Dragonminded, good idea to post updates here. I am in fact one of the lazy people that only read this board, so I wouldn't happen to see what's going on, on individual developers blogs. Great new policy change to keep us (me) informed :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Color support seems cool, will give it a spin, thanks for allowing us to increasingly customize the look and feel of DSO. 
<br/>
Would it be possible in the future to have a screenshot feature to show and share color profiles?
<br/>

It's minor, just invalid entries that get deleted (like for deleted or temp files from renaming) I get around that using the very handy MCTool so I don't have to be at a PC.

    <h4>#122201 - HyperHacker - Sat Mar 17, 2007 8:59 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice work as always. Found a bug though; after rearranging my Home screen in the configuration menu, the Calendar icon is replaced with the Calculator icon (but still opens the Calendar). It only did this after rearranging them, but it remains after powering off. I'm using the default icon set and a GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
NSF support is nice, not quite as accurate as Moonshell's though. It's very loud too. Any chance we'll see the ability to have the volume less than 100%? I have to keep Moonshell's at 50% and turn the hardware volume control almost all the way down with my headphones to be comfortable, they're very loud... x_x
<br/>
<br/>
SPC support works beautifully. Does it just loop forever though? The progress bar isn't doing anything. It sounds pretty nasty with F-Zero's Mute City, I think the left and right channels are out of sync. This was after playing an NSF and another SPC, if that helps. Super Mario Kart's Vanilla Lake is also way off, and Super Mario RPG's 'Shroom Kindgom has a bit of an echo to it that I don't recognize.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually now I'm hearing the same desync problem with NSF (Star Soldier), and the dpad doesn't always respond while playing one. MP3 is still working fine though. The Super Mario Bros NSF sounds almost exactly like the real thing, maybe it's Moonshell that's inaccurate... I'd have to dig out some NES games and compare, no time to do that now.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though I'm one of the unfortunate few running homebrew on a MMD, so I can't even get it to run without resetting the clock to 0:00 (or renaming to bootme.nds, but that's a bit less convenient). If only homebrew booting in DSOrganize worked with the MMD, then I could just have it run at boot and use the browser to run anything else. Regardless, this is some nice homebrew, even if I do need to use an annoying workaround to get it to start. Excellent work here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Say what? You can click on links fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, mostly fine. For some reason clicking on a link to DS Misc on this site lead me to a topic in DS Flash Equipment, but that might have been a touch screen issue. Some feedback when you click on a link (like a dotted line around the link you just clicked) would be nice, so you can tell if clicking it worked.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The threat of NAND flash wear is overblown. The microcontrollers in modern CF and SD memory cards perform hardware <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_levelling" target="_blank">wear leveling</a>. When a sector begins to show wear (detected, perhaps, using ECC statistics) after 100,000 to a million writes, it is remapped to another spare sector. There are enough spare sectors to last until flash memory density has improved by an order of magnitude. This is why my next project, which is finally not another Tetris clone, will autosave what the player does to a log file every couple minutes.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I too get the " <a href='http://"' target="_blank">http://"</a> address when clicking on links occasionaly.

    <h4>#124325 - HyperHacker - Thu Apr 05, 2007 2:43 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pardon the double post, but I found another bug and had a simple idea for the browser.
<br/>
<br/>
I went to the DSO home page to look up the file format for shortcuts, and when I clicked FAQ, it redirected to "/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize FAQ", not escaping the space. This caused the server to complain about invalid characters in the query string or some such (even though it works fine in Firefox). After that, I Googled "dsorganize" to try to find a link to the FAQ page there. When I clicked "More results from <a href='http://www.dragonminded.com"' target="_blank">www.dragonminded.com"</a> it actually took me to "www.dragonminded.com/search?hl=" and so on. After that I closed and re-opened the browser and it was simply at "blank" instead of "about:blank".
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed it doesn't always connect (a problem with most wifi homebrew in my experience), especially if you close and re-open the browser. I found a simple solution: Do a connection test in an NWFC game. When it says "Connection successful", power off and start whatever homebrew you're trying to use, and it should work. Seems the wifi lib may not be initializing or de-initializing everything correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to download the DSDoom shareware WAD, but it just stopped at 20%. It wasn't frozen (I was able to cancel), it just didn't download any more.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I noticed the searchpref.txt file. With some minor changes, this could be used as a form of favourites list:
<br/>
1) Allow the first string to be more than a single letter, ending at a space.
<br/>
2) Allow empty input (e.g. go to Google even if I just enter "g").
<br/>
Then for example you could define "dsdev" as "forum.gbadev.org" and simply type "dsdev" in the address bar to get there. You could also change how the input is added: instead of tacking it on to the end, maybe replace any dollar signs in the URL with it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like .mov and .mka, .avi is just a container format; it can hold any video codec and any audio codec. Which codecs do you want, and how many seconds are you willing to wait for each frame to be decoded? The codecs used with the .dpg container have the advantages that they are mostly patent-free (MPEG-1 video and MP2 audio are old, and Vorbis audio is designed around all known patents) and they are comparatively low-complexity compared to "modern" codecs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Sure, there is still the bug that accidentally creates lfn entries when the file is only 8.3 still, and there is the bug that occasionally corrupts a file itself if you write to it, but I haven't gotten one bad fat entry or needed to format once since updating to Alpha 3.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using alpha 3 and GBAMP. I notice the corruption occurrs in the same way every time:
<br/>
<br/>
-/TXT/ideas.txt, when modified by any program (but only after using the DS for a while, which probably means only after using DSO's browser), will not actually be modified; a new file /TXT/ideas~01.txt will be created with the new contents. Moonshell can't open either of them saying the extension '. ' is not supported.
<br/>
-If I rename any file in /linux in DSO, usually it and a few others in that directory disappear. If not, editing the file will cause this.
<br/>
<br/>
Once this starts happening I do a disk check in Windows and it finds 4 to 16 files, most of which are browser cache files, the missing Linux files, or filled entirely with 0xE5.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] I noticed something else. While using the browser occasionally I get "incomplete download" errors, but if I use it for ~10 minutes at a time, I get this every time I load a page or even use the Back button to go back to a page that loaded successfully. The filesystem drivers go into a failstate. If I exit the browser and open the file browser, every file is listed as zero bytes. Shortcuts on the home screen don't work (as if the file isn't a valid shortcut), the todo list and reminder don't display on the top screen, etc. The files are still intact though, and if I reboot my NDS they show up alright. Presumably the "incomplete download" errors occurr because it's reporting that the downloaded page is zero bytes when it should be more.
<br/>
<br/>
This is using the GBAMP CF patch BTW. It works without (haven't seen any corruption) but takes a long time to boot up.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I noticed this as well. Scandisk finds both cache files (HTML code) and files filled with ? (0xE5). Fortunately, I have not experienced any other file corruption since upgrading from 2.61 to 2.7a3. I have used DSO for renaming, deleting, and copy/pasting save files only.

Same here. Additionally, when the browser goes into the "incomplete" state, if I hit Home, then start the web browser again, I get a black keyboard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">K, this is awesome. I only see one minor issue so far: When you touch a text field and the keyboard is hidden, it should pop back up. It can be confusing otherwise. "OK, I clicked the box and nothing's happening..." Then when you enter something, and hit Enter, it submits the form instead of just hiding the keyboard; you have to hide it again and poke the next box (e.g. for login pages). Heh, it even masks the password, nice.

<br/>
I can't seem to log in to acmlm.no-ip.org/board; it only takes me back to an incomplete log in page (ending at "Register | Login"). This place was never known for having valid/decent code, so I'm not surprised. Being able to view source would help debug in these cases.

PHPBBs look much better now, probably because of adding line breaks after &lt;tr&gt; elements.

Yes it does. The touch resistance is inversely proportional to the touch area, which varies with touch pressure.

<br/>
Yes. Nintendo has the exact spec for the timing that the touch screen expects. I seem to remember some effort in reverse engineering some DS Download Station demo's touch code in the R18-R19 days. And based on the changes to the ARM7 code of the combined template between DKA r18 and DKA r20, it looks like the timing might be done with vcount, which provides a roughly 63.5 microsecond timing granuarity.

<br/>
I can guess three reasons: <ol type="1"><li>The translation from pressure to area depends on what kind of pen you are using: DS stylus, DS thumb strap, DS Lite stylus, finger, etc. </li><li>The translation from area to resistance depends on which lot the touch screen came from. Such data is not recorded in the DS firmware, unlike the translation from raw touch values to screen-space values. </li><li>Pressure sensitive games may encourage (especially younger) players to press too hard on the touch screen, which could cause premature failure and extra warranty replacement costs for Nintendo. </li></ol>

That or you're using a fingernail, which deforms more than a stylus does and thus covers a larger area.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <h4>#127331 - Sweater Fish Deluxe - Tue May 01, 2007 7:42 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a file system corruption while using the web browser in 2.7-final last night.  From reading earlier comments, I think this is a different sort of corruption than people were experiencing with the alpha versions.  Basically what I got was this:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i135/sweaterfish/corruption.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like an HTML file was written to the ToC or something like that.  Even the cart's volume label showed the same thing.  Luckily, running Scandisk more or less solved the problem, I hust had to figure out what the proper names for files and folders in the root were supposed to be after Scandisk identified them and gave them placeholder names, and that was easy for the most part since files inside the folders were named correctly.  I removed everything from the cart, formatted it and then put stuff back, though, just to be safe.
<br/>
<br/>
I had actually just logged on to these forums and was about to post in this topic when the problem happened (the HTML file that was written to the ToC seems to be the index page for the GBAdev forums if you look at some of the file names in that pic), but the forum didn't come up, instead I got a message saying that the download was not complete and that refreshing would probably fix it.  I had gotten that message a couple times before, possibly because I was on a public wireless network shared with a couple dozen other users.  Hitting 'A' seems to have the effect of refreshing, or at least it did the previous times, but this time, I just kept getting the same message 6 or 7 times, so I assumed that I had been disconnected or something like that.   I exited back out to the DSOrganize menu and re-launched the web browser, but the keyboard in the web browser didn't come up properly, there was just a big black box where it was supposed to be, though everything else on the screen looked correct.  Touching the stylus inside that black box would actually type letters into the URL bar, though I didn't actually try going to any webpages this way since it would have been pretty hard to type any addresses correctly.  Instead, I exited back out to the DSOrganize menu without doing anything at all in the browser (it did seem to associate with the wireless network, though).  DSOrganize then froze at its manin menu and I had to reset my system.  When I reset it, I noticed the file system corruption.  Like I said running Scandisk on the drive solved the corruption perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using a G6 Lite with the v0.19 DLDI driver.  The G6 DLDI driver is reverse engineered since the G6 people naever gave out full source.  Iv'e had problems with the G6 DLDI in the past, though, things have been perfect since v0.19, but it's still possible that this problem is at least partially the fault of the DLDI driver, I don't know.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what I was coming here to say in this topic when all this happened is that the DSOrganize browser is really very good.  Better than I would have expected so quickly.  One option that would be nice to have would be some way to view individual images.  Not rendering all the images on the page since I know that will be difficult, but if we could somehow click on an image placeholder in the browser and have that image come up in DSOrganize's regular image viewer, it would be nice.  Of course, that would only be worth doing if full image support within the browser is going to be a long time coming.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there any way to keep a music track from pausing when you close the DS?

When you close the DS, the music goes out the headphones jack, saving alot of power. I think there should be a version that you can change that.

-change the song order from "Single File" to "Sequence" - doesn't it remember your selection? This would require writing to a config file.

-playing 320kbps song - this is an interesting one, could be decompressing to disk?

Chishm has developed two different file system implementations for the GBA and DS: gba_nds_fat and libfat. The former was standard around the time DSOrganize was developed. Chishm abandoned it in favor of libfat, not fixing bugs in the legacy code, but libfat needed enhancements to devkitARM itself that took longer than anyone expected, so people continued to use gba_nds_fat until devkitARM R20 came out, and DSOrganize hasn't been refactored to use the new code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I have a test NDS file that uses this exact method.  This is how I tracked the major corruption bug that has been fixed.  The reason I've been slow to find the rest is that they don't ruin whole cards like that one did.  Since fixing that, I haven't had to reformat once, and not one time has a directory been corrupted.  Sure, once in a while, a file gets created wrong and you lose that particular download/text file, but that's way more bearable than if the entire directory craps out.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

Yes, the most times my file system was corrupted after I deleted a file with either DSFTP (gba_nds_fat) or DSOrganize (gba_nds_fat).
<br/>
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
After deleting an 'interrupted' file DSFTP wrote the new file correct, but some other files with strange 'Japanese' names appears in that folder, too. Chkdsk shows these are kind of renamed files from all over the disk...

I don't see any real reason actual file downloading in the traditional sense can't be done as it's basically already implemented. It's a pain, but it works: you have to browse to the file you want, which will display a blank page, then figure out which file in /cache it is and change its extension (and ideally move it out of /cache). :-p

I've had less and less filesystem corruption incidents with each new version but they still do happen occasionally, mainly if I delete a file or (moreso) directory. I haven't seen just editing a file cause trouble anymore, but every now and then I'll find some weirdness with one or two of my files, and chkdisk will fix a few things and come up with one or two of DSO's browser cache files in /FOUND.000. I'm not sure whether to blame DSO (since it's always a browser cache file that gets found) or TxtWriter (since it's usually a file I frequently edit with it that gets messed up - its name gets changed, and an old copy under the old name remains), but I'm leaning toward the latter since it's old, unfinished, and uses GBA_NDS_FAT.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And just a quick question: Is there a quick way to add support for other file types to be opened with the text editor in DSO? I've been playing with changing keysets for DScent a lot and they're stored in plain text files with the ".csk" extension. I've been renaming them to another extension type that is recognized so that I can edit them, but was wondering if there is a quick way to do it without resorting to writing a whole plugin for it?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

There's still a minor bug in the configuration menu. Since both touching and moving to (using L/R) a text field activates it, you don't get a chance to read the description.

Startup sound is awesome. Directory listing can still take a while when you have a lot of files (~283); some sort of animation or something would help stop people thinking it's frozen.
<br/>

Looks like either it or 7zip (probably the latter &lt;_&lt;) made a "dsorganize" directory in the root of the card, even though I put that in /data.

Looks like you've improved form elements in the web browser. :-) Not to mention favourites and that shortcut keyboard thing.

You would be right, if there really is one.
<br/>
But if you talk about pretty humble DSFTP, we surely needs 'a full ftp'. 
<br/>
<br/>
Try to load some mp3-files at a time - DSFTP stucks after 3, 4 maybe 5 files and you have to restart the whole thing (and if you are lucky your file structure wasn't messed up).
<br/>
<br/>
Try to start a big dpg-file loaded via DSFTP - 10 % it will start, 90 % it will state something like 'extension unknown' (and if you are lucky your file structure wasn't messed up).
<br/>
<br/>
Try to delete a file or a folder via DSFTP, if you are lucky your file structure wasn't messed up.
<br/>
<br/>
Try to... 
<br/>
<br/>
So that is not what I will call 'a pretty decent standalone client'!
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------
<br/>
'messed up' means not only you have to run scandisk... 
<br/>
To make the SD card working properly again you have 
<br/>
to reformat it (expecting some data loss every time).

<br/>

<br/>
You would be right, if there really is one.
<br/>
But if you talk about pretty humble DSFTP, we surely needs 'a full ftp'. 
<br/>
<br/>
Try to load some mp3-files at a time - DSFTP stucks after 3, 4 maybe 5 files and you have to restart the whole thing (and if you are lucky your file structure wasn't messed up).
<br/>
<br/>
Try to start a big dpg-file loaded via DSFTP - 10 % it will start, 90 % it will state something like 'extension unknown' (and if you are lucky your file structure wasn't messed up).
<br/>
<br/>
Try to delete a file or a folder via DSFTP, if you are lucky your file structure wasn't messed up.
<br/>
<br/>
Try to... 
<br/>
<br/>
So that is not what I will call 'a pretty decent standalone client'!
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------
<br/>
'messed up' means not only you have to run scandisk... 
<br/>
To make the SD card working properly again you have 
<br/>
to reformat it (expecting some data loss every time).
<br/>
<br/>

The previous one was a bug where it created an lfn entry for short entries that didn't need one.  The current bug was one where it returned the wrong lfn name for some file lists.  This last one is significant as it fixes the issuse with two files being named exactly the same sometimes, and directories freezing when the data is not corrupt on some cards.  Also, it fixes issues where suddenly you are out of memory on certain apps.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was really hoping that the next version of DSOrganize would allow for browsing of two devices simultaneously (well, not precisely *simultaneously*, but you know what I mean) if you have both a slot-1 and a slot-2 cart.  So that's disappointing, but of course it's always nice to see a new version of a much used homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
DragonMinded, to you have plans to incorporate dual device browsing or are you waiting until Chishm introduces it into libfat (which I am also hoping will be happening soon)?

<br/>
<br/>
I assumed the version of gba_nds_fat in DSOrganize is modifed by code from libfat as well as DragonMinded's own modifications, which is why I thought it might have something to do with Chishm releasing a new verison of libfat.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have another suggestion for DSOrganize.  It would be great if the Scribble Pad could be integrated with the Calendar so that each day had its own scribble picture that you could view easily as you browse the calendar or edit directly from the calendar section.  Trying to write notes using the virtual keyboard is nasty.

With 1.7, it would lose the buffer and have to refill it at the start of every new song, which wasn't that bad really.  However, in 1.8, whenever a new song starts, it resets to what looks like a stream selection menu, which a single blue bar at the top of the touch screen, and no music plays at that point.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bet it's some sort of buffer underrun or something.  The Games n' Music is incredibly slow at reading from the card (as opposed to my GBAMP CF, which is very fast), and the new mp3 engine in DSO may try to read faster than the GnM's stream...then again this is all a guess.  I saw a similar incident with MoonShell at my friend's house.  His old Games n' Music broke (he got it replaced though) where the microSD wouldn't stay in, it was held down with tape, and while playing a video, the tape came loose and the card popped out.  The video did something similar, it skipped and crashed.
<br/>
<br/>
Mods and any other tracker formats are relatively small, and are probably copied entirely to memory, and therefore don't cause any problems, while streaming formats (ogg, mp3, wav, etc) seem to cause problems.

There are two distinct factions within the Ogg Vorbis users community: A) those who want to "archive" their CDs at maximum quality on prosumer audio equipment (nominal bitrate 256 kbps or higher), and B) those who just want to listen on low-end equipment. You were probably using a tool designed for A) to do B). I recommend going to RareWares and downloading <a class="postlink" href="http://rarewares.org/ogg-oggdropxpd.php" target="_blank">oggdropXPd</a> to encode your .wav files to Vorbis at quality 2, which gives about 80 kbps and is enough for the DS's 10-bit DAC. For more compression, you can downmix the files to mono either before or during encoding, letting you leave one ear open to the world.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Alternatively, if you must use DSO but wish to keep audio playing through the speakers, you can see if LoveLite supports the reset protocol for your device.  If it does, you can use it to turn off the backlight and then launch DSO, which respects the current backlight position.  You'll still have to keep the lid open, but at least the backlight will be turned off to save power.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Unfortunately, I find the way that it is always writing files to a cache directory very off-putting, especially considering the small size of the card I have DSO running on.
<br/>
Is it really technically required to have the cache files? (If not, an option to turn those off would be excellent! Otherwise, I guess I'll live with them, but I wish they would pretend to not exist).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there a magical way that a web browser can find the mobile-friendly version of a page? Would be kind of cool if that happened here, since those versions work much better on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

With my 1 GB miniSD card using SCSD_moon.dldi, it boots and all, but I suspect things may still be iffy, as it's frozen on me a couple of times.  Unfortunately the Ormgas radio stream is even more broken in this release than with 2.8 (now it plays 1 second of audio and is then silent), but that's just a minor issue that I can easily deal with.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very nice, just downloaded it. Unfortunately I haven't spent any time playing around with the new features, because of a booting problem that I just can't figure out.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been having problems using DSO to boot other NDS files, ever since v2.8 (and now 2.9). I have an R4 (firmware 1.11 with DLDI auto-patch and I manually DLDI patched all files as well), and have already replaced the exec_stub.bin with the custom R4/M3Simply version. My config is set to boot using the MightyMax method (Chishm's and DSO internal boot methods have never worked for me). Fresh DSOrganize folder with all other options default.
<br/>
<br/>
This is what happens when I try to load an NDS file from DSO 2.9 - but it depends on what homebrew:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">loads but touchscreen is broken</span> (Beup live 0.3e, Colors! 1.05, LMP-ng v1). LMP-ng also shows low-battery incorrectly, and freezes when trying to play music.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">loads, then freezes</span> (Moonshell 1.71, Pop_tire, WordWrap 2). Moonshell is the English version from the R4 firmware. What's interesting is that normally, Moonshell shows an English message briefly on the bottom screen while loading. Now, the bottom screen is in Japanese, and it is stuck.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">no sound</span> (Pop_tire, WordWrap 2) - anything that uses sound also seems to freeze.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">two white screens</span> (DiagnoSe), <span style="font-weight: bold">white and black screens</span> (Bunjalloo, DSAIM), or <span style="font-weight: bold">two black screens</span> (ComicBookDS 2.2)
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">works</span> (DSFTP, DSO 2.9). DSFTP connected and transferred a file with no problems. But it doesn't use the touchscreen. DSO is the only one that loads and works including touchscreen and sound.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
Ironically, I can boot DSO from DSO! I wonder if this implies some sort of missing initialization problem? I have lots more homebrew that I haven't tried, but I decided to stop there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> been able to boot homebrew from DSO before. I believe the last time this worked was 2.7beta/final (not sure). At that time I was also using an older R4 firmware. So I tried reverting to an older firmware (1.08, before DLDI auto-patch feature existed), but there was no difference. I would try reverting the DSO to a previous version as well, but now I'm too tired, and it's a pain transferring files on this microSD.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">DS Lite white, R4DS, 1GB Kingmax microSD</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
In theory, it would be possible to make a cache directory on a SLOT-2 card with RAM, such as a SuperCard, M3 Perfect, EZ-Flash 3-in-1, or the card that comes with Opera. But this differs for each make and model of SLOT-2 card with RAM, and the robust implementation (by Lick) is licensed incompatibly with some of the libraries in DSO.

Ideally, each page would put <a class="postlink" href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_10_presenting_your_main_content_first.html" target="_blank">the content before the navigation</a>, using CSS2 absolute positioning to move the navigation up when the current <a class="postlink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/media.html" target="_blank">CSS2 media type</a> is "screen".

Dude, that's illegal. DSO links to GPL code, and thus the source code must be available on the terms of the GPL license. You can't both have the cake and eat it.

Although I believe the terms of the license allow you to have a message saying "ask me for source code", as it still technically makes it available. (There is nothing saying it has to be a direct download, and there is really no difference anyway; in one case it's a machine responding to a request, in the other case it's a human).

<br/>
You still have to give up the code, but it can dissuade most people who would be using it for ill, and makes the situation easier to control.

Yeah, the one screen shot was the only I had seen at the time of that post. I've since seen the video review...

I'm not very enlightened on this licenses thing, but wouldn't it be illegal for them to sell it, even if they did include the source?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since DSO is under the GPL (due to it using GPL software) then there is nothing illegal at all about this, this is how the GPL is supposed to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in the GPL prevents you from taking the source code from a project, modifying it, and selling it. That is actually what the GPL is designed to <span style="font-style: italic">allow</span>. You don't need to ask permission from the original author or even let them know either.
<br/>
<br/>
The only possible GPL violation here would be if they do not release the modified source code (to those who purchase the device, not publicly) or credit DragonMinded as the original author. As this device isn't yet released to the public (as far as I can tell, there only appears to be a single review of it) we don't even know if that is the case. There is absolutely no reason they can't sell a modified DSO assuming they adhere to the other GPL requirements. For that matter, you could sell unmodified copies of DSO and still not be in violation of the license.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLCommercially" target="_blank">FSF FAQ</a>
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, closing the source and claiming the code was "stolen" <span style="font-weight: bold">IS</span> a GPL violation. You can't "steal" GPL code, that is the entire point of the GPL. You also can't arbitrarily close the source of a GPL project because you feel like it. If you really want to close DSO's source, then you need to remove all GPL'd code that it uses, and then relicense it under whatever suits you better. 
<br/>
<br/>
What you are doing now is not only a larger violation then the (unconfirmed) Media Cart issue, but is also pointless since the source for 2.9 has been in the wild long enough for everyone to already have it.
<br/>
<br/>
I would however suggest you really think about what you are doing here. You used code written by other people, and you made a larger program out of it. The Media Cart people used code written by other people, and made a larger program out of it. <span style="font-style: italic">It is the exact same thing.</span> Nobody has "stolen" your code any more than you "stole" the GPL code used in DSO.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, it may be that you did not fully understand the GPL and it's implications when you used GPL code in DSO. In that case I can understand your current position (though I would have to question why you didn't fully understand the licensing before you started using other people's code) and see why you would want to revert to a closed source model. But if you knowingly went into the GPL, then what you are currently doing is just misguided and only making matters worse.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.
<br/>
<br/>
I should clarify that I am not saying what they have done isn't underhanded, and I am not unsympathetic to your cause; if the same thing happened to me I would certainly be pissed off.
<br/>
<br/>
"Based on the work of..." should be plastered on every page of the site and every developer's name and site should be listed inside the "Credits" part of the software itself so everyone can see it; no question. Permission should have also been secured from the author of all the individual programs, not that it is contractually required, but just because that is the professional thing to do.
<br/>
<br/>
I can even understand your moral standpoint, that a device built to play primarily to play commercial ROMs is bundling your software as a "*wink wink*" feature to pretend it isn't all about bootlegs.
<br/>
<br/>
But when I see posts like "get a lawyer" and you try to pull the source...I have to chime in. The fact of the matter is that you have no legal leg to stand on, since nothing illegal has been done. Again, that is a bit forward-looking and assuming they don't refuse to credit you and release the modified sources to those who buy the device.
<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, let's not forget that even massive companies (Linksys, D-Link, etc) have made occasional lapses in GPL etiquette and didn't release the source to things they have modified. When called on it, they (usually) complied, and if not, there was a case against them.
<br/>
<br/>
We can't rule out the fact that the creators of this device simply don't know or don't fully understand what using GPL'd code means. When they are informed of the situation (and perhaps put under a wee bit of pressure) they may rectify the issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Personally, I don't think source code makes much difference. I could equaly see them just bundling the whole app blindly.

This is not the sort of thing that will encourage us to buy it. (I'm sure the vaste majority of us wont be)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">See, I don't mind them bundling the app blindly.  At least then it's my app getting free publicity.  I also sent them an email letting them know that if they wanted to, they could simply release the code under GPL and it would indeed be legal, but that I would still be pissed off.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I like T3's idea.  I am mulling over making public versions GPL free and releasing the source under my own license.  That would, however, take away the calculator, the images capability, and most of the sound capability.  I just have to think about whether it's worth it or not.
<br/>
<br/>
What irked me in this case was not that they were using my code in their program, but that they had based their entire interface and most of their product lineup on MY ideas that I'VE worked a year and a half on.  The only GPL linked code they used out of my project was the images code.  Basically, they took just my part of the source code, that if released individually, I would not have allowed to be sold.  They didn't even use the original GPL software that was meant to be released modified if I made changes.
<br/>
<br/>
Basiclly, the entire interface, look and feel, and most of the IDEAS of DSOrganize were ripped off, not just code.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else been having problems with DSO as of versions 2.8 and above when run from a SC:miniSD?
<br/>
<br/>
When running directly from my SC:miniSD DSO stalls on the Initial File System loading sequence (As indicated by the dancing cow/birdy icon).
<br/>
<br/>
However, if I launch DSO from Moonshell it works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Is the problem my DLDI, or is it something to do with the SC firmware?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The "two DLDI" issue applies to nearly all slot-2 Supercards, not just the SC-miniSD.  Some Supercards work with the default SCSD.dldi, and some simply don't.  It happens mostly with SCLites but can also affect the SD and miniSD versions as well.  In fact, it may also have to do with the media card itself; I have one miniSD card that works fine with SCSD.dldi but my other one requires SCSD_moon.dldi for FAT access to work at all.
<br/>
<br/>
I've had great success running the DLDI-enabled builds of DSO on my SC miniSD ever since you started building them, except for this last release which, as I stated before, locks up and freezes on my one miniSD card (the one that usually works fine with homebrew and only requires SCSD.dldi).  The other miniSD card worked when using SCSD_moon.dldi though I had odd freezes, which I'm guessing now is due to corruption I believe my card had at the moment, so I'll retest sometime soon.

2.7 and above had issues, but not predictable ones :-(

Has anyone with an R4DS been successful with booting homebrew from DSO 2.8 or 2.9? Can anyone confirm my problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, trying to boot NDSmail from DSO gives an interesting error message that points to an ARM 7 problem:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So the "exec_stub.bin" file is actually MightyMax's loading method and not the DSOrganize method? I'm experimenting with trying to launch homebrew from DSO on a CycloDS Evolution Slot-1 card. The Evo offers DLDI autopatching, but the beta driver is available for testing. I'm trying to see if any of the loading methods work with the autopatched DSO first (so no prior patching). So far, the DSOrganize method says that no loader is available whether I've patched the exec_stub.bin file or not and Chishm's method just seems to hang while attempting to initialize. I haven't been able to test it much more than that. I'm trying to figure out what I should try next.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

<br/>
<br/>
So, the latest DSO is awesome. Images are working, hasn't broken my filesystem once, and fixed-width editor font is nice. OGG playback stutters, though. However, there's been one nasty design flaw that's been annoying the crap out of me lately: the text editor doesn't ask you to save when you exit (and also can't save without exiting). Combine this with the rare touchscreen misread (or an accidental poke/button press) and Murphy's Law, and I end up losing a lot of work by having the editor close without saving while typing. Bloody annoying.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I was wondering if the plugin/executable system could ever be adapted for pseudo-multitasking, being able to load more than one plugin at a time and switch between them? Maybe using slot-2 RAM? For example, while using the text editor you could pull up the calculator, crunch some numbers, and then go back to the editor without having to save, exit, and find your position again. Or a plugin could be made that's a client for an Internet radio station, that would load up the music player plugin and let it do the music stuff while the client plugin does things like fetch information about the songs from a website.
<br/>
<br/>
One last question: background images? Even just one for all screens? They wouldn't even have to take up any extra RAM or CPU power (only VRAM) - just put them on a separate background layer behind the main one and fill blank spots with transparent instead of white, and load the image directly into VRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, looking forward to future versions, keep up the good work. :-)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, after a bit of testing with DSOrganize and the beta DLDI driver for a bit, they've released a new driver available in this topic:

Here's what TeamCyclops reports:

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>TeamCyclops wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">We've just uploaded v1.1 of the DLDI driver for CycloDS Evolution. Download it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cyclopsds.com/downloads/CycloEvoDLDI_v1.1.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. There have been quite a few changes from the last file released, most notably:
<br/>
<br/>
    * Now contains full SD init code. This means it will work with both standard and SDHC MicroSD cards, and it should work with homebrew executed via WMB (untested) or other alternative loading methods, allowing you to completely bypass loading through the CycloDS Evolution GUI if you wish. We've personally tested the driver by loading homebrew from slot2 CycloDS, which works fine.
<br/>
    * Various workarounds are included to enable support for the various ways in which 3rd party loaders use the DLDI driver. Its been tested to work with DSOrganise (Chishm loading method only), DSChannels and Chishm's standalone loader.
<br/>
<br/>
This is the same DLDI driver which is included in the new v1.2 BETA #3 firmware. Unless you're not using CycloDS Evolution to actually load your homebrew (which would be the case if you're executing code via WMB) then you dont actually need to manually patch anything, even in the case of 3rd party loaders.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I've tested it with Chishm's NDS_loader, DSOrganize 2.9, and DSChannels Beta 5. NDS_loader and DSO (using Chishm launch method) launch and run unpatched apps without issue, but apps launched from DSChannels can't read from the memory card unless they are manually DLDI patched. It seems that DSO permanently patches what it launches, so all that needs to be done is launch them from DSO once and they'll work with DSChannels as well. This is a major update for anyone using a CycloDS Evo and DSO!<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

i can connect to internet with any apllication (dso 2.8 too) and with any game, but not with dso 2.9... so strange;

A. Could you include the booting method of DSChannels using the dsgstub.bin?  It seems this loader can boot on carts that the included loaders of DSO can't.  Ex. EZ-V

B. Could you upgrade the Browser function of DSO to also browse Slot-2  if inserted.  Allowing the user to transfer files between the two?

It would have to be converted to libfat though (but that's not a bad thing :) )

Just instead of reading the file "/DSORGANIZE/FOLDER/FILE.txt" read "fat2:/DSORGANIZE/FOLDER/FILE.txt" for slot-2 and "fat1:/" for slot-1.  The slot-1 needs to have a DLDI patch, the slot-2 needs to be native to libfat (GBAMP, SCCF(?), etc).  If you're smart enough to figure it out, loading a second DLDI (for another slot-2 device) would be great, and patching the chishm loader for whatever device then booting from it would be even better.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

I admit I was ill informed as to the situation, but I wasn't only talking about that one or my problem either. In my opinion you seem to be less involved about your DSO users than other developers and their software, maybe I'm missing things on IRC, but thats just something I've noticed.
<br/>
<br/>
And I still don't see how you can claim no responsibility for code not booting on the SCminiSD, since every homebrew I can think of worked the same on most other cards as it did on the miniSD, I think it's possible for you to change something around to let it boot, without effecting other card's compatibility, unless of course for some reason it would hinder overall performance. Is DSO compiled with r20 yet? Are you and/or wintermute working on that?

All I said was that was something I had noticed on occasion. For instance, most likely it wasn't on purpose, but I've asked the question of whether DSO compiles on r20 or not I believe two to three times, and you have ignored the question. I understand if you missed it in my last post, seeing how both our posts were lengthy. Also you said things in your last post referring to mine that were too harsh, I only said less involved, not neglect, and from my point of view. I don't pretend to be all-informed about whose emails you answer, etc. but that is the conclusion I drew from what I've seen here on the forums, and a few fleeting moments on IRC. (Although you were in another conversation and some people on IRC are less than polite.)
<br/>
<br/>
I should've realized personal offense could have been taken from my statement, although if you can believe it I meant none, and should've kept my thoughts to myself and just asked you about the miniSD problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not looking for a guarantee, but maybe there was some way you could send me a debug build that might ballpark the problem? And then I could send you my card with more confidence. I guess what I'm asking is, what is the first thing you would do to debug DSO on my SCminiSD? And is it possible for me to take these first steps?<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Yes, I would.  It is a royal nightmare for me to constantly deal with differentiations in cards from manufacturers that claim homebrew support, then dump said support on the homebrewers themselves.

Well it's been made clear to me that he is not working on fixing the problem, although it's true that it's hard to do without actually owning the card.

I agree.
<br/>
<br/>
As to trying to fix it myself:
<br/>
I've tried multiple things with no success. Booting from 2.8, from moonshell, with the 2.8 DSOrganize folder, and with the 2.9 one. Also that new DLDI driver works fine for everything else, but its no different for DSO. It seems as though the problems are related to the ARM7, because the touchscreen doesn't work, as well as the X and Y buttons. (I knew that these two inputs are related separately to the D-Pad and other buttons, I'm most likely mistaken as to the ARM7 reference.)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and thank you for your comments, jetboy. They were a great help to the situation and benefited everybody.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

When I open this playlist, it will quickly skip to the third song and freeze. Most of the time, the progress bar bugs out and covers most of the bottom screen (drawing &gt;100%?), one time it only showed up at ~25%. LMP doesn't have a problem with it. If I select the individual files in the browser they play just fine, except for the first one which is a bit distorted and has the progress bar lagging behind. (LMP has similar problems, but everything else plays it fine; my guess is it's just taking a lot of CPU power to decode.)
<br/>
<br/>
The first song can be downloaded <a class="postlink" href="http://hyperhacker.no-ip.org/b/Kirby%20Title.ogg" target="_blank">here</a> (285K), if you need the rest I'll have to PM them for copyright/bandwidth-related reasons.

I've fixed that for ogg files and it now plays the file even though the m3u stream fails.  I think it's failing because the filenames are showing up wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I found a major bug just now, but I realized it was not loading anything because copying from this page added spaces to the end, so be careful you didn't do just that.  I've added a check in the loadSound routine to make sure a file exists, and it doesn't crash on the third song now when it can't find it.  It successfully loops to the end, and loads the first song again.

I've just had to replace my old corega router with a new Linksys one, and it seems that DSOrganise won't access the internet any more. I've tried with the picture-chat app on the MoonShell website and that works fine, as well as any commercial games and most other DS homebrew. I have a silver DS Phat with V3 firmware, and my router has WEP enabled, although I'm not <span style="font-style: italic">allowed</span> to change that...<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

As usual, notes, bug reports, etc:
<br/>
<ul><li>As pointed out before, it's a bit annoying that leaving a text field on the config screen closes the config entirely.
<br/>
</li><li>In the wifi config editor (awesome BTW), text isn't centred correctly in the SSID box; "GPRC Public Access" runs right out of the box onto the Scan button.
<br/>
</li><li>The first time I tried to scan for APs, it immediately just said none found. I just hit back and tried again and it worked. A signal strength indicator would be good here.
<br/>
</li><li>Nice touch showing a few hours of the day in the calendar.
<br/>
</li><li>The image viewer cuts off the bottom row of pixels (all white) when viewing a 256x192 image. (I was actually coming here to report this in 2.9...) I haven't checked to see if other sizes have this problem.
<br/>
</li><li>That OGG file that was showing up with the 8.3 filename is showing correctly now. It still stutters slightly when played, but not nearly as bad as before.
<br/>
</li><li>OGG sound quality seems to have improved. The interface lags a bit, but there's not much reason to be using it while a song is playing anyway. (Just hit pause if you need to do something. &lt;_&lt;)
<br/>
</li><li>Clipboard = awesome. The implementation is a bit strange (wouldn't separate cut/copy/paste buttons make more sense?), but not bad. It's a bit confusing though that the move/select button shows the current state, not the state that you'll activate by poking it.
<br/>
</li><li>When I opened the Homebrew Database it immediately said there were no entries. Hitting refresh, it froze up at Getting MOTD. This is a DS Lite, 001656 range MAC address. Similarly, the web browser never gets past associating, although the system isn't frozen; I can still exit. The AP it should be connecting to (#1 in the firmware) uses WEP128.

There is NO room for extra cut/copy/paste buttons, and there certainly isn't any on any PC platform, so why is using standard PC shortcuts confusing?  Also, INS/OVR works the same way, showing your current status, and noone's ever stated that it's confusing.

Because some of us don't come from a Windows platform. I learned on a Mac (though I've used Windows since mid-1999), which uses <span style="font-style: italic">slightly</span> different key bindings, but that's fine, as the biggest difference between the two is Ctrl vs. Cmd. Still, would it be hard to make space for an "Edit" button that brings up a list of commands that may include Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Select All, Show Clipboard, Find, Replace?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, no.  Since control is there, I can add other keyboard functions that have no room on the gui otherwise, such as ctrl+b bookmarking the current page on browser in 3.0+.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Out of curiosity DM, have you considered adding a reboot option to DSOrganize to return to the flashcart's firmware/OS menu? Either using Lick's rebootlib or by executing Moonshell's RESET.MSE executable? I ask because, as I said, DSO is so useful that I'm using it as the main application on my CycloDS Evo in place of Moonshell. Well, Team Cyclops' modified Moonshell has a custom RESET.MSE file as well for resetting back to the Evo's firmware menu. Being able to do that would be so useful. And I'm sure that other carts (like the R4) could do it too with the appropriate version of RESET.MSE. Moonlight even intended for other applications to make use of it:

Understood. And that sounds like a good project idea. I've been meaning to try my hand at actually doing some DS programming, but have lacked the motivation. This sounds like a good way to get my feet wet.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I think that's your problem right there. I think DSO only looks for the "DSOrganize" folder on the root of the card and under [root]\data\ while the DSOrganize.nds file can be anywhere. Most homebrew I've used doesn't work like Windows where it looks in the same directory as the *.nds for the subfolder. Rather it looks for the subfolders branching from the root of the card itself. So the new DSOrganize.nds is using the outdated and incompatible files from the older DSOrganize folder.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Uh, if there is a setting added it just loads the default, and when you go to edit it, it saves the new version anyhow.  The whole POINT of having an ini configuration is so that it's compatible between versions.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

<br/>
I think that's because for other programs, there is an installation program, whereas for DSO the only "installation" is copying over a directory. And that directory happens to contain both program files and settings files (the INI).
<br/>
<br/>
When a new version of DSO comes out, I too just copy over the whole folder, and then reprogram my settings in the options menu (it's not a lot of work - kudos for a simple interface Dragonminded). It's actually <span style="font-weight: bold">more</span> of a hassle to decompress, pinpoint the files that I don't want overwritten (should I search for a list in the Readme/website, or just open each file in a text editor and guess?), and then copy them over.
<br/>
<br/>
Might I suggest that you simply not include any configuration file in the release? If DSO is capable of generating the INI file and any missing entries anyway, might as well let it do that. Then people can do a "copy-install" very smoothly.

Well the fact that DSOrganize's s3m and nsf AREN'T broken, it does streaming audio, people state that it sounds better than moonshell, and includes other things such as IRC and a calculator that don't require writing means that it's still useful without writing.  Besides, the interface is cleaner and more suited to the DS and it has better html rendering capabilities for ebooks.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from all that, there still was demand for a read only DSOrganize, so for those that use it, there's obvious advantage.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

Config.sample IS the config.ini which is provided with the installation, including comments PER setting if you had looked.  If config.ini isn't there, it has all the defaults set upon loading.  It also DOES write back if possible.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks like the web browser doesn't handle links like &lt;a href="?foo=bar"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; correctly. E.g. if this link occurs in <a href="http://www.foo.bar/somewhere.php," target="_blank">www.foo.bar/somewhere.php,</a> instead of taking you to <a href="http://www.foo.bar/somewhere.php?foo=bar," target="_blank">www.foo.bar/somewhere.php?foo=bar,</a> it takes you to <a href="http://www.foo.bar/?foo=bar." target="_blank">www.foo.bar/?foo=bar.</a> Also, does it not try to render images that have an alt attribute? Finally I noticed, like IE but unlike Firefox and from what I hear Opera, it doesn't handle &lt;script src="foo" /&gt;; it keeps looking for a &lt;/script&gt;. I'm not sure if it's IE's or Firefox's behaviour that's wrong here.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding sound, I don't remember if I mentioned this already, but it stutters and lags badly with some OGG and SPC files, and although it's now extremely stable I did have one random crash playing an SPC. It repeated the sample a few times then went silent, ARM9 froze up shortly afterward.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] Actually, it's not rendering the images even without the alt attribute. I've tried both GIF and PNG. They're quite small: <a href="http://hyperhacker.no-ip.org/images/winamp/prev.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>, <a href="http://hyperhacker.no-ip.org/images/winamp/play.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>, <a href="http://hyperhacker.no-ip.org/images/winamp/pause.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>, <a href="http://hyperhacker.no-ip.org/images/winamp/stop.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>, <a href="http://hyperhacker.no-ip.org/images/winamp/next.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>, and those are the only images on the page, each occurring once. The largest of them (the first) is 228 bytes.

The page that was having the script tag problem is <a class="postlink" href="http://hyperhacker.no-ip.org" target="_blank">here</a>.

Still seems to be a FAT bug somewhere too. I created 3 todo files, and when I saved the third one, the first one disappeared entirely.

DSOrganize can handle infinite APs.  The limit comes from dswifi.

It was a big time saver to be able to use DSO to edit the snemul.cfg file for the latest SNEmulDS directly on my DS without having to remove the Evo, pry the card from the Evo (it's not spring-loaded and has a strong grip on the card), plug the card into my reader, plug the reader into the PC, browse to the file, edit it, safely remove the card reader, plug the card back into my Evo, put the Evo back into the DS, and run it again. In fact, right after I finished editing the file, I just browsed to the SNEmulDS.nds file and launched it directly. It all worked like a charm. It took me more time to write about it than to do it. :P<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I only suggested separate cut/copy/paste buttons because I forgot about some of the other buttons and figured that space could be used better.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I found a small bug in the text editor. I'm using the fixed-width font if it matters. When I'm typing, if the cursor goes off the bottom of the screen, it doesn't scroll down; I have to press Down on the D-pad. (Also, again, just having a Cancel button that doesn't prompt to save is aaaarrrrgggghhhh, especially since the touchscreen code isn't 100% accurate.)
<br/>
<br/>
It also seems when I paste something, the clipboard gets cleared. O_o
<br/>
<br/>
Also in the web browser, you can edit multi-line text boxes, but I don't see any way to insert a line break. If there's already a line break in the box, it glitches up a bit; you have to scroll through an entire box-full of spaces and then you see the line-break character and the next line. Would it be difficult to make it use the text editor interface for multi-line boxes?
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing, occasionally when I open the web browser it doesn't even try to connect to an AP, just immediately says "Failed to connect." It does this maybe half the time if I open the web browser, close it, and open it again, and on rare occasions the first time I open it. It's not a real problem though since if I just close it and open it again it will work the second time.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In the interface I envision, I first touch "Shift". I press arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow, and the shift key stays turned on. Then I touch Ctrl to bring up the toolbar-style keycaps and finally touch the X key (which now has scissor handles on the X) to cut the text.

Hyperhacker, the clipboard does not clear when you paste.  I don't know what you are doing but not only is there no code to clear on paste, but I've tested it pasting multiple times.
<br/>
<br/>
Inserting a linebreak is done by pressing enter...Making it multi-line aware inside the editbox on the browser would be extremely difficult.  Besides, it should be fine the way it is now.

<br/>
The AP thing is due to your router or weak signal.  I've never had it fail connecting to my AP here.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tepples, if you get around to changing up the keys, post it up, I might be interested in what you're suggesting. Would your vision of the keyboard selecting include holding control to arrow between words, therefore holding select and control to select words at a time?
<br/>
<br/>
What would be nice in the way of selecting, is just touching and dragging. Currently, I have to touch move to start selecting (I admit the text on the buttons confused me at first; I guess I'm accustomed to the buttons performing the action thats displayed on them.) and then touch where I want to select, which, in the case of URLs, is often times way past the end of the visible text box. Then that makes me have to use the arrow buttons to finish selecting the end of the URL. Maybe a "copy URL" button would work?
<br/>
Dragging to select would be really nice in the text editor, you could swap the screens and select what you want, maybe even hold a button and drag selected text to move blocks of text around... Yeah I know, we're getting past the functionality of notepad here.
<br/>
Oh the woes of GUI on a tiny touch-screen...

Whats that? Make your own plugin you say? You'll be happy to know I'm currently learning C, (or so I'd like to hope) but sad to know I haven't attempted any DS programming yet.

I feel your pain, but is there anything keeping the keyboard size from being a compile-time or even run-time option?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think much of the "it's not big enough I keep missing" problem was caused by old, suboptimal ARM7 touch code that reflected the homebrew community's lack of understanding of the details of the touch screen's timing requirements back then. <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing</span> seems to have no problem with slightly smaller keys, but that's because it uses official ARM7 touch code.

I don't see where anyone's mentioned making it smaller, though. There was mention of being able to bring the text box to the bottom screen to select text, and of being able to move word-at-a-time by holding Ctrl and using the D-pad, and select word-at-a-time by holding Ctrl+Select. None of those would require any changes to the keyboard layout, save for maybe a button that brings the textbox to the bottom screen. (Hm, B could do that, and Start could be Cancel like B is now.) There's no need to do like AC does with the textbox and keyboard both on the bottom. Just swap between text on top, keyboard on bottom and nothing on top, text on bottom.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Those images made me realize how much faster I can type things on official Nintendo keyboards than DSO. I think it's because of the older DevKitARM revision, and because we <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> using homebrew'd code here; I have to touch harder and watch to see whether my input was recieved.
<br/>
<br/>
On this note, lots of input functions in DSO seem to be kinda slow, they can especially be a pain in the browser, since I can click on a link and not know if  I hit it, or hit hard enough, so I wait to see the text turn purple and the gray progress bar start going at the bottom. Overall in DSO I would be really nice, DM, to have the program notify you instantly whether it received the input or not, like having depressible buttons or something of that nature when you touch something. Now I know the 'instant' thing may not be possible, but thats what I'm getting at here; I'm not asking for an entire reworking of the GUI in the next release, but I feel it would really help the usability of the interface in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Also another small suggestion I've always wanted, and I hope you can do for a release in the near future, is the ability to move the user shortcuts to the front page of the icons, and the DSO proprietary icons amongst them. Basically make the user shortcuts exactly like the DSO icons.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

one suggestion for the browser:

would it be possible to have the browser load the whole site on the top screen but pan and zoom the site on teh bottom like the apple iphone?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sound freeze is still not quite fixed, it crashed after about 20 minutes on an OGG file.

Right now anytime I make a download, or rename a file, or use the browser? (or anything that writes to the microSD card) I get problems such as:
<br/>
<br/>
When I turn off and turn the DS back on, certain files have the wrong filename. like dslinux.nds becomes tombraider.nds. Since I downloaded the demo from the homebrew db from DSO.
<br/>
<br/>
Or I tried downloading from the DSO Web browser. It didn't seem to save the file. Even though it gave me a positive message when it got to 100%.
<br/>
<br/>
So Im a bit fed up with these bugs. My question is, are all flashcart having this writing to FAT problem?

It's not a gba_nds_fat bug, or it would be the same on all cards.  The cards I use download, rename, and delete fine, with no corruption.  The very reason it says YMMV for that card is that, well YMMV, the driver isn't good.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry for not giving more info on my previous post.
<br/>
<br/>
I've had this problem occur since 2.8 up to 3.05 (those are the only version's I've tried on the SClite anyways). I've made it a habit of formatting my microSD card anytime I want to install a new version of DSO. I tried both with a 1Gb PNY microSD card (SD-C01G Japan) and a 512Mb Kingston microSD card.
<br/>
<br/>
This is how I proceed. (I use linux by the way)
<br/>
mkdosfs -F16 /dev/sda1 
<br/>
sometimes I use my wife's computer to try windows's XP own formatting tool
<br/>
<br/>
Then I prepare DSOrganize this way:
<br/>
-patch DSOrganize.nds with sclt.dldi (provided on chishm's website dated: 2007-01-19 made by brisssou)
<br/>
<br/>
-I then use ratx's SuperCard Magic Homebrew Patcher v0.21 on DSOrganize.nds, making sure to delete the DSOrganize.sc.nds that comes with DSOrganize so there won't be an overwriting problem (since I would have Dragonminded's own NDSOrganize.sc.nds in the same folder)
<br/>
<br/>
-I transfer both the DSOrganize folder and the DSOrganize.sc.nds file created by the ratx's patcher program to my microSD card.
<br/>
<br/>
-And that's when any writing to the flashcart, whether it be renaming a file, using the browser, or downloading a demo from the homebrew DB, causes corruption to the microSD card.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried many variations of DLDI patching, and ratx's patcher on DSOrganize before. But this detailed procedure above, is the only one that let's me use FAT writing. The default DSOrganize.sc.nds that is provided by Dragonmided does not write to the microSD. It only reads.
<br/>
<br/>
And if I don't use ratx's patcher, DSOrganize would only display an eternal black screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually let me go test all the different variations again and give a detailed tables of what happens if I mix some of these steps:
<br/>
<br/>
patch with DLDI / Don't patch with DLDI (with brissou's version and moonlight's version)
<br/>
use DSOrganize.nds / use DSOrganize.sc.nds
<br/>
patch with ratx's patcher / don't patch with ratx's patcher</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Results index:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Result #1</span>: White screens
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Result #2</span>: The following error shows up: You are not using a card that is compatible with Chishm's FAT library. Please make sure you have properly DLDI patched DSOrganize!

<br/>
with the "DSOrganize.sc.nds" file
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: no, ratx'ified: no</span> - Result #2
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: no, ratx'ified: yes</span>  - Result #2
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: brisssou's SCLT.DLDI, ratx'ified: no</span>  - Result #3

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: moonlight's SCSD_MOON.DLDI, ratx'ified: yes</span> - Result #4

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: no, ratx'ified: no</span> - Result #1
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: no, ratx'ified: yes</span> - Result #2
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: brisssou's SCLT.DLDI (2007-01-19), ratx'ified: no</span> - Result #1

<br/>
So these two are the ones that gave me somewhat positive results:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: moonlight's SCSD_MOON.DLDI (2007-02-14), ratx'ified: yes</span>
<br/>
DSOrganize works. But any writing to the microSD doesn't. Downloading homebrew goes through with the download, but nothing shows up on the microSD card. If I try browsing, it associated succesfully. But trying to go on any server results in the following error: <span style="font-style: italic">The server sent an incomplete reply back. This can usually be fixed by simply refreshing the page. This can also be caused by file corruption or a bad DLDI driver</span>. True enough, if I use DSOrganize to browse to it's CACHE directory. I get many files with odd symbols and "start" images or what not.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DLDI patched: brisssou's SCLT.DLDI (2007-01-19), ratx'ified: yes</span>
<br/>
Works very well. I can save to-do lists, drawing, download homebrew, browse the web. I cannot however create new files in the root directory. only new directories work.  But after 2 minutes of browsing. I go to my favorites, I double tap Google and it freezes. I turn off my DS. Turn it back on. Open DSOrganize, go to the web browser. It associates right away. But then any website I go to gives the following error: <span style="font-style: italic">The server sent an incomplete reply back. This can usually be fixed by simply refreshing the page. This can also be caused by file corruption or a bad DLDI driver.</span> So far even if the web browser doesn't work. I can still download from the homebrew DB and open homebrew games without any problems. I can still save drawing and to-dos, etc. Renaming doesn't seem to corrupt the card. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think Dragonminded is right in saying that the DLDI patch for this flashcart is bad. Or the rumors about the SClite not having the same hardware from one to another might also be what makes the drivers work good for some, and not for others.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by h0t1ce on Tue Nov 06, 2007 5:27 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Im a big fan of the program, but im wondering is there an option to let the DSOrganize turn off the screen after a minute of inactivity?

The power light also flashes like when u close the DS during a game. It will be great if the DSOrganize can do the same!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For starters, I <span style="font-weight: bold">did</span> have a promotional campaign.  See <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12151" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12151</a>.  As you can see, everyone was all excited, but no one actually did anything.  All that ever happened with plugins, is people would join my irc channel and whine that there weren't enough.  I would get suggestions saying "your program needs more plugins."  Every time someone asked for something I didn't want to do, I said to write a plugin, and then three people would ask me to do it.  Then people who had no programming experience whatsoever would download the sdk with the intention of making something and then bug me for hours on how to program.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought it'd be a good way to get started on the NDS too, but no one could care less.  They all wanted to do it their way.  By the way, the whole "things were made before DSO" argument doesn't hold.  Both the genesis and wonderswan plugins took me mere hours to convert from a .nds to a .dsp to demo to you guys.
<br/>
<br/>
The whole point of plugins and executables was to give people an easy way to add on and "help" DSOrganize, like people had been bugging me to let them forever.  But it turns out they don't actually want that.  They just wanted to do something easy to get their name on the project.  None of this after the fact crap is going to help any.  If you guys had actually wanted the plugin system, you'd have written something in the 11 months that it was out without me begging for you to do so.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

On the Configuration screen, the picture orientation tab seems to have the same description as the Browser tab, and the web browser image support seems to be breaking quite a few pages for me. When it loads a page with lots of images, instead of trying to load all of them as normal, it seems to get rid of half the page (text and all) once it reaches a certain image. Also, some images which load are corrupted, with random blurry bits in them.

Might it have had something to do with the different bugs in different FAT libraries? If you use raw .nds, you get libfat.

I *think* Sweater Fish Deluxe isnt being quite so arrogant as he appears.
<br/>
<br/>
Purhapes its just me being too nice to people, but I think what he was trying to say was what other people would say, not what he himself was saying.
<br/>
eg. He thinks that having a plugin system meant you could legitmately tell people "Write your own". (even though they didnt)
<br/>
<br/>
Without a plugin system, you cant say write your own, so they will nag you anyway.
<br/>

At least, I think thats what he meant to say.

i had a few other pulgs runnin. like emulators but i didnt really use them that much.
<br/>
<br/>
and the error.
<br/>
<br/>
Im using GnM
<br/>
1gb and the original i think its 154mb card it cam with. 
<br/>
<br/>
i didnt update 
<br/>
ALL
<br/>
just the ones that were different. but ill go do that and see if i still get the error.
<br/>
and what do you mean by including the folder. do you mean like the folder on the root menu or all the folders inside that main folder.
<br/>
<br/>
the cookies folder was like to store "Cookies" the things the sites download. and a cache folder.  idk i had some peoples help me.
<br/>
but i never delete stuff and i always make copies so lemme dig through the like 200 homebrew apps i have on my comp and try to find it for you.
<br/>
then i can tell you what i mean.
<br/>
<br/>
but it didnt really work that well becuase i used my 1g with nothing on it exsept moonshell and i logged in to myspace then i tried to change page and it said it ran out of memory or what ever.
<br/>
<br/>
idk youd probably have to create somthing that will write the info to the ds's flash memory so when you turn it off it erases the cookies.
<br/>
thous allowing you to log in and store cookies.

I'd need to reboot the DS to choose another NDS standalone app instead of having them all in the next door icon ready to be used. Like closing the webbrowser to use the calculator and back to it in DSO, or exit IRC to see any link in the webbrowser (nice integration ATM).
<br/>
Everythig with similar usage and interface, without the need to configure everything individualy.
<br/>
It's a shame DSOE/Ps are gone, it should be a standard, like every little app coming in NDS, DS.GBA, SC.NDS and DSE/O in the zip.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
though Calculator, Webrowser, IRC etc aren't plugins, they are already built in.
<br/>
<br/>
DS takes 5 seconds to turn off and on again? Or even faster if the the homebrew supports soft reset - (supercard one homebrew soft reset works for dso too)
<br/>
<br/>
IMO i use DSO a bit more than most other homebrew applications, but that doesn't mean I want everything interlinked.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Having to reboot can be a real pain, especially depending what equipment you have. In my case I'd have to fish out the ARDS from my pocket, put it in, turn the system off and on again, go through the Nintendo logo and ARDS startup screen, and then if my GBAMP managed to start up, choose the program I want. Then when I'm done that, reboot again and wait for DSO to start again. Maybe for some people with nice fancy slot-1 cards and hacked firmware, this process is a bit faster, but it's not going to be as fast as hitting Start and poking an icon or two.
<br/>
Also, by having to restart you lose the clipboard and captured URLs.
<br/>
<br/>
As for soft reset, last I checked DSO didn't have this. Those of us who don't use Supercard have to hard reboot. (Or write a plugin... &lt;_&lt;)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a neat program. Nice work.
<br/>
<br/>
DSO will run on a slot 2 M3 SD. Just like pas said, format, make sure the .nds and dsorgainze folder are in root (folder can be placed under data/ too) and launch the patched .nds with start.
<br/>
In my experience however, some major features of this software are broken thanks to what I can only guess (kinda new to this) is flawed write support in the dldi driver. It seems to write small files fine, but the homebrew database for example, when downloading a file only a 0 byte file will be written. Moving/copying files in the browser appears to be broken as well, and I have had a few instances of corruption. Now this is while using the normal dldi driver by Chishm. When patched with the alt driver, files saved through the database are written correctly and apparently run fine, (except for scumm, fails to dl every time) but the file browser remains broken.
<br/>
<br/>
A little OT but, it's not just DSO I've been having problems with though. I've been desperately trying to get a ftp server to work correctly with my hardware, but again only small files and occasionally a 256k file can be written to the sd without a crash. Neither dsftp or combox will start when patched with the alt driver. If you can believe it, these are the very first 3 pieces of homebrew I've tried.. nothing but problems. It's odd that the dldi tester will pass all tests, and that's writing a 1M file, much larger than I've failed to write with any other program.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't received any feedback from other m3perfectsd users to know if it's my card, formatting, adapter, etc. or something beyond my control as an end user and only a vague idea who to try to contact to resolve this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you ever experience any 'weirdness' when launching DSO or any other homebrew from the cart's menu, try this...run DSOrganize, and then use it to re-run DSOrganize.nds...then you can launch the homebrew from DSO's file browser.
<br/>
<br/>
This clears up freezing problems I was getting in DSO 3.2 while moving around the file browser, fixes the touchscreen-being-unusably-offset problem that people have mentioned when using MoonShell on the M3DSR/G6R, and various wackiness in other programs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems the M3DSR's menu is leaving some sort of garbage around, or else it launches homebrew in such a way that some programs don't like, but launching them from DSO has fixed any such broken behavior.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Now I know what DSO does, and it probably does more than I need - but I what I want to know is which version is the most stable for basic file manager operations - seems to be some references to the birthday release as the best, but I can't determine if this is subjective -- and more to the point, which was the birthday version.
<br/>
<br/>
And dare I even ask for fear of invoking wrath, but should I be using something other than DSO if all I need is file management.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think thats the version I have.
<br/>
<br/>
Right now DSOrganize works great as a replacement OS for my Max Media Dock. After disabling auto-DLDI patching (since it seems to...not work) I am able to boot any homebrew with it and even boot homebrew that wouldn't boot in the normal Max Media app.
<br/>
<br/>
So far DSO hasn't corrupted anything, so I'm not worried about it.
<br/>
<br/>
lol DragenMinded thought the DS was too small for video? Well just look at the iPod. People are buying those up like crazy and the screens on those things are even smaller then the DS!<br/>_________________<br/>Sig under construction...Please check back after the sun explodes....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Sorry, I'm a complete noob.

<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am new to this stuff for my DS. I have just figured out that I can use the Moonshell program on my DSTT chip to play movies.
<br/>
<br/>
I am now watching movies but need a few answers.
<br/>
<br/>
How do I fast forward, rewind and pause the movie in Moonshell ?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some kind of software that I can upload onto to the Moonshell to help out the playing of movies?
<br/>
<br/>
Is this what the DSOrganize program does??
<br/>
<br/>
If not, is there something out there?
<br/>
<br/>
What does this DSOrganize program do for your DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm so sick and tired of DSOrganize not reading over half my files because their names have chinese characters in them. And since 3.2's source code was released, I want to know if I can make at least the Browser portion of it support unicode (UTF8).
<br/>
<br/>
I know it's possible, since Moonshell reads UTF8 just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
So how would I go about adding unicode support? Any classes I should be looking into?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
