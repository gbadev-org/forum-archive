    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is based on some code I wrote over a year ago, I decided to polish it a bit and release it as a small tool.
<br/>
It should run on most slot 1 cards with DLDI support and allows to dump and restore savegames from a GBA game in slot 2 to/from a file on the slot 1 card.
<br/>
<br/>
Dump and restore should work with Flash and SRAM, however, EEPROM isn't supported (yet).
<br/>
<br/>
I've tested it with all my games and it works fine but it still needs more testing (for examlpe restoring on flash with 'bad' blocks will probably hang the program)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
<br/>
Great application you have made ! :D
<br/>
<br/>
Everything works. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Only when Restoring it gives 2 withe blocks...
<br/>
I guess that is what you mean with "bad" block.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much! :)
<br/>

(My GBA game: The Sims bustin' out , Always delete the save game once it is out of the Console... 0_o. This is the great solution! :D thank you!)
