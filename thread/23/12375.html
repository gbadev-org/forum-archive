    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">PLEASE NOTE:</span> This is not my emulator. The source was released by Ethos of <a class="postlink" href="http://ethos.oddigytitanium.com/" target="_blank">http://ethos.oddigytitanium.com/ </a> I simply started working on it to stir up some interest in it.
<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to stir up some interest in this NDS GB/GBC emulator, I added libfat support to it, with a pretty rudimentary file explorer (thanks to PicoDriveDS) and adjusted a few lines of code so it will compile with DKP r20.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems that theres a bug somewhere in the code causing slightly corrupt
<br/>
graphics, I wasn't able to track it down but I haven't been looking for very long.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I know little asm and even less about the Gameboy's Z80 processor, so I don't imagine I would be much help in coding speed optimizations and the such. Hopefully someone with more knowledge on the the subject can help improve this emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
attached is both the modified source and a binary (.nds and nds.gba). 
<br/>
<br/>
KNOWN ISSUES:
<br/>
Graphics slightly corrupt
<br/>
Many ROMs will crash it - tested with Mega Man 1, works fine (slow though)
<br/>
ROM's must end in ".gb", spaces in filenames not tested.

At least on the GB mono emulator I wrote, it was, and it ran between 10-15x the original speed when not limited. Before writing a dynamic recompiler, virtualizing the rendering through the DS ones would be mandatory, as it'll give the biggest boost, with no doubt.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://shashemudev.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://shashemudev.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I was added the streaming sound, I noticed that all the saving code that is in gnuboy does not exist in this port. It would have to be readded or the asm would need to be added to a full gnuboy port that includes all the saving source code.

Wait, so you're saying that we need to get the source code from the original Gnuboy and redo it a bit so that the DS port could have it? I couldn't really understand some of what you just said though so sorry about my poor understanding.

<br/>
EDIT: Oh and can someone please re-add the save option then? Since there's a source code floating around for the original Gnuboy for the PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also the Nintendo DS has 2 processors so the ARM7 can deal with the sounds and the ARM9 with other stuff. Adding a adjust speed options would be a good idea though, including slower or faster than original hardware.

<br/>
<br/>
To compare audio quality, first is Goomba Color, which is going to sound much more genuine since it simply passes all audio commands to the GBC sound chip and doesn't spend time worrying about it after that.
<br/>
<a href="http://dannysied.googlepages.com/GoombaColor.mp3" target="_blank">http://dannysied.googlepages.com/GoombaColor.mp3</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly is GPF's build of GNUboy, which does not have access to the GBC sound chip since it's running in DS mode.  It's passable considering that it's all emulated sound and this is the first release that implements it.

Both recordings are of track 10 of the Azure Dreams GBS file and were recorded in WAV format, downsampled to constant 192 bitrate mp3.  The fadeout is my own - the original GBS music loops forever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
