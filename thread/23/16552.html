Here a little part from the readme:

RULEZ

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
The goal of the game it's to make snails complete some races.
<br/>
<br/>
Snails starts at 0 and end a race at 14+.
<br/>
<br/>
If a snails reach 14+ with your card, then you get one "Finish" point and X
<br/>
"Speed" point where X is the final value of the snail [let's say you play a
<br/>
card and a snail reach 16, then you get one "Finish" point and 16 "Speed"
<br/>
point].
<br/>
<br/>
Each players start with eight card and draw a card at the end of each of his
<br/>
turns [if the deck is not exausted].
<br/>
<br/>
On each turn players must play one and only one card.
<br/>
<br/>
Colored card can only be played on the snail of the same color.
<br/>
Black card can be played on whatever snail you like.
<br/>
<br/>
When a player plays a card on a snail it moves forward [or backward in the
<br/>
case of black card] of a number equals to the card value [let's say that the red
<br/>
snail is at 4 and you play a red 2, then the snail runs at 6].
<br/>
<br/>
The winner is the player with most "Finish" point, on draw the winner is the
<br/>
player with most "Speed" point, on draw ... the game is a DRAW! 8)) .
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
