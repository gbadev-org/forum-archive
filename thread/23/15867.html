    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A new version of Bitsweeper! (Release 3) has been released. 
<br/>
<br/>
Changes include the following: 
<br/>
<br/>
 - New options to let left-handed users play the game more comfortably. 
<br/>
<br/>
 - Corrected an obscure bug that does not let you read back your best scores table in certain media cards. 
<br/>
<br/>
And, with this release, I want to apologize to early users of this application for not providing an appropiate switch for left-handed users, something that should have been provided a long time ago. Here's hoping that you can enjoy now better the game! 
<br/>
