    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
I am Rodrigo (half of "rrc2soft"), and after some months of work I have almost finished my first NDS project: DSZhongwen.
<br/>
<br/>
DSZhongwen is a tool for learning (a bit of) Chinese, able to read the ideograms (pinyin), and to show the order of the strokes (alongside with exams and some other stuff like a dictionary of every word used in the lessons -:) ).
<br/>
<br/>
Any kind of feedback that would help to improve the user experience will be greatly appreciated :-D
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">(Update April 12: v1.0 )</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">(Update April 29: v1.0a. New lesson type, "Hanzi Attack!!!!". I think this new lesson type is worth of being announced :-) )</span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">    * Patch to avoid game corruption when loading and showing certain hanzi.
<br/>
    * New lesson type, "Hanzi Attack!!!!!". The 3752 hanzi stored inside DSZhongwen have been sorted according to their popularity (number of hits in Google), and you can learn them in "just" 251 lessons!
<br/>
    * New option added to the dictionary: Check how to write a certain word.
<br/>
    * "Play" option added in the listening lessons. You can continously listen to a listening lesson, even with the nds closed!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
Comments:
<br/>
The writing lesson could use with some better looking fonts instead of the straight lines.
<br/>
Stroke order for "5" and "9" are wrong
<br/>
Unzipping all those pronunciation files took a long time. Maybe merge them into a few files?
<br/>
Put the data files in /data/DSzhongwen instead to prevent cluttering up the root folder?
<br/>
Choosing the lesson is counter intuitive. You click the big button, choose the lesson, then click back, then click the small button? The "click back" part shouldn't be there.
<br/>
The quiz for "grammar 1". When the question is "tamen", the answers are all "tamen"; when the question is "women", the answers are all "women".
<br/>
Put "DSzhongwen" on the title screen as Chinese. ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Known bug - if a lesson has less than four ideograms of a certain size, the quiz will fail. Have to find a way to fix it (maybe reduce the number of options :-) ).

I'll do so. Maybe, we could propose to make this "having the homebrew data in the '/data' folder" a de-facto standard :-)

Once i code it for myself, I will make it public too. Although now I am tired of coding and want to learn (a bit of) chinese ;-).

BTW, felix123, now the title is in chinese, the pronunciation files are packed, and the "quiz bug" is fixed. Thanks for the comments!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...nope, sorry :-(. I need that space for the pinyin pronunciations and the dictionary. The application would not be that useful without those things.

Easy. Just go to (random office supply store) and buy a bigger CF card. Then instead of being 21% of your card, the program is only 2.6% of your card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Or you can order it online. It's a lot cheaper, since I got my 1gb mini-sd at around 15$, yet in CompUSA the same card was around 40$.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you add a dictionary?  Or maybe make a dictionary seperate?  Someone ported PocketKanji from Palm Pilot, a dictionary that recognizes when you draw kanji on the touchscreen and finds an English definition and Japanese pronunciation.  That kind of function would be really helpful for Chinese because of how hard it is to look up characters in a paper dictionary.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway to install this without the audio pronunciation?  Pinyin is good enough for a lot of people and doesn't require as much memory.
