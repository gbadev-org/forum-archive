    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I put this in the root on her ds, so she had to see it :P
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the controls are simple, 
<br/>
<br/>
control pad = move hearts
<br/>
Touch screen = restart song
<br/>
<br/>
Its very simple, but I've maybe spent 4-5 days worth of time learning to program for the ds, so some of the code may look familar to some of the demos around, however trying to blend what I learned proved to be a pain :P
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I went from knowing PHP to programming this in less than 5 days time, and if someone wants to change the image, and use the source for their loved one, have at it :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just added some bug fixes and new features :P
<br/>
<br/>
A adds another heart to the screen
<br/>
B removes a heart from the screen
<br/>
<br/>
I also fixed a few bugs with vertical heart movement.
<br/>
<br/>
Also if you remove the hearts, it leaves old hearts on the screen, I could have cleared them, but I left it this way, because if you remove it down to 1 heart, it is a mini game of clear the hearts, with the remaining heart being moved around by the cursor, and as it runs over pixels, it clears them :P
