    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">update: v1.0b is out - lots of new stuff. easier to try it than to explain it.
<br/>

<br/>
i've put together a little drum machine/sequencer ds app (using devkitpro + palib). 
<br/>
<br/>
(edit, latest screenshot:)
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://remaincalm.org/nds/bliptracker.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
you can use the touch screen as four drum pads, with four different WAV sample sets and four different patterns. i also chucked in my old theramin code which kicks in if you hold the left trigger.
<br/>
<br/>
download link and full instructions at: <a href="http://remaincalm.org/nds/" target="_blank">http://remaincalm.org/nds/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
please read the instructions carefully - you probably need to DLDI patch it (the supplied version is patched for R4DS) and the files have to be placed in a particular location on your flash card in order for the program to start up. also, pretty much every button combination does something :-)
<br/>
<br/>
there's no save file support yet, but it's coming. backup your card first anyway, it's usually a good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
development is continuing, so let me know if you can think of any good features to add. dsmidi support and additional sample/program selection will go in first after the load/save, but after that i'm not sure what else it needs.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers

<br/>
I'm not sure if this is a bug but you can get some crazy sounds to the left of the top left kitties head. Well I'm using it either way.

<br/>
you mean when you hold down the L trigger? yeah, it's a bug - but i liked the way it sounds so i not planning on fixing it :-)
<br/>
<br/>
couple of things that are cool for live performance - you can switch pattern playback live (L+pad) - i'm going to change it so that the pad by itself picks a pattern, but L+pad lets you edit a pattern without affecting playback. the other things i'm toying with are a "program" selector - so you can have sets of samples, and being able to have a different sample set for the sequencer playback and manual entry.
<br/>
<br/>
you're right though - it's a little tricky to get started on but once you memorize the keys you can really do some crazy stuff with it. cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#129974 - Sweater Fish Deluxe - Tue May 29, 2007 5:26 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is superb!
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't try out the earlier versions but 0.9c is really excellent.  I'm not very musicaly inclined, but I always love playing around with drum machines and keyboards, yours is no exception.
<br/>
<br/>
I have two suggestions that I think would really make it great for live playing.  First, it would be cool if you could compose and begin playing a beat sequence in the sequencer and then change to a different sample set on the touchscreen without changing the samples being played in the sequencer.  That might involve some complicated changes to your code, though.  A simpler suggestion is providing some different instrument effects for the "theramin."  Are you using the PSG to create the theramin sound?  Even with PSG, it should be possible to create effects that sound (vaguely) like flute or saxaphone or things like that.

    <h4>#129998 - dub3000 - Tue May 29, 2007 11:31 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that first one is on the list - the code is super clean, that won't be hard to do
<br/>
<br/>
i can actually set it up so that two completely separate songs, both with their own sample set, tempo and swing settings, are playing at the same time - would probably take about 20 lines of code. the problem is getting it working in the user interface. my main goal with this thing is to keep it really simple to use.
<br/>
<br/>
same thing with pattern size and number of instruments - there are no fixed limits in the code. i can actually do different tempo per quarter note (that's how the swing feature works). 
<br/>
<br/>
there's a strong chance bliptracker isn't going to evolve very much (apart from some really basic pattern sequencing options, including a randomizer) but i may use the codebase to build a new sequencer with a lot more capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm happy to release the source if anyone wants to see it, mail me and i'll send it through.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

there's already a playback mode that does that - i think it's the third option down. i might rename it to something more sensible...
<br/>
<br/>
i've just uploaded a new version (1.0c) that switches off some compiler optimizations . if you're having trouble with beats not playing sporadically, this might fix it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
