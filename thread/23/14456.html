Great to see it released and thanks for including the souce code - I was able to make 2 versions that included my skins.
<br/>
<br/>
Just had quick test and there's something you need to address: 
<br/>
<br/>
Turning off the DS with the lid closed, locks up the emulator the next time it is used. The gui still works so loading a clean rom will start it working again but loading the  .tisv will not.
<br/>
<br/>
After trying this 3 or 4 times the emulator failed to work loading either and xp recovered some lost clusters when I scanned the microSD for errors.
<br/>
<br/>
When restarted the emulator need to be shown the .rom again for it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
I found this out because I was tring to find out how to save the calculator state between sessions. As I had suggested (rather late) that calculator off be used to trigger  a save state with DS power off and wanted to see if it had been implimented.
<br/>
<br/>
(For safe saving:- close lid (pause), open lid (pause) and then power off)
<br/>
<br/>
I like your gui and the file selector with fat2: support is very exciting (I hope something like it makes it into moonshell one day), but it wasn't obvious to me what file sending was supposed to do as I could browse to directories but do little else.
<br/>
<br/>
The TI-83 Plus emulation seems to be good, but due to the save state issue I haven,t been able to test it to any depth.
<br/>
<br/>
All in all it's as good as you suggested, and I'm glad to have finally seen your work. It just needs a few tweeks here and there, like most programs.
<br/>
<br/>
Hardware: European DS Lite (FlashMe 8a), M3 Simply (v1.07) and M3 Lite (e35) both with a 2GB (FAT32) Kingston microSD
<br/>
Software: WabbitDS.nds, 558KB, 3/11/07; r4tf.dldi</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Ramzee on Sun Nov 04, 2007 5:34 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

However does the save issue only occur when you attempt to turn off the ds with the lid close? Or is there always a save issue.

Not that I've noticed, in my quick test - as long as I follow the close lid (pause), open lid (pause) and power off sequence everything seemed to work (I haven't tried saving to fat2: yet).
<br/>
<br/>
If it takes a lot of work to impliment TI-83 OFF = DS OFF then prehaps just making it switch to the SELECT gui would be possible, as at the moment the user is left with a blank top screen and none functioning keypad (unless they press ON or SELECT) and so it feels like a program lockup. In the gui SELECT could turn it on again if it wasn't already running when switching back.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Portrait mode</span> works quit well (with my SE skin), only thing to do is change the d-pad assignments to match the screen orientation. I'd like to be able to have the emulated screen at the top of it's screen as I'm used to reading left to right/top to bottom, but as this is down to taste I'd leave it unless you can make it configurable.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Ramzee on Sun Nov 04, 2007 5:37 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

I would like to have the option to turn scaling off, because it leads to slight image distortion. The screen looks fine in landscape mode (or should it be called portrait mode? well, let's call it brain age mode :), but then the skin is distorted.

<br/>
It does already, it makes a save when you close the lid and this will auto load next time you run the program. However at the moment it is not safe to power off the DS in suspend mode so always open the lid before finally switching the DS off. If you don't there's file corruption. If you've spent a lot of time setting up the calculator it's worth keeping a seperate back up of the .tisv file just in case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I was a bit worried about the blank screen meaning off. Its actually a slightly darker shade of white, but I should have made it darker.  I haven't emulated contrast yet, that would make it more obvious.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll take a look at popping up the GUI when it powers down, see if that looks good.

Another option would be allowing the user to see entires in a DS font in the space below. Perhaps Pretty Print them(that'd take a while to do of course).
<br/>
<br/>
Theres actually a lot of options that have potential. When we made Wabbitemu, we tried to keep it usable as an actual calc allowing for things like ctrl+c to copy the last answer to the clipboard. Since the DS is already similar in size as a calc, I need to think of new ways to make it user friendly.

I've been able to play with it some more and so far found no emulation issues (gray scale didn't change with the contrast control (staying black), I tune for speed anyway).
<br/>
<br/>
While using it APD was active and it struck me that it would be ideal if the DS Lite could use that as a trigger to power save at the same time (turning off the backlight, etc. like moonshell does) and to use any touch or button press (other than SELECT)to bring it and the DS out of suspend. If the gui was left on you'd want that to do the same.
<br/>
<br/>
To catch TI-83+ program crashes there could be a 5 or 10 second waiting period between consecutive power saving. So the user would see the keyboard and blank screen (which won't respond anyway) for 10? seconds at least before powering off again. Alternatively and maybe better, if off is triggered repeatedly in 10? seconds assume a crash and activate the gui with a message saying that "Off has been triggered the TI-83 may have crashed and a reset or rom reload may be necessary". Could this be handled in a power saving module rather than the TI-85 emulation? You would also need a file to test it with (mabye one for the wrong calculator would do).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm worried that users will lose complex setups accidentally. It will be important to have a clear seperation between auto saves and archived configurations in the final gui (unless I've missed something already) and for users to know their work has been saved.
<br/>
<br/>
Changes I've made to my setup include changing the key assiignments in TIDS.CFG as the START button is only small on my DS lite and changing 2nd Function up to the top to match the keyboard arrangement. As the 2nd function and alpha keys are also triggered by buttons I'm looking to simulate the relevent keys lighting up on my SE skin as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Re: Power Management

Thinking about the program logic I think something like this might work:-

2.1 If not OFF
<br/>
2.1.1 Assume all is well and pass control to user.

2.2.2.2.1 Go to gui screen give user a meaning full error message; ie. "The calculator has been turned on, but it has turned it's self off. The calculator may have crashed and may need to be reset or have the save state or rom reloaded."
<br/>
2.2.2.2.2 Give the user control.

---------------------
<br/>
This would be triggered by the TI-83+ being powered off.

<br/>
This would be triggered by any keypress, touch screen input or the lid openning (ignore sholder buttons with the lid shut).
<br/>
<br/>
1. Bring DS out of suspend mode

Re: Save Management
<br/>
===================
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think having an auto save when the lid is closed is good as there's no way to tell the user what's being done. Just use it to trigger suspend mode.<span style="font-weight: bold">(I'm not sure about this now, it didnt seem natural at 1st, but now seems faster than switching to a sub menu to make a save.)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The user might still want to save their progress without quiting so this should be an option in the gui.
<br/>
<br/>
When loading a .rom, .tisv, etc. it would be good if the file manager openned at the directory last used.
<br/>
<br/>
If a new .tisv is loaded from the gui the user should be asked if they wish to save their existing state before loading the new file. There is an issue with over writing a previous .tisv file if you load the same .rom twice so the user should again be asked before the new .tisv overwrites the old .tisv
<br/>
<br/>
Later on if the gui can handle text input (either through a qwerty keyboard or the existing alpha skin) when these conflicts occour the user could be given the chance to create a new .tisv with a meaning full name.
<br/>
<br/>
It's already possible to create different .tisv's by copying and renaming existing files using windows xp. ie. create games.tisv, statistics.tisv, etc. and then load and setup the TI-83+ accordingly for each, but it would be better to be able to do it in the program.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Note: Niether TIDS.CFG or the .TISVs are created with date or time stamps at the moment.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I think your idea's for using the extra screen space in portrait mode sound very promising.
<br/>
<br/>
My comments are ment as suggestions to help improve your program and not criticisms of it as I am still very much enjoying it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Ramzee on Tue Nov 06, 2007 2:44 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I think DS suspend (if possible at all) would need to be a configurable option and if difficult should be left for later.

Sorry bout the lack of updates, I had exams this week. So let me compile a quick to do list in order of importance.
<br/>
<br/>
* Fix Suspend &amp; Save mode
<br/>
* Turn off backlight when is Low Power Mode and no buttons pressed
<br/>
* Make OFF more apparent
<br/>
* Add notes for usage on File Bowser Screen
<br/>
* LCD Contrast(forgot to add that in)
<br/>
* Better Scaling for Rotations
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not gonna save when the Calc is turned off, I consider that a bit dangerous.  Theres no way for me to detect if the calculator was turned off intentionally or not.  2nd + OFF isn't reliable, theres Auto Power Down and teacher keys in games. So theres a lot possible ways this could fail. More over, that doesn't give the user choice to save progress. Assuming everyone read the readme,  If you don't want to save and you want revert you can simply turn off the DS and reload your sav. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One thing though, Is there a way to timestamp files? I've Updated to DevkitPro r21 but it doesn't seem to change that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've patched Quake DS, SNEmulDS, NesDS, Lameboy, etc. They all work fine, so I'm not sure what the problem is. I'm going to try it again just in case. Does the Wabbit NDS file have to be in the root, because I've been leaving it in the folder. And I put all my TI roms in a folder to keep the card more organized. I've got roms for TI-83, TI-83 Plus, and TI-83 Plus SE. And I downloaded that 8xu thing, and tried them all. They're working roms, because I've used them before. So any other advice?

The TIDS.CFG is 0kb? Its only a few hundred bytes so 0kb maybe a misleading. Check the contents of the file, open it in a text edit and see whats written and post it here.

New features:
<br/>
<br/>
* Save and suspend bug fixed(hopefully)
<br/>
* Back light turns off on menu screen and when the calc is off after 45 seconds of non use.
<br/>
* Off is a much darker shade of grey
<br/>
* Scaling for portrait mode is improved, makes text more legible.
<br/>
<br/>
and probably some other little things here and there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Consider this build some what beta, theres a lot of new things in here despite the short update list.
<br/>
<br/>
If this fixes most of the remaining issues then I'd like to release on more sites and Start work on some things to learn the hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only files needed are WabbitDS.nds and a copy of the TI-83 Plus firmware (.rom or .8Xu) which isn't included for obvious reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
In your case, when the program started, I would expect the bottom screen to show the fat1: file manager waiting to be directed to the location of the .rom or .8Xu file.
<br/>
<br/>
The selection of an incompatible rom would then give a white top screen with a none functioning keyboard (SELECT would still switch to the gui menu). This would become your default save file (.tisv) loaded each time you start the emulator until you select a new .rom, .8Xu or .tisv file in the gui.
<br/>
<br/>
To test your .rom file you can use the XP version of<a class="postlink" href="http://www.revsoft.org/wabbitemu.zip" target="_blank"> Wabbit </a>
<br/>
<br/>
NB: When the TI-83 Plus turns it's self off only the ON button and gui SELECT work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
first run i thought it was frozen was happening so i powered off.
<br/>
<br/>
Second time i left it for longer, (realising it just needed some more time to write the sav file etc) and it worked fine. I drew a basic graph and did an equation, it worked fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Third time i ran it, i went to draw a simple graph of 2X^2 but it didn't draw, nothing was on the axis. I restarted again but this time the emulator froze rather than just failing to draw the graph. 
<br/>
<br/>
The last time i ran it I tried a basic multiplication sum and it half froze again and the keypad changed to ALPHA style simultaneously and the screen went into a darker blue shade. But the menus were properly accessable.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW each time i ran it it said "ram cleared"
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking it might be corruption of the rom/sav, so i'll try recopying the files over.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wabbit was working fine, until I ran into a problem. I was backing up my files and I was going to replace some of my files for updates. So I needed to erase all the stuff on my file to reorganize it. I reformatted the card, something that I do occasionally after backups because my computer won't let my delete corrupted save files. I reformatted it, put everything back on and booted up my DS. I got into Wabbit and waited a million years and nothing happened. So I restarted my DS, and it said no media device found. I tried to reformat it on my computer, but fo some reason it's not fat32 anymore, it's RAW. And of course you can't format that. So I've tried partitioning it, with no avail. I'm using KillDisk to try and get it so I can reformat it. I just don't know what to do. Is it really Killed? It's a 2gb Lexar card I got on sale very cheap. But I really don't want to go and buy a new card. Does anyone have any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wait, I just thought of something, I've got a regular SD card adapter for my micro, and a camera that works with SD cards, I'll try that. Good idea, I'm hoping it works.

Results: the emulator crashed, and the folder where I've put the .nds was fucked up, couldn't open it under windows and with my supercard, I can open but it shows japanese folder names x)

I had to format my SD card to delete it. I'm happy that I didn't keep the .nds on the rot folder, in that case I totally could loose all my data. Because in this folder I had another homebrew (TI85 emulator) and it was dead too.
