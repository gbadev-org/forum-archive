    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please take a few minutes and give SLURP a try.  It is available at <a href="http://dl.ndshb.com" target="_blank">http://dl.ndshb.com</a> with instructions.  Please post any bugs you find here or on the ndshb.com forum.  As you can see, we already have a few.. I totally forgot about devices that require the .ds.gba version of homebrew.. I don't know why.. :(  Just slipped my mind.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is really just a concept, the "final" product will not look anything like this, more of a database browser, and we are just starting to work on the web interface to allow people to create accounts so they can add homebrew to the database when it is ready.
<br/>
<br/>
One nice thing to note (I hope others will do it as well) is the ability to download the latest version of SLURP within SLURP.  It would be nice if some of the WiFi enabled games we already have (ExplosiveGas comes to mind) would check to see if a newer version is available, and give the option to download it.

I don't have a card that supports dldi on me at the moment to try this out, I'll try to get one back for the weekend.

<br/>
Are you thinking individual games would check if they're the latest version, or letting SLURP itself do the check?  i.e. when you download a game through SLURP it stores the downloaded version number in a control file, and when you run slurp again to launch a game you have downloaded, it will notify you if a new version is available.... well that's assuming SLURP launches games from it's interface.

Just tried it with my new-ish NDS lite and my R4DS. Patched, loaded it through R4DS loader, would not initialize the wifi. Loaded it through DSO, and the wifi worked. Tried to download MelstromDS and everything seemed to go ok, until right at the end. The last line on the display looks like it said "Closing sock: 1" and it hangs. Also, according to the main page, the bar should have turned teal, indicating it was patched? Anyway, I rebooted the DS and went to play the game, which had a size of 0, so of course it didn't load. Tried downloading Word Up! as well, and got the teal bar for about 9/10ths of the way, but still a filesize of 0.
<br/>
<br/>
I do get a somewhat flickery black bar at the top of the upper display, but once the program starts downloading, it disappears.
<br/>
<br/>
Ideas:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      When downloading, make background of upper display black as to be able to see the text that scrolls by.
<br/>
      When downloading, float the image of the selected app/game above the progress bar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So other than the filesizes being 0, everything seems to work so far. If you want any further testing, let me know :)

I had to patch it with supercard magic homebrew patcher to get it to work though. DLDI alone didn't work. Strangely they all booted through DSO just fine. The same goes for the games I downloaded with it except Maelstom. I double checked the DLDI file and file setup and everything was as should be.

Yeah, that is what I was thinking..  SLURP was planned to only give you download access to a database.  I didn't really think about it checking it's own database to see if there are newer versions available..  Good thinking..  I'm also hoping to get a DSO and Moonshell plugin setup, depending on the difficulty.

Yeah, that is the prepended header I forgot about (and mentioned in red) for the devices that need the .ds.gba version.  DOH!  Still don't know what I was thinking!  DSO auto prepends the header if needed.  Hopefully in the next release or so, we will auto prepend the header based on the DLDI file you are using (to know if your device needs the header or not).
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.. and I should mention that Phoenix Rising did all the real work on this release.  Now that we have something working, we plan on more collaboration.  So hopefully it will get better.. quicker.. ;)

PR had already thought about that (I didn't know).  But the main problem is if you go outside the system.  He was talking about checking hashes, but the current patched file would be different because of the patch.  If we went with a local tracking system, if you downloaded something outside of SLURP, you wouldn't want SLURP to download an update overtop of it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, PR said we plan on open sourcing this when it is more stable and it is being broken up into 3 seperate parts.  So anyone who would like to add an auto downloader (or whatever) for their program will be able to use parts of this application to download from the database.  He is also talking about a private/public flag so that devers can use the system as private to make sure everything is working before making it available to everyone else.  It might even get to the point where you can add a step to your Makefile to upload it to your account in the database.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep the suggestions coming and we will do our best to implement them.  Main next step is to get the online stuff working so we can have something to download for the next version, which currently just displays 'All' and 'Games" for categories, and only has SLURP available for download.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is the problem we are having.  How do we tell the difference?

We download ThisGame 1.0 using SLURP. (SLURP thinks we have 1.0)
<br/>
a month passes, I see an update post, and download ThisGame 1.1 overtop of the one downloaded by SLURP.
<br/>
<br/>
What happens next?  Does SLURP think we have 1.0?  If 1.1 is available in SLURP, is it going to tell us there is a newer version even though we have the current version already?  Etc..

Not worth getting bogged down with - if it's not downloaded via SLURP then SLURP doesn't know and tells the user there's a new version.

Because we are patching them?  Otherwise, we'd have to keep the hash for every patched version of the .nds for every DLDI driver on the server to compare against, no?

<br/>
WinterMute: We're not getting bogged down with this.  Our list is plenty long before we worry about features such as this.  It was more of a "neat" idea for individual homebrews to do, as it's much easier for them to keep track of their own version numbers.  I'm not a programmer, but I could see this as easy as having a version.txt file available on the authors site, and a version variable in the prog.  Just fetch the version.txt, compare to the version variable, and ask to pull down the latest version if needed.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wouldn't it be better to patch at runtime in the loader? This was Chishm's original intent with the DLDI system.

As I've said in other places I'd love to see a standard homebrew menu &amp; launcher that works on as many cards as possible. Chishm has an exec stub somewhere that works that way.

This is why I suggested some kind of internal database.
<br/>
<br/>
SLURP can generate it's own hash after the rom has been patched, then write it to file.
<br/>
<br/>
SLURP then can run hash checks and determine if the user updated the file, at which point SLURP can simply stop managing that file until the user re-downloads it via SLURP.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A more simple solution may exist. The main thing is that a large number of users want some kind of update checking, be it manual or not. With such a large demand, one would suspect implementing the feature would be fairly high up on the list. Without it, what real good does slurp serve over a more simple and existing solution, such as the ftp client? From what I gather, the innovation of SLURP is that it's somewhat more intelligent than a simple downloader, in which case it needs to reflect that in it's feature list.

The only other similar solution is DSO's homebrew database.  And it only has Official NDS demos in it.  Dragonminded has more to do then worry about that homebrew database.. and what I'm sure he is finding out, is that it's a lot of work trying to keep a list up to date with all the new homebrew coming out.  So, the <span style="font-weight: bold">main</span> purpose of SLURP (name is actually going to be changed) is to not only provide a homebrew database for easy downloading and patching, but to provide an upload interface so that one person doesn't have to maintain the database.  If all is a success, developers will be adding their homebrew to the database (or fans will) so that we have a large group of people helping to keep it updated.
<br/>
<br/>
Not only will it be an applcation, but it will have two libraries (so far) that will be available so that anyone can have their homebrew check/download/patch updated versions, not just within SLURP.  Here is some of the current task list for version 0.1.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">NDS Application</span>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
- Ability to download and display motd and disclaimer to user.
<br/>
- Ability to download and display available categories.
<br/>
- Ability for the user to select a category.
<br/>
- Ability to download and display available applications within a category.
<br/>
- Ability for the user to select an application. First click provides application details on the top screen. Second click begins download.
<br/>
- Ability to download and patch the application.
<br/>
- Ability to go back up to the category selection screen.
<br/>
- Support Menu-&gt;Sort Order-&gt;[App Name, Last Update Time, Times Downloaded, Rating]
<br/>
- Support Menu-&gt;Options
<br/>
- Use the DLDI Patch from within the downloader to patch the file rather than relying on an external file.
<br/>
- Add a flag to the configuration to prepend a standard header to the front of the nds files to make them .ds.gba/sc.nds files. Primarily to support the supercard.</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Website</span>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
- Logins -- Need to provide logins for uploaders to keep track of who is uploading what.
<br/>
- Upload Apps -- The ability to upload new applications to the website.
<br/>
- Provide Categories -- The ability to send the category information down to the NDS application.
<br/>
- Provide Applications Info -- The ability to send the application information associated with applications within a given category.
<br/>
- NDS Download -- The ability to send the application data down to the NDS given an application id.
<br/>
- PC Download -- The ability to browse the database and download an application to the local PC.
<br/>
- Provide Application Info -- The ability to send the application information associated with a specific application id.
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Some is already working, some not so much.  Once we get all of that stuff working, we'll start on the 0.2 features of which, we have quite a few of those as well.  Once we get the new svn dev site setup (sf.net) feel free to download the source and submit changes..  The more people that help out, the faster these features will be available.

<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly, at this time, it isn't going to have a loader.  Just a downloader.  But, we've already been discussing it, as I think it would be a lot better to be able to download and play than to have to reboot to play.  So, maybe someone with more loader experience can help out with that part.
<br/>
<br/>
But, what would be the benefit of the loader patching at runtime?  I guess if you swapped cards between devices, but you'd still need a version of SLURP patched for each device.  Also, you would then be "stuck" with using a loader that was either A) SLURP, or B) supported patching at runtime.  Where if the files are patched during download, you would be able to use the loader provided by the device, or any loader that didn't support patching at runtime.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is somewhat of a tangent, but was inspired by the idea of having NDSHBHive patch homebrew with its own DLDI driver. I don't mean to hijack the topic, but now I'm wondering how difficult would it be to have a stand-alone app that acts as a DLDI-patched patcher that uses its own DLDI driver in memory to patch another file? Or a DLDI extractor to take that DLDI driver from memory and save it (although this would probably piss off some of the flashcart makers that don't release their drivers)?
<br/>
<br/>
The reasoning behind this is for flashcarts that do auto-patching, but don't offer a driver for manual patching. The ability to DLDI patch homebrew on the DS itself then becomes rather handy for apps that act as loaders but don't autopatch at runtime. In the future, if everything works like NDSHBHive is intended to, it won't be necessary, but we still have a need for manual DLDI patching now.
<br/>
<br/>
I see applications for all the major OS's, but not for the DS itself, which would be the same for everyone. The idea the NDSHBHive could do it on download or even load has really made me think about this. Is it something worthwhile?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I think its worthwhile, sometimes I forget to patch homebrew, and I'm already on the go, or just don't want to take the trouble of going back to my PC and getting out my card reader, etc. Also, with my supercard, different SD cards will require either scsd.dldi or scsd_moon.dldi, if I wanted to swap files between cards, I could forget the correct patch more often.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

If you have programming knowledge, you could easily look at the source of BHive or DS Organize and see how they patch, and write a stand along patcher if you like.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's been a long time since I've done any programming, let alone C (which I never really had a proper introduction to and went straight to C++). I do want to get into DS programming, though. But all I have is game ideas and I don't know the basic "nuts and bolts" of DS programming yet. The most I've done for any console is reverse engineering save files for the PS2 Armored Core games (which is another project I haven't touched in years and never truly finished).
<br/>
<br/>
However, this does seem like a good place to start. I can't promise any actual results or anything like that and if someone did it, they would probably have it done before me. But this could certainly be a good learning experience. If something working comes out of it, I'll be sure to put it out there.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
