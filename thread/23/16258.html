    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The latest and perhaps, greatest work from Sander Stolk and LDAsh - Ulterior warzone (which was known for some time as RTS4DS) has begun to take shape into what looks to be an excellent real time strategy game. Anyway, they have just released a tantalising wallpaper contains a heck of a lot of juicy screenshots to enjoy.
