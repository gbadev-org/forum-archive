    <h4>#123678 - GrizzlyAdams - Fri Mar 30, 2007 5:40 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone, I've not officially announced it yet here, so incase theres anyone who doesn't frequent the IRC channel.... Here is my current project:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://grizzly.thewaffleiron.net/dualchannel/" target="_blank">DSChannels</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://grizzly.thewaffleiron.net/images/dualchannel2.png" target="_blank">Screenshot</a>

<br/>
<br/>
Its a clone of the Wii channels menu, on a smaller scale, with some artistic license taken. Right now its main purpose is to launch NDS files. Each program should have an 80x48 pcx icon in the qlshell/icons folder for it (not many icons have been made yet!) Soon I'll add a feature to load the icons from the same folder as the nds file, and also to load icons from within the nds file if all other attempts fail. I've got to recreate my source images for the skins because I recently had my primary hdd fail.
<br/>
<br/>
This should work for most cards, Don't bother reporting here that it works unless someone has already reported it doesn't. I'm interested in bug reports, so send away! Also, just so everyone knows, it doesn't have pen input yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Future plans:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Slot 1 / Slot 2 booting (Reboot to loader on card, or to a game)
<br/>
</li><li>Settings menu
<br/>
</li><li>Download channel (a separate app, usable on its own or together with DSChannels)
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
For now DSChannels only indexes nds files under the /Applications or /Apps folders on your card. You should be able to nest a level or two deep, but keep in mind that will increase scanning time at boot, and you cannot ever exceed the pathlimit of 255 characters (240 to be safe) including slashes and periods.
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff being worked on now:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>New font code for icon labels &amp; other misc text
<br/>
</li><li>Text console hidden while loading .nds files
<br/>
</li><li>INI file for various settings.
<br/>
</li></ul></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by GrizzlyAdams on Sat Mar 31, 2007 5:25 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

The Download Play is another story, and certainly some people would miss that. But the lack of Download Play didn't stop FW Nitro from releasing. At some time in the future when it becomes possible to either pull out the Download Play function from the original firmware, or create a homebrew replacement, then it could be added. But in the meantime I am sure that many people wouldn't mind the temporarily loss of the function considering the advantages this would have over the original firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SC-CF here, DLDI patched it (SCCF.DLDI) and renamed as "_BOOT_SC.NDS" (using your 1.7a firmware).
<br/>
Turned my DS on and got white screens. Turned it on holding L and got to the SC's menu, opened the DSChannels.nds.
<br/>
No problems with date and time at all. Just Moonshell has a icon showing, because none of the others have them in \qlshell\icons. Could i make GIFs or PNG-24s?
<br/>
Firstly, nothing booted, as it couldn't find \qlshell\drivers\sccf.dldi, so i deliberately renamed \qlshell\dldi folder as "drivers"
<br/>
Of course i have all aplications at \apps folder.

<br/>
The thing is: i can boot only bjoern's DSFTP and ReadMore. The other freeze in "loading ARM7 binary" after some debug info on a blue screen.
<br/>
All of them are DLDIed, even the two above. I have to use unpatched ones?
<br/>
<br/>
Also could you add text showing what the selected buttons is? As only Moonshell has a icon, all the others have the "fixme" default button. Hard to find what each one does.
<br/>
<br/>
And please, make it work with the 1.7a firmware hack.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It makes sense to offer it as a firmware replacement.  People who want to use PictoChat and/or Download Play simply wouldn't use it, but for those of us who don't use them, it would be a nice replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, though, I'll be using it autobooted with chism's Supercard firmware hack, which I assume is why Grizzly put the work into porting the hack to other models of Supercard.  It'll be especially cool once touchscreen control is worked in.
<br/>
<br/>
One question, though, I haven't used it yet, but is it slow to load NDS ROMs the way DSOrganize and Moonshell are?  Those options take way too long to load a file to be really useful in my opinion.

You could just use this as your default launcher on your card (_boot_mp.nds / _boot_sc.nds) But its a tiny bit too large to use as a firmware replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly my opinion on firmware replacement is not to do it. Use flashme if you must, but nothing more. That way you retain WMB and Pictochat (no comments on pictochat's usefulness) Plus full control over settings.

If you care to read the previous posts (mine's and Grizzly's), you would know the \qlshell\dldi folder should be named "drivers".

If you use the "launch alternate" with DSOrganize (press Y instead of A) then it loads pretty fast, and I haven't found a peice of homebrew that doesnt work with Y button launching on my SCSD yet.

I can't say that touch screen controll will make it into beta5, but maybe by beta6.

The 0's being displayed as blanks was my choice, but I'll add an option to the new INI file for it.  I resurected my ini library I wrote a couple years ago, and it should make some stuff easier.

<br/>
Battery charge indicator is already there, its a green led / red led built into the hardware, putting an icon on the screen isn't much use, and I don't see why nintendo bothered. I will consider adding an option to put one in, but as useless as the battery life indications on the DS are, I'll likely default it to disabled.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You need both of these, beta5b is a update that disables patching of loaded .nds files.
<br/>
<br/>
Beta6 is in the works, with the loader reworked to use chishm's dldi patcher from his loader.
<br/>
<br/>
.SC.NDS loading only works on supercards currently, in beta6 i hope to get more cards usable thru the new DLMI interface I'm building.
<br/>
<br/>
A feature I want to have soon is the ability to flash gba carts from files on a slot1 card. Example: you have 4mbitcompo.gba on your r4, and your friend has a ezflash card, you can flash the .gba onto their card, and give it back to them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ooh! That sounds really cool! I would have liked to use this on my supercard with yours/chishms hacked firmware, but I like sound in my videos... I'll probably take a look at it if I buy another card or just wait for a 1.0 version.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, no. Its not possible.
<br/>
First of all they run entirely different code (I believe...)
<br/>
The 'OS' on your Supercard DS is doing a whole lot more in relation to the hardware than this program is doing.
<br/>
There are a few cards however that enable auto-booting of an .nds if its named specially (e.g. GBAMP uses _boot_mp.nds)
<br/>
There is a firmware hack for the slot 2 versions of the supercard (except rumble) that enables auto-booting of a _boot_sc.nds file, this was created by dumping and reverse engineering the supercard firmware (what you're calling the OS, its actually called firmware) One problem is that theres a bug, and its not being maintained anymore.

I replaced the exec_stub.arm7 and exec_stub.arm9 for those in the update zip.
<br/>
DSChannel.nds freezes, _BOOT_SC.NDS also.
<br/>
Purpusedly, i renamed the two splash pcx so i could see if there was some error or log running on background. Nothing, white screens. DLDI patch also changes nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Luckly, DSChannel_b4.nds still works with the new \qlshell.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Well, weird, it boots fine if i rename the \apps folder to something else.
<br/>
Weirder yet, using DSOrganize 1.7, i renamed it back to "apps", and miraculously now it works fine.
<br/>
I could even get DSOrganize.nds booting whe DLDI patched.
<br/>
<br/>
Now i'm afraid of use windows's CHKDSK in my CF, as i do periodicaly, and fix this "error".

I'm considering doing that with beta6, where it will first try to load the icon from the same folder as the nds, then the skin's icon folder, then the default skin's icon folder, then the nds file internal icon, then the default icon from the skin, then the default icon from the default skin. With a menu to choose the order if you don't want the default order. Settings menu should be fleshed out in beta6, and I think the skin layout will stay the same. Skin INI files will be fleshed out soon too. And a skin chooser W/ preview.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to add some sort of scripting langauge and expand what can be customized. I've not settled on ECMAScript (JavaScript/ActionScript) or LUA yet but they are currently at the top of my list since I've used each in the past. An example of what could be done thru scripting: Dreamcast startup logo, Amiga Insert Disk animation, etc. Simple animations that require just moving a sprite around the screen, possibly with a trail left behind (as is the case with dreamcast).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to add a "micro" mode soon which just has 32x32 icons (like they are now for no icon found) and more icons on screen at once.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What I kinda meant was that every program that wanted customizable  directories could use the same file, called something like paths.cfg, and it would have its own syntax for paths, etc. Users could edit the .cfg themselves, or the programs could edit them when the user uses the settings menu in the program.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">//File paths for nds binaries

<br/>
_user1 = "/games/quake/quakeDS.nds"         proprietary paths *\

Obviously proprietary paths for other programs could be things like locations for resources, etc.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm still working on DSChannels, and plan to release a new version soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Heres a quick status update:
<br/>
<br/>
I ported a GUI library (depui) to make fast work of dialogs etc.  Created three new skins, with work still progressing on them.  Working on custom desktop backgrounds, and skin animation features.
<br/>
<br/>
New channels:
<br/>
RemoteChannel - mythremote updated to use alot of code from DSChannels, and working on xmbc support.
<br/>
DownloadChannel - a feed reader of sorts, subscribe to a feed from your favorite nds homebrew site, and you can download the latest versions of various apps. DLDI patching built-in (with option to disable).
<br/>
PhotoChannel - just what you think it is, still in very early stages (requires custom written jpeg / png decoder that scales an image on the fly without need of a slot-2 ram card).
<br/>
ExampleChannel - a quick example of how to write a channel app, and some guidelines on user interaction.
<br/>
<br/>
New config interface:
<br/>
Choose which loader (theres 4 now), skin, dldi &amp; dlmi drivers, and more to use.
<br/>
<br/>
Loaders:
<br/>
Chishm's loader (runs on arm7, doesn't work with R4DS/M3DS currently)
<br/>
exec_stub from previous release of DSChannels
<br/>
dsgstub from previous releases (requires a slot-2 card with ram)
<br/>
gbamp (requires a gbamp patched with chishm's patch)
<br/>
<br/>
Dynamicly Loaded Memory/Media Interface:
<br/>
Drivers to access / unlock features of various cards. Few written currently, similar to how dldi works, but runtime patching so users don't have to run another tool on their pc before installing the app on their card.  Used for loading GBA homebrew onto cards such as the supercard, m3, and ezflash slot-2 adapter families.  Also used by the dsgstub for folks who can't get the other loaders to work (dsgstub &amp; gbamp loaders are worst-case pray it works)
<br/>
<br/>
Hierarchal menu system:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
WinterMute is working on argc/argv (passed command line) support in libnds, and once thats ready I'll be adding file associations to DSChannels.
<br/>
This will allow you to associate files with specific applications, roms with an emulator for example.  To help with situations where multiple applications use files with the same extension but different formats, I'll be providing a way to limit associations to specific folders.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
fat0:/AppleII/*.dsk  and fat0:/Commodore/*.dsk
<br/>
(this is purely an example, and I don't even know if any commodore emus use .dsk images)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The next release of DSChannels won't happen till all of the following happen:
<br/>
WinterMute releases his argc/argv update, and any other changes he asks me to wait for.
<br/>
I'm satisfied with the number and quality of accompanying channel apps &amp; skins.
<br/>
DSChannels itself is ready for the public.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

-Beta 5 won't work for me at all. Freeze at Splash screen also. Deleted everything in the qlshell folder except for the images (Since I made myself a custom skin) and replace everything including the files from the 5b.zip. Still stuck on Splash screen, even tried DLDI patching.

-Moonshell, Image Viewer won't work. Freeze after a flood of codes.

<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I have noticed that, however, it now scans everywhere (including a folder with files that are decidedly not DS homebrew), making them showing up as ? marks on the index. Is there any way to only scan ROOT:/Applications, etc? It's kind of an eye sore to see files that I can't boot from the DS Channel. :/

So far, most things have worked after I've manually patched them all and renamed the driver in the "qlshell\drivers" folder to "cevo.dldi". It rather defeats the purpose of auto-loading, but it works where DSOrganize and Chishm's loader both fail. I even replaced Moonshell as the main loader app on one of my MicroSD cards.

Download it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cyclopsds.com/downloads/CycloEvoDLDI_v1.1.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. There have been quite a few changes from the last file released, most notably:
<br/>
<br/>
    * Now contains full SD init code. This means it will work with both standard and SDHC MicroSD cards, and it should work with homebrew executed via WMB (untested) or other alternative loading methods, allowing you to completely bypass loading through the CycloDS Evolution GUI if you wish. We've personally tested the driver by loading homebrew from slot2 CycloDS, which works fine.
<br/>
    * Various workarounds are included to enable support for the various ways in which 3rd party loaders use the DLDI driver. Its been tested to work with DSOrganise (Chishm loading method only), DSChannels and Chishm's standalone loader.
<br/>
<br/>
This is the same DLDI driver which is included in the new v1.2 BETA #3 firmware. Unless you're not using CycloDS Evolution to actually load your homebrew (which would be the case if you're executing code via WMB) then you dont actually need to manually patch anything, even in the case of 3rd party loaders.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I've tested it with Chishm's NDS_loader, DSOrganize 2.9, and DSChannels Beta 5. NDS_loader and DSO launch and run without issue, but apps launched from DSChannels can't read from the memory card unless they are manually DLDI patched. Considering that DSO seems to permanently patch what it launches, all that needs to be done is launch them from DSO once and they'll work. And once DSChannels uses Chishm's loader, it will probably be a moot point anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking about such an app earlier. I'll probably never get around to using these ideas:
<br/>
1) The buttons don't have to be rectangular. Your skin provides two 256x192 bitmaps, one where all the buttons are up and one where they're all down. Also, there's an INI file or similar that defines the location of each corner of each button - you can have any number of corners, so as to have cool hexagonal buttons and so on. Think HTML image maps or OpenGL.
<br/>
These bitmaps might also have transparency, and you could have a background image on another layer below them.
<br/>
<br/>
2) The menu can occupy more than 256x192. If you touch and drag, it scrolls around. So you can put your most commonly used programs on the part that shows up at first, and more off-screen. Dragging wouldn't require holding a button, just moving the stylus at least X pixels, where X is just enough to prevent it scrolling accidentally when you touch an icon (ideally defined in a config file).
<br/>
Going with the separate background image idea, you could choose whether you want the image to scroll with the menu or stay put.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, and the option to have a random theme at startup is a must. :-p<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
