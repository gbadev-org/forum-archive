    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">UPDATE: Binaries now available! <a class="postlink" href="http://ds2key.googlecode.com/files/DS2Key.rar" target="_blank">Download Here</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Recently <span style="font-weight: bold">cualquiercosa327</span> contacted me with an interest in adding adapters, such as the <span style="font-weight: bold">Guitar Hero Grip</span>, to my DS2Key application. I spoke to him saying I had lost all the server source code, which would make it impossible without recoding everything again to add these features. Long story short with some help from cualquiercosa327 I have almost completed the server and client working with all old features of DS2Key, and I've added the Guitar Hero Grip feature. I'm not going to release binaries until I feel that it is polished enough for the normal user. Although I am asking if you are able to compile it from the <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/ds2key/source/checkout" target="_blank">SVN</a> to please give input on what features you would like to see. If anyone would like to help with this project simply get the source from the <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/ds2key/source/checkout" target="_blank">SVN</a> and either post your changes or send them to me directly. Any help including bug reports would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Current Status</span>
<br/>
The server <span style="font-weight: bold">(PC side)</span> is either a GUI or console window (only console in Linux for now). It runs off of configuration files it generates when it first needs to use them. You are able to edit them by hand if you're using the console version. At this point it's undocumented, but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out the codes if you're able to compile it, just read through the source code a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
The client <span style="font-weight: bold">(DS side)</span> has a simple GUI at this point. tapping the top left where you see a <span style="font-style: italic">badly drawn</span> rotating gear you can edit the settings, which are also saved. To edit the settings just tap "[Edit]" next to the setting and it'll bring up a keyboard, pressing enter when you're done editing will take you back. You'll have to change the IP for sure the first time, the default is 0.0.0.0 which is invalid for everyone. Then press "[Done]" to go back to using DS2Key. at the bottom right corner is a cursor image, tapping that will lock the screen back lights on, and you'll be able to use the mouse or mouse buttons, tapping it again will deactivate this mode.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #00FF00">Complete:</span><ul>
<br/>
<li>Action Buttons (Normal button input, a, b, left, right, etc)
<br/>
</li><li>Exact Mouse movement (Touching the middle of the touch screen sets the cursor on the middle of the PC screen, etc)
<br/>
</li><li>Mouse Touch Screen buttons (The screen is divided into having 12 buttons working similar to the normal buttons)
<br/>
</li><li><span style="color: #00FF00">(New)</span>Guitar Hero Grip buttons (All four buttons act the same as the normal buttons, but have their own settings)
<br/>
</li><li><span style="color: #00FF00">(New)</span>Mouse Clicks (Left, right, and middle buttons)
<br/>
</li><li><span style="color: #00FF00">(New)</span>Linux Support (All functions work as they do in Windows now)
<br/>
</li><li><span style="color: #00FF00">(New)</span>Windows GUI Support (Very friendly GUI :3 )
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<span style="color: #FFFF00">Planned:</span><ul>
<br/>
<li>Relative Mouse movement (Similar to a laptop's mouse pad)
<br/>
</li><li>Profile Toggle Function (Press or hold a key to switch to another profile)
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<span style="color: #FF0000">Known Bugs:</span><ul>
<br/>
<li><span style="color: #FF0000">(Squashed)</span>Mouse input doesn't cover entire screen -- deadzone borders need to be made for the touch screen.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="color: #FF0000">(Squashed)</span>GUI log is disabled -- log caused lags, disabling command logs should fix this
<br/>
</li><li><span style="color: #FF0000">(Squashed)</span>Setting mouse button clicks in the GUI doesn't work -- mouse clicks actually work, just setting them up in the GUI doesn't
<br/>
</li><li><span style="color: #0000FF">(is anyone geting this problem?)</span>After changing the IP on the DS, the server ends up sending /p? repeatedly -- restarting the DS makes everything work fine
<br/>
</li><li>Setting GUI log to "All Messages" causes lag. This log mode is mostly for testing your connection, just switch the setting to something else and it will run lag free
<br/>
</li><li>Arrow key settings actually send numpad arrow keys, or numbers, depending on numlocks status
<br/>
</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>Pixels have feelings too.

To compile the linux version you'll need <span style="font-weight: bold">libXtst</span> installed. To do so in Ubuntu: open a console and as a  as root user type <span style="font-weight: bold">apt-get install libxtst-dev</span>. After that cd into <span style="font-weight: bold">svn/DS2Key.Server/DS2Key/</span> and type <span style="font-weight: bold">gcc -lXtst -O2 -s config.c key.c main.c -o ds2key</span>. After that you should be able to type <span style="font-weight: bold">./ds2key</span> and enjoy native Linux DS2Key goodness. About the errors, I'm really not sure, tell me if you still have them with the Linux version, and I'll help you then if it's still needed.<br/>_________________<br/>Pixels have feelings too.

Read the post in the news section, the server's hard drive failed and the database has been rolled back to a backup made 5 days ago.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
