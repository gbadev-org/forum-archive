I get white screens the whole time, but at first the light blinks very slowly, and then the screen does something (just a flash, like it updated or something) and the light starts blinking faster. I'll see if I can find an email account that doesn't use SSL to try it on.

kvasir,

that is correct, you have to rename the ds.gba file to .nds.

<br/>
<br/>
another UPDATE: I *do* have the app and cfg file in a folder other than the root directory, maybe this is my problem? right now its in /Apps/NDSMail, I'll move them to the root directory and see if that works.
<br/>
<br/>
YET another update: that was it ;)  I have to have the .cfg file in the root directory, I can run NDSmail from any other folder and as long as the .cfg file is in the root directory, it will find it.
<br/>
<br/>
Update Quatro: I'm having the same issue as Mithos with my mail account, the account is provided by my ISP (rr) and uses POP3 without any sort of special connection (TLS, SSL, etc.) I appriciate what you've done so far Bronto, this will be a great app that I'll use constantly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow! Definitely wow! One day has passed since the TCP-enabled wifi-lib is out and we already get a really promising looking mail client! Definitely keep it up!
<br/>
<br/>
I have done some testing: Read/write works with GBAMP, except for the fact that the lines that contain the ports are omitted, which makes a written config file invalid. Also, I had the problem that the last character of each line was cut off. The problem was that i was using Unix-Style line breaks (only LF, not CRLF). Maybe you should add supprt for that, but it's only a detail.
<br/>
<br/>
The connection to the AP seems to work (the program starts up without errors). I have tried four POP3 servers. Unfortunately, I could not fetch mails from any of them. Here's the results:
<br/>
<br/>
web.de: Stuck at retrieving message headers
<br/>
gmx.net: Stuck at closing connection
<br/>
my university's mailserver: Stuck at retrieving message headers
<br/>
my website's mailserver: Stuck at retrieving message headers
<br/>
<br/>
I think this should not be too helpful. Maybe you could add some debug output to be able to diagnose the problems better. I'll be glad to do further testing.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, awesome job so far! I'm absolutely looking forward to checking my mail with my DS.

HAHAHA, yeah. Actually I dont think I had any mail on the server at that time, I tend to clear stuff out, so that may have been why. It's retrieving mail that I've already read now, which is good. I even sent a message to a friend successfully! When going to reply though, had to re-enter the mail addy -- it just shows the name of the person in the address box. If I try to erase part of it, the actual address in &gt; and &lt;'s shows up, I'm thinking you know about that though ;-)

I think you missed his point. You need to use a different SMTP (outgoing) server.  Your current SMTP server does not allow you to send mail to Hotmail accounts.  Your friend does not need to change his email address.  Typically, your ISP can provide you a SMTP server that can be used to send mail msgs to anybody...  Some web space provider offers the same, but usually you have to enter an user name/password.  Do you use Outlook Express or other-mail-client on your PC?  If so, which SMTP is it configured to?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You can set up the feeds you want to read in the settings / feed settings menu. NDSMail also looks for a file called ndsmail.fed in the flash card's root directory. ndsmail.fed is a text file, each line contains the URL (full URL with <a href="http://" target="_blank">http://</a>) to a RSS or ATOM feed.
<br/>
To download the feeds, press on the &lt;Inbox&gt; button in the main screen to switch to &lt;Feeds&gt; mode, then press Receive.
<br/>
Please note that I did not disable the New/Reply buttons in feed mode yet, pressing them will give unpredictable results.
<br/>
I added 2 feeds as defaults so you can test it right away.
<br/>
<br/>
Bug where settings file got corrupted should be fixed (can't test it)
<br/>
<br/>
Shows status while connecting to access point
<br/>
<br/>
Some mail display bugs fixed
<br/>
<br/>
Many more things I can't remember

Note that most bugs with incomplete/corrupted messages are because of a bug in dswifi which will be fixed soon.

- correctly converts some tags like &lt;br /&gt;, so mail/feed display is a lot nicer.
<br/>
- file writing probably did not work at all in 0.40
<br/>
- better error handling / access point reconnect
<br/>
- default settings in nds file, so users without filesystem support can hex-edit their settings
<br/>
<br/>
For those who are waiting for SSL, it will not happen before the release of a new version of dswifi.

I'm working on SSL and multi account capability at the moment. I'm not sure how to include it best into the user interface.

What about this:
<br/>
I change the &lt;Inbox&gt; (&lt;Feeds&gt;) button to a button or drop down list that lets you choose an account/feed you want to display. 
<br/>
Or should I put all Mail/Feeds in a "global" mail folder, and let the user mark the accounts for which email is always received in the settings menu, and extend the Receive button to a drop down list where the user can chose between "Receive all","Receive:bluebottle" etc ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does that mean you might keep it the same how it is?

I highly suggest the divider
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">or</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I have another idea just incase the divider is not possible!
<br/>
<br/>
In the feeds screen, after you download them, have them into separate feed "folders", and when you open them up, it displays the feeds from that blog
<br/>
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">-http:// FEED WEBSITE NAME HERE- (<span style="font-weight: bold">click this to view all entries from this feed</span>)
<br/>
-http:// feed website name here-</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

both of these are good ideas, the divider, or the "folders"<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

UPDATE!

found another bug in the feed area. long addresses seems to cause problems when trying to recieve feeds. i had two xanga feeds in there and the one with the short name worked and the long name caused all the other feeds to not work too. and when u go to the feed settings the long address doesnt show up on the list either but when u recieve feeds it shows up as one of the feeds. i think its something having to do with the long address being longer than the one line display in the feed settings maybe like if its longer than what can be displayed it wont work/?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Changes:
<br/>
- Uses latest dswifi version

- Improved connection code - should be faster &amp; more reliable now
<br/>
- Put keep-ap-connection-alive function back in

- mail display slightly improved
<br/>
- asks you if you want to save your settings when leaving the settings screen
<br/>
- reply button disabled for feeds
<br/>
<br/>
As you certainly noticed, progress is a little slow lately. I'm quite busy with other things at the moment, so no SSL yet. I would probably need about 1-2 free days for a first version. I'm planning to make it available in some way to other DS developers once it's done :)

many feeds only only include the first 4-5 lines of the message, for the rest you have to visit their website.

RSS and Atom are both ways of getting information, such as news, from a site.  Take <a class="postlink" href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a> for example.  They have an RSS feed, so if you entered that RSS feed's URL into ndsmail, it would download all of the news items from drunkencoders.  If you keep that feed, then whenever you clicked retrieve (or whatever the button is), it would download all of the new news items from the site.  So, in summary, it's just an easy way of getting news from a site.
<br/>
<br/>
SSL is a way of securely transmitting data over the internet.  Since it's "encrypted", so to speak, it's a bit more sophisticated then normal internet traffic and thus it's not really supported by the current wifi library for the DS.  Since gmail requires you to use SSL to connect to their email servers, you can't access your gmail account through ndsmail.  I don't think this is compatible with yahoo mail, unless you can find a way to access your yahoo mail through a POP server, which yahoo disables for their free accounts, i believe.
<br/>
<br/>
As for online content, just about anything you could ever want to know about has an RSS feed or an Atom feed (note that the two terms aren't interchangeable).  To sign up for it, all you do is enter the URL of the feed into a feeder, such as ndsmail.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just tried the latest NDSMail on my Original DS, SCSD, Passme and but unfortunately it no workee.
<br/>
<br/>
I've just had a quick search through this forum regarding my router (WRT54G), and it appears there is a bug in the wifi lib that stops them from working.  NDSMail boots fine, but when it tries connecting to the access point I don't think it ever receives an ip via dhcp.  I'm going to try it tonight using a static address to see if that fixes it.

Yahoo wont let you because Yahoo doesnt support Pop3 without having you pay an extra $$$ (I think).

Don't edit them!
<br/>
Place NDSMail.sc.nds anywhere on the miniSD and run it. First, it will ask for FAT support. Click 'Yes' and then go to the settings - you can change everything there.

the problem with the font is that the ds only has a limited display resolution. So if I used a bigger font, there would fit less characters on the screen and you would have to scroll around a lot. Personally, I think the font is a good compromise. What do the others think?

    <h4>#89715 - Red XIII - Mon Jun 26, 2006 1:27 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well...
<br/>
<br/>
1)About the kinda tiny font,you could always use the other font,the bigger one,that you use for your tabs (eg Receive,New,Reply,Settings etc).I think that's big enough.
<br/>
<br/>
2)When you mention that you will have to scroll around a lot when using a bigger font,you surely mean it will happen when viewing feeds,right? So,I think I've got an idea:
<br/>
<br/>
3)The way it presents feeds is not very practical,I mean seperators are good for feeds with not many posts ,but if you have a site like ign or revo-europe,with over 50 feeds,it becomes an enormous list that needs constant scrolling.Scrolling is not 100% accurate,either.So,how about using tabs instead? One tab per feed. Simple and practical.
<br/>
<br/>
4)I think it would be better to have two different tabs &lt;Inbox&gt; and &lt;Feeds&gt; to switch ,instead of one.
<br/>
<br/>
5)In the mail settings menu,the field where you type "25",you know,next to where you type the SMTP server,is kinda out of place,not in the same line.
<br/>
<br/>
6)I use a SC SD,and it's kinda annoying selecting yes,to enable FAT support,every time I start NDSMail.Can you do something about it?
<br/>
<br/>
7)There is a bug in the "manage email accounts" menu,when I touch and hold the stylus inside the account window (but not selecting one) a part at the top of the screen becomes white,covering my accounts.When I stop touching the screen the fat white line disappears.
<br/>
<br/>
8)The scroll bar is not very practical,please make it bigger and give it a little more room to the left.
<br/>
<br/>
9)When downloading feeds,something like "Received: 536 (total 8568) bytes" appears. But the feed's total size of bytes is actually the bytes you've downloaded so far,so how about getting the feed's total size before downloading,and then showing it in a downloaded so far/total size format,eg 8568/12000 or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
10)When I've downloaded my feeds,next to the feeds tab it shows "61 mails(1 new)". This should become "61 feeds",or even "61 feeds from 4 sources",or something better.
<br/>
<br/>
11)Bug: Sometimes when I receive my emails,the I switch to feeds,I receive my feeds,then when I switch back to my inbox, "ERROR: mail can't be displayed (RM02)" is displayed.
<br/>
<br/>
12)When I receive my inbox, some numbers appear in the top left corner of the upper screen,when the download is finished a "X -11992" is displayed there. When I touch the screen it's gone.
<br/>
<br/>
13) As for gui,you could always have nicer tabs and window outlines,but ssl comes first.
<br/>

It works great with gmail. I haven't had any problems other than the hundreds of debug messages. Bronto, could you compile the latest version without the debug messages, and maybe with the FAT dialogue somehow disabled or something (maybe a seperate fat enabled version).

web based email, like Hotmail, uses a different protocol than POP3, called IMAP. I don't know the difficulty in writing in IMAP support, but he'd have to add support for that protocol before Hotmail worked, but the added benefit would be support for numerous other web based email solutions.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

<br/>
<br/>
I've got a DSL with a M3 slim SD and i can run the .ds.gba file perfectly (.nds doesn't boot). I just tried the application again 10 minutes ago.. It had trouble finding my router or something, but it did grant me acces to the mail &amp; feeds.. When i tried to download the feeds the app froze and i rebooted my DS.. 
<br/>
<br/>
The m3 always makes a back-up, but this time the screen had weird colors &amp; glitches.. I couldn't see anything of the whole m3 interface.. Lucky for me i know the interface by head and i managed to change the interface style back to the orginal.. I deleted the mail application, but now i can't open all my maps on my m3... My DS keeps freezing when i try to open certain maps.. JIPPIE!!
<br/>
<br/>
When i try to delete the map that makes my DS freeze windows tells me that the map is damaged and can't be deleted. The SD-cart also keeps creating new ndsmail.cfg, ndsmail.fed &amp; ndsmail_ssl.ds.gba files (all 0 kb).   Can't delete them either..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using what you released last night (the one with less debug messages).
<br/>
<br/>
Have trouble with it freezing. It always occurs on text entry with the keypad and stylus. I'll be typing letters and all of a sudden it will freeze up, with the last letter I hit stuck in its redish highlight.
<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky and was able to set up a new entity, and put in all the gmail settings before it froze, and it receives mail very nicely.
<br/>
<br/>
(Update: Apparently it can crash on any button press with the stylus -- not just when typing letters into the keyboard)
<br/>
<br/>
(and for reference I'm using an M3 SD adapter)
<br/>
<br/>
Update 2: If I send a test message to the gmail account, grab it with NDSmail, and restart the DS, I cannot again retrieve that message. Are you telling it to only get what hasn't been read yet? Is it possible to save downloaded messages locally to the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any plans to allow the deleting of messages off the server or locally off the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Is the "Do you want to use FAT" window supposed to come up every time when starting NDSmail?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, just have to say thanks man. This is the sole-reason I spent money on the passcard and the GBA cart and SD card. I live and die by email, and this will help me out a lot.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ThetaDot on Mon Jul 03, 2006 4:35 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Configuring other mail clients
<br/>
You can use the following information to configure POP with many mail clients. If you encounter difficulties, we suggest contacting your mail client's customer support department for further instructions.
<br/>
<br/>
Incoming Mail (POP3) Server - requires SSL: 	pop.gmail.com
<br/>
Use SSL: Yes
<br/>
Port: 995
<br/>
Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - requires TLS: 	smtp.gmail.com (use authentication)
<br/>
Use Authentication: Yes
<br/>
Use STARTTLS: Yes (some clients call this SSL)
<br/>
Port: 465 or 587
<br/>
Account Name: 	your Gmail username (including '@gmail.com')
<br/>
Email Address: 	your full Gmail email address (username@gmail.com)
<br/>
Password: 	your Gmail password
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that if your client does not support SMTP authentication, you won't be able to send mail through your client using your Gmail address.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not really. As I understand it, SMTP-AUTH largely consists of sending the account name and password before the headers. I just wanted to have all the info in one place when the developer gets around to reading this topic.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Good job Bronto!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: the programm also froze.. but who cares, i can send emails via my DS :)

Edit3: wow so many edits.. well better then then triple posting..
<br/>
for some reason ndsmail is only able to recive emails which have not been sent by ndsmail o.O or is it my imagination.. i tried to recive emails from my gmail accoun, whose inbox was full of unopedned test-messages i wrote from my ds.. and ndsmail wasnt able to recive them..
<br/>
even tried the 0.46 version, but didn't work either.
<br/>
but when i sent an email from an other email adress to my gmail account nds got it perfectly..

321 emails here! though... that might have been a mistake... now I've gotta figure out how to get GMail to ONLY allow pop3 on certain e-mails, I'd like to keep some notifications off my DS... too bad NDSMail doesn't allow for tags like Gmail... though perhaps folders?

I am having the same problem as dragonman.. I can use Tetris, Mario Kart etc with my router without problems with or without WEP, and some other homebrew Wifi apps like SylphIRC, however ndsmail stalls at acquiring DHCP. I haven't tried other routers yet, so it could be specific to our linksys routers (dragonman- do you have a linksys?).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try this:
<br/>
Get the latest firmware update from Linksys
<br/>
Backup your settings.
<br/>
Apply your backed up settings.
<br/>
<br/>
I found that the router needed to be shaken around a bit for the new firmware to start to work :)
<br/>
(It works great with homebrew now, with WEP and everything!)
<br/>
<br/>
I'd recommend using a static IP in the DS's settings, though.
<br/>
To do that, just use the Wifi config in an official online game and tell it to not manually acquire IP address.
<br/>
The WRT54g will automatically to DNS stuff, so just set your DNS to the gateway IP. (Generally something like 192.168.1.1)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I'm guessing it's something with SoftAP, since we both have the same DS configuration.  I would try setting your DS's wifi settings up manually, though.<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SSLConnect is just a debugging flag he probably forgot to remove. 
<br/>
<br/>
32 (plus 10) is the meaning of life, the universe and everything. 
<br/>
<br/>
32 alone and by itself is almost that, except that instead of being the meaning of life, the universe, and everything, 32 means that we cant read HTML emails (such as gmail's emails), so he probably left a flag there as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
Until a basic HTML parser is written for NDSMail, you can access GMail and send email, and even receive it, you just wont be able to read it... for now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Welcome back!  I just started using this program and have a few questions or possibly additions to your todo list.  
<br/>
<br/>
Are you implimenting a "Reply All" function?  I tend to send/recieve a lot of group e-mails among friends and this would be usefull.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, are there plans on working out the crashing bugs that happen when using the touch screen?  Supremely frustrating when half way through an e-mail.
<br/>
<br/>
Great program though and I look forward to upcomming releases.  Thanks for developing this!<br/>_________________<br/>DS Lite, M3SD Slim, Flashme V7, SanDisk 1GB SD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was wondering is this application supports Hotmail accounts and if so how i would go about configuring it to do so.

Finally can you read mail from more than one account at a time or do you have to individually log into each account.

Also, can you re-upload the test file? It seems to be down...
<br/>
<br/>
I heard on other forums that .jpg/.gif support is implemented in NDSmail right now, is it? Or is it in the test file labeled as "among others" in the changelog?
<br/>
<br/>
somebody that has it, Please re-upload, and answer my JPG question :D

<br/>
so you have something to play with while I am away next week.
<br/>
<br/>
If you click on "Save Mails" on the second button-page (yes, I will change the design), all mails and news items are saved to files on the flashcard in a convenient XML-file. Configuration file is now XML too.
<br/>
<br/>
Some things to note:
<br/>
- SSL is broken at the moment, at least on my NDS phat / SCSD..
<br/>
- "Delete" button has no effect
<br/>
- when adding a new mail account, don't leave any fields blank, or saving will not work
<br/>
- some strange bug (I think it has to do with the compiler, but I am not quite sure yet) causes the buttons in the settings screen to appear in a different color
<br/>
- please ignore the "can't read ... file" messages, sometimes fread() returns incorrect values (0 although data is read)
<br/>
<br/>
other changes include new keyboard, new FAT lib, new wifi lib, new devkit and many more..

<br/>
<br/>
I have been playin around with your latest release and I have noticed a few things and also have a question.  My setup is in my sig:
<br/>
<br/>
* When I make a New e-mail I can't see the 'send' button or anything above the keyboard for that matter.  It is all black, but if I touch where the 'send' should be it works
<br/>
<br/>
* the Outbox does not clear itself, so everytime you check your mail you are sending your entire outbox again
<br/>
<br/>
This may all be obvious to you already as it was a quick release for the fans ;) but I thought I would point it out.  
<br/>
Question: when I boot up NDSMail I get the folowing for the (Inbox, Outbox and Feeds)
<br/>
<br/>
"Folder file could not be opened!"  followed by
<br/>
"Error in folder: no root node"  Anyway to fix this?
<br/>
<br/>
And finally a feature request for down the road.  "Reply-all"  I send a lot of group e-mails and would love to see this feature one day.  Cheers.  I really appreciate the program.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Lite, M3SD Slim, Flashme V7, SanDisk 1GB SD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
it's been some time, but I am finally finishing a new version of NDSMail.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Please no posts to the news sites yet, I will notify them when this version proves to be stable.
<br/>
</span>
<br/>
I'm not even sure I remember everything I changed, but here are the main parts:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
- dropped Palib, now using a new library based on libfb
<br/>
- attachments (only jpg for now, but you will soon be able to save attachments to your memory card)
<br/>
- all settings and mails are stored in XML files now
<br/>
- many improvements to stability
<br/>
- updated libraries
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
NDSMail now uses libfat which supports DLDI to support more flash devices (eg. EZ4)

The problem is that the setting has to be stored somewhere. And the only reasonable way to store settings is the fatlib. But as almost all devices are supported by libfat now, I think I can remove the question soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
it's been some time, but I am finally finishing a new version of NDSMail.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Please no posts to the news sites yet, I will notify them when this version proves to be stable.
<br/>
</span>
<br/>
I'm not even sure I remember everything I changed, but here are the main parts:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
- dropped Palib, now using a new library based on libfb
<br/>
- attachments (only jpg for now, but you will soon be able to save attachments to your memory card)
<br/>
- all settings and mails are stored in XML files now
<br/>
- many improvements to stability
<br/>
- updated libraries
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
NDSMail now uses libfat which supports DLDI to support more flash devices (eg. EZ4)
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Working well with my DS-X. (mail and feeds recieved, emails replied to fine) Like the menu button movment at the bottom.
<br/>
<br/>
Any plans to keep the Inbox/Outbox etc files in a folder off the root rather than in the root as now? Would be handy to keep everything tidy.
<br/>
<br/>
Some issues:
<br/>
<br/>
-Why does it always as you to enable fat support, can it not tell if you have already said yes? (or have I got a logic loop, in that it can't tell unless it check the drive...and it can't check the drive 'til FAT is enabled?)
<br/>
- Loses mail/feed count on restart
<br/>
- if more than 9 feeds posts/emails the number spils over the box
<br/>
- long email addresses spill over to the date field
<br/>
- My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-xtra.com/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;feed=atom" target="_blank">wiki's Atom page</a> goes a 404 and caused the feeds count to go to -1 (seems to be the &amp; is being dropped by the app)
<br/>
- How about jumping the active selection down to the body of an email when replying rather than to the first field as is now?
<br/>
- Outbox count doesn't clear even after message has been sent
<br/>
- what's the limit on email size? SOme large text emails just say "ERROR: mail can't be displayed RM01)"
<br/>
- Download an email, delete it, stlect transmit, the deleted email doesn't come down again. But if you restart your DS the deleted email comes down again.
<br/>
- red marks on the upper screen when you edit a feed
<br/>
- url on lower screen is on top of the keyboard image when editted.
<br/>
- you can't edit to the end of very long feed URLs (again my <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-xtra.com/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;feed=atom" target="_blank">wiki's atom URL</a> for example)
<br/>
- How about using R&amp;L buttons to go up/down list of emails?
<br/>
<br/>
(hate me yet? feel free to ignore some/all of the above as I know it's a beta)

Update
<br/>
<br/>
Issues:
<br/>
- Loses mail/feed count on restart
<br/>
- long email addresses spill over to the date field (so do long subject lines)
<br/>
- Outbox count doesn't clear even after message has been sent 
<br/>
- Large emails give message 'Press A to download' when you press A my DS freezes and I have to reboot. Then when you view message it gives "ERROR: mail can't be displayed (RM01)" 
<br/>
- Download an email, delete it, select transmit, the deleted email <span style="font-weight: bold">does</span> come down again.
<br/>
- When replying default focus is the sender's email address, should really be the body of the message.
<br/>
- My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-xtra.com/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;feed=atom" target="_blank">wiki's Atom page</a> goes a 404 and caused the feeds count to go to -1 (seems to be the &amp; is being dropped by the app)
<br/>
- You can delete your feed accidentally by going to the settings section, pressing edit..then pressing edit again. 
<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions
<br/>
+ How about a Delete all button?
<br/>
+ Store the mailbox files in a subfolder rather than root
<br/>
+ How about confirmation that messages have been sent?
<br/>
+ How about encrypting POP password?
<br/>
+ How about an option for authenticated SMTP (so I can send emails while out and about back through my mail server)
<br/>
+ Add a confirm delete box in settings
<br/>
+ How about trimming an atom feed that's too big rather than just dropping it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-xtra.com" target="_blank">http://www.ds-xtra.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i found a workaround to making gmail work. i dont noe if this was already mentioned (i didnt read the entire thread - 35 pages wtf?!). gmail allows you to forward all incoming mail to another email and ndsmail allows you to retrieve email from other non-ssl pop email server...get where im getting at? you make gmail forward all incoming mail to another email service that offers pop access (no ssl) and you check the latter service with ndsmail. i use lavabit and it works. now i can check for myspace/facebook comments on the go :)
<br/>
EDIT - you can also use gmails rss feed (https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom) - i personally haven't tried it. tell me how it goes :)

ps - i have a question about the feeds part of this program. i can retrieve feeds and it saves to my flash card okay. the thing is whenever i start ndsmail again, its hangs up trying to load the feeds! any solutions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And as soon as the general public figures it out, Microsoft has every right to patch it not to work, by patching the Hotmail backend to change the protocol and then patching Outlook to work with the new protocol.

Given that Gmail only allows 20MB file size for attachments, I'd ask you... Why in heck do you have 140 20MB files in your email?

Plus, theres this nifty firefox extension that <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> have the ability to help you out. I think its called Gspace; it lets you access your account space with an ftp-like interface.

<br/>
<br/>
Also, once i have used it and created the /INBOX file, when i re-turn on the DS, i can't connect to host (<span style="font-weight: bold">Connect(): could not resolve host name</span>), unless i delete the /INBOX file and redownload everything.
<br/>
<br/>
If i redownload a attachment named "photo.jpg", it stores a copy called "photo.jpg_". Why not "_photo.jpg" or even prompting if i want to overwrite or skip it?
<br/>
<br/>
The /NDSmail/ folder is a nice touch indeed, please move the ndsmail.xml, inbox, outbox and feeds to it.
<br/>
I can receive a *.ICO file as attachment, you think i could do so to MP3, NDS and such?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, great update, this app is everytime more usable, you are great!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But how long will it keep working? Does anybody remember the cat-and-mouse between proprietary instant messaging networks and the developers of Trillian and libgaim (now libpurple)? How quickly are <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freepops.org/en/files/html-manual/node7.html" target="_blank">the plug-ins</a> brought up to date?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i don't actively use it now but when i did it was pretty solid and well designed.  it's been around awhile and it still is supporting yahoo, only service i can attest to.  yahoo has that new ajax beta they launched, but you can still access the normal interface.  i can say that yahoo's format hasn't changed much over time, and when they had a small change it was rather quick to pick it up..  it's worth messing with to save the cash i think.
<br/>
i didn't run it on a home pc - i pay $10/m for a virtual private server.  i'd open a freepops up but i know how word spread on my ship (aircraft carrier) with a webproxy i told 5 friends about -- hah.  and i only get 100gig/mo =)
<br/>
most ISPs are only anal about port 80 though.
<br/>
again, just a notable mention. i believe it's the best software out there that provides this service.  i remember trying Mr Postman on my home windows PC. it has a small GUI probably more user friendly.  supports fewer providers but it has the big ones.  looks like it uses Java now (or did it always?)

I have a nintendo DS lite (bought one month ago, don't know the firmware version) with a ttds flash card (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndstt.com/english/index_en.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ndstt.com/english/index_en.htm</a>) and a Netgear dg834g router. The network has no WEP protection.
<br/>
Untill now never had problems with wi-fi homebrews (beup, bunjalloo, dsmaps and dsorganize works perfectly) but nds mail is not working. When trying to connect (it says ACQUIRINGDHCP) I get the "Could not connect to AP" error, and when I click ok I get another error when trying to initialize FAT library ("Error in folder file: no root node") for three times (same as reported here: <a href="http://www.martin-kremer.de/forum/index.php?topic=61.0" target="_blank">http://www.martin-kremer.de/forum/index.php?topic=61.0</a>).
<br/>
I tought it could be a problem with writing on my flash card but never had any similar problem with other apps or games, and NDSMail is able to create a ndsmail folder with an attachment subfolder and the ndsmail.xml file with the settings I entered.
<br/>
I can't manually DLDI patch the .nds file because the ttds has DLDI auto-patching and there's no DLDI device patch file for my card.
<br/>
What can I do?

Disabling WEP is your only option. The security provided by WEP is fairly meagre (although it might deter people from trying to use your wireless if yours has WEP and the neighbour's has nothing). If you want you could enable MAC filtering, which, while not foolproof, is better than nothing.<br/>_________________<br/>I've got nothing to say, but it's OK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
