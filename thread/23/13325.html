    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need headphones, a rubber stylus or big speakers to appreciate this. :D  Two crash cymbals, two hats, two snares and three kicks are on the touch screen for you to play with.  Enjoy.  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix</a>  It now has a decent GUI.  Don't worry about DLDIing it, either; It loads the whole thing into RAM for the sake of being able to boot it and remove it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by NeX on Fri Jun 08, 2007 11:01 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice work! I just love the responsiveness of this app. Samples sound great too. It is a bit quiet though, like you said I had to hook the DS to an amp the really enjoy it.

<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey!, this is an awesome program bro...im pretty crazy about percussion and have been waiting for something like this for a long time, something responsive to tap to as i am constantly tapping everything around me 24/7. All i can say is that this is awesome and please keep this nice piece of homebrew going so it can be up there with the likes of dso/beup etc etc...lololol im really happy about this program bro LOL so just keep making it better, maybe tyhings like...which you have probably already considered adding in the next release-
<br/>
<br/>
-Some recording function.
<br/>
<br/>
-Ability to tap symbols 'singulary' at the same time (even though you can do this by tapping in the middle of the symbols, I cant even begin to imagine how fast i could make beats on this if i was using two stylus's and tapping the symbols sigularly, so please add this function...if u know what i mean)
<br/>
<br/>
-Ummmmm....maybe some yummy visual overhaul, even though i dont really care about how it looks the beats,quality and responsiveness of the sound is all i care about, im sure your going to make it look prettier anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
-Basically make it as close as possible to what real drums are, and any other candy you can think of
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks brother this is so awesome man, hope you continue working on this forever. Cheers!!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking of having recording.  And, one of my early ideas was to have a Venn diagram type thing where you could press two at once, but that doesn't work with very many drums.  I'm kinda busy with StrumMe at the moment, though.  :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you get it working by using libfat to load RIFF WAVE files from an FCSR image on the GBA card, then those of us using e.g. R4 or SuperCard can use the DLDI for their card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's kind of the point of FCSR and it's associated DLDI.
<br/>
<br/>
Does the EFA burner app attempt to "fix" the GBA header when you write your image? The standard .nds image *should* work if you can stop it from "correcting" the header.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
