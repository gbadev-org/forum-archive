Description:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Negative Space is a homebrew puzzle/platform game for the NDS, based on the concept of negative space. 
<br/>
<br/>
The whole game contains only two colors: black and white. The player controls two 'blob' characters: the white blob moves in the black space, and the black blob in the white space. That's why, empty space for one blob represents solid ground and walls for the other. 
<br/>
<br/>
The aim of the game is for each blob to capture its corresponding flag. In order to do so, the player can draw directly on the touch screen in black or white and thus modify the levels and create new paths and platforms. But keep in mind that a new path for one blob means new walls for the other! </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whoa, I like the concept.  Downloading now.
<br/>
Edit: Just beat level one.  It took a while for me to understand how to play, I suggest you add an instructions page before the first level.  I liked the quote at the beginning even though it was a little hard to read because of the font... but this is a great game.  I don't understand why the "ink" runs out so fast, though.
<br/>
Edit #2: Nevermind, the ink is enough.  It's just a matter of being smart with it to pass the levels.  And BTW, the level design is genius.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I got to level ? "This level is possible, this is not the end." 
<br/>
Is it really possible?  I don't see any flags and there's no way to paint, so what's left to do?
<br/>
Also, is there a way to save..or does it just save by itself... or not save at all?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This concept was already made, but a game based on it is hella awesome.
<br/>
I remember a page and it's goal was to make 300 game concepts. The first of them was this, the second of them was adding a "grey space", either as a block for both or a space for both.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not saying copying was done, or even its wrong if it was.
<br/>
Just curious how sometimes one idea catchs on and everyone does their own variation.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
