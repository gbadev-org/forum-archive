    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MCTool has just been updated to version 0.16. This is mainly a bugfix release, although it offers a couple of new features as well.
<br/>
<br/>
MCTool is a program to fix the errors and sort the entries of your media cards straight from the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Changelog:
<br/>
- Added ability to choose how to repair every single error.
<br/>
- Added automatic repair mode.
<br/>
- Added MC switch feature.
<br/>
- Display detected flashcart.
<br/>
- Wait for all keys to be released upon initialization.
<br/>
- Patched double files count when verifying.
<br/>
- Tested and added new SC Lite driver.
<br/>
- Cleaned up code.
<br/>
- Started development of a GBA version (which will not be released soon, so don't ask! ;)).
<br/>
- Compiled with new devkitARM r20.
<br/>
- Other bugfixes I cannot remember :).
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to read the README, as it has been updated with tons of info!
<br/>
<br/>
The program is released under the GPL. Please report any comments/bugs/appreciations :). E-mail is the preferred way, as there are too many forums out there and I can't read them all!

<br/>
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM MESSES WITH THE FILESYSTEM OF YOUR MEDIA CARD, WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN A DATA LOSS. THEREFORE, BEFORE USING IT, ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP OF ANY IMPORTANT DATA.

Wouldn't 'Homebrew an.' be a better place for this?

<br/>
MCTool works great for me. It's a how some carts list directories in inconvenient ways.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also more convenient than using fatsort.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So it might be an issue of the cart!?
<br/>
<br/>
With my M3Simply checkdisk for the 2 GB microSD card won't work.
<br/>
After pushing X (Check media card) the start message appears followed by an error message 'Read 1979740 bytes at 1997312:Not enough space' and the app freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
With which cart(s) it works fine for a 2 GB SD card? 
<br/>
And how could that be, because the limitation is the memory of the DS...?

Is it easily possible to add <span style="font-weight: bold">free space</span> to the informations you already show?

Btw, what about the support for 2GB and 4GB memory cards?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is the first time I've had this particular problem with homebrew. Anyone else?

I had the same problem with my SCLite with exception that it did not get rid of the files but threw out all files that were in a sub-directy where I keep homebrew. Hope it is fixed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
