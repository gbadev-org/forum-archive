    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In my CS class at my university last semester, we learned C by programming for the GBA.  For one of my projects, I took the sourcecode from a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.zumodrive.com/share/6l0OTFjZT" target="_blank">GBA WinS demo</a> and greatly expanded upon it, firstly to make it much faster, and secondly to add user input so that different visual effects could be generated.  I turned it in long ago, but continued to work on it for further improvements.  I eventually installed DevKitPRO and ported it to the DS for speed purposes, then made a version that could rotate around the center of the screen with the DS's additional horsepower.  Finally, I made a small branch-off program that creates a starfield on the DS screen, with variable speeds.

And an animated .gif image of one of the coolest (in my opinion) effects you can generate with the rotation-enabled DS binary:

All four binaries can be downloaded here:  <a href="http://www.zumodrive.com/share/6kWNWI2OD" target="_blank">http://www.zumodrive.com/share/6kWNWI2OD</a> - simply click the "Download" link on the right side of the screen.  The ReadMe.txt file explains the controls and offers some suggestions for interesting designs.

<br/>
Constructive criticism is greatly appreciated.  I know it's not a cool game or anything, but it did take a lot of work to make and I think it's a fairly interesting visual effect at the very least.  Would people be interested in the sourcecode at all?  I'm more than willing to release it, though it would take me a bit to clean it up for ease of understanding.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
