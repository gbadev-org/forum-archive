<br/>
<br/>
I just took a look at your blog page...
<br/>
<br/>
Are those screens supposed to be from the game?
<br/>
<br/>
Just asking, because unless my memory is shot to hell and gone, those screens look like they're using graphics from the classic SNES jRPG ChronoTrigger...
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, those screens and the dialog in question would be from the opening few minutes of CT. The only change seems to be that Chrono's mother has been replaced by a purple dude...
<br/>
<br/>
Which could get you in trouble with Square...
<br/>
<br/>
I may be wrong, but if this is the case...
<br/>
<br/>
Gah, someone tell me this is an early prototype or something, or a mock-up...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Gah, curse my eyes. I didn't notice the one important line in your post. The line in bold. My bad. Bizarre that I missed the one line I should have read :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, from the looks of the video the engine has been well put together. Looks just like an SNES engine (Compliment :P) I especially like the typewriter style text that has become almost standard. I'm still getting used to the way that the DS/GBA handle sprites and it looks like you guys have it down pat with your engine.
<br/>
<br/>
"Did you prepared for the ceremony?", "Did you saw her?", along with a lower case i when Valkan was referring to himself. Those were some grammar errors I saw. Sorry if you were aware of them, but I just wanted to make sure you knew before you released a build or something.
<br/>
<br/>
Your story was pretty cool from the get go. I like the beginning with the Strange Voice guy, it upped the mysterious factor.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: gray">The lone Wolf howls, driven by pride he presses on.

In fact, my english is quite dirty (i'm french). The engine is quite advanced and allow many manipulations now.
<br/>
In fact, the begining dialog will be probably changed due to the official scenario release next week.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the engine script example for the demo :

<br/>
<br/>
At the begining, there was a unique entity without form , but with a soul. This entity was call Hann. After weeks, hann decided to create his own desires, throught 6 creators.
<br/>
<br/>
(The creators BG is fully detailed in french BG)
<br/>
<br/>
Oxana, Malarh?a, Dioxis, Equishene, Ferwen, M?liador.
<br/>
<br/>
All this creations was called to "Order".
<br/>
To equilibrate the world, Hann created chaos, the exact opposite of the actual world.
<br/>
<br/>
During 1000 years, each one of this god created 6 race.
<br/>
<br/>
(The same, they are fully detailed in french BG)
<br/>
<br/>
After wars between the jealous chaos and pure gods, the 6 creators diseapered, abandoning 6 artefacts on earth.
<br/>
<br/>
Every 2000 year, a special planet alignement allow powefull wizards to open a gate to chaos world.
<br/>
This one try to spread on Kirya (the actual world) and to take it's vital energy. As the prophecy says, every 2000 year, a man is choosen to fight them.
<br/>
He is the descendant of the first man who received from Hann itself the power to send chaos back to shadow world.
<br/>
<br/>
As i sayd, the french one is really fully detailed. The scenario takes place when a brother and his sister are going to the ceremony to open the gate to shadow world.
