    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm here to introduce you to my latest homebrew, StillAlive DS, now in version 1.1 !
<br/>
(edit : now in version 1.15s :p )
<br/>
(edit? : now in version 1.2)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">About :</span></span>
<br/>
StillAliveDS is a puzzle game inspired by Portal: The Flash Version which is a 2D renewal of Portal, developed by Valve Corporation.
<br/>
Portal consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the character and other simple objects by using a Portal Gun. The unusual physics allowed by the portal gun are the emphasis of Portal.
<br/>
<br/>
You can download the game here : <a href="http://stillaliveds.free.fr/index.php?page=download" target="_blank">http://stillaliveds.free.fr/index.php?page=download</a>

I have played it for a while and I like it a lot! :^)

There were some problems in the first version, and I'll make sure I'll check the new version out asap, hoping that you have fixed them. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways: Thank you for this game! :^)
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Please, rework the controlls. I have posted suggestions in the old Portal DS thread.

Great the level editor is in the DS now!

Just the wifi is a problem for me, because I have only the Nintendo connector. But I'm trying to modify that so I can use the wifi for homebrews.
<br/>
<br/>
Something would be good is the possibility to evaluate the maps ( 0 - 10/10 for ex) so we can see which map is the best :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have not yet tried the level editor though, and my internet connection is hidden, so wifi is a little tricky. I have to unplug my router for 10 seconds and then plug it back in and sync my DS to it at the same time, because that makes it display for a couple seconds (don't ask, I accidently found it when my xbox live went down and I was coincidentally searching for a way to make my wifi work, and have no idea why this works, lol). Awesome game though, with a rather frusterating last level =).<br/>_________________<br/>w00</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
. The editor is also nice thing, i uploaded my first map today (ApertureChamber1 :)) 
<br/>
aaah this is so great game, i hope you will make another great things :)
<br/>
And one request...can you add an Acid element? For making traps and that sort of thing :)
<br/>
However, great game, keep going! :)<br/>_________________<br/>Red dwarf and Futurama Fan!!!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, about add new features, I would like to see a second plasma ball system: you have one green thing which creates the balls (like now) but you can have more than one red thing, so to open the magnetic wall, you have to unlock all red things.
<br/>
The green thing stops creating plasma balls when all red things are unlocked.
<br/>
How do you think?
<br/>
<br/>
Also I finished all advanced level without downloading the last upgrade... (you mean in your last news twe can now finish the level 11 in advanced mode)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#158946 - t4ils - Sun Jun 22, 2008 6:46 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you finish advanced level with the first 1.1 release ? very good then ^^
<br/>
<br/>
As someone told me it was very hard, I decided to play it again
<br/>
I realized that the turret which is located in the end of the level (just before the finish line) was almost impossible to kill (didn't find a way to, you don't have time to reach it and it kills you).
<br/>
1.0 version was possible because the character was more slippery on the floor. In 1.1, you don't have enough speed to reach the turret and grab it.
<br/>
<br/>
So I decided to move the turret a little so that you can grab it without being killed :)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">edit :</span></span> KillerMapper, your idea has been placed into the game :)
<br/>
Now you have to activate all red switches to deactivate the green energy wall (switch already pushed disappear)
<br/>
<br/>
Also two new blocks in the level editor :
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- Acid element</span>, which place some acid on the map (don't touch it or you're dead). It's animated so that you can make something like pool :)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">- Rotating razor wheel</span>, which kills you if you touch it (can be placed everywhere)
<br/>
<br/>
All these features will be present in a future version :)
<br/>
<br/>
You can suggest me ideas if you want, I'll see if they are good and I'll probably put them in the game :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#158952 - JLsoft - Mon Jun 23, 2008 3:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Having 45 degree-angled blocks (normal and un-portal-able) would add a lot more possibilities to level-building, and then making it so that the player slowly slides down when standing on an incline could lead to some nice time-critical portal-throwing/jumping being required.
<br/>
<br/>
...but being able to place portals on these angled surfaces &amp; handling the physics correctly might take more work than it's worth in the end. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#158962 - KillerMapper - Mon Jun 23, 2008 11:20 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">45? angled could be good yes :)
<br/>
Great for the new plasma system!
<br/>
<br/>
And for the lvl 11, I just run and take up the turret to kill it on the ceiling. But it was hard to make it, my life was very low after ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Ha yes I have another suggestion: a fence wall, player can create portal shooting trough it (no portals on the fence) but the player himself can't pass trough the fence. So we can have separated places in a level.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: ha yes, in the map editor, can you add the possibility to save a map without finishing it? Because if I start a difficult map and have to stop playing DS, I have to restart it after. So my idea is the possibility to save a map, but this can't be sent on the wifi or played until I continue and finish it.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the rotating razor wheel is making the job you ask (or almost :p )
<br/>
You can shoot portals through it but you can't pass (it kills you)
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you want something that doesn't kill you
<br/>
<br/>
concerning 45? angled blocks, this is something very hard to include in the game, because I have to find how to place a portal on it (and change the game so that you can pass through it), and I also have to redefine how the character moves on these special blocks
<br/>
<br/>
who nows, maybe one day ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I just succeeded in mapping custom controls :)
<br/>
A nintendo DS icon takes place on the menu, you touch it and you can change controls
<br/>
When you leave, they are saved on the flashcart
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to make something for the saving feature, maybe upload only from the editor, so you can save whenever you want, you have to finish the map to have the "upload" option enabled

I thought about it a little while taking shower ( :P ) and it will be in place tomorrow :)
<br/>
This will be a Red energy wall
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't require a lot of work at all, I just have to add the new tile in the level editor and a new type of collision.
<br/>
Then I have to tell the game to ignore this collision when I shoot a portal, and to take it in count when I move around the map :) (will be the same behavior for other objects (crate, turrets, plasma ...) since they all use the same checking collision system)
<br/>
<br/>
Another idea I had, which i'll probably make tomorrow also : a platform that moves around the level !
<br/>
You select it in the editor, you place it where you want, and when you play, the platform moves left/right at a constant speed.
<br/>
You (and objects) can step on it :)
<br/>
<br/>
should be a great feature I think ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
In advanced mode it's even more xD
<br/>
<br/>
Also I see there are stats for each level (steps, portals, time). Will you create a chart on your site, and add a feature which allows to send our stats?
<br/>
Something like this in the wifi mode, the player select send stats (for ex), and write his nickname, and the DS send the infos on your site!
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make the best time in some levels (not advanced) ^^
<br/>
In level 4 I take 2"683 seconds to finish the level, and the lvl5 I take 4"500 :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.mariokartsource.com" target="_blank">www.mariokartsource.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
And i have one more idea...larger maps :) On the topscreen, there would be little map instead of that wires :) The map size would be adjustable,  maximaly 128x96 or some multiple of the current map size :)<br/>_________________<br/>Red dwarf and Futurama Fan!!!!

Hello everybody :)
<br/>
<br/>
The wait is over once again, as the 1.15 version is now available in the <a class="postlink" href="http://stillaliveds.free.fr/index.php?page=download" target="_blank">download section</a> ;)

Here is what's new : 
<br/>
<br/>
[Level Editor]
<br/>
+ 5 new elements (see below).
<br/>
+ Grid (press select to hide/show).
<br/>
+ You can save your map when you want
<br/>
+ You now have to upload your maps through the level editor. Only possible if the map was finished.
<br/>
+ New clear button which deletes everything on screen.
<br/>
+ The "Build" feature is automatically called when you save/upload a map.
<br/>
<br/>
[Game] 
<br/>
+ red energy wall : you can shoot portals through them but can't pass.
<br/>
+ razor wheels : These will kill you if you touch them.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
[Menu]
<br/>

<br/>
+ customizable controls : just click on a control to change the associated action.
<br/>
<br/>
[Other]
<br/>
- Backgrounds are now loaded from the flashcart
<br/>
- Updated EFS lib to V2.0 finale, maybe G6 and M3 will load the game now ...
<br/>
<br/>
Please report me any bug since this version was hard as hell to finish, I had some weird punctual glitches like the upload system that just stopped working one time ...
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy :)

I've been trying to amass a large collection of levels just to mess around with at 5 minutes at a time (which seems to be all the time I have some days), and one at a time is a bit... tedious. It would be nice if they could be on an FTP site which would allow mass downloading, or... something. Perhaps direct download links rather than the .php scripting that's currently in use (programs like DownThemAll, and other download managers can't get through that).<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life
