    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a logo I'd like to work on in colors.  I've scanned it to PNG and moved to the microSD card.  But it's not "seen" by Colors - I assume because it's missing the .drw file.  So how can I create a .drw file to do this?<br/>_________________<br/>tempus nunc est</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First make a blank .drw file by clearing the screen and saving. Then <span style="font-style: italic">replace</span> the .png file while not touching the .drw file. But I would watch out if you're planning to upload your image to the gallery, as playback always starts from a white canvas, and if any of the .png remains in the final drawing, they'll know you traced an existing .png image.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
