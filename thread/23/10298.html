    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Changes in this version:
<br/>
- Added MP3 compressed speech support (although it can cause the games to slow down)
<br/>
- Fixed save path bug
<br/>
- Improved touchscreen accuracy
<br/>
- Fixed GBA flashcart reading bug
<br/>
- Fixed some graphical glitches
<br/>
- Fixed Loom save bug
<br/>
- Fixed another Loom audio bug
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this version fixes the issues people were having with ScummVM 0.6.  You still won't be able to write to disk properly using the M3 SD.  On the other hand, you can play without choosing a save path, and GBA flash carts work much better.

Mr Picklesworth, are you playing the CD version of loom?  I tried that myself just now and it works fine.  You do remember that there's a black screen after you select the skill level for about 10 seconds while some audio plays?
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could copy v0.5 over to your card and check if it still works.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by agentq on Wed May 17, 2006 12:13 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I been testing alot of games with mp3 and i can say that it's not that many that play to smoth mostly Indy 4, Simon (DOS version) games don't work any good at all in mp3 .. same goes for sam &amp; max .. i did talk to agentq about  puting mp3 support with Audio CD games as loom, indy 3, monkey .. ect .. games that use Track1.wav .. should use Track1.mp3 .. it will take a while cuz he's bussy right now with more important issues but it will be there some time in the future .. or faster if more support and interest is shown ;D  Also Stereo audio would rock too ;D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh yeah it does. The German voice actor of Simon sounds so motivated xD
<br/>

Okay, it works now, although Simon sounds a little drunk due to the compression, and when I use uncompressed sound effects together with compressed music, the speed loss is bearable. Touch problems also seem to have vanished, at least as far as I have tested.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using a flashme'd DS and Supercard CF. With version 0.5, I can make the ds.gba fle and rename to .nds. Alone it does not load. If I make it with MOnkey1 included, it'll run, detect a CF reader, and allow me to run any game that I put on the CF card in directories (so I don't have them in the nds file itself).
<br/>
<br/>
I can't do the same with 0.61. It'll only pick up a virtual directory, as it were, of what is in the nds file. Anyone had this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#84630 - agentq - Tue May 23, 2006 8:23 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">kassidy, you need to take the .ds.gba file from the archive, rename it to .nds, and then run it on your Supercard.  Ignore all the zip file stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
You should then be able to pick files from directories on your CF.
<br/>
<br/>
If you use the zip file method (which is meant for cards that are not directly supported by ScummVM DS), it will use the game in the zip and ignore any present on the CF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#84643 - Bas - Tue May 23, 2006 9:59 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Trying to get Secret of Monkey Island to run on my M3 mini SD... It runs, but two weird glitches.
<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, I can start the .nds file with both A and Start, seems to make no difference, if that helps)
<br/>
<br/>
- First, sound isn't working. I had the tracks as mp3's, which didn't work, and then converted the tracks to wav's as described on the website, and dropped them in the monkey directory, but still nothing. Is there anything else I should do? Should any of the ScummVM audio settings be changed?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Wait, I checked the debug info (any way of showing that in the top screen on a black background?) and it says "wave file is in the wrong format, you must use IMA-ADCPM 4-BIT mono."  Pretty sure I chose that, but I'll check. ScummVM DS tells me it's 16 bits.. And 22khz. I'll try again and see what happens.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2: Got it working now, turns out cdex doesn't apply the settings you entered when converting mp3's to WAV files, and just turns everything into 22KHz 16 bit stereo files. Converted some audio files with soundrecorder (teehee) and now it works perfectly. Default audio settings, in case anybody is wondering.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 3: *sigh* Turns out it didn't work. I can get the intro music and the ambient sounds on the docks, but no SCUMM Bar music, no Lechuck theme, nothing. Debug info just says "Playing somethingsomething.wav: failed!"
<br/>
<br/>
- Second, seeing how like most people here I keep having to add the game to ScummVM every time I boot, I notice that eventually, the folder containing the game files disappears. It just doesn't show up in the list. I added other subfolders next to it, and they work fine, but the game directory is just gone. I have to copy the files to a different dir, and then they work. Anything that can be done there?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: When I put the game directory in the root of the SD, it doesn't seem to disappear. However, after a couple of copies to and from the audio files in that dir, ScummVM DS told me it couldn't find any game data. Had to copy all files to a different dir for it to work again. Weird.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit 2: more info: copying stuff from the nonfunctional directory 'monkey' to a directory 'x' and then deleting 'monkey', and renaming 'x' to 'monkey' does not help. What does help is simply renaming the dir to 'monkey1' or something. Bizarre. Also, if the dir doesn't work, and I open it in ScummVM, it shows another subdirectory with the same name, which in turn contains all the dirs in my root (monkey and scummvm). So I can the following directory: "c:\monkey\monkey\monkey\monkey\monkey\". It's the same dir, but for some reason ScummVM thinks it contains itself, or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#84655 - agentq - Tue May 23, 2006 11:08 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I know what your problem is with Cdex.  When you rip the CD, you must choose 'Extract CD tracks to a compressed audio file', and NOT 'Extract CD tracks to WAV file'.  Since, in this case, the compressed format selected in the options is ADPCM WAV, if you get my drift.
<br/>
<br/>
Saving on the M3 is dodgy, because the FAT driver is still early.  That will be the cause of the corruption to the SD card you are seeing.  ScummVM DS has an alternative save method which uses GBA save RAM.  You can save to this, and then use the M3 boot menu to save the GBA SRAM to the cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Just create a file on your flash cart in the root directory called scummvm.ini (or scummvmb.ini if you're using build B).  Put the following text inside it:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">[ds]
<br/>
forcesramsave=true</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If this works, ScummVM DS will print a message to the console after you start your game letting you know that SRAM is being used.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also a way to get around having to add the game each time you boot.  Just manually add the game to the scummvm.ini file and stick it on your SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to add a section like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">[simon1talkie]
<br/>
description=Simon the Sorcerer 1 Talkie (English (US)/Windows)
<br/>
gameid=simon1
<br/>
language=en
<br/>
music_driver=windows
<br/>
path=mp:/SIMON
<br/>
platform=pc
<br/>
subtitles=false
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
You need to get the gameid, language, path, and platform exactly right for this to work.  These are displayed on the screen in the menus when you add the game in the ScummVM DS interface.  Add a secrion for each game, and they should appear in the list when ScummVM DS starts.
<br/>
<br/>
You can have as many sections in your ini file as you like, and they can be in any order.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure what exactly made it work, but I copied and modified the .ini file that someone posted on page 2 or three of this thread, and ran it with that. Now I can run it with full music and SRAM saving.
<br/>
<br/>
For future reference, if anyone else is looking for answers:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using an M3 mini SD with Passkey2. (Shouldn't matter, but still) Firmware version E18.
<br/>
<br/>
I copied ScummVM to the SD card using the M3 Game manager: No trim, Fast boot, 1xDMA, and software reset selected. (Will experiment with this later.) I'm not sure if it helps, but at least it created the NDSSAVE directory and .dat files for SRAM saving.
<br/>
<br/>
My scummvm.ini file is as follows:

agentq, maybe it's a good idea to list some of the settings in this ini file and what exactly they do? I'd like to know, for instance, if it's possible to set the bottom screen to scrolled all the way down (so you can see all the verbs) by default on game startup. Also, I'm not sure what to set at "versioninfo", but it seems to work like this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

daninski: Building on OSX should be easy - you just have to append the zip fil on the end of the .ds.gba file.  Any program that can do that will do the job fine.

Of course, if you're using a CF or SD reader you don't need to build a zip file at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, there. New user of ScummVM DS here. First off, wanna say thanks for making it possible to enjoy these games on my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having some problems. What a surprise!
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm using:
<br/>
-Nintendo DS (firmware ver.1)
<br/>
-PassKey 2
<br/>
-M3-Perfect slim SD
<br/>
-ScummVM DS A ver.0.61
<br/>
<br/>
And I've been trying to play Sam &amp; Max. Works great until the point after I examine the fish magnet. When the map pops up, an error message shows up saying:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Failed to load game state from file:
<br/>
samnmax.c26</span>
<br/>
<br/>
And then I can't select anything on the map... I don't think it's a problem with my copy of the game, since ScummVM for Windows works fine past this point...
<br/>
Can anyone help?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, having the INI file seems to cause the game to freeze, no matter what. ScummVM DS boots up fine, but Sam &amp; Max won't when I have the INI file in the root (shame, too, as I'd like to at least not need to re-add the game every time!).
<br/>
So, as things are now, I can't even use SRAM... Bugger.<br/>_________________<br/>[bpmΩ]

I had exactly this same problem, on exactly the same hardware. Except I'm running it on the latest original firmware version... There's something strange going on with the ini's. Try copying the exact .ini file I posted above, run ScummVM, add Sam &amp; Max, and see if it'll run and if SRAM saving works. If that happens, try editing one of the games in the .ini to Sam &amp; Max and try again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So, I typed in the full path names, and it worked fine! Woot!
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I was already using your INI as a base for mine. It's just the directories that was screwing it up. :)
<br/>
<br/>
And now that it can save to SRAM, the game doesn't lock up any more!
<br/>
Though, there is an odd pause here... but, at least it doesn't freeze!<br/>_________________<br/>[bpmΩ]

It doesn't show subtitles in the Windows version of scummvm either, even if activated. Any clue whether subtitles were possible in the original game? AFAIR, the postcard was the only thing which you had to control the game; okay, the hardware settings, but I'm not sure whether you could use subtitles there...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MaHe, quitting doesn't work currently in any version of ScummVM.  The PC version just quits back to Windows when you hit quit.  The code to return cleanly to the game select screen just isn't there.  If they fix this, of course, it will make it into the DS version eventually.
<br/>
<br/>
thundrestrike, Curse of Monkey Island won't ever work on ScummVM DS.  Not only is there the problem with memory, which might or might not be solved at some point using the extra RAM in the M3/SC, there is also the issue of the screen resolution.  I don't know how I would ever scale the 640x480 image down to 256x192 in any acceptable way.  There's also the CPU time, Sam &amp; Max is pretty slow at some points, and COMI uses a lot more CPU time than that.  There are reports of it being pretty slow on the PSP, and that's got maybe 3x the CPU power of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Dan2552, if the subtitles don't show in the PC version of ScummVM too, there's little I can do.  If they say the subtitiles are missing on the CD versions, then they're probably right.

Playing Sam &amp; Max all over again on my DS is just simply amazing.  I've also got Fate of Atlantis to play as well, and it was a fairly easy and painless process, I was very impressed that not only the music worked for both, but so did the voice acting!  Simply awesome.

<br/>
Anyway, I've now tried my hand at getting both the Simon the Sorcerer games to work, I've got both on cd which I bought a year or so back at Game (2 for ?10 I believe).  I've tried out 1, and it all seems to be working pretty nicely although it sounds like the sound file for when he reads Calypso's note at the beginning is corrupt (won't play) but this could be down to the CD rather than ScummVM DS.

For whoever asked what files are needed to be copied across to get StS to work, I copied Effects.VOC, GAMEPC, ICON.DAT, SIMON.GME, SIMON.VOC, STRIPPED.TXT and TBLLIST all onto the SD card and that worked fine (don't forget once you've browsed to the game directory to then pick choose and to use the B build version of ScummVM).
<br/>
<br/>
However for StS2, I've tried copying the files from the Dos directory (similar to above except there was no Effects.VOC) and I've also tried copying the files from the root of the cd that looked relevant, however, I try to run the game and it just pops up with two black screens and the little mouse icon picture at the top.  Obviously I'm doing something wrong, so any help would be much appreciated!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I can't really help you with StS2.  It's possible it doesn't actually work.  I didn't try it, as I don't have that game, although the code is there to run it.  If you can't get it to work, I'll remove it from the compatibility list.  I'll have to look into why it doesn't work for the next version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Regarding the second game, I'm having trouble actually installing the game on my PC, so it could be the cd rather than scummvm not being compatible with it.  I'm using a back up, as all my original copies are back at home at the minute, so I'll have to try it when I get back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The note will be played when you compress the speech output to mp3 (at least when you bring it down to 8bps, which was the only thing that worked for me because my flash card is sooo small)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Keep in mind however that ScummVM can corrupt files and I had a bit of trail and error on figuring out how to save and keep files in tact...
<br/>
First, I put the game files into their own folders and (through Windows) marked the folders and files inside as read only. I did this because Loom's files kept getting corrupted whenever I saved. I did the same for Steel Sky as well. 
<br/>
My folder list looks like this:
<br/>
4_Apps (where I put homebrew as well as the ScummVM.nds.gba roms, I renamed these to A_ScummVM.nds and B_ScummVM.nds for the two types)
<br/>
as well I have another folder
<br/>
ScummVM
<br/>
+ within this folder I have
<br/>
  BASS (Steel Sky files in here)
<br/>
  Loom (Loom files in here duh)
<br/>
  SaveA (save games from using ScummA are put into here)
<br/>
  SaveB (save games from B are put here)
<br/>
As before, both the folders and files within are marked READ ONLY, in the hope that this prevents file corruption.. so far for me it seems to have worked.. 
<br/>
My ini files for both scummvm.ini looks like (make sure you have created a scummvm.ini and a scummvmb.ini text files to have this text)
<br/>
EDIT: As well, make sure both ini files you made are within the root of the miniSD

So far the only problem I had was in playing Loom after a while.. at some point it crashed and gave me the error that it was out of memory :-(  Guess I should have saved and stopped for a bit.. 
<br/>
I had to change ForceSramsave to false from true as that caused problems for me..
<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion for me what worked so far was the directory structure, keeping folders and files checked as readonly, and turning ForceSRAMsave to false, in order to save my games in both Loom and SteelSky.. 
<br/>
EDIT: I actually have had a problem in saving with Steel Sky.. seems you can not ever save within the pipe factory / store room sections.. just leave the area and save outside and that worked fine for me.

The SD version of the GBAMP won't work. The CF version is probably the best choice for ScummVM right now, because it has the best save support.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want something that uses SD cards, a Supercard SD is the cheapest (and in my opinion, best) option.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus you'll need a card reader for whatever type of media (SD or CF) you're using, if you don't already have one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The forceSRAMSave option will use GBA SRAM to save.  As GodNnelg said, this means it won't save to the SD card, and you must use the supercard menu to save the data to the card as you do with a GBA game.  It should prevent data corruption on your card though.
<br/>
<br/>
GodNnelg, setting the file to be read only won't help in the slightest to stop the corruption, but putting the saves in a separate folder to anything else may well help, as the corruption should only destroy the folder where your saves are.  Thanks for the info on BASS crashes, by the way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Calimero, yes, there is a size limit for a GBA save, and this is 64Kb.  The saves are compressed using an LZ-style compresson method, and I usually fit around four saves from one of the later Scumm games.  Older games seem to take less space to save.

I'm using an M3miniSD, and after reading through this thread finally got DoTT working perfectly. I'm having problems with the audio in Loom though.. It's horribly choppy and you can barely hear what they say most of the time.
<br/>
I did convert the cd-track to IMA ADPCM just like it says on the webpage, the file i get is 69.1MB. I also notice that the game seems to look for both a track1.wav and a track2.wav.. But i only have one audio track on my disc...?
<br/>
There seems to be people who have Loom working and i haven't seen any mention of horrible audio, so i'm assuming i'm doing something wrong.
<br/>
I also tried converting it to .mp3, but that just made Loom hang right after displaying the difficulty selection...
<br/>
So, any ideas? Broken encoder? Wrong mp3-settings? Bad karma?

For voices, the file needs to be either .sou or .so3 (wav or mp3, I believe...).

Freezing on the opening screen occured for me when I tried to encode the game music as mp3; currently, the music must be a very particular type of Wav file. (Don't worry, it still sounds good). Instructions are on Agentq's web page.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Actually, could you go into a bit more detail with the voice files? I'm looking at my Sam and Max folder right now, and there aren't any .sou or.so3 files.

Basically, you just put the .nds file on your DS and the games anywhere else on the card, and you can select them when you boot your DS.

parasyte, there is no support for the Supercard Mini-SD (unless it's exactly the same as the normal SD version) and that might explain why it doesn't work well.  You might want to try the forcesramsave option.  There are other posts in this thread that explain how to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  filozof, the stability of the SD card driver is down to when the remaining problems are fixed in the FAT driver.  I think there is some work towards this being done at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i only tested ScummVM DS v0.61 with MI2 so i don't know if these issues also happen in other scumm games.
<br/>
shouldn't the top screen show an unscaled clipping of the screen around the cursor when full zoomed out (l+a)?
<br/>
there are pixels jumping around in the scaled image on the top screen when moving the stylus (what scaling algorithm do you use?).
<br/>
also an option to scale the image on the lower screen so that the content height fits rather than the content width would be cool (i cant see the lower text buttons).
<br/>
maybe i'm missing something? there was an aspect ratio setting in the per game option menu but i guess its not working?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It should be exactly the same as the normal SCSD, only smaller. Saving works perfectly in scummvm-a, for Indy, MI1, MI2, and Sam&amp;Max, so I don't think it's an issue of any differences between SD and Mini-SD versions of the Supercard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've read through them... trust me, the moment I heard ScummVM was ported (months ago), I scoured through it to see if it could play The Dig, and the more I read about it, the less likely it would ever be for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I read your post about how much CPU power it *might* take, which added to the worry, but having heard about Moonshell's ability to use the M3 ram - it sprung some hope - so I had to ask..
<br/>
<br/>
I *REALLY* wish I was a programmer - I'd jump on this in a heartbeat and work to get it functional if possible (I really *really* love that game).
<br/>
<br/>
I won't pester you anymore about it, unless I saw some more information that might lead to a function Dig on the DS, but eh, I doubt that'll happen until I sink my teeth into it, which won't be for a while (still have to learn C to begin with).<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My guess on the CPU requirements are down to the game's requirements on the PC.  Sam &amp; Max required a 386/33Mhz and 4Mb of RAM, and this currently runs (just about) on ScummVM DS.  The Dig required a 486DX2/66Mhz which is quite a lot more powerful.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also found that ScummVM is probably not quite as efficient as the original games were, as these would have had plenty of assembler optimisations and were written specifically for the PC, while ScummVM is a lot more general and runs on every platform under the sun, so it's not well optimised for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been quite surprised about how dedicated the fans of these games are, it's quite amazing how much interest there is after so many years!  You should pressure Lucasarts to make an official version of these games on the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm using a M3 SD (english firmware v22c), and I almost have this whole thing working, saves and all. This should also apply to the miniSD version, as I think the hardware/firmware is identical.
<br/>
<br/>
If you use ScummVM DS on it's normal settings, saving doesn't work (and can apparently screw up any data on the card) due to SD card driver issues, so to save reliably in the game, you need a .ini file with the line "forcesramsave=true" under the "[DS]" header. This means that ScummVM DS refuses to write to your SD card, and instead stores save games in the SRAM, thus avoiding the SD driver entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with this is that while it is possible to backup the SRAM manually, I don't know how, and more to the point, it'd be a pain to have to do it every time you play. So the solution is to let the M3 deal with it automatically, by writing the .nds file to the SD card using the M3 Game Manager. This also adds a scummvm-a.dat (or b for build b obviously) file under the NDSSAVE folder. I leave all the settings in their standard positions except "Read Method" which I set to "Direct Copy" - i.e. no rom trimming, fast-booting, etc. funny business.
<br/>
<br/>
The last problem is that ScummVM loses its configuration each time you reboot. This is because the config was saved to a scummvm.ini (scummvmb.ini for build b) file on the SD card, which, even if it did save alright before "forcesramsave=true" was added, will not save. Therefore all the games and options will either have to be added manually to the .ini file, or using the menus each time you play.
<br/>
<br/>
While I can get the games to appear in the list by adding them to the .ini file, none of them will load that way. If I try to start the entry I put in in the .ini file, I get two black screens. If I ignore the entry in the .ini file and add the game using the menu, it works. Also, if I press the "edit game..." button while a game in the list that I added using the .ini file is selected, ScummVM DS crashes, if I do the same with one I've just added using the  menu, it works fine. EDIT - the "edit game..." thing no longer causes crashes - I've set a save path in the ini file, and that seems to fix that. I have also compared the information in the edit screen for a game manually added via the .ini file, and a game added with the menu, and even though there are no visible differences, the manually added one never loads.
<br/>
<br/>
This problem could theoretically be solved by running ScummVM DS with "forcesramsave=false", adding all the games, allowing it to save the .ini file, then changing it back to "forcesramsave=true"... but I can't seem to get it to save the .ini file at all. Even when there isn't one there, and ScummVM says it's making a new one, it doesn't seem to do anything.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by hinges on Thu Jul 20, 2006 7:42 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

file, then encode the vorbis files. This can be done with the following oggenc
<br/>
command line with the value after q specifying the desired quality from
<br/>
0 to 10:
<br/>
<br/>
  oggenc -q 5 track1.wav
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7.7.2) Using Flac files for CD audio:
<br/>
------ ------------------------------------
<br/>
Use flac or some other flac encoder to encode the audio tracks to files.
<br/>
Name the files track1.flac track2.flac etc. In your filesystem only allows
<br/>
three letter extensions, name the files track1.fla track2.fla etc.
<br/>
ScummVM must be compiled with flac support to use this option. You'll need to
<br/>
rip the files from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the flac files. This can
<br/>
be done with the following flac command line:
<br/>
<br/>
  flac --best track1.wav
<br/>
<br/>
Remember that the quality is always the same, varying encoder options will only
<br/>
affect the encoding time and resulting filesize.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Hi,

<br/>
I'm trying to get ScummVM DS to work on my EZFlash-II 512mb with no success...  I tried Zak and Monkey Island, both giving me the same result: I see the Gameboy loading screen and then... two black screens and nothing happens...  I tried ScummVM DS 0.6 and 0.5 and both give me the same result: a white screen on the upper screen of my ds and a black one on the bottom.
<br/>
<br/>
I've made an uncompressed zip named scummdata-a.zip, used the bulddata-a.bat file like required and burned using the EZClient 3.26 software.
<br/>
<br/>
Is my configuration supposed to be supported with ScummVM DS?
<br/>
Am I doing something wrong?
<br/>

titoboy666: yeah, for DS homebrew you can't have a GBA menu on the front of the cartridge, which some flash carts put on there by default.  This will prevent any DS homebrew from working, although maybe I should put a note on my page about it since ScummVM is sometimes the first thing people try.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Troubles with Sam N Max...
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I'm using a whilte DSL with a Passcard III and a M3 Mini SD.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried using scummvm-a.nds and scummvm-a.ds.gba and found neither worked.  The top screen would show the commands and the bottom screen would remain blank.
<br/>
<br/>
So I tried the build-data trick with the non-talkie version of Sam N Max.  This actually works.  I can get into ScummVM and play Sam N Max.  Also, since apparently ScummVM doesn't like SD cards, I've added the .ini file with the command to save to SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Now comes the problem, I'd like to play Sam N Max CD/Talkie version.  The file is too big to put it in a .zip file and use build-data to create a custom .nds file.  If I do this the ScummVM loads to 90% and the NDS freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
So instead I launch with the non-talkie version, and try to add the CD/talkie version.  When I try and add a game I can't see any folders, so can't choose Sam N Max.  I've tried launching Scumm VM from the folder with the game files, and I've tried putting it various other places, no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
So, what can I do?
<br/>
<br/>
I want to try manually adding it to the .ini file and see if that solves the problem, however I can't find anywhere that lists what I need to add to the .ini to add the English CD version of Sam n Max.  Can someone provide that for me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The solution is either to help write a FAT driver, or buy a card reader which is homebrew-capable.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a chance that the reader will be supported in the future as the FAT driver is being constantly worked on, but with the amount of readers out there at the moment, this could take some time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh that blows.  Before buying the mini-SD version I checked out the FAQ at the M3 message boards and it said the only difference between the SD and Mini-SD version was the physical size, that compatiblity was the same.

If you want to use homebrew, you should be buying a CF reader.  They're large and stick out, but they are compatible with pretty much everything.  The GBAMP is compatible with everything homebrew I know of, and is the cheapest thing out there, too.

Also, since I use it for development you know that ScummVM will always work on it.

Wish I could help out, but can't program worth a lick.  I do see some other homebrew can *read* from the MiniSD, so it is possible.  Since I don't code, I have no idea how they got it to work.

Unfortunately, the Supercard MiniSD is not supported by the FAT driver so you won't be able to run talkie games on it.

Chishm, who wrote the fat driver, is always hard at work on it.  If and when your card is supported, ScummVM will support it in the next version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

just done a quick test and all looks good, on first startup it created the scummvm.ini file, i added a few games and made a save in DOTT. Quit ScummVM, rebooted DS and on bootup it found the scummvm file with all the correct info and managed to load from a save, better than ive ever had before but still needs more testing. previously it would appear to save but never find the file, and then my me card would be corrupted
<br/>
<br/>
im on a primarily unix desktop and whilst the normal supercard patcher works in linux using crossover office, the moonshell/homebrew patcher doesnt, so to save anyone else the need to patch the files ive uploaded them here:

Unfortunately, the Supercard MiniSD is not supported by the FAT driver so you won't be able to run talkie games on it.
<br/>
<br/>
Chishm, who wrote the fat driver, is always hard at work on it.  If and when your card is supported, ScummVM will support it in the next version.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I'm pretty sure that the Supercard <span style="font-style: italic">miniSD</span> is the same, fatlib compatibility-wise, as the Supercard SD. The microSD version is the one that's different. Toyo's problem is that his monster.sou files are in OGG format.
<br/>
<br/>
Toyo, you'll need to convert the moster.sog file to .sou using the ScummVM tools. Just renaming it doesn't work. You can get the tools package on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">this page.</a> There should be readme files in it that explain how to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, really? There's no way to convert .sog back to .sou, then?

Edit: Now that I think about it, I guess the only reason you'd want to do that is if you don't own a real, original copy of the game. So that means only pirates would benefit from it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The files were patched with the moonshell patcher which comes bundled with supercard lite software, and my hardware is a NDS Lite, Super Key and SuperCard Lite with a 1 gig Micro SD card. The other games on the card still play fine so looks like nothings been corrupted. Im running no special settings with the SuperKey or in ScummVM, apart from I recently moved all saves into a new dir and updated ScummVM.ini.

Brilliant stuff - your patched versions worked for my SuperCard Lite (MicroSD), too. Before I was having to use the SRAM method for saving, but now it seems able to save directly to the card without any problems. It's a little bit confusing that some people seem to have had trouble with getting ScummVM to READ from the flash card using the SuperCard Lite, though - I never did.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would be worthwhile mentioning the Moonshell patching program under the SuperCard section on the web site (which is otherwise excellent and comprehensive, by the way, well done)? It would save people having to scour this thread.

You're not using a zip file, are you?  So it's not an error.

After this message it should say something like 'Flash card reader detected!' to let you know it's detected the card reader.

<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten Monkey Island 1 and Loom to work using the bat file method, mostly I think because the final file is little more than 5 mb.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, since I really don't want to be limited by the 30 mb limitation, is there a way to load scummvm stand-alone?
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a flashed Nintendo DS with an ezflash IV cartridge along with a 512mb SanDisk microSD card.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried running the scummvm-a.nds file, but all it does is end with a "Zip file check... Not in use!". After that it just stops.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a side note, is there a way to rip the music from Monkey Island 1? I have the CD but can't find anything that remotely resembles a music file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
As for ripping the music from the CD, the music is provided in CD audio tracks and don't show up as files.  CDex can get these off the CD and save them as WAV files (link to CDex is on the ScummVM DS site).  I don't think you'll be able to rip the music in low enough quality to fit into 30Mb, however.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#101491 - ancient_imhotep - Tue Sep 05, 2006 10:38 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I have just received my SuperCard Lite last Friday, this is my first time using a Flash Cart on a DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Once I had everything up and running hardware and software wise, I discovered a post on gbatemp.net about ScummVm.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of issues that I am having, which are causing me problems in fully enjoying this great program.
<br/>
<br/>
1) An earlier post suggested using the MoonShell Patcher on the ScummVM.nds file. I am not 100% sure which .nds file I should be using the patch on, the scummvm-b.nds file in the .zip file from the ScummVM DS download page or the renamed scummvm-b.ds.gba (changed to scummvm-b.nds). Can someone who has done this successfully let me know which is the correct one to patch?
<br/>
<br/>
2) I am finding it very difficult to save games in BASS (freeware version from ScummVM downloads). I have tried both the saving direct to MicroSD and the saving to SRAM methods and regardless of which one I use there seem to be problems saving at various points in the game. I thought I was doing something wrong, but it would appear that there is a problem with the compatibility with BASS based on other posts. I can always get the game to hang if I try to save in either factory or on the walkway outside the factory by the elevator (where Lamb is). Is this a confirmed problem that Agentq is aware of and is it something that can be fixed?
<br/>
<br/>
3) Also I am having problems when trying to access the inventory in BASS at certian points. Again the problem areas I have found tend to be in the factory (where you have to put the wrench in the cogs) and out on the walkway by the elevator (where Lamb is). It seems that when you press down on the D-Pad, the cursor moves to the top of the screen, but instead of displaying the inventory it just shows 'Exit' in the top left hand corner above the left exit. Again is this a known bug that Agentq knows about and is it something that can be fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
4) Due to the issues that I am having with BASS and not wanting to give up on trying to use ScummVM DS, I decided to try and play Flight of the Amazon Queen. So I downloaded the Freeware version from the ScummVM website (the largest one with full audio etc). The game is detected when I add it to the list, but when I start the game I just get two completely black screens. I am going to try one of the smaller versions in case it is something to do with the size, but wanted to know if this should be expected or if it should work?
<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry for making this such a long post, but I absolutly love the idea of ScummVM for the DS and want to give Agentq as much feedback as possible. 
<br/>
<br/>
Because the SCL seems to have some issues at the moment, I am in the process of locating all my old copies (hidden in the garage) of the other games supported by ScummVM DS, so that I may try and test these as well.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can provide me with answers to the above questions (especially the one about the MoonShell Patcher), it would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>
<br/>

    <h4>#101632 - agentq - Wed Sep 06, 2006 10:44 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1)  I can't really help with this patcher - I only know that others have used it successfully.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Yes, there is a problem saving in certain areas due to a lack of memory.  For now, the only solution is to go to a 'safe' room before saving your game.  In the next version, BASS may be split off into another build to avoid this issue.
<br/>
<br/>
3) D-pad down moves your cursor to the top left of the screen in order to show your inventory, unforuntely, if there's something in the way, it may not work properly.  You can still touch the top line of the screen to show the inventory.
<br/>
<br/>
4) Queen should work fine.  I'm not sure what issue you could be having with it, but you should make sure you have all the files, especially the .tbl file (which I think you download separately).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#101651 - ancient_imhotep - Thu Sep 07, 2006 12:37 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the quick replies Agentq.
<br/>
<br/>
1) I think I have worked out the patcher bit. SCL users need to take the .da.gba file from the ScummVM DS 0.61 build and rename it to .nds - once this has been done they can then use the MoonShell Patcher that comes with the SCL Firmware &amp; Game Patcher software from the Supercard.cn website. From my testing so far I cannot see any problems of the corruption that is supposed to exist on SD/miniSD/MicroSD cards when using the patched version of ScummVM DS. I can confirm that if you use a non-patched version on the SCL, then you will not get the scummvm.ini file created (it will say it is creating it but if you quit ScummVM and read the SD card in a PC it will not be there) and save games directly to the SD card will not work either (if you play BASS and try to save, the first one will appear to save OK but if you try to save/restore again the listings in the save/restore boxes will be filled with garbage).
<br/>
<br/>
2) Thanks for the update on this, I thought it was me being a plank but I am glad that is not the case. Do any other users of ScummVM DS who have played BASS know of any other rooms to avoid saving in? Maybe players of BASS could help start a list of known safe or unsafe rooms so that other people don't find out the hard way which is unsafe?
<br/>
<br/>
3) Thanks again for confirming this. Even touching the top line on the screen does not always work, it took me nearly 30mins to the inventory up the other day. The problem always seems to be an 'Exit' in every instance that I have encountered it. Does the cursor have to be in the top left of the screen to activate the inventory? If not, could you not make the cursor move to a different area on the top of the screen, so that it avoids touching the far left or right exits on some of the rooms?
<br/>
<br/>
4) Well I down loaded the Freeware versions on the ScummVM website. First I tried the full version, I think unzipped it is 189MB, and this just black screened on me (there is only file called queen.1 in the zip file). However I just downloaded the medium sized version, about 66MB unzipped, I think it has compressed sound OGG. Again this is only a single file (queen.1c) but this works without problems (except no speech, maybe because the speech files are missing or not supported). I will have to check up on the .tbl file and see if this is needed, I thought it was only for the retail versions. Will retest the full freeware version tomorrow and post the results.
<br/>
<br/>
Once agian thanks for such a great app.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">3)  I could easily move the position the cursor moves to call up the inventory, but I don't know where on the top line is a 'safe' position.  I'd rather do this a better way by inserting a hook into the BASS engine, but I'll have to check with the rest of the ScummVM team that this is ok.
<br/>
<br/>
4) I'm using the full freeware CD edition from the ScummVM website, and it works fine for me.  Maybe you should try downloading it again, because I have heard of problems with file corruption getting files from the sourceforge servers.  I'm not sure if it's still an issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using my increasingly confusing version numbering, I have made a beta of version 0.9.1a, which will be a bugfix release to fix a few niggling issues that I wanted to get out of the way.
<br/>
<br/>
* Bug fixes for saving on M3 SD/MiniSD/Lite and Supercard SD/MiniSD/Lite/Rumble
<br/>
* Fixes for card detection problem on M3
<br/>
* Fixed graphical glitches in Scumm games which use a lot of scrolling
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you can save reliably in this version. If it works ok, this will replace the version 0.9.1 which is currently available from the main ScummVM downloads page.
<br/>
<br/>
It may also fix the DSX saving problem (it had the same symptoms as the other save issue). Who knows though, because DSX are still silent on how their stuff works.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Excuse me that it took so long to answer, but I was away - an explanation:
<br/>
I was about to go in a hospital for a spine surgery and just the evening before I'd go I tried to put Day of the Tentacle on my new M3 Lite.
<br/>
It didn't work, because there was a bug in the code. Naturally, I got frustrated (because I didn't fancy the idea of being stuck in a bed for several weeks doing NOTHING).
<br/>
I overreacted (and my post was really stupid) and offered 25$ to anyone who can recompile the older version of ScummVM (0.61, that is) with SaTa's latest drivers which support M3 Perfect SD (since my aunt's PC didn't allow me to install
<br/>
devkitPro and my aunt was/is on holiday on the other side of the world (Australia, New Zealand, etc.).
<br/>
Anyhow I'm back and sucessfully recovering, playing the old classics :), all thanks to you for the last part. If you accept donations, I will probably send some money your way, if I get my hands on a credit card. Not too much though, I'm pretty much poor myself. :(
<br/>
<br/>
And, ummm, the second problem. Day of the Tentacle freezes at the point where [SPOILER]George Washington chops down the tree and therefore makes Laverne fall off it 400 years later[/SPOILER] ...
<br/>
The console pops up and if I close it, the system freezes. It's no big deal, when I'll be able to access my PC, I can copy the save to it and go through the cutscene that way.
<br/>
But it's still a bug. :(
<br/>
I'm using the Talkie version (uncompressed, the files are huge, but at least the gameplay is pretty smooth). Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Since the game makes a temporary save and then restores at that point I would suspect it to be the problem.  Did you continue your save from one made with v0.9.1?  If so, it may have been dodgy for a while, just not dodgy enough to crash.
<br/>
<br/>
See if you can reproduce the crash starting the game from the beginning.  You only need to do a few things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
agentq, are you sure there's a bug on the DLDI driver? I mean, using 0.9.1a beta3 patched with DLDI for SCLite (brisssou's one, normal SD and Moonlight's SD don't work at all) worked once for me. I tried about 10 times and it saved once. Why? Who knows.
<br/>
<br/>
But it saves scummvm.ini flawlessly. Maybe there's something bugged in the way you write savegames, but not how you write the ini file (Maybe the difference is that ini is plain text and savegame is binary?) I'd try to help fixing it, but using svn is quite confusing to me.

I hope you see this.

DS Linux has done it, so why can't you?
<br/>
A: Not at the moment. The extra RAM has certain differences to the build in RAM which makes it difficult to use for general programs. The problems with it cannot be solved by ScummVM, but rather need to be addressed by the DevkitARM team, and is a lot of work. Even if support is added to DevkitARM, it is very likely that many of the games would run extremely slowly on the DS, and not much can be done to make them run faster. So, basically, don't get your hopes up.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
