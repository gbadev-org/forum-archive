    <h4>#117154 - tepples - Thu Feb 01, 2007 11:49 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Soviet Mind Game was invented by Russian programmer Alexey Pajitnov in the mid-1980s and sold under the name Tetris. From 1988 until 2000, various Tetris products had vastly different control feels and rotation systems. The Tetris Company <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php/Tetris_Guideline" target="_blank">standardized</a> the games sold under the Tetris mark starting with <span style="font-style: italic">Tetris Worlds</span> (2001), but some of the changes proved <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#Easy_spin_dispute" target="_blank">controversial</a>, especially the new <a class="postlink" href="http://infinitespin.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">infinite spin</a> play mechanic.
<br/>
<br/>
LOCKJAW is a configurable implementation of the single-player Soviet Mind Game. Its 20 options can be configured to emulate at least Tengen Tetris, Sega's arcade Tetris, NES Tetris, Game Boy Tetris, The New Tetris, Quadra, Tetris The Absolute The Grand Master 2 PLUS, TOD (without the distortion effects), several modes of Tetris Worlds, and Tetris DS, along with various combinations not yet realized in a Tetris product. Don't like infinite spin or the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php/Back_to_back_T-spin_triple" target="_blank">T-spin triple</a>? Turn them off. Think 8 next pieces are too many? Turn it down. Want faster or slower sideways motion? You can. Want to try the challenge of a low ceiling? You can.
<br/>
<br/>
LOCKJAW is available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Game Boy Advance (since 0.26), and Nintendo DS (since 0.30 by request from owners of SLOT-1 flash cards).

Of course, since you can hold pieces in Lockjaw, you will have more options than normal Bastet because you can save pieces for when is better. Of course, you can also play without holding the pieces if you want to play like older games.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Probably not yet. Supporting the powerups, the wider playfield, and other differences between tnet and Tetris would take a lot of coding. I also wouldn't be able to get in much testing on the bus like I normally do.
<br/>
<br/>
zzo38computer: I have reduced the Bastet randomizer to pseudocode and added it to TODO.txt. Right now implementing Bastet isn't exactly high priority, but patches against the LJ source are welcome.

<br/>
#2: L/R move, Up (or touch, Start, mic tap, whatever) drops, X/Y rotate.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be interesting to see how well people do at that. Actually that just gave me another fun idea; save replays like Mario Kart games do. AFAIK they record the random seed and which buttons were held on each frame, just like emulator movies. A more memory-efficient method might be to record which buttons were held and for how many frames (so 60 frames of not holding anything generates 0,60, not 0,0,0...). Feeding that back into the input handler with the same random seed should replay the game. Then you save the files to disk and people can trade them.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Press up several times. But the next version will have a button to cause instant game over from within the pause menu, like holding Esc on the PC version.

For 20G at the start, set the speed curve to "Death".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'd have to keep the game small enough to multiboot, so that 1. it can run on GBA Movie Player and 2. the ASICs won't get confused when trying to access the program from NOR/RAM and the memory card at once. More importantly, as I understand it, people expect GBA homebrew programs to be able to run on a pure NOR device such as F2A, EFA, SZCard, or the EZFlash V 3-in-1 expansion that a lot of SLOT-1 card owners buy to add GBA capabilities. Is there a guide to making sure that GBA SRAM using the FCSR driver is properly backed up on each major card?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As of 0.42, the DS version has a result screen after Game Over. To get this onto the GBA, we'd have to eliminate three lines of text from the result screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just tried this out for the first time ever (DS version), and I really like it. Whenever I think of Tetris, I usually imagine the GB version and the accompanying Russian music... so this is very nostalgic. All the customization is nice.

Thanks tepples.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#164922 - Icehawk78 - Mon Dec 01, 2008 8:41 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not sure if you still check out this place, or just the Tetris Concept board. I had a few additional ideas. Many of these ideas have been gratuitously stolen from StillAliveDS, so if needed, you could probably look there to see how they work.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Count me as a vote for DS Skin Support. Custom skins could be loaded from a folder, similar to how I assume you do it for the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Another vote for button configurations. Assuming that's added, it'd ideally be stored in an external config file, so that it was remembered.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Vote for saving a game configuration as a custom gimmick, with the ability to name it. Design could be an option under the Game menu for "Save current options" and then display a naming dialog? Backend would be another folder that stores all Gimmicks (including built-in ones).
<br/>
<br/>
4) DS Specifics:
<br/>
<br/>
A) Allow stylus use in menu. (Not major, but would be nice.)
<br/>
B) L/R to change pages in options, rather than A/B - allow A/B to change current selected option. Wraparound up on topmost menu option/down on bottommost menu option, rather than shifting to the next page.
<br/>
C) Display more detailed info of selected option on top screen.
<br/>
D) Option to select which screen to play on, when playing.
<br/>
E) Ability to have a double-height well, spanning both screens.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5) (Less likely to be done, but would be awesome) Implementation of extra features available in the game "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.caywen.com/kevtris/" target="_blank">Kevtris</a>" for Windows Mobile phones.
<br/>
<br/>
These consist of four things, mostly:
<br/>
<br/>
A) Pentominos can be optionally used.
<br/>
B) New garbage mode - garbage spawns a random number (3-8, I think?) of garbage blocks
<br/>
C) Different scoring mode which allows for garbage blocks to count as "bonus" points (I can check, but I think it's something like 100pts per garbage block cleared, in addition to whatever the line itself would be worth).
<br/>
D) An extra "slider" block, which is a 1x1 block with an arrow that can be rotated to point all four directions. When it lands or is pushed into a block, it moves all contiguous individual blocks one in the direction the arrow was pointing. (Obviously, optional)
<br/>
<br/>
Falling example:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
......t.&lt;.. ......t&lt;... ......t.... 
<br/>
.llllttt... .llllttt... llllttt.... 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Push example:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
......t.&lt;.. ......t&lt;... .....t..... 
<br/>
.llllttt... .llllttt... .llllttt... 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
==========
<br/>
<br/>
I'm aware this is a huge list - not complaining at all, and I'm very impressed with what's already there. This is just a list of every possible thing I could think of to add. If these were all added, I'd have literally nothing else to add, other than a hearty "Thanks", which you very much deserve.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
