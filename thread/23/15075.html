    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I've just started learning and programming for nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
This is my first homebrew program for DS, a simple minesweeper.
<br/>
I still have to add some features, but this version is quite playable.
<br/>
<br/>
You can get more information and download it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fobos.org/dsmines" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by aGaTHoS on Sun Jun 01, 2008 4:42 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this program is very good. personally i think it is better than most other "fancy" minesweeper homebrew I have found.
<br/>
<br/>
I reccomend to just add those liitle flag marker things and maybe the same scrolling backround on the top screen as was on the menu.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is very nice. There's a couple things I can suggest.
<br/>
<br/>
1) When the user drags the stylus off of a space he presses, don't uncover the space.
<br/>
2) Of course, flags! &lt;- already supported
<br/>
3) The "middle-click" feature (uncover all surrounding spaces if X number of spaces are flagged).
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps by holding L and clicking it will place/remove a flag, and by clicking any uncovered space it will be treated like the middle-click.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Maybe I should have tried holding L...(or read the readme) :D, flags ARE supported, and "?" too!
<br/>
more edit: Hey I can't click my "?" marks :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you very much!
<br/>
<br/>
For the top screen I'm working on making it in graphical mode, with the game information: panel size, number of mines, remain flags to put, and a simple miniboard for quick view of what part of the panel is active and which cells remain to discover.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I'm planning for the next release to add one more panel size (extra large: 32x32) and a "standard" panel, that is the expert windows minesweeper panel (30x16, 99mines) for those who want to try to beat their windows record with the DS. But sorry no score saves for the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't understand what do you mean by "those little marker things". You mean flags? Have you tried to push a cell while pressing R or L keys? :P
<br/>
<br/>
The uncover a cell when stylus leaves it, is a "feature" :), in the previous version every cell had to be pulled-released for discover it. I've done so for increassing speed, but I'm planning to make posible to chose the input method in an options menu in future releases (single, multiple, and as you suggest a middle-click like method).
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know what are question marks for. Can you tell me the exactly behaviour you expect?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Question marks are just like flags, except that you can still click and uncover them. They are for marking spots that have potential to be a mine, but you're not really sure about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've released a new version, the link of the first post is updated.
<br/>
<br/>
There are many improvements, including various types of input methods as you suggested, clickable question marks, a graphical information top screen with a minimap. And new sizes added.
<br/>
<br/>
Still no scores :S, for the next release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for the update, but of course a version with scores would be much more appreciated ;)
<br/>
<br/>
a game without the possibilty to lose or get point is basically not a game ;) (where is the competition)
<br/>
<br/>
good luck with your project!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Kojote</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've released the new version of DS mines 0.7
<br/>
<br/>
It has some bugs fixed, and basically I've added two features: profiles and scores.
<br/>
<br/>
It now really uses libfat for options and score saving, so don't forget to dldi patch the binaries if required by your flash card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">first of all, nice work aGaTHoS.
<br/>
<br/>
my suggestion is there should be an option to turn off ? flags. they just slow you down. 
<br/>
the same option exists in the winmine.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks patto,
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a good idea, in fact I've only put those ? marks in game because there are in the original but I don't like to use it very much.
<br/>
<br/>
So you could turn it on/off in options in the next release.
<br/>
<br/>
I also expect to add some nice effects for the next version like new visual effects, sound, and rumble.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I love minesweeper. And now I can have it in my pocket! :D
<br/>
<br/>
If I have to find something negative about this game (which is hard), it would be the moving background on the menu, it makes me a bit dizzy, lol :D 
<br/>
<br/>
That's all...
<br/>
Keep up the good work, and good luck against sweden tomorrow ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
