    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is no April's Fool Joke. Here comes the next preview release of OpenTTD for Nintendo DS.
<br/>
Please tell me what you think of the new GUI and any wishes you have regarding the interface. Also, any crashes, especially due to memory issues are importent. Please be as specific as you can in your crash reports and include a savegame and your openttd.cfg file along with some information about your flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Changelog for Alpha 6</span>:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li> based on r12452 (internal rev1926)
<br/>
</li><li> the NDS port now has a different toolbar, more suitable for the small screen
<br/>
</li><li> for better access with the touchscreen the toolbars have been moved to the bottom screen
<br/>
</li><li> a fully customizable on-screen keyboard has been added (click on a text field to open it)
<br/>
</li><li> a newsticker display on the lower screen has been added
<br/>
</li><li> some windows have been adapted for the NDS screen (more will follow in future releases):
<br/>
<ul><li>   intro menu
<br/>
</li><li>   game creation menu
<br/>
</li><li>   minimap
<br/>
</li><li>   build vehicle window</li></ul>
<br/>

<br/>
</li><li> information regarding accepted cargo when building a station is displayed as icons now
<br/>
</li><li> switching screens (left shoulder button L) now only switches the windows
<br/>
</li><li> many windows (e.g. confirmation dialogs) are now centered on the bottom screen
<br/>
</li><li> the amount of free ram (in kb) is displayed in the middle of the status bar. This is only a temporary change to help with tracking down a memory leak
<br/>
</li><li> additionally you can view some memory information by pressing the B button
<br/>
</li><li> always use new global pathfinder (NPF). the original TTD pathfinder crashes due to too many recursions
