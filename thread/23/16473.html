    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on a DSLatin vocabulary training tool.  Other vocabulary tools don't work well for Latin because Latin words can have numerous forms.  
<br/>
<br/>
The tool will load a database of words, most likely from a flashcart, and quiz the user.  The user will have to enter the exact form of the word.  Incorrect answers will be tagged so that the word appears more often to help the user learn.  You'll also be able to mark a word as memorized, so that it will never appear again.  I'm still in the planning/prototype phase, so expect many more features!
<br/>
<br/>
Architecturally speaking, it features an advanced 2D widget toolkit that I hope to make available when it's ready.  
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a prototype screenshot

My GUI toolkit should be completed and fully doxygen-documented by this weekend, so then I can focus on the actually logic of the quiz program.  Hopefully I'll have a playable demo in a few weeks!  
<br/>
<br/>
Getting the user to enter a definition is difficult, because based on the form of the word, the definition can change.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, amo = I love, amas, you love, amans, someone loving, etc etc etc.  
<br/>
<br/>
So after the user correctly identifies the form of the word, I was planning on popping up a generic scratchpad where the user just writes their answer.  Then when finished, the game will provide the definition and ask the user whether they got the right definition or not.  This will rely on user honesty!  
<br/>
<br/>
I want desperately to avoid a multiple choice situation, because that leads to guessing, and in the real translation world, there are no multiple choices for you to guess from.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Very interesting.  
<br/>
<br/>
The first declension would be a-declination, such as porta/portae.
<br/>
The second declension would be o-declination, such as puer/pueri
<br/>
The third declension would be i-declination, such as rex/regis.
<br/>
The fourth declension would be u-declination, such as manus/manus
<br/>
The fifth declension would be the e-declination, such as res/rei.
<br/>
<br/>
I will see about having a different labeling option that follows what you said.  Thanks for the suggestion!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The third declination isn't called i-declination but third declination (The only one with a number. Some people also call it mixed declination). The i-declination is vis/turris (fem) or mare (neu). I think it has about six words or something small like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not fully functional, but it'll give you an idea of the interface I'm planning on using.
