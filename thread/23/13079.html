That probaly means that i got some offsets wrong or to large for detecting the touch screen. I thought i had cleared that out in the latest version. I'll see if i can replicate this problem. It will be definitly on my 'to solve' list

Sorry, won't happen anywhere soon.
<br/>
To get a bit technical, the reason why is that i then have to use a fat file system. I did that before with JDS but i got to many complains that is didn't work on specific cards. Even when they did patch the rom.
<br/>
<br/>
However... I made this for my own use and i don't mind to share it. So there comes a point where i have to is start to learning the kanji and then i need a aid. So you never know.<br/>_________________<br/>My personal ranting at blog.zoelen.net</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice work!  This is probably going to stay on my DS for a while.  I would like to request a few features though.
<br/>
<br/>
In the writing practice, could you make the brush ~3 pixels instead of 6?  It is difficult to write certain characters that involve barely lifting the stylus (like ya) because they run together.
<br/>
<br/>
In the other modes, it displays a character on the top screen, but if you change the selected practice characters to exclude that character, you cannot continue until you re-select the group the character is in.  Could you make it so the character on the top screen changes if it's corresponding group is deselected on the bottom screen?
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I don't really have any complaints except that the sound is really soft.
<br/>

In this release i re-sampled the 48 speech files so they are louder as many of you requested. I also added a good/false sound, an intro sound and a few other sounds to bring things more alive. In the previous release i introduced an new error that i hadn?t noticed. That one is removed to in this release.

You are lucky today. First thing, the behavior for the speech is intended. I've included speech only for Japanese, so only when a kana is on the upper screen.

Next the 'oddities when more then 100 right'
