    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
I?m new fairy new to Homebrew for the NDS and I?ve built my first real application which I like to share.
<br/>
<br/>
The application is a dart-scorekeeper called 2Dart. It has the following options:
<br/>
<br/>
 - 301 and 501 game mode
<br/>
 - Single or double player mode
<br/>
 - Keep score by touching dartboard
<br/>
 - Game statistics (dart count, dart average, highest score, lowest score, etc.)
<br/>
 - Flip screens (to switch between right- and left-handed users) (use L and R key)
<br/>

Well.. I've thought about it, but got stuck on the gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of digital dartgames use level bars to indicate the x and y position of the dart, but i'm still looking for a better alternative which creates more interaction.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas are welcome!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That could be an idea, but would make it more of a gamble game because of the unforeseeable behavior of the dartboard. You could get better in the game by reacting faster, but it's not a very stable option...
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried several online dartgames, and the level-bar method seems to be very popular. For now i'll stick to them, until a better idea is born :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've only played the downloadable demo, but Clubhouse Games has a dart game that lets you throw the dart by dragging it on the bottom screen with the stylus.  The position, speed, and direction when you release the dart determine where it hits the board.

That is a nice game! It has a nice form of interaction to throw the dart.
<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the fact i'm just building a scorekeeper, the built-in game will be much simpeler, but hopefully just as fun.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment i'm testdriving the first version with the levelbars. It seems to work well, accept the fact that i really suck in it. All my test persons seem to do better, even the first time they play :(

I've been playing with it yesterday evening, it was really fun, thanks for that really nice homebrew :) :) :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I've found two bugs. One is that it doesn't 'close' the game when scoring a double bull. (I mean... say there are some 110 poits left: I should close with a Triple 20 and Double Bull, right? Or are you using different rules than the ones I used to?)
<br/>
Another little bug is that when you press the 'New Game' button and then you answer NO, the darts you already throw disappear from the board...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it's really cool :) Good work pal! :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanx! It's always good to hear that someone appreciates your work! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
About the bugs:
<br/>
<br/>
1) I'm afraid it's a bug! i don't use other rules...
<br/>
<br/>
2) This one i already knew, but i don't know if it's worth fixing...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning to make animated darts which will use sprites instead of being drawn on the background. This will fix the problem. Since it seems that i'm not able to draw good animated darts (the different angles make it hard), it can take a while before those will be implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably do a temporarily fix ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After you throw the 1st dart if you press 4 times again the OK button you just score twice again the same points with the 2nd and the 3rd dart... it's quite easy to do a 180 with that trick ;)

That's strange, i've just tried this, but without the same result. Do the levelbars still move or are they standing still at the moment you press the OK button?
<br/>
<br/>
At this moment all the previous bugs are killed, and created a new one while cleaning up the code. Now the levelbars keep moving while the game is over. When both bugs are solved i'll post the new version.
<br/>

 I've found another (minor) bug: sometimes the 2nd player lowest score in the statistics it's wrong, once I've read 180 there (and the highest was 135...)
<br/>
<br/>
Then... a request. Is it possible to add a 'Pro' mode? With smaller doubles and triples, smaller bull and with dart bounces if you throw exactly where another dart already is... ? Because I think actually it's too easy and after some legs you already learnt to score 180 each time...

Sure, I still have my first dartboard which had normal proportions. I've changed it because it was to hard to hit the triples when keeping score :-)
<br/>
I guess it fairly simple to create extra option to adjust the skill-level (easy, normal and hard), which decides what dartboard and speed of the levelbars to use.
<br/>
<br/>
I've already implemented my first animated darts attempt, but still have to fine-tune them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The main focus of this release was to create a computer opponent for both x01 and cricket games, which is now operational! An other thing was adding more animation to make the package more *fancy* :-) Full details follow below:
<br/>
<br/>
   Additions:
<br/>
<br/>
    * Computer opponent for all game types and variants
<br/>
    * Score indicator at cricket games
<br/>
    * "Flying" scores at dartgame mode
<br/>
<br/>
   Changes:
<br/>
<br/>
    * Sliding (deck-of-cards like) menu's
<br/>
<br/>
   Fixed bugs:
<br/>
<br/>
    * The score doesn't always match with the box of the dart
<br/>
    * The current score is shown before the dart hits the board
<br/>
    * When cleaning the X01 scoreboard the start score is printed
<br/>
    * When changing hand with the select button in the first menu,
<br/>
      the buttons do not update
