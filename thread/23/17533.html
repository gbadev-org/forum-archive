    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there,
<br/>
a few days ago I released an almost final version of Arsenal, a dual screen bullet hell vertical shoot em up. You can download it <a class="postlink" href="http://smealum.net/arsenal/Arsenal.rar" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
Here are a few screenshots :

<br/>
There's a ton of stuff that I've added since the last version (which was released exactly 6 months ago), so here's a feature list :
<br/>
- full dual screen 3D bullet hell vertical shoot em up
<br/>
- robust engines capable of managing hundreds of bullets (over 1000 in certain conditions)
<br/>
- 7 levels, ranging from easy to insanely hard 
<br/>
- massive bosses
<br/>
- different weapons, powerups
<br/>
- varied backgrounds : space stations, planets, oil rigs...
<br/>
- replay system
<br/>
- highscore system with online leaderboards
<br/>
- complete modding tools available : make your own levels and share them on the game's website
<br/>
- download people's mods directly from the game's menu via wifi
<br/>
<br/>
The game is pretty hard (well the first 4 levels aren't too challenging, but level5 gets a little crazy, and level6 and 7 even moreso), and I'm probably going to be adjusting it so that it's at least possible to finish (I'll probably be adding bombs at some point, and I'll be fixing some of the impossible to dodge patterns from level7).
<br/>
Also, the game uses EFS, and I intend to switch to nitroFS since a lot of people have been reporting problems running the game.
<br/>
Anyway, let me know what you think ! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, that's basically what I plan on doing, except it'll be a nitroFS and and EFS version (I'll be using FAT to load custom game files in both versions anyway).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem with NitroFS is it requires you to pass in the command line via argv which is not supported by some older cards (see <a href="http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Homebrew_Menu" target="_blank">http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Homebrew_Menu</a>).
<br/>
<br/>
I believe EFS is basically NitroFS with an extra function for searching out the exe on the card. It probably uses an older NitroFS version though. What would be ideal would be to add file search support to the latest NitroFS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I know, that's actually why I didn't use nitroFS in the first place, but some people have requested a nitroFS version so I'll try to deliver that for them. :P Just trying to provide options really, I don't know why EFS wouldn't work for some people, but it happens, and giving a nitroFS version means more people will be able to try the game. Hopefully. ^^'
<br/>
(there's also the fact that EFS's file search can be excruciatingly long for some people, while nitroFS is instantaneous provided you use a compatible launcher so... yeah)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do realize that, but I still believe I should give users a choice; I've never had any problems with EFS, my games have always worked on my cards so I haven't felt the need to change anything.
<br/>
But some people are reporting problems which a nitroFS version would probably fix, so I'm going to make one, but that doesn't mean I'll be pulling the EFS version.
<br/>
And I also agree that nitroFS should be used more in order to force cart makers to add support for argv, and I would have made my nitroFS version earlier if I hadn't been in such a rush to release this game, but I don't like forcing people with non-argv compatible carts to use hbmenu, so I'll keep using EFS, if only as a secondary version of my game. Hope you understand. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well no, I don't understand why you would deliberately choose to cause problems for homebrew users and programmers alike. If a card doesn't support argv it doesn't support homebrew, end of story.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're willing to add multiple versions to try and support all types of users, I think the best choice would be to offer a nitroFS version, and a plan FAT version with loose files.  EFS causes problems for many users, for no significant benefit.
<br/>
<br/>
And like wintermute and others have said, continued use of EFS in homebrew prevents the proper solution (argv support in loaders) from gaining traction, which harms the entire community in the long run.<br/>_________________<br/>#include &lt;sig.h&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">smea: actually I believe the best option is nitroFS for those that support argv and a FAT version for those who have got old carts. This way you would promote the argv cause while still giving a chance to the owners of old carts to enjoy your game. But promote the 1st version as 'the best one' (and more frequently updated or similar...) so that people will eventually move sooner or later to better homebrew supporting carts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
