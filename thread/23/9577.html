    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! This is my second attempt at a program for the DS, a small MSN messenger, so I'm looking for testers... 
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't have many functions, since I'm not sure how much the wifi library can handle, but at least you can -theoretically- connect and chat. The program uses GBFS, I think some cards can't handle that...
<br/>
<br/>
The wifi config is taken from the firmware, so make sure you have it available. L acts as a quick backspace, left and right to change tabs, Start to connect/disconnect. Your password is shown -since the keyboard seems to be quite buggy- so be warned :]

<br/>
I'm not sure whether this will work at all, since I've only checked it on my DS, but anyway...

Changelog: Lots 
<br/>
- Added support for sending / receiving user display pictures through MSNSLP 
<br/>
- Added support for sending / receiving INK gifs (not sure if works with official client, it does work with aMSN, kopete and others) 
<br/>
- Can handle now 302 Transfer in SSL auth (I think, if it doesn't, contact me) 
<br/>
- Added keyboard pressed key mask thingy a lot of people asked. 
<br/>
- Updated to devkitpro19 
<br/>
- Fixed bugs where some transaction ids were expected to be 1 char long 
<br/>
- Changed principal interface 
<br/>
- Can change now avatar / display name 
<br/>
- Fixed bug where would crash if disconnected while chatting 
<br/>
- Fixed bug where MSN would still consider you online / in some session even after closing (in my PC works fine, probably an error of socket closing of the lib) 
<br/>
- Fixed some stuff where a principal would create new tabs continuously because beup didn't recognize that it had left the one before 
<br/>
- Tabs now appear only after partner sends a message (so sessions used only for avatar exchange don't clutter the tab container) 
<br/>
- Added some sounds 
<br/>
- Tabs now use principal names instead of account 
<br/>
- Fixed chat tabs in general 
<br/>
- Changed button look 
<br/>
- Simplified principal synchronization (hope it crashes less now) 
<br/>
- Implemented composite glyphs for dstype (now can display accents / tildes / stuff) 
<br/>
- More other stuff that I can't remember. 
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff still wrong: 
<br/>
- SSL still fails sometimes (tell me somebody is writing a native SSL lib for the DS...) 
<br/>
- WEP seems to crash regularly (can't check it since I don't use WEP)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by kevinc on Thu Jun 22, 2006 11:18 am; edited 5 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are a lot of things that have to get polished but I really love that little app.
<br/>
<br/>
First, and the most important concern: Please, do not limit the username character (my account for example, has almost 20 characters!), because I had to create a temporary one just to test it.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, improve the input ('shift' should go back to lowercase when you stop using it :D) and allow the user to move backwards and forwards through the characters. Other than that, I cannot complain. Some routers aren't supported, but that's the WiFi Lib issue (lucky me, I have two APs ^_^).
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I cannot complain. Please, keep up!

It runs on my M3 CF, but there's a problem with touchscreen accuracy (same thing as in Scumm 0.6, agentq solve it by using Touch ReadXY() code).
<br/>
Anyway, I tested it on another DS with no touchscreen accurcy problem, and I was unable to connect, he always failed on authentication, I'm sure the password is correct, and I wasn't connected with that account when I tried.
<br/>
<br/>
As said earlier, you should also permit username more than 20 char long, mine don't fit (I used the one of my brother...).

Why the hell do you need GBFS? The application itself is 2MB... For what? Graphics? Compress and you will achive an atleast 500Kbyte application.

After some practice, the keyboard didn't seem quite as buggy as it did at first. All I have to do is give the keys a quick, firm tap and I rarely make a typo.
<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading elsewhere that they got around that keyboard issue simply by skipping the first few frames of input after a touch is registered. Then again, for all I know you've done this already.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is. GBFS is starting to read from GBA ROM space area (0x08000000) which isn't "supported" on the GBAMP, MK2/3 and of coruse not on WMB.
<br/>
Why I mentioned the 2MB in size, Is because the RAM is 4MB and the ARM9 binary can be as big as almost 4MB. He could just add the images/fonts/graphics to the ARM9 binary, and increase compatibility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It saves my username correctly, but never my password.

How can you set the IP by hand? I can connect automatically with mario kart to my soft AP. I'm a bit dumb with networking so its probably something simple that I'm missing.

If it crashes while synchronizing, it's probably a problem in the Wifi lib while receiving big packets (the MSN seems to like sending the whole contact list [1K+] in one packet).

2 default avatars (which I forgot to take away when I disabled them). But mostly fonts.

That's an issue with the Wifi Lib DHCP, nothing I can do... If it gives you problems, try setting an IP manually in the firmware config (or go a bit further away from your router, seemed to work sometimes).

Try to log in with your normal account, then logout there.

Then try logging in with BEup (helped me once).

Also, try to see if your DS is really working with your router.

<br/>
<br/>
I just had the same issue on my own code, i found an neighbour AP but my own took hours. I did the same init as it is done in the Hello-World demo for the WiFi lib beside not using auto connect but waiting for recognizing APs.
<br/>
<br/>
Turned out that i explicit needed to call WiFi_ScanMode(), when doing so. This step was missing in the example and i've overseen it in the includes. Now i can see all (3) APs in Range.
<br/>

Could this be a similar issue with your prog not finding all APs?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One of the things I noticed was that, as many mentioned, the touchscreen is buggy. But I can live with that. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, M3 CF, it "loads" the settings but loads the password wrong
<br/>
<br/>
example
<br/>
<br/>
asdfg*[][]H[]
<br/>
<br/>
it reads the first 8 digits right, then the rest are corrupted, it might be because my M3 is out of battery. I'd love if in a future version, we could write them in a TXT file and have them loaded from there. 
<br/>
<br/>
I once managed to connect successfully, my friendlist showed up and all that. I freaked out and pressed Start, which disconnected me :(

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Super lame, I managed to connect once yesterday on my test account when I had nobody on my list...Then I try a few mins later and it goes on
<br/>
<br/>
"Authentication Failed (Wrong Password?)"
<br/>
<br/>
Then I go and try the same password on PC, it works! I think MSN servers banned this client or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way I think you should put a few options on the management of the account. I mean, like adding people, removing people, blocking people. That would be sweet.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on further coding this client, it is one that I really look forward to :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The SSL lib sends a Hello and waits indefinitely (sp?) for an answer (which, if the server didn't get because of a bad connection, won't send at all). That may be a problem of the wifi lib, of the connection, or because the server just didn't feel like replying.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can alter the SSL lib so that if it doesn't receive an answer in some time, it just returns with an error, instead of waiting forever...

I'm sorry, that was badly worded, it doesn't mean a "slow" connection, but an "unresponsive" one. The SSL lib blocks until it receives an answer, and if the server doesn't send one, it will wait forever (I'm checking that).

Note that even if you can't type anything while it waits for an answer, it doesn't mean it has crashed, just that it's waiting. Normally the authentication lasts about 10 secs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To everyone having problems with IP numbers not being issued. I pretty much fixed this by putting manual IP addresses in my WIFI configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, after that, the actual handshaking procedure is random for whenever it works or not. If it works, then there might be another problem like, the authenticity failing for whatever reason. It's the wifilib. Hopefully it will get fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Kevinc, I have a big requst for a (perhaps very soon) future release. A bigger keyboard, like that of the Wifi configuration from Nintendo. Something that spans the entire DS screen, and not just a small one like the pictochat keyboard. It's too hard to type, even with more accurate touchscreen code.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, make the keys dim whenever you click on one, and please..I've gotten spoiled with Nintendo's way of doing it, but make a "click" sound when you actually do type. I never know when I'm actually typing the letter I wanna type until I look up.
<br/>
<br/>
Whenever it does manage to log into MSN, it puts me into "offline" mode by default. And for whatever reason, ..it invites anyone I try to private message into a "Chat"? That's odd.
<br/>
<br/>
One last little request, a clock in the corner. :D Okay, that's it.
<br/>
<br/>
Those are just a couple little problems I have with it, but otherwise it's looking good. MSN on DS is starting to look like a very good piece of software to use.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

That's strange, I don't know why people have a problem in <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> part... it's just sending 2 commands (USR/CVR) and waiting for the server to answer. It's a straight thing, not authentication or anything complicated, it should work everytime.

Would you prefer to enter into Online directly? I can change that. :)
<br/>
And about the "Chat": when you first invite someone, it creates the tab; however, the tab remains empty (with "Chat") until the other person's client accepts the call and enters the switchboard. Until then any message you type simply won't get to the other side. So it's all a matter of when your partner replies.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is how MSN works behind the scenes.  You can see this happening at times when a message doesn't go through because the "chat" is broken and you get a message saying the other party didn't receive the message.
<br/>

You also see this "chat" established in most of the other IM clients that connect to MSN.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I absolutely totaly agree with this.

Otherwise, it's a struggle to hit "connect" constantly, and hope that it connects. Just keep doing it. It seems to work when it wants to.

kevinc, the 0.3 library examples never connected to my router, no. It never has.. and thanks for taking the keyboard suggestion seriously.

Love the graphics and the keyboard is fine for me, no problems with accuracy at all. I get the occassional i intead of o sometimes but I get that on every other homebrew keyboard as well. Having the keys light when touched would be appreciated though.

This looks very promising! Hope you can tell us a little about why it can get our contacts but makes us offline.

PS. When I connect with my <a href="mailto:virtual_me_151@hotmail.com">virtual_me_151@hotmail.com</a> account at the authenticating step, no matter how close to y router I am, it either crashes or gives me 'Error 8 (unknown)' message in red.

You have to set your status to "online", if you try to talk to someone when you're offline, you will get disconnected.
<br/>
<br/>
To change your status, press the place around where is says "offline" and where your name is. It's a bit hard to get the status meny, but you'll find it. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EDIT: I like how it changes the tab to red when someone IMs you, I was hoping for some sort of notification. Some sound would be cool too, like a ding or some sort of alert. I tend to watch TV while I wait for someone to reply. Also, would it be difficult to add an option for time tags? Little things that tell the time an IM came, cause sometimes I get an IM and I don't notice it right away and I wonder how long they've been waiting. Perhaps a sound whenn a new IM opens and a different sound when a new message in an already open IM is recieved?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm getting the 0.0.0.0 ip address about 70% of the time (but not all the time) and to get the handshake to pass, i just have to click connect, wait a few seconds, and repeat a few times.  I'll do some more testing and report back.  If your router has an option to reserve ips for certain mac addresses, try setting up a static ip for your DS, i've found it helps when running some homebrew apps.<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of it working?  All right, give me some time.  I've found that i can typically avoid the issue of 0.0.0.0 ip 100% of the time by holding my ds right up next to my router (basically touching the antenna), strangely enough.  Handshake time seems to be anywhere from 10 seconds to 1.5 minutes.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet that the next wifilib will fix a few of these issues.
<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE:  I seem to have found a programming glitch.  I was trying to send messages to myself and not succeeding, when I started pressing buttons, and beup locked up.  Thinking it was working on something, I left my DS for about 15 minutes.  When I got back, it was very hot, with a temperature reading (taken from moonshell) of 29.62 degrees, which is way above average, leading me to believe it was caught in a recursive loop.  I'll post more info as i discover it.<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The synchronizing part depends too much on many circumstances, sadly :( For instance, I've never seen it crashing on my DS, and many people also see it working every time. It appears to depend on how fast the server sends the info, how big the packet is, how cranky the wifi lib feels and which moon it'll be tonight. Having a small contact list also helps :D
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be releasing another version in a few days, using the updated CVS version of the wifi lib, hopefully things will look a little better :)

It's had no problem with anything over homebrew. And I really find it strange that the only 2 times I was able to connect, were both times which I had pressed the 'reset' button.

I only have access to this one, and a Cloud one - which I can't even connect to with mario kart...
