    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used DSMAPS for my biketours (I pre-downloaded the maps before start) for quite a while. Sadly the author canceled the development and the software did not work anymore (I guess google has changed something on their site).
<br/>
 Is there something similar out there (downloading Googlemap content for offline viewing?) I know AMAP4DS, but it?s not what I?m searching for: no download possibility, to complicated to create own maps. Or are there other ways of viewing maps?  Viewing bigger maps on my DS as a picture is a mess (to slow, buggy).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

don't get too excited. i have a pre-release review kit, the software doesn't work very well. it shows my gps location incorrectly, by up to 1 mile off from where i actually am. but it does show maps and you can scroll around them. there is no map based point-to-point support, and there probably won't be due to the cost of custom maps.

<br/>
if this sort of thing interests you, keep an eye on it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It looks really promising but I?m not able to download Maps with the GMD Tool. I followed the tutorial but empty directorys are created (also I?m not able to see maps in Preview mode). :-( I guess the connection to google is somehow broken.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can now download the maps, copies inside the root of my m3 /caelitis/maps/mymap but after starting your software nothing happend (white topscreen, black screen below). Does it work without the hardware extension??

FYI: The website <a href="http://www.ds-gps.com" target="_blank">http://www.ds-gps.com</a> has problems. I can?t scroll to read the entire content in Thunderbird and IE. I needed to copy the content in another document.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
