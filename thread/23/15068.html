    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, so heres my attempt, tweaked a little from the version any of you might have seen already. I am content to call this version 1.0, that is, I feel that it works.

I have just noticed, that I forgot the put the source in the .zip, not to worry though, it will be in the next one.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] Never noted the controls anywhere, use up/down, A to select a file. SELECT to bring up the file list after that. All .smf files must be in the root.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the nice filebrowser.
<br/>
But i have a pair of ideas.
<br/>
1. Maybe a button to turn bottom screen lights off, and|or turn them off automaticaly on movie start;
<br/>
2. Instead of root, make the browser search for movies in a folder, like /data/SMP/;
<br/>
3. Bind play control to butons also;
<br/>
4. When a clip ends, play the next or open up the browser;
<br/>
5. Maybe when you press SELECT to open browser, it pauses the current clip and pressing it again closes the browser and resume playback;
<br/>
6. A touch button to open browser, or maybe a swipe stroke downward to open it, like DSReader does;
<br/>
7. Volume control on the fly.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, would you say if it can get more fps at the future?
<br/>
Just now i'd say doesn't pay to switch DPGs for SMFs just because of it.
<br/>
<br/>
But thanks for you app =]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. I have started working on turning the screen off already. I should have it working properly soon. I was also thinking about brightness settings for the top screen.
<br/>
2. The files must be in the root only because I am having difficulty with folders, I will fix this though. I would prefer not to need the files in a specific place, but to be able to navigate to the correct folder.
<br/>
3. Good idea, I was thinking this also, but the main problem is that the frames and sound take up a lot of processor time and I can't figure the best way to read button presses.
<br/>
4. Good idea, opening the browser again would be simple.
<br/>
5. I will try this, it sounds like a good idea.
<br/>
6. Again, good idea. There is lots of free space on the bottom screen for more buttons.
<br/>
7. I only know how to set the DS hardware volume, I would only be able to do that, and I don't think it would be any better than using the slider on the bottom of the DS. If I new how to amp the volume like moonshell does I would try that.
<br/>
<br/>
I would have to change the format of the smf file to change the fps of the playback (it is encoded at 12fps currently) it would be possible, but I might not have time for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou for the great suggestions.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">can't you use a more common format like mpg ? It would be a blast to convert cause of ffmpeg, and it would be more accessible.
