<br/>
<br/>
Wow, the 1.4 beta has lots of nice little improvements :)
<br/>
<br/>
The Setup program is finally becoming worthwhile, as it can give previews of clock plugins.
<br/>
There seems to be a shutdown sound now. Not quite right, as it only plays if I shut down by closing the lid, and I don't have that option turned on. Can software detect when someone presses the Power button?
<br/>
I'm guessing not, but it would be great if it's possible. (I'm thinking that if it was possible, official software would put up a giant message and make an angry noise if it's saving when someone presses the power button, but nothing does).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still a bit complicated, though.
<br/>
Skin.ini seems to have disappeared entirely, so people looking to make skins will probably have to keep the file from an older version handy.
<br/>
Having to run through Setup doesn't seem right.
<br/>
Would be great to have the plugins and things immediately accessible instead of hidden within that file.
<br/>
<br/>
The new movie encoder is excellent!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And a random question:
<br/>
How does the clock plugin "AnalogDot" work?
<br/>
I thought the clock plugin system was too limited to do fancy animated elements like those falling dots.
<br/>
I think it would be really cool to have a more fancy analog clock, so does anyone know where I can get the source to that one?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

It is no news that they are busy.. maybe he means those saving/cart corrupting bugs? I have begged the lib for several months and they are always too busy. I think Nintendo will publish new portable console before they will release it (so sad).

Better MP3 play?, I'm not sure. Better video playback?, yes.

If you only need MP3 playback of MoonShell then you can stick with that oldie.. but if you need anything more, then download the latest MoonShell as (almost) all the others are improved.

Stuff encoded to 1.0 works. MoonShell uses ARM7 processor for Audio playback and ARM9 for Video. Audio/Video sync has been fixed/optimized several times. I'm not sure if there have been added new video filtering levels (check it out).

Also other video playback improvements that I can not remember, anyone?<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

EDIT:
<br/>
I just got a Max Media Dock and am using the CF card from my GBAMP to try it out. I've noticed that none of the homebrew apps I have on it will launch from Moonshell directly. Some will launch and play fine from the Max Media Player app, but not from MoonShell. Has this always been the case with the Max Media Players? I know support for them is still in the early stages compared to most other flashcarts and adapters, but I was rather curious. Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Beta 1 and 2 work fine for me, but beta 3 always quits with the error message "Critical error!! CPU HALT for safety. Check 'shell/resume.sav' or retry setup.". Pushing the start button while starting, like described in resume.sav (it's a text file) doesn't help, unfortunately. I'm using a Supercard MicroSD with a 1 GByte Toshiba MicroSD card.
<br/>
<br/>
I also get a strange error message when trying to watch *.dpg files encoded with the new dpgenc.exe. It says "VideoOverlaySize setting error." and completely crashes Moonshell. This happens with all the videos I've converted.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what dpgenc has to say about that video after encoding:

<br/>
What puzzles me is the last line: "MovieData=1297188-&gt;0byte". 0byte? Sounds like it didn't convert anything at all. This happened with all the other files I converted, too. The preview window shows the correct picture, so DPGEnc seems to be able to decode the original XviD AVI.
<br/>
<br/>
Help would be appreciated, thanks in advance,

It's easy in principle to synchronize: just have the audio CPU report the current sample position since start of file, and then have the video CPU convert the number from samples to frames and slow down or speed up decoding (or skip GOPs) as necessary.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Tip: Classical music has much more dynamic range than pop music. When encoding classical music, run it through a level compressor at 2:1. This will make the quiet parts louder so that 1. the DS audio DAC's -54 dB noise floor isn't as noticeable in quiet parts, and 2. you can still hear quiet parts over ambient noise.

I've noticed that at least some of the noise (especially in quiet sections) is due to dithering done by Moonshell (DSOrganize does it too, but not for modules). I wonder what dithering method Moonshell uses, it doesn't really sound too great.

Thanks a lot for the help, but I know how to do it that way. I just liked the self contained .nds file because I hate having the shell folder on my SD card. Hopefully he will re-instate that feature for the final, because I really liked it. I hate having all kids of clutter on my SD card :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think so. :( Blame on M3/G6 development team as they haven't gave the source code to support it officially (with MoonShell).
<br/>
<br/>
Moonlight writes in his blog that he has tried to compile code with the Trial version of ADM (the full licence costs around $5971, that is so much, not fair) without luck. He thinks that the pre compiled library is made with another version of ADM of isn't working because it's made with the full version.

There are floating cloned SuperCard carts that are not supported with MoonShell. Please use only with REAL SuperCard.

How to identify the real one: <a href="http://eng.supercard.cn/" target="_blank">http://eng.supercard.cn/</a>

You need to copy the right file from the "files for SuperCard" folder to your card.

<br/>
Thanks for your information &amp; concern about our products .
<br/>
We did our best to finish doing G6 /M3 lib for the developer.
<br/>
But it is not suitable for all the developers .
<br/>
In fact the lib we offered is similar to the lib from SC ,and their lib is also not source form.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is completely understandable as there are several different types of flashcarts, each of which usually require a different build of moonshell due to read/write issues. T
<br/>
<br/>
hey need to spend more energy on revising software if supporting all Flash Cards. 
<br/>
But we heard that moonshell support for SC flash card has been dropped . 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don't  really understand it due to I'm not a developer.
<br/>
We had solicited  opinions from many users.
<br/>
I will discuss with our developers about related problems.

Just a little just correction.
<br/>
<br/>
As a single unit it does not move.
<br/>
<br/>
Obtaining it increased and increased and when using the [mu] [pe] [gu], it held down audio deterioration?It is it is, the intention of holding down.
<br/>
When the [yu] - the [chi] [yu] - converting from the [bu], because it converts similarly, whether it becomes the different/[ku], is.
<br/>
<br/>
That? DL it is not possible? The money you paid, but it is,?. Still, perhaps renewal job is not ended. DL please do is from the mirror server.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Corresponded to EZ4/DSLink. I wish to express my deep gratitude to Rudolph.
<br/>
'The cartridge of enhancing the memory of DS browser' can be used for the cache memory.
<br/>
The resume item was added. (sound volume, reproduction mode, and NDSLite backlight brightness)
<br/>
ResumeUsingWhileMusicPlaying item was added to [System] section of global.ini. The resume is preserved while performing the tune.
<br/>
The DPG format was renewed. As for the DPG file made with a new encoder, seek is fast and the image doesn't fall into disorder either. Especially, it is remarkable in a long video.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it supports EZ4 and DSLink now, it can use Opera DS's RAM cart as external memory, you can shutdown and it'll remember the brightness, voluime level and playback mode (if you enable resume), and there's a new DPG2 format that supports fast seeking (which LS5 is attempting to figure out and implement in BatchDPG). dpgenc's quality still sucks though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think you have a choice, because I don't think there's a .NET for Windows ME (so you won't be able to use BatchDPG either).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
