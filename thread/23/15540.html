Everything is shoved into one big asm file :). It also does some pretty weird things, like arm7/arm9 sharing the interrupt handler! :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yay, the game is pretty boring but it's much more fun when you know that it's writen in pure asm and arm7/arm9 are sharing one interrupt handler :D!

No just kidding, the source code is very usefull for learning asm (at least for me) :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.programix.info" target="_blank">My blog</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pong for the Atari 2600 used the hardware windows too, as that's all there were: two 8x1 pixel sprites, one 20x1 pixel background, and three rectangles. Everything on that system is just one big raster effect. Your use of the windows for rendering is probably the DS's closest counterpart to the Atari 2600's rectangles.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
