(And faster than when I used it to word process my assignments back in high school!)

<br/>
I assume psuedo-emulator means that it is optimised to run GEOS only on a specific build of a c64 emulator? Nice virtual keyboard too.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW. Any games in there? I couldn't find the version of mahjong I used to play heaps...

Just compare to running GEOS in FrodoDS.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to make a C64 emu, I think the DS is just not fast enough to do one that will run at full framerate (FrodoDS runs at frameskip level 9). It's a lost cause.

spinal_cord,

The .nds download is right there on the page. I kept the page as simple as possible. :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by mrsid on Sun Nov 12, 2006 12:37 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

.nds and .ds.gba are included in the zip on the site.

I never used GEOS on my C64, I only had a tape drive.  I have a C64 mouse around here somewhere.  Looks just like the Amiga mouse but it says C64 on the bottom and is wired differently.
<br/>
<br/>
Nice work.  I can't say I'll use it often but major points for the geek factor.  It works on M3CF and DS-X but I didn't try saving.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm not suppose to go to &gt; options &gt; BASIC , the cursor disappeared and I couldn't do anything after that.  Lefties would prefer R instead of L to bring up the keyboard.  Perhaps you should only have to push a button to toggle the keyboard, rather than holding down L.
<br/>
<br/>
FrodoDS could be a lot faster than it is now.  Tiles instead of framebuffer would be a nice speed increase.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, BASIC is obviously not supported. This is not a C64 emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a lefty myself, but was too lazy to implement two different usage modes. But the idea to make the keyboard button sticky is a good one.

<br/>
This would decrease its compatibility dramatically. You could only run the most simple games.
<br/>
Nearly all games on the C64 use raster-line based programming, which is not easy to emulate on a different system using the hardware features.
<br/>
And the biggest problem remains, which is the screen size difference.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You're right. I completely forgot about UltraHLE. I'm doing something very similar, but I did it in 1996, since the whole GEOS engine was written back then :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
but I've just bought the R4 card for the NintendoDS, and am very interested in getting GEOS up and running.
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded it, and did as the installation file said (copy the geos directory to the root directory)
<br/>
<br/>
But no cigar. :( I get the error. Cannot open the /geos directory
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  Or maybe it just doesnt run of a R4?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
