dslive weather

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One of the more thorough hardware diagnostics I've used for the DS.  One irritating problem occurs when going back to the main menu though.  If I tap M over the icon for the rumble test, it activates that icon.  
<br/>
<br/>
The speaker test is handy, but the on-screen doc doesn't mention the center (i.e. both speaker) test that you've implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
A couple things I'd like to see:
<br/>
<br/>
-implementation of the resetlib
<br/>
<br/>
-implementation of lick's brightness switching code
<br/>
<br/>
-coordinate feedback on stylus test as well as a cursor that points to the position rather than having the position be at the base.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know much about it, but I've always wondered why there hasn't been a comparison of code in DS roms to figure out a command to enter the Wifi setup (or if that's even possible without a bound game key to associate it with).  This sort of App would be the perfect host for something like that.  
<br/>
<br/>
As someone who's taken their DS apart multiple times, I appreciate this testing app so I can check everything before setting the last few screws.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's a very nice bit of software, kudos to the coder. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm attempting to update the stylus check to something a bit more useful, but im having memory issues. also i was thinking of making the pixel fixer customizable.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

The M button has been fixed, redownload from the direct link on the neoflash page.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm re-doing the stylus test, this time a little more useful.
<br/>
<br/>
the pixel fixer has mee modified slightly, to allow single pixel flickering (for those who worry about other pixels being affected by the flickering).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-implementation of the resetlib
<br/>
-implementation of lick's brightness switching code
<br/>
Both good ideas, ill see what i can do, although this was coded using palib,  os arm7 stuff will be a little tricky.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
