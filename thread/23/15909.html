<br/>
Does it say "Initializing FAT... Failed!", or does it just freeze on "Initializing FAT..."? The only thing I can think of that would cause this is that you didn't DLDI patch it correctly or didn't patch it at all. Instructions for DLDI patching are here: <a href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=End-user_instructions" target="_blank">http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=End-user_instructions</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I just read an e-mail from someone who said DSbible 2.0 doesn't work on their Cyclo DS but the first version does. They said that Cyclo DS auto-patches DLDI so that might not be the problem. So for now, use <a class="postlink" href="http://viewsourcecode.org/forum/bible.zip" target="_blank">DSbible 1.0</a> until I figure out how to make it work on Supercard and Cyclo DS...

For the Moonbooks contest I decided to put the Moonbooks logo on the top screen and the menu on the bottom instead of a "pre-menu" splash screen because a pre-menu splash screen can be annoying making people have to wait. But I'm also planning to enter DSbible in the Neoflash contest and for that I have to have a Neoflash pre-menu splash screen.
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I will be needing a title screen for the main menu, that would be very nice if you could make one! :) And I'll try to add WEB to the Neoflash version (especially since you're doing something for me.) Although with three 4MB Bibles the download could get big. Maybe I'll make a webpage where you can download extra Bibles to use with DSbible.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://viewsourcecode.org/" target="_blank">viewsourcecode</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That looks great! Thanks! I will use it in the next version, which'll be released in a couple weeks.
<br/>
<br/>
The World English Bible I downloaded was in DSbible's format except it had some extra formatting things like paragraphs (I think) and footnotes. So I'll try to support those in the next version, although only the WEB will have paragraphs and footnotes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://viewsourcecode.org/" target="_blank">viewsourcecode</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great! Works fine on R4. Great search function! Nice to always have a Bible nearby. Also happy to see the WEB translation. I like the different color for the footnotes. 
<br/>
<br/>
I love the fact that users can add their own favorite translations of the Bible if they have them in a text file format. This is something all the other Bible programs I have tried cannot do. If you ever want to do a version that accepts UTF-8 or UTF-16 then non-Latin character Bibles can be used, which would be great for users all over the world, not to mention missionaries. I would love to see a Japanese Bible in this. I already have the text files for the Japanese Bible.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I love the splash screen :)
<br/>
<br/>
Now everybody will think I'm playing a mindless game while I'm actually reading the Bible.
<br/>

Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are several fonts out there for Japanese on the DS, possibly many. I can read my Japanese text files on Moonshell already with no difficulty. I don't know if Moonshell carries its own fonts, or uses what is in the DS already. I don't know how these things work.
<br/>
<br/>
Considering the DS comes from Japan, it seems there would be no issues with using Japanese language.
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, my R4 built in ebook reader handles Chinese fine, but garbles Japanese. Lots of kanji but no kana.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
