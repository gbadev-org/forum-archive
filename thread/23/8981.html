    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there!
<br/>
<br/>
In case you haven't noticed, I have realeased a tracker for the DS, that can be found at <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm mainly starting this post for having a place that bugs can be reported to. 
<br/>
<br/>
My top priority with this project at the moment is making it compatible with every method to run homebrew on the DS. The methods that are confirmed to work (because I used them) are:<ul>GBAMP
<br/>
WMB
<br/>
Bafio's WiFi-loader</ul>If you have a card that is not the GBAMP, please test the program on your card and post here whether it works or not.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have other bugs to report, this is the place.
<br/>
<br/>
Bye,
<br/>
Tob</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you using your own sound system or are you using a sound system that was ported? (Like libmikmod) ..Are you using hardware channels?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Of course, I was using the M3, dunno if that would corrupt modules or not. I really should get my GBAMP up and running again.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I've thought about taking donations so that I could buy other cards to make NitroTracker compatible with them. But before that, I'll try to remote-debug it and see if I can make it run on other cards without begging for money.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'll do next is try the patched japanese FAT libs by Sata and Infantile Paralyser and ask people to test the program with them.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll also put togther a crippled version without FAT support such that I can see whether the incompatibility with some cards comes from the FAT lib or if it's something else. Also, this version would be suitable to run from a flashcart or via WMB and people could at least use microphone-recorded samples.

That's it for now, thanks for your support!

Get a SuperCard CF and make a .ds.gba (which the SC firmware calls .gba.nds), and once you get it working with GBFS, things should Just Work for flash card users.

For MP3 output, you'll need an MP3 encoder. Use ModPlug Player on the PC to render to .wav and then use lame to compress to MP3. It might be easier to do ADPCM or GSM output if your goal is to output to something that a MoonShell plug-in can read.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I was thinking of it would be nice to be able to render from the DS straight to MP3 to store on the flash card, to play in moonshell.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MoonShell's got a libmikmod plugin which plays S3M, XM, ITs and MODs with a few problems in some cases, but should play the XM files created by <b style="color:#FFA34F">Nitro</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Tracker</b> fine (though I haven't had time to try it myself)
<br/>
<br/>
Having an MP3 encoder would be pointless in the <b style="color:#FFA34F">tracker</b>. Now, having an MP3 encoder for something say, a personal recorder program for the DS, that's a different story, but then again that's also a different topic. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Thanks for the offer, but to include another filesystem library, I would have to write everything that uses the fs again for the other lib. So, I'd rather wait until flashcart support is added to chishm's lib.

That's strange because it works for melw. Have you checked the filesystem of your SD card? Perhaps try another card if you have one.

That's similar to my setup too. (Can't remember the actual make of my SD card offhand). 
<br/>
<br/>
And to double confirm, the samples do actually look corrupt in the sample viewer too. (At work at the moment, so can't provide a sample.)
<br/>
<br/>
Some samples just totally distort, whereas others have weird junk appended to the end of them.
<br/>

I'm using a Supercard SD and a TwinMOS Ultra-X 150x 512MB SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
I can load NitroTracker just fine, record samples and make songs, but the file operations don't seem to work. When I tap the file tab, the program hangs. Nothing is displayed at all in the file part of the program. I can't tap the other tabs or any of the buttons. Looks like there's some kind of problem with reading the file system on the SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
If there's anything I can do to help fix this, I'd love to help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What M3 firmware are you using? I'm using v16e and it works fine, only problem is the saving of mods, though even then I'm not sure because I haven't fully tested it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still playing with it, though.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
OK. I have used <b style="color:#FFA34F">Nitro</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Tracker</b> to create an XM file, and saved it with complete success on my (unscandisked, undefragged) compact flash card via my M3 Perfect CF.
<br/>
<br/>
There's no problems with that.
<br/>
<br/>
I then played it back in MikMod through MoonShell. It did not sound 100% the same, but that's because MikMod was playing back the envelope usage of the instrument I was using which <b style="color:#FFA34F">Nitro</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Tracker</b> ignored.
<br/>
<br/>
The sample corruption is there, though. It sounds like maybe samples that are of a certain file length are becoming corrupted. Maybe that's what it is.. It does not show in the image of the waveform in the "sample editor" tab, though. And strangely enough, it didn't sound.
<br/>
<br/>
There was no sample corruption when I put notes in channels 2 3 and 4 that have a sample that's corrupted.. but when I put it in Channel 1, it was there. Playback in MikMod for MoonShell had sample corruption, but not in the same manor as was playing back in <b style="color:#FFA34F">Nitro</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Tracker</b> (I found that REALLY odd)
<br/>
<br/>
I would certainly like some sample looping information, and some envelope support in the future, that's for sure. Those are a given.. but here are my suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
Add some lines in the patterns between rows..not the same colour as the major new hex start, perhaps an inbetween colour..Where the major colour is orange, the background colour is blue..perhaps a darker orange colour for inbetween rows that aren't every 8 lines.
<br/>
<br/>
That also is something I would hopefully like configurable in the future. I would like to be able to change where the <b style="color:#FFA34F">tracker</b> highlights these lines so that I could switch between pattern styles (so I could put in, for instance, triplets with relative ease)
<br/>
<br/>
Here are my suggestions about the pattern editor (in RECORD mode, or better yet, when the pattern editor is on the touch screen):
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, you're going to have to change that cursor from full channel to only one part of the channel (for instance, only highlighting the note, or the velocity, or the effect column, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, make the channel numbers transparent. Is that possible? The should also change colours depending on whether or not they're muted or not. (blue for active, grey for inactive?)
<br/>
<br/>
L/R should be your page up/down buttons
<br/>
Select could stop playback
<br/>
Start could start playback
<br/>
Holding Select and Pressing Start could play only that pattern repeating.
<br/>
<br/>
A = Input Button. Include the musical keyboard and the octave level thing on the touch screen. Also, give me buttons on the right of the screen that will give me A - Z and 0 - 9, you don't even need a full keyboard graphic, just something that will give easy touch-screen access to it so I can put in effects and volume. 
<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that say, if a letter/number button on the touch screen is not selected, then
<br/>
B = Clear Button. (Not Delete, clear. Delete should only be accessable on the touch screen, and include an Insert button too.) This should do the opposite of what the A button does. :D
<br/>
<br/>
Y = Shift back along A-Z and 0-9 (depending on what you're editing on that row in that channel)
<br/>
X = Shift forward along A-Z and 0-9 (ditto as before)
<br/>
<br/>
Holding Select and pushing L should solo a channel
<br/>
Holding Select and pushing R should toggle a channel mute
<br/>
Holding Select and pushing up/down/Left/Right should highlight part of the pattern
<br/>
Holding Select and pushing Y should copy
<br/>
Holding Select and pushing X should cut
<br/>
Holding Select and pushing A should paste
<br/>
Holding Select and Pushing B should Mix Paste (paste inbetween notes that may already be there, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
Include an "undo" button in the bottom right of the touch screen if that's at all possible.
<br/>
<br/>
These are things that would definately get me tracking faster on my DS. :) You could also have a slider bar for quick and easy "hex number" input, though I don't know if that will be necessary. Of course, it's sensitivity will depend mainly on whether what you're editing can use only one digit, or two, and of course, would edit only what the cursor is currently selecting (if it's on a note, or if it's in the volume column, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
These changes might take time but it will definately improve the pattern editor, immensely. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
Input button as in, the general "Put stuff in" button for every column in a channel/row in the pattern editor. You would have a number or letter selected on, say the right of the touch screen, and pressing A would input it. Or, for easier and faster editing, Y/X would change the values without having to use the touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
When I track, I use the keyboard way more than the mouse :) Which is why I think having all these button combos is important.
<br/>
<br/>
Could holding R and moving up and down be the "page up/page down" function, and holding R and moving left and right be the "beginning of/end of pattern" function? That might work better :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you need a "keyboard retrigger" ability. When you hold down a button, it needs to keep doing that function, for instance. :D

One more thing. You know that little flashy scrolling effect you've got for debug? Could you do that when flipping screens? Like a screen "shuffle" or something? (It doesn't have to animate slowly..it would just look cool. ;D)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I have nDS the first one not light one... it says that it's produced in 2004... Got mario game with it...well im a musician and im not that much into coding or anything like that... i used so far nanoloop for making music... and then few days ago i saw the nitrotracker wich looks awsome and i wanted to work with it... i have GBA movie player 2nd version  and good will for doing this :).
<br/>
Can anyone tell me what do i need to do or have to run this beauty of homebrew on my DS.
<br/>
Oh yeah i forgot i'v done the firmware test and i have both screens blue. they look very much like this one posted here.

I don't know if your blue is the V2 blue or the V6 blue. If you have a Ralink RT2500 wireless card at hand you can find out by sending wifime to your DS. Depending on whether you have a V2 or a V6 DS, you have to buy a PassMe or a PassMe 2. By the way, when did you buy your DS? If your DS was one of the first, you can be sure that you have V2 and not V6.

If it was from 2004 I'd bet you have one of the firmwares compatible with a PassMe.  Did you get the metroid demo with it?  If so, that's pretty much a certain thing you will be able to get a PassMe.

It's a cool idea. How about this:
<br/>
<br/>
Select - Plays back current pattern, and stops playback
<br/>
Start - Plays back song, and also pauses playback
<br/>
<br/>
Could R + Start playback the song from the current cursor position?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually an Impulse <b style="color:#FFA34F">Tracker</b> junkie, A lot of my suggestsions were based around Impulse <b style="color:#FFA34F">Tracker</b>'s functionality and stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
0xtob, I have a bunch of feature requests regarding effects in the pattern too, but that will probably require a lot more coding, I'll wait before I make those suggestions.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You guys are way off topic ;) Anyway 0xtob, some of my other feature requests included:
<br/>
<br/>
-Effect/volume column gradient slide, akin to Impulse <b style="color:#FFA34F">Tracker</b>. How IT would do it is you'd highlight the beginning value to the end value, and it would calculate slides depending on what the first and last values were. It could be activated via an "effect dialog box" on the touch screen that would pop up. For instance, you push the "Effect" button on the right of the touch screen in pattern edit mode, then click "Gradient slide" 
<br/>
<br/>
Example of how it works:
<br/>
<br/>
C-4 01 64 .--
<br/>
--- -- -- .--
<br/>
--- -- -- .--
<br/>
--- -- -- .--
<br/>
C-5 01 00 .--
<br/>
<br/>
would become:
<br/>
<br/>
C-4 01 64 .--
<br/>
--- -- 48 .--
<br/>
--- -- 32 .--
<br/>
--- -- 16 .--
<br/>
C-5 01 00 .--
<br/>
<br/>
Same idea for the effect column :)
<br/>
<br/>
Another idea for the effect dialogue box:
<br/>
<br/>
Amplification.
<br/>
<br/>
C-4 01 32 .-- (highlight it, click Effect button, click, "Amplify" button and put in your percentage value, hit a "go" button)
<br/>
Would become:
<br/>
C-4 01 48.--
<br/>
<br/>
All these things make tracking faster, and would make tracking on the DS no less powerful than tracking on a pc. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

There are some very bad mod files out there, yes. ;) RPGs like that beg for traditional style emotional music, which I offered to supply but he said no. *shrug*

And the graphics..well, I guess you're right about that, but the characters look so.. ugh. There are better sprites out there, like say, Tales of Phantasia sprite sheets.

What are the rules for the contest btw? If you design a program for said contest, do you have to, you know...keep the splash screen on?

Keep up your great work and hopefully one day the SuperCard CF file access problem can be resolved (yeah, like most of the SuperCard CF user experienced, the system hangs up once you tap on the directory tab)!  
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don't mind that I put a link to your site in my blog.

Also, I write Chinese lyrics for the songs my friend Meth wrote and arranged.  You can listen to one of our songs at <a class="postlink" href="http://www2.uzone21.com/creative/music/index.epl?id=199" target="_blank">http://www2.uzone21.com/creative/music/index.epl?id=199</a>.

I'm currently listening to that song. I don't understand a word, but the music is really good! It's nice to have the attention of some people that know how to make music, because, honestly, I suck at tracking :-) And guys like tssf are coming up with some great suggestions.

And yes, it it closed source at the moment, the reason for which is that the source code is (in my opinion) not clean enough for a GPL release. I'm planning to make it open source though, once I have the motivation to clean it up.

Hey don't push yourself too hard.  We are already very thankful for your contribution.  In fact your app got me so excited that I was thinking of write a simple apps myself just to test the water.  I write C# code for Hong Kong government projects as day job, and was always thinking of writing some simple education app that trains my chord recognition skill.  How did you get started on NDS dev?  (I know this is kind of FAQ, but I was interest in knowing how YOU start it.)
<br/>
<br/>
Later dude!

P.S. heck, would it be cool if there's a NitroTracker -&gt; MIDI file converter so that I can put what I started on the road and continue developing some more sophistate in a PC/Mac sequencer like Calkwalk Sonar.  Just dreaming :-&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can use MODPlug Tracker to convert xm/mod files to MIDI, but they often don't convert very well. But if you get a default setup for an xm that exports to a MIDI file nicely then you could probably do it. You could always import the xm from NitroTracker into <a class="postlink" href="http://www.skale.org/" target="_blank">Sk@le Tracker</a> and continue composing on PC.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But they have become rather outdated and I would not recommend them for beginners. I really like the <a class="postlink" href="http://patatersoft.info/manual.html" target="_blank">homebrew manual</a> that Patater has writen recently. I think you should use that. Other than that, you should think of simple programs that you could write to learn DS coding and just implement them. Start off with simple ideas, like draing on the screen with the stylus and then think of more complicated things, like a tiled map, sound output, microphone recording, maybe even 3D. Search these forums or the rest of the web if you have questions and join the #dsdev IRC channel on EFNet that's full of people who don't mind giving newbies a hand. You  can also find some tutorials in the <a class="postlink" href="http://tobw.net/dswiki" target="_blank">DS Wiki</a>. If you find something that you think is badly documented (and you will find lots of these things), feel free to add it to the DS Wiki.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not going to be easy and you sometimes have to code very close to the hardware (juggling with registers and stuff), but it's totally woth the effort because the DS is an awesome platform to code for.
<br/>
<br/>
OK, hope this help you get started!

Apart from Impulse Tracker's resonant filter, effects don't use much CPU either; the majority just change the playback rate and volume. Even NT2 and Famitracker, which play back using a fraction of the CPU power of an 1.8 MHz 8-bit 6502 CPU, have MOD style effects.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yes, as tepples said, the DS is well capable of the functionality of a complete PC tracker. NitroTracker is still far from it, but I hope to achieve FT2-equivalence sometime. Thanks for you cool track! You're only the second person who actually send me something he's made with the tracker. Once all cards have proper write support (perhaps already next version), there'll be a NitroTracker tracking compo, so I get to hear some more music :-)
<br/>

compacho:
<br/>
Hey cool! But I think the last note has to be a "C". Also, where I come from, the scale goes CDEFGAH. The "B" is the halftone before the "H", but I think this notation is different in other countries.

Same thing happened on the GBA, even in commercial games. When it uses more CPU time to mix the audio, the CPU draws more current. When the waveform is larger, the amplifier draws more current. Put together, it could look vaguely like it's flashing to the beat.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">headspin:
<br/>
Wow! Now that looks really slick! I'm impressed! You got me thinking abot adding some kind of skin support, because it would be really cool if the <b style="color:#FFA34F">tracker</b> could look like this. Damn, the keyboard looks much more plastic than mine! (And I thought I had done a pretty good job with it :-) In comparison to that, my interface looks like a toy.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, at some point, I want to re-write a major part of my graphics code, because I'm currently using 16bit ERBs which use all the VRAM. My plan was to use paletted backgrounds and then make parts of the palette customizable to support color themes. The current graphics are created completely procedural (except for the keyboard and typewriter). This has the advantage that I can create widgets with arbitrary sizes (you see there are eight different sizes of buttons only in the main view). Do you have an idea how add skin support without losing this possibility? Perhaps I'll stick to the idea with the color themes, but make certain elements skinnable, like the icons, the background of the sample view, the keyboard (but then I would need a file format that includes the tile set, the palette and the tile map), etc. What do you think?
<br/>
<br/>
Another problem are fonts: As you see, the current font on the bottom screen (which is the original FT2-font btw :-) is too broad. If it was more narrow, the file names and instrument names would not have to be cut off, or at least a larger part of them would be visible. On the other hand, I don't know if a narrower font would decrease readability, and I had no complaints about that so far. So, are you any good at designing pixel fonts? :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm really impressed by your designs and I would like to cooperate with you to get them into the program.
<br/>
<br/>
Darkflame:
<br/>
I wanted to implement it, but then I realized that chishm's lib has no methods for finding out the free space on the card. I'll ask him if it's possible to add this. But, what you can do is (at least it worked with my GBAMP): You can just pull out your card while NitroTracker is running (Just don't do it during a file transaction!), delete some files with your PC, and plug it back into your DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oxtob: Glad you like the skin :) Well, to be honest most of the skin is in fact just a colour scheme change. The music keyboard and text keyboard are obviously shaded differently - so you could just have them loaded in as a tile sheet and then have an external config file that defines the colour scheme. If your using procedures to draw the controls (I was guessing you were doing something like that because they weren't always 8-pixel aligned) then I've mainly added a 3d effect to the buttons which is just a light and dark colour on the edge of the buttons to give the effect of light from the corner. Feel free to use the colour scheme, I would just use the colour picker in Photoshop or some other paint program to get the values. My guess is you could get a very close effect by just changing the colour scheme and adding 2 colour outline to the buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples has created some nice fonts, perhaps you could post the FT2 font and he could try and make a smaller variable font using it. Or perhaps there is a nicer font to use, not sure?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is just THE BEST HANDHELD PROGRAMME EVER! (for me anyway!)
<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe that it's now possible for me to make a track on the train/bus on the way to and from work, convert it in Modplug <b style="color:#FFA34F">Tracker</b> VST when I get home and then export to Cubase to for the final mixdown (all within 1 day)
<br/>
<br/>
NitroTracker is amazing! The interface is great. It's really easy to use (well I've been tracking for over 10 years now although it might be hard for people new to tracking) and the way the stylus and touch screen have been used in the tracking environment is sheer genius!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Future suggestions would be to allow a "scroll down by specified number of lines" feature on say Button R (ie. if the number is set to 4, you'd be able to scroll down by 4 lines at a time by pressing R): if possible it would be good if you could also scroll up (by a specified number of lines) using the "Directional Up + Button R"
<br/>
<br/>
Specified looping of samples would be great (I'm not entirely sure of the constains of the .XM format as I have been tracking strictly in .IT format for the past 8 years and .mod/.med formats prior to that). Any sample editing features full stop would be great really!
<br/>
<br/>
The most important for me at the moment though would be a way to control the volume levels on each of the channels (if there isn't one already that is).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless all of these requests are just like having icing on an already great tasting cake.
<br/>
<br/>
I've had my DS and GBAMP for about 5 months now, and for me, this is the first killer homebrew app (to the extent that I bought a PassMe immediately because of it). I used to dream of someone creating a program like this when I owned a GP32 but nobody got round to it.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS and it's touch screen is definitely far more suited to handheld music making.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now if someone can write a seperate sample editing/effects program (like a mini Soundforge / CoolEdit), the DS will truly be the best portable studio ever!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
miraclefx: Wow, I'm really glad you like it so much. Thanks very much for the nice comments :-) I don't know if you know it, but there's the "fast scroll" mode that's triggered by holding the B-Button. When you press the D-pad up/down, it scrolls 4 rows at once. Should the amount of rows be configurable? Looping is already supported by the XM player class, it's just not yet in the user interface, but it will come in 0.2 or so, together with sample editing. Channel volumes are not supported by XM, but instrument volumes are, which should be sufficient in most cases.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, there is a <b style="color:#FFA34F">tracker</b> for the GP32 now, called <a class="postlink" href="http://www.10pm.org/nostromo/lgpt/" target="_blank">LittleGPTracker</a>. It's not comparable to NitroTracker though, as it is a clone of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/" target="_blank">LSDJ</a> for the Game Boy, which is rather minimalistic because of the Game Boy's limited sound hardware, but very popular in the chiptune community.
<br/>
<br/>
OK, have fun then! Also, I'd love to hear some music you made with it.

It's AMAZING!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Little bug in lefty mode...
<br/>
<br/>
The popup for recording samples still says "hold a to record" even though it is now looking for me to press the right d-pad button.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And... a request (of course). I think it would be awesome to have a direct, unaltered mic recording option somewhere.
<br/>
That way, NitroTracker could also be used to record complete audio (well, somewhat long, probably limited by RAM) directly, to be listened to later.
<br/>
<br/>
One extreme useage would be recording audio of notes (the boring school kind with letters ranging beyond F) instead of writing them... and a more sensible use would be using a real life instrument amongst the regular samples.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not really entirely sure how this would fit in, but it could be as simple as a special key that doesn't change the sample in any way. (Unless there already is one...).
<br/>
A record toggle would be cool to go with that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, no pressure :)
<br/>
Great work so far!
<br/>
Very original, too... Better than some PC <b style="color:#FFA34F">tracker</b> apps.
<br/>
Just for fun, you should see how close Nintendo would come to publishing this. (You'd probably need some pretty extensive lies to get them to pay attention though, knowing them).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

There are two kinds of conversion: playback at a higher pitch and actual resampling. If you don't know how to do resamping in your favorite audio editor, you can do so in SoX.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Thanks for the good suggestion.  Metal.zip is indeed a great all around sound pack for NitroTracker!  And that's my "default" sound pack these days.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I was wondering if someone has a list of suggested NitroTracker friendly sound sample pack for each music style.  Like a pack for HipHop, a pack for pop ballad.  Stuff like that.  I said this because I went to <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu" target="_blank">http://freesound.iua.upf.edu</a> and found myself pretty clueless, not knowing what sample or pack works for NitroTracker, when all I know is trying to find some nice piano and music box sound to write a short pop ballad tune for my sweetheart  ;-&gt; .

A lot of research on how the mod files work could be beneficial. Read tracking tutorials, experiment. If you hear an effect in a mod file you like, you should load it up in a tracker and check to see how the effect was achieved.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, don't distort your samples, don't overuse surround sound, and don't clutter the patterns with useless/unused stuff. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I've been looking into DSness and its homebrew scene for a while but seem to have completely missed this application, which for me, would be singlehandedly the most excellent thing I could have on the SD card.

To be able to create some music on the move would be awesome and its now the reason I have to get my ds and superpass etc asap.

Hey Tobs,
<br/>
<br/>
Props for mentionning LGPT here... handheld tracker a for sure an exciting field to work on... been thinking about a DS port but I guess it is good each of the console got it's special little app :)
<br/>
<br/>
Just for putting things right, LittleGPTracker does NOT try to emulate the gameboy chip... it is based on the user interface and philosophy of LittleSoundDJ but the sound engine is purely sample based, just like Nitro.

<br/>
Good luck &amp; &lt;3

Hi! Nice that you're interested in my program.
<br/>
<br/>
The G6 Lite is not a good solution for NitroTracker at the moment, because NitroTracker only supports reading from/writing to devices that are supported by Chishm's FATlib, which are the GBAMP, all variants of the M3 and all variants of the SuperCard. Support for other cards may come, though.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBAMP is generally considered the best solution for homebrew, but it sticks out of the DS Lite pretty bad. The are SD/miniSD variants of the M3/SuperCard don't stick out too bad in my opinion (I have an M3 miniSD which so far worked fine with the homebrew I tested). But PassCard should be fine.
<br/>

Oh, I see. Thanks, that is great, however it is not what I expected. I thought they would allow you to change the volume in the volume column of the tracker (so it is not always FF), but they just change the master volume of the sample, which can be done with the new amplitude scaling anyway. Tuning is nice, yes, but I still don't know how to edit the volume to be anything other than full (FF).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Haha, ok. We anxiously await all FT2 features and more of course :].. As it is some nice simple tunes can be made; at least it is very useful for jotting down melodies on the fly.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey, great work! i got my ds lite today, have been messing around with the program a little. pretty amazing, actually! 
<br/>
<br/>
couple of questions:
<br/>
<br/>
- output sounds like it's 8bit/22khz (or thereabouts) - am i close here? is this a DS hardware limitation? i'm guessing there is no way to do interpolation in hardware? not really a biggy, i can always dump to my pc to render.
<br/>
- having some weird problems loading my wav sample library - when i load a sample, it plays at a really low sample rate until i go into the sample editor and change the note tuning values up. maybe it's just my samples? i can send some if you're interested.
<br/>
- feature request: when you click on a sample in the file dialog, it'd be great to hear a preview of the first second of that sample.
<br/>
<br/>
i've worked around the lack of volume column issue (at least for short samples) by loading multiple copies of the same sample and setting different volumes. i'm thinking for editing volume column, the best way to do it would be to have a volume bar (like a scroll bar) in the keyboard window that has values from 0x00 to 0xff, so you can just click in the bar and go back to editing notes and they'll all go in at that value.
<br/>
<br/>
another feature request: an alternative keyboard view w/ 4 "percussion" pads that can each be assigned to any sample at a specified note. for example, if you had kick drum, hi hat, snare and cymbal samples, you could assign each of these to a pad; it'd make it really easy to enter percussion patterns (instead of hunt-and-peck/swap between samples). of course, if you get XI support in there this won't matter as much.
<br/>
<br/>
i'll put these in the wiki anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
but yeah, awesome stuff! so impressed. i look forward to the train to work tomorrow, got a few ideas to try out.
<br/>

cheers!

No. But for some kinds of music, especially chiptunes, you don't want linear interpolation. You want <a class="postlink" href="http://www.slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/" target="_blank">band-limited nearest-neighbor interpolation</a>, and plain nearest-neighbor is the cheap approximation.

this response doesn't make any sense to me. i know about midi positions, but don't see how this relates to nitrotracker and its current ability to have one sample per 'instrument' - actually there are no instruments, just samples. the guy wants to be able to play different samples without switching in the sample-list, either by having instruments (xi's) and map different samples to different keyboard keys (like you seem to describe) or having a new drum-pad feature that is like one pseudo-instrument.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

not familiar with blnn interpolation, cheers for the info.

in any case, the output quality from NT is a lot fuzzier with the samples i'm using than, say, New Super Mario Bros. or even Moonshell's XM player (because of the dithering maybe?).

"fmt" chunk in RIFF WAV header has the sample rate. "smpl"/"inst" chunks have tuning info (note/finetune). These would be much better than a default of 8kHz (most of my recent sample sets are going to be closer to at least 22kHz for middle C, which might explain the stupid amount of aliasing i'm getting). i was reporting a separate bug though, which is everything sounds weird on load; setting the tuned note up a semitone and down a semitone makes everything work properly. i'll get some video of it if anyone wants to see?

<br/>
as others have paraphrased: i just want to punch drum patterns in really quickly. without a physical keyboard, the system really needs as many shortcuts as possible.  i'll typically build my drum patterns up from cut up loops; we're talking a usual minimum of 2 kicks, 2 normal snares, a ghost snare, 2 closed hi hat and an open hi hat, so i can reshuffle the order of hits and get some nice free flowing groove happening.
<br/>
<br/>
another request, because i'm greedy: either implementation of the XM pattern speed command (F0x, from memory?) so we can fake "swing" by setting the speed like F08 F04 F08 F04 on alternating rows, or an overall swing feature. very useful for getting a nice feel in a track.

No. But for some kinds of music, especially chiptunes, you don't want linear interpolation. You want <a class="postlink" href="http://www.slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/" target="_blank">band-limited nearest-neighbor interpolation</a>, and plain nearest-neighbor is the cheap approximation.

i went over that link - what's described there looks like it's just a synthesis technique, not an interpolation mode for freeform samples. from what i can tell, the closest approximation to BLNN i can think of would be the non-realtime sinc rendering which some trackers have (which isn't really going to work on a DS). or am i totally off track? i haven't really touched DSP stuff for about 8 years, uni was a long time ago...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Imagine synthesizing the Game Boy/GBC/GBA tone generator 3 with this. You take the sample up a few discrete steps, then down a few discrete steps, etc. depending on the first difference of the waveform data. Then do the same thing with a wavetable that has more than 32 steps. Resampling using band-limited square wave basis functions is like nearest-neighbor in that it preserves source aliasing (so that square waves and the like don't sound muddy at low pitches) and the overall -6 dB/octave tilt up to inf Hz characteristic of square waves. But it is unlike nearest-neighbor in that it eliminates destination aliasing.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
a pulse in the f-domain (i.e. brickwall filter) is a sinc fn in the t-domain; i was talking about filtering by convolving your samples with the sinc fn. the problem: it's slow as hell, even on a fast PC. i suspect doing this to a regular square wave would give you a band-limited square wave, btw. 
<br/>
<br/>
linear interpolation (+ simple LP filtering) would be very nice to have for the stuff i'm working on, if the DS can handle it.
<br/>
<br/>
very low priority compared to "fix pattern corruption bugs", though, to be honest. i think it's something to do with some of the large samples i'm using?

It would sound better to use a low-pass filter before you decimate the sample. Do you know how to do convolution? If so, try the 5-tap kernel [-1 2 6 2 -1]/8, which factors to [1 1] * [1 1] * [-1 4 -1] / 8.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples: I don't know the exact sampling frequency that made the DS crash, but it was really high. The problem is, that frequencies grow exponentially to the octaves, i.e. the frequency is doubled from octave to octave. OK, you probably know that, but I explain it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
In XM, the sampling frequency that corresponds to C-4 is 8363. The highest note on the keyboard in XM trackers is H-7 (yeah, here's my german H again :-) H-7 is C-4 + 47 notes.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, you can assign a relative note to an instrument. This is the note that is mapped to C-4 on the keybord. A value of 0 means C-4 is mapped to C-4. The maximum value of relative note is 71, which corresponds to H-9.
<br/>
<br/>
So, if H-9 is mapped to C-4 then the note that is mapped to H-7 is A#13 (=C-4 + 47 + 71), which is the highest possible note in XM.
<br/>
<br/>
The frequency of a sample played back at A#13 is:
<br/>
8363 * 2^(118/12) = 7629400.04 samples per second
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's forgivable for the DS to be incapable of downsampling samples with that sample rate, but it would have spared me some work.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the hint with the lowpass filter. I'll give it a shot.

I use Sata's modified FATlib which has support for Supercard (mini)SD, but which is very slow on this device. Once it supports all the features I need, I will swap to Chishm's new libfat which has Supercard (mini)SD support implemented by "the master himself". This should probably hopefully solve the problem with slow file access.

*Jin - it sounds like you're not properly set up for running homebrew. Firstly, your DS needs to be 'flashed' or have a 'passme' type device inserted. See here:

<br/>
<br/>
Also, if your GBA Movie Player is booting to the menu page, then it also needs flashing, plus you'll need a copy of 'moonshell' on the CF card (it functions as a replacement menu/loader) as well as Nitrotracker

Sounds like you've flashed the GBAMP correctly now, so its probably a botched moonshell installation. To make life easier for you I've hosted a copy of the one I use here:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="ftp://danielkeeling-1504754:HjXhQaM8@hosting.123-reg.co.uk/Moonshell.zip" target="_blank">ftp://danielkeeling-1504754:HjXhQaM8@hosting.123-reg.co.uk/Moonshell.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
extract that onto the ROOT directory of your CF card. Then run as normal, it should boot straight into moonshell. If it doesn't, you messed the flashing up.
<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how it goes
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
emphyrian/serf: I had reports of NitroTracker not working correctly on newer M3 miniSDs, but I thought it would work fine on M3 SD. Please tell me if older releases work. Else, contact me and I'll bomb you with debug versions :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone: I've found a serious bug in the "ins" button in the pattern view. Avoid this button for now as it causes memory corruption and thus random crashes. Use cut/paste instead. It will be fixed in the next version. Sorry for the inconvenience.

<br/>
I'm working on 0.2.1 which will have improved usability, stability and compatibility. Can't promise any date though, as my coding time is limited atm.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made an account here at gbadev.org just to say how awesome this app is for the DS. Amazing work 0xtob! I have a soft spot for chiptunes and with this app, the idea of being to make tunes on the go is extraordinary. 
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to ask however, Nitrotracker v0.2 crashes fairly often on my DS when trying to save or sometimes loading samples but it's something I can cope with. The real problem I'm having is the slowness of the tracker when I open the file browser. Simply opening the browser will cause the app to stall for about 5-10 seconds. Entering/Leaving a folder would also cause the app to do the same thing. Is this problem due to an incompatibility with the equipment I'm using? Or perhaps it's something else completely? 
<br/>
<br/>
My DS is one of the first models that came out (I think it's the old Platinum Silvers). It's flashed with FlashMe v7 and I use a Supercard SD flashed with the latest firmware along with a Centrios 66x 256 MB SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that however, and aside from the crashing, the tracker works great. 
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you best of luck with your projects, 0xtob! Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just to clarify: "now" means "in the next version"

jin:
<br/>
Hmm, this is strange. Does the GBAMP still work in GBA mode? Perhaps try flashing it again? I'm really running out of ideas :-/
<br/>
<br/>
mrpham:
<br/>
Hey, thank you very much! Sorry about the crashes. They will get less frequent and eventually disappear completely as the tracker progresses. As pointed out by dub3000, there are some "risky" things to do. Also you have to be careful about memory usage, as the tracker currently does not check if you try to use too much memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Extreme slowness on SC SD is a known problem of FATlib. I hope this will be fixed at some point, but that's up to the great people working on the FATlib (chishm and several other contributors).
<br/>
<br/>
dub3000:
<br/>
Really well done track! I could never come up with that! Hooray for traffic jams! Must have been a pain to make without control over the volume colmn. I should really do something about this.
<br/>
<br/>
Little correction: "del" has no known problems in 0.2. All these problems will be fixed in the next release.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I'm still on it, only my coding time is very limited at the moment.

Is this a SuperCard miniSD you're having the trouble with? The next version of NitroTracker will use a newer FATlib that might potentially fix it. And even if it doesn't, I'm sure it will be fixed at some point. I'm just not the person responsible for the FATlib, so I can't tell when.

<br/>
I'm a nitro tracker fan from London.. etc.
<br/>
<br/>
And first of all..Tob.. thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
Your tracker is as far as I'm concerned the tidiest bit of homebrew on the ds so far.
<br/>
<br/>
And as a musician, this is great for me. Love it!
<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are a few things I've found problems with with v0.2+ my setup [supercard lite, micro sd 1gb, superkey] .
<br/>
<br/>
I can't seem to save, at all, which is a shame. The saving process appears to happen, but the resulting save file never appears.
<br/>
<br/>
Also:
<br/>
<br/>
When I load in .wav samples from my collection I get issues.
<br/>
<br/>
First, the sample plays back in a massively glitched out/low/bitcrushed way.
<br/>
<br/>
I can sort of fix this by playing with the relative pitch, but this doesn't fix the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
At a higher pitch the sample sounds correct, but then, at the end of the sample, it glitches. At the end of every sample I hear the sample again, an octave up, then another octave up, unitl there is a machinegun type glitch of barely audible noise. Very weird. And almost impossble to work with.
<br/>
<br/>
This problem does not occur at all with samples recorded in with the mic.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I am so impressed with the design of Nitrotracker, really works with the stylus/dual screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Feature Requests!
<br/>
<br/>
An effect collumn, with the ability to manipulate sample offset [0900] ?
<br/>
The possibiolty to tell a sample to play to it's end, or to stop.
<br/>
Sample looping? Pitch envelopes? [much like the fade out/in but with the ability to make a pitch bend.]
<br/>
Rudimentary insert effects? [Delay line, sample reduction? ]
<br/>
<br/>

I guess you mixed something up. You don't have to use an the official GBAMP firmware patch, but an unofficial patched firmware made by chishm. This firmware then allows to load DS homebrew software from your CF card. It is available from <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDSMP/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

A question : I test a XM and it miss 2 channels in the song, this 2 are empty. Is it normal ?
<br/>
<br/>
After some tests : most of my XM files crash NT, crash after have delete a song for a new.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem : i don't see anything on the pattern screen :) Seriously, it's too small.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NitroTracker only supports 16 channels. If the channels you are missing are above 16, there's nothing you can so. If they are below 16,please send me the XM so I can have a look.
<br/>
<br/>
XM files cause NitroTracker to crash if they are too big. This is due to the limited RAM of the DS (4MB).  Taking into account NT's own size in RAM and the memory overhead of an XM, I guess the maximum XM size is something around 1.5 MB.
<br/>
<br/>
I did all I could for displaying as much as possible on the pattern screen. A smaller font would be unreadable. I will probably make the columns configurable, so you can disable the volume colmn for example and display more channels at once.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The XM I can read weigh 1.3mb. The 5 others XM I can't read weigh less than 120 kb. In fact all XM songs of the same artist crash with NT.

About column : Yes resizable will be great, and yesterday I imagined to have focus on a column  which would be a bit bigger than others. Like the visual effects we can see with MacOs or Enlightenment 17 under Linux.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, after 2 days to 'tame' the NT interface, I have some suggestions-questions :
<br/>
<br/>
About Tool Button :
<br/>
- The NT tutorial says nothing about the 'Tool Button' : what is the use for 'Handedness' &gt; left/right ?
<br/>
- Will you plan to add some features for this Tool section ?
<br/>
<br/>
About Pattern screen :
<br/>
- After some hours, my brain told me : why not use the R button to have a menu with options ? 
<br/>
- Miss the important 'Loop' action !!! :-) Not easy to create a pattern if we can listen again &amp; again &amp; again automatically.
<br/>
- May it be to enable/disable the channels we just want to see ? ex : if I have 10 channels, I would have 10 little buttons I could set and say to NT : please display just channel 1 3 5.
<br/>
- Same suggestion for mute/un-mute a channel.
<br/>
<br/>
About recording with microphone :
<br/>
- I suppose I shall sing out after I press on A ? The sample is very short, is it a normal result ?
<br/>
<br/>
About the general interface :
<br/>
- Hum.... NEAR PERFECTION ? :-) Very simple to use.

I apologize for the horrible lack of updates, which is due to three reasons<ul>
<br/>
<li>I've had little free time in the last three months
<br/>
</li><li>Some major changes in NT are due (porting graphics to 8bit, somehow getting more space for the XM player on the arm7)
<br/>
</li><li>I've been working on another yet-to-be-announced project (which NitroTracker will also benefit from ;-)
<br/>

I have several nice new ideas for NT which I personally find very exciting. Just be patient :-)

There will probably first be a bugfix and compatibility release, then I'll approach the major changes and new features.

Sorry, but the max media dock is not supported by NitroTracker. The problem is that Datel doesn't release a FAT library for it. The problem that you can't tap on anything is probably not related to the FATlib, but to the way the MMD loads nds files. If you catch me on IRC (#dsdev on Blitzed), we can look into this problem, but I guess the FAT issue can't be fixed without them releasing a proper fatlib.

Hmm, this concept is new to me too. I'm not sure if a thing like this works with the way in which you arrange drum beats in a tracker. But I guess you want this as a separate program anyway. Technically it should be quite possible.

<br/>
im a noob here, just got a nintendo ds lite, and cant wait to get started using nitro tracker.

i neeed a little help tho, as there seems to be many hardware options available to run nitro tracker on. 
<br/>
ive done some reading up on it, and have a fair idea of what is needed now.
<br/>
<br/>
although the most compatible option seems to be using the GBAMP/MML combo, it seems  a little too bulky for me.
<br/>
<br/>
so far the best option i have found is the DS-Xtreme. a bit expensive, but seems worth it , due to the huge 4GB memory, and easy of use.
<br/>
<br/>
I am aware this is also a now product, and seems to be on pre-order.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone here confirm that the DS-Xtreme is compatible and working without problems in Nitro Tracker?

DS-Xtreme does seem to own all the other carts ive seen.

Hi again, do u mean 4Gb, as in 4 giga-bit?

512meg seems a little low actually, thats a bit disapointing.

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reply's Tob, they have been really helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
I do have i final question however.
<br/>
<br/>
I think maybee i will go for the supercard lite micro.
<br/>
<br/>
just a bit dubious if ill be able to save with this cart.
<br/>
<br/>
i've heard mixed opinions in this forum of it working with moonshell patcher, 
<br/>
and others saying its not working atall. (saving that is)
<br/>
<br/>
can anyone here confirm from experience that save is working, and also file navigation is not toooooooo slow??
<br/>
<br/>
cheers guys,  and big respect to Tob for making such a cool program ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i think i may have found the most ideal cart, the NinjaPass X9 !!

looks well sweet,

like the DS-Xtreme but accepts micro sd carts,

and its a lot cheaper , infact it is very reasonably priced.

the ninjapass x9 does not appear to support homebrew atall at the mo, also seems a little sketchy compatibility wise and with saving. 
<br/>
<br/>
looks like a supercard lite all the way then.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
just one thing that i thaught about tho, which i guess would affect everyone here using slot 2 carts (running a no pass in slot 1 too), is the impact on battery life.
<br/>
<br/>
do you find that you get much less battery life when using homebrew, compared to just playing a normal DS game cart ? 
<br/>
<br/>
is it possible that flashing a ds could potentially give better battery performance as slot 1 would be vacant, therefore consume less power??

<br/>
<br/>
I still cannot save nitrotracker songs on my supercard lite with sandisk ultraII microsd.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried using the moonshell patcher to no avail, once going through the save process everything seems to work but there is never a saved file.
<br/>
It kind of limits my enjoyment of NT because I'd not bother to complete a complex song if I can't save it for later perusal.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've spoke to you t0b via email about this and I'm not trying to hassle but I'd be interested to know why I can't save and others can?

If it's possible for someone to send me their working supercard lite nitrotracker file then I'll format my sandisk and test that out, as a trial and error method.

Yanking the NoPass means starting your DS with the NoPass inserted and then taking it out while the DS is running. As The NoPass is only required for booting from the GBA slot, it won't be needed afterwards and can be taken out. But I have no idea if this really increases the battery life.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Currently NitroTracker has a bug that causes the relative note and finetune values of a loaded wav file to be calculated wrongly, so they are played at a very low frequency. So after loading a wav you have to adjust the relative note manually.
<br/>
<br/>
If this does not fix the problem, then your wavs are probably compressed. You can use an audio editor like Audacity to convert them to uncompressed PCM wavs.
<br/>

<br/>
* The maximum file size is limited by the DS's RAM

I cannot say precisely how big an XM file may be, as that depends on the number/length of samples, but generally I think everything under 1MB should be pretty safe.

Hi there!
<br/>
<br/>
im having a hard time deciding on which cart to buy!
<br/>
<br/>
its either gonna be a m3 lite perfect, or a supercard lite, 
<br/>
but i've heard both mixed opinions of compatibility for both of them!
<br/>
<br/>
help!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
from what i've read:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sc lite - should be able to save, but file access is slow, however some users have been unable to save atall. 
<br/>
<br/>
may take a risk on this one, it is fairly cheap anyhow, also seems to have good homebrew compatibility.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
m3 lite perfect: reported save working, but how fast is file access????
<br/>
<br/>
if it's fast, i think ill go for this one. (also prefer the sd card hidden)
<br/>
<br/>
m3 lite seems like a safer bet, but how is other homebrew compatibility with this card??? (is it true that ds organise dropped m3 support?)
<br/>
does it really work well with nitrotracker (saving that is)
<br/>
<br/>
also i found this reported bug in the wiki for m3 lite pro:
<br/>
<br/>
Nitro Tracker shows the Disk tab (2nd tab) and hangs (stops responding to input) 
<br/>
<br/>
--- maybee this only happens with the "pro" version. can anyone confirm?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if i decide to go with the m3lite perfect, what are the main advantages over the supercard, they really seem pretty well matched, im not fussed too much about gba compatibility anyhow.
<br/>
<br/>
Is the m3 lite perfect really worth the extra cash??
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(sorry for asking so many qustions guys got a bit carried away!)
<br/>

Well, I have absolutely no idea about the homebrew compatibility of the m3 lite perfect, but reinmoon has support for m3 lite, so it could work with their FAT driver. I also don't know if newer fatlibs fix the slowness with SC lite :-/ I'll try different versions once my SC lite arrives. At the moment, I'd say go for a SC Lite, because it's been around for a little longer and from what I've heard support seems to be OK.

I have only had the m3lite perfect for a week or so, but i have used the original m3 lite for like 4 or 5 months. every homebrew app i try works fine on it (including my favs: dsmidi wifi and nitrotracker). As far as playing roms i really like the support i can get from the m3wiki, and every rom i have tried (after proper patching) runs flawlessly. I can't speak to any other products, but I am quite pleased with the m3 lite perfect for playing dsroms, nes emulation and homebrew. as far as specifically nitroTracker: the only problems i have had are also documented as bugs or current limitations. saving has worked perfectly (knock wood) on a sandisk microSD card. i have nothing to compare to as far as speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I think looping is quite the necessary minimum to make anything beyond percussive tunes, i.e. chiptunes etc. - of course you can use piano and guitar samples etc. but I guess there is no possibility for longer notes as of now, except perhaps to load longer samples...
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm really hyped that there's a tracker with great potential for DS, but I can't use it fully yet. I'm probably not the first person to ask when a new release will come but I don't have the time to check 20 pages ;) 
<br/>
<br/>
So I would like to ask when there is a new version and if, will it include looping..some popular effects (0xx, 4xx would be my most wished for) would be awesome as well but I'm sure you know that too...just wondering how far up in the priority list looping is...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hey, glad you like my app :-) Trust me, I badly want to implement looping myself and it's practically the next thing on the list once I'm done with the next release, which should come in the next time (I don't want to promise anything, because I have a tradition of not fulfilling my deadlines :-)

The next version will be mainly a bugfix/usability/compatibility release with one very cool new feature that's easy to guess considering what I've been doing lately :-)

I got my SC Lite and found a bug in Sata's modified fatlib that caused the horrible slowness on Supercard SD, miniSD and Lite. Also, I hacked in native support for the card, so that the "Moonshell Patcher" is no longer required. So the next release will work great on the SC Lite.

I'm not looking for publishers, because I want to keep this a hobby. I also wouldn't think I could get this published because the audience is just too small.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sitting here playing around with the new .03 release and I must say it feels like it is more stable. Previous version crashed after a number of saves and I had to defrag my card to get it running again. No such problems yet. The improvement in the GUI is very nice!! I love this app thx tob!!  =) I want to upload some work soon. I have some feature suggestions that would make this a definite workstation for me:
<br/>
1: Cell Editing, when I flip screen to edit pattern there is an "edit cell" button and when it is pressed I can tap on a pattern cell and it expands and shows parameters like volume, panning, note value etc. That is individual settings for each note. Is it possible to implement panning of instruments at all? Would make huge difference.
<br/>
<br/>
2: Hardware synth integration. I saw that you have used the PSG synth in your dsMIDIWIFI app. It would be totally awesome to be able to use it inside NT to make more advanced continous melody and basslines. How to make a good interface to it I havent thought about, but just the idea of it makes me drool! =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off, huge props to 0xtob, NitroTracker is beautiful and one of the reasons I bought my Nintendo DS in the first place :) Really appreciate the effort dude.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now for a problem... I have a Nintendo DS Lite, a Supercard Lite/Micro SD with firmware 1.7 and a Kingston 1GB MicroSD card.
<br/>
<br/>
The new version of NitroTracker reads from the MicroSD card almost instantaneously which is fantastic, but I'm still having the same problem as I have since I started using Nitrotracker... The card gets corrupted when I try to save (and I have to reformat).
<br/>
<br/>
I've read in a lot of places that patching it with "patch moomshell for super card.exe" makes it work, but it seems to make no difference for me. It's the same with Nitrotracker 0.3 and 0.2.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get this sorted out so I can finally have Nitrotracker completely working. I'd be able to take it with me everywhere and write tracks as inspiration strikes.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I just got some help and finally got it working! For those who have the same problem, follow these steps...
<br/>
<br/>
1) Go to this page <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/</a> and download the DLDI patch for "SuperCard (SD Card)", and the patcher tool.
<br/>
2) Patch NitroTracker.ds.gba (make sure it's ".ds.gba" and not one of the other two files that come with the zip).
<br/>
3) Rename to NitroTracker.sc.nds
<br/>
4) No more corrupt on save!
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Is it necessary to still patch the file using the moonshell patcher?
<br/>
<br/>
will try this with a patched version to see if it helps.
<br/>
<br/>
also, may be a wild guess, but my battery light is on red, could this be affecting the reliability of the saving?

<br/>
<br/>
SC Lite owners: I've fixed a serious write issue with SC Lite. Please re-download v0.3. There's no need for patching any more (neither moonshell patcher nor DLDI).
<br/>
<br/>
clrFog: In fact, both of the features you suggested are already on the list. PSG has a rather low priority though, as it will break compatibility with XM, but I agree it would be very cool to generate oldskool sound directly.

<br/>
<br/>
although i have not tried this program, it looks ways cool! very well done. 
<br/>
I actually came across it on youtube, there are 2 small videos with a guy playing about on it! i wish there were some more user videos but at least you get an idea of how it works! 
<br/>
<br/>
well i have a m3 simply ds on the way and i was wondering if this awesome looking program will run on it? also, if this isn't the case will there be any simply compatibility in future releases? 
<br/>
<br/>
Seems that not alot of homebrew is running on the simply as of yet, i think the msn program works but thats about it, would be most awesome if this program works! 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also does anybody have any sample tracks they have uploaded? i would love to hear them

When you tap on a .wav file you should hear a preview of the file. Is this the case?

Use NitroTracker.nds, patch it for R4DS and copy it to your card. Optionally, copy .wav and .xm files to the card so you have some material.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
After putting a track together the other day and moving it over to my computer, it seems that the xm files saved by NitroTracker sometimes have garbage notes saved in them that cause sort of "stuck" notes in other players (Like MilkyTracker and Winamp/WSP Plugin)
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the track I first noticed it with. There are a couple of long, stuck notes in the second pattern audible when played in MilkyTracker etc.

I think i know why it wont work- you are loading version 0.1.4

This is a vey old version!

<br/>
you need to download the latest version 0.3

I have to get the correct DLDI ? patch ? when i start nitrotracker ( my ds linker OS display the nitrotracker icon but then it goes blank (sic) snif )

When NitroTracker doesn't even start, it's a problem with the way the DS Linker launches the file. You could try launching it with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize" target="_blank">DSOrganize</a>. But before, you have to patch both DSOrganize and NitroTracker with the DLDI patch for the DS Linker, available from <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Tob,
<br/>
<br/>
Ive been playing around a bit more with nitrotracker, and although i still think this program is super dope, unfortunately ive been getting some problems with saving songs :(
<br/>
<br/>
on a few occasions now i have lost tunes cos they havnt saved, even after verifying by loading them straight after saving- next time i boot up the songs aren't there :(
<br/>
<br/>
i had one occurance of a song getting corrupt after saving a modified version- although i think i was pushing the file size - was over 1 meg.
<br/>
<br/>
i got a weird black screen with some text (cant remember now , deleted the file sorry!)- advising to report to you - something about not being able to write memory.   I got this when i tried to load the corrupt file, crashing nitrotracker.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What i want to know is: could these errors be due to the firmware i am using with the SC Lite (1.63), what version are you testing with?
<br/>
<br/>
or 
<br/>
<br/>
are the bugs likely to affect eveyone, and are just bugs in the application which may have accumulated by file browsing/ and/or editing the song?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, could going into sleep mode affect saving?
<br/>
<br/>
Ill have to try patching with the DLDI to see if that helps, this uncirtian saving is getting quite annoying, i need more reliability.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All that said, thanks so much for all your hard work on nitrotracker, you really have done a good job regardless.

Keep up the good work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would be interested in that, too, if Tobias is down with the idea.  I haven't done any DS programming yet so I don't feel confident that I could actually do anything useful with the source yet - but as I get up to speed I'd enjoy being able to tweak the program, and maybe even contribute something useful to it.  If that's not the way it's gonna be...  Well, I'll still enjoy using the binary a real whole lot.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just tried this program (why on Earth did I not try it when I first FlashMe'd my DS, almost a year ago??) and it's great fun.  I'm no musician, but I'm interested in getting good enough at making music to create music for my own projects (I want to make an original game with a dual-SID C64 sometime...) and for a while I've been thinking that it'd be great to have a program for, say, my Palm Pilot that would give the the ability to toy around with ideas any ol' time I wanted to...  Having a program like this on my DS is just about perfect.  Once I got the hang of the interface I spent some time trying to remember how to make chords and how to play the scale in different keys - I played around like a kid with one of those old Casio sampling keyboards, and delighted at making my crude rendition of "Row Row Row Your Boat" (a round, even) and trying it with different sounds.  Once the juvenile novelty of playing tunes with fart noises wears off I think I'm really going to enjoy the whole process of making songs with sounds recorded on-the-spot.
<br/>
<br/>
The interface is pretty nice overall.  I especially like the tap &amp; drag that's used for things like the BPM control, pattern length, etc.  It's a simple and compact way of controlling the values (maybe there was something similar in FT2?) - the only problem I've had with it is landing on a specific value.  If I want my pattern length to be 80, I can drag it to 80, but sometimes it'll jump back to 7f as I lift the stylus.  Maybe a bit of delay between reading the touchscreen and updating the value would straighten that out - then if the touchscreen value changes just before the pen is lifted, it won't affect the value (because it'd be inside that delay window).
<br/>
<br/>
I was also wondering why "B" notes are shown as "H"?
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the things I'd like to see in the program are already on other people's feature request lists.  Hardware synth support would be great fun - maybe there's a way you can crowbar that into XM format, or maybe NitroTracker should get its own file format at some point.  There was also a feature request on the Wiki for "drawing samples" - I don't know if that's the same idea as what I was thinking of: I was thinking something along the lines of a simple synthesizer for creating waveforms, using either a recorded sample or a fundamental waveform, and using the pen to tweak the frequency and amplitude (or a filter) with the result being a new sample.  So if you were using a sine wave as input you could create Theremin-like samples, or if you were using a sample or something like a square wave, you could use "freq + filter" as the two axes of the touchscreen and hear the effects of the filter.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that bugged me a bit was that every time I'd re-record a sample, it'd be renamed in the sample list to "rec".  I think this is a handy feature when a new sample is being created, but sometimes I'll record a sample, name it, and then want to re-record it to get a better effect.  Perhaps the renaming should only happen if the sample's old name is blank.
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to second the request for an Arpeggiator.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that'd be handy is the ability to apply certain classes of changes to a whole selection of notes in a pattern.  For instance:
<br/>
<ul><li>change samples: make the selection, then choose this action, and it will cook up a list of all the samples currently used within that selection.  It'll display that list on the left and the full list of samples for the song on the right.  User then draws lines from the list on the left to the list on the right to define the mapping, then taps "go" and all the remapping is done.  (Defining a full mapping, rather than a single-instrument mapping, is useful if, for instance, you want to swap two instruments.  Rather than having to change A to C, B to A, C to B, you can just change A to B and B to A at the same time.)
<br/>
</li><li>"Change notes" - similar "map drawing" as with "change samples" - but also with the ability to change everything by a certain offset (number of octaves or half-steps within an octave)
<br/>
</li><li>Compress/expand timing
<br/>
</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>

    <h4>#117210 - NotOminous - Fri Feb 02, 2007 10:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been playing around with NitroTracker some more lately. Putting together some tracks made entirely of sounds recorded through the mic. Interesting results, planning to release a few soon.
<br/>
<br/>
On to the point of my post though... I think I found an obscure bug today. It's to do with file system access, so I'm not sure if it's 0xtob's job to fix but I'll post it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using a Supercard Lite with a Kingston 1GB MicroSD card. Filesystem access usually works quickly and flawlessly.
<br/>
<br/>
The bug causes files to be deleted from the card when they shouldn't be. It's hard to reproduce but it appears to be caused by some combination of long filenames, saving to a directory that contains a lot of files, and using a directory that contains a lot of files with sequential naming, like "0000001.xm", "0000002.xm", "0000003.xm".
<br/>
<br/>
I will load up a previously saved song, say "0000003.xm". I'll make a few changes to it, and then try and save it under the name "0000004.xm". What appears to be every second time I do this, "0000003.xm" will be deleted, and "0000004.xm" will not be saved. But then if I try saving as "0000004.xm" again, it will save succesfully (though "0000003.xm" will still be missing).
<br/>
<br/>
If it's not a problem with my specific card and the DLDI driver, I suspect perhaps NitroTracker has some filenames in its memory mixed up, or is maybe relying on only the first 8 characters of the filename when checking what files exist, etc?
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried to explain this as best as I can, and like I said it's hard to reproduce, but it's a problem I'd like fixed if possible, since I've lost a few of the latest versions of my tracks this way, without realising til later that the newer version hadn't saved, and the older version had been deleted.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I just managed to reproduce it then by randomly loading and saving-as different filenames. It seems whether the filenames are sequential doesn't make a difference.
<br/>
<br/>
I just lost a track I'd been working on for a few hours :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you tried using the latest SC Lite DLDI? Some SC Lite models are known to misbehave. The SC Lite firmware should not be the problem though. Running out of RAM can cause all kinds of strange things probably. I'll add a RAM usage display to keep track of that.

Hmm, maybe it would also help if you could use them both ways: Sliding the stylus and tapping the up/down arrows. On the other hand, this problem also affects other controls, so I'll give the delay idea a try.

I'll try not to break compatibility with XM when including PSG support, but of course all other trackers / XM players just won't play the PSG sounds then.

Hmm, the fact that songs are deleted makes me think this is a problem with the SC Lite driver, because NitroTracker can't delete files. I'll play around with my SC Lite and see if I can reproduce this. After a file was accidentally deleted, have you tried running chkdsk or fsck on the MicroSD card to see if the file system got corrupted and if file can be rescued that way?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a SCL Rumble,which i suppose has the same drivers as a simple SCL,but I'm sad to see that I can't run 0.3. I tried both 1st and 2nd 0.3 versions,but unfortunately I get white screens when I boot this nice app.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried patching with SCSD &amp; SCL .dldi's,but nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, SCL Rumble has more support than people say,as basically NitroTracker is the only app I can't seem to boot.<br/>_________________<br/>He who laughs last, obviously didn't get the joke.

<br/>
Hmm, maybe it would also help if you could use them both ways: Sliding the stylus and tapping the up/down arrows. On the other hand, this problem also affects other controls, so I'll give the delay idea a try.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
On a somewhat separate topic - one of the downsides of the tap&amp;drag control is that it's limited by the borders of the screen - meaning that if a control is on the bottom-left of the screen it's hard to decrease its value, or if it's at the top-right of the screen it's hard to increase its value.  And in any case there's a limit on how much you can increase or decrease a value before you need to lift the pen and start over.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of alternate solutions and one idea I had was that changing values could be done by "turning a crank" - putting the pen down on the control would give you the "crank handle" (a line, at least, from the center of rotation to the pen point) which you could move with the pen - and you could increase the value by turning it clockwise, decrease by turning counterclockwise.  Something like that would work best if there were graphics going along with it, though - to provide a visual cue that the thing works by rotation.  It would also work best if the center of rotation were the center of the screen - so a control like that might need to be somewhat modal in nature.
<br/>
<br/>
I gotta go through one of those tutorials on making music with a tracker - maybe pick up some samples, too.  I'm finding it difficult to move beyond my early efforts...<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My problem seemed to be coming from saving into a folder with too many XM files already in it. I've since cleared out my MicroSD card and the problem has gone away for now, so I'll just avoid it this way. It's probably to do with DLDI stuff anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Also seconding a RAM usage bar. That would help a lot. Also possibly maybe you could put checking in to refuse recording new samples/loading new samples if there's not enough memory? I'd rather this than having a crash. Otherwise, showing the filesize next to samples would be handy too, so you can avoid loading big ones when you know you don't have the memory left, though isn't really needed if large files won't load anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
One idea I've had that I don't think has been mentioned yet, is how about a downsampling ability? So far I've had to manually downsample WAVs to 22khz or less so the memory doesn't get filled up too quickly. It'd be handy to have.
<br/>
<br/>
Also be great to have the ability to save off WAV files to memory card, though I think you're already working on that, or planning to. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, while I'm here, added a new track to the Art Section in your wiki, 0xtob! Looking forward to seeing more from others posted there too. <a href="http://tobw.net/dswiki/index.php?title=NitroTracker/Art_Section" target="_blank">http://tobw.net/dswiki/index.php?title=NitroTracker/Art_Section</a>

<br/>
EDIT: It'd also be nice to have notes played in their own virtual channel when you're playing on the keyboard. At the moment notes get cut off by anything in channel 0 if you jam while playing your track.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by NotOminous on Mon Feb 05, 2007 8:00 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, well done. It look amazing, can't wait to use it. I 've been into a gamboy workshop for a week where we code and play with the library of the synthesiser. But you are really good!!!!! 
<br/>
I forgot evry thing about coding for gamboy. if you don't practice.......
<br/>
I specially like the midi-wifi. Amazing and It look simple. I work on installation and performance using Director&lt;-&gt;MapleMidi&lt;-&gt;Ableton Live.  
<br/>
It's cool but playing live with the ds is even more cool!!!
<br/>
<br/>
I have DS lite (pink), and so I search for how to use it, but I read that it's more tricky for lite and for flashing compare to old DS. That scared me a bit cause the lite cost 99pound and I don't want to destroy it. On the other hand you don't really speak aubout it for the midi-wifi.
<br/>
When I look for cards I found the M3 Simply (Slot 1) wich is cheaper then the  DS-xtrem but you said that you need to install (on the card, I imagine ) a DLDI. Do you have any persons who already use the M3 Simply (Slot 1) and install DLDI  and had you application working perfectly ?
<br/>
<br/>
I really look forward for your answer, I am french, not really good in english and have little money that I don't want to spoil.  That's why I am asking those questions. Hope you don't think that I'm lasy, I just don't want to get it wrong.

After that I will send video of me doing sound with the Kaos DS. Once again, your softs rocks. BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO !!!!!<br/>_________________<br/>fuck dance let's art</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have to say that nitrotracker was the homebrew that got me the most excited when I got my DSX. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have the newest version, many bugs were addressed and it works much better.
<br/>
<br/>
My only problem is that when i reload a song that i composed and saved in Nitrotracker certain notes will have moved over to another track. I use only one sample per track, example, hihat track 1, sinth track 2, ect...
<br/>
<br/>
so it will look all messed up but it plays fine. very strange. kind of makes it not worth using right now. I have gotten hours of enjoyment out it though. being able to sequence anywhere is so cool.
<br/>

really looking forward to an update. thanks again.

I've been lookin for somethin like this for ages, and even though im sure ones bin out for ages but when you put it on a DS -sigh- massive thanks for the hard work.
<br/>
<br/>
and now onto the question:
<br/>
<br/>
So ive been abusin the dsmidiwifi addon, and connecting to the PC [using Ubuntu] while running QctrlJack and Qsynth. I load up the soundfonts i wanna use on my pc, and for every instrument on the soundfont, it takes up a instrument slot. So far so good. I lay down some notes, with the different instruments and hit play, but all the notes are only the first slotted instrument. Does anyone know how make the channels correspond to the instruments i was using?
<br/>
<br/>

Yes, several music programs for the PC have controls like this. Most of the time I find them hard to handle though. You would get higher precision, but you're still limited by the borders of the screen. Displaying the control in the center of the screen would require displaying it as an overlay, and the user would have to tap on it to activate the overlay, then change the control and then tap somewhere else to remove the overlay, which would be somewhat tedious.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll stick to the current controls, but what I could do is to make them speed-aware (like the iPod clickwheel for example). I.e. the values don't change linearly to the stylus position, but the interval between two pixels is dependent on the stylus speed.

When recording or loading a sample, the program already checks if enough RAM is free. At least it's in there now. No idea if I implemented it before or after the 0.3 release.

Really strange. I'll blame it on the DSX FAT bug :-) Have you tried the DSX DLDI yet? That should fix most problems with the DSX. The next version of NitroTracker will fix some more, so that it finally becomes 100% reliable in combination with the DSX (at least I haven't had any problems since).

<br/>
OK, that's maybe a little underdocumented (as in "not documented"): It's not the channels that are mapped to MIDI channels but the instruments. I.e. a note played with instrument x will send a MIDI note event with MIDI channel x. I should add that to the docs.
<br/>
<br/>
GoopyMonkey: Thanks! I added this to the compatibility list.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently thinking about a way to integrate bug reports and feature requests better into the development process, as the Wiki-based approach is too hard to keep organized. I'll let you know about this.
<br/>
<br/>
The project is making some great progress in the last weeks. I have a lot of plans for 0.4 which will add several new features that I'm pretty excited about. I don't want to get too specific though :-)

Another similar effect that could be fun is doing smooth pitch bends as you drag back and forth. Basically auto-calculated tone porta effects. Or do volume slides by vertical motion. Although that wouldn't work too well with the keyboard at the bottom of the screen.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">0xtob, Thanks for the reply. I kinda understand what you mean, and i got it to 
<br/>
work somewhat,  problems arise if you load a already made song from the DS.
<br/>
I have a feeling this one is gonna be REALLY long winded. I apologize in advance lol.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So i have a song i made wih like three instruments. we'll say kick, brass and a vocal, I setup on ubuntu with Qjack,  a synth instrument player prog and DSmidiwifi. I'll connnect to DSmidiwifi and load the song i already made, On the synth program I'll pick three new instruments we'll say A B C. On the synth prog. each channel an instrument is on corresponds to the different slots the instruments are on, in nitrotracker. 
<br/>
<br/>
so i map A to Channel 1, which would be the Kick on the DS. I can touch the keyboard on the DS and it'll play the instrument A on the PC. and i'll do the same for the rest. B to 2(vocal), C to 3(brass). everything seems to be candy. When i play back the song i made, on the DS only the first channel instrument on the synth will be heard. [in this case A]. and it will be the only instrument, for all the patterns on my DS song. So the pattern i layed for the brass on the DS will be played by  A on the synth as too for the vocal. 
<br/>
<br/>
So i poke around, and i switch instruments B and C to channel 1 on the synth prog and now they are heard. in conjunction with instrument A. So now for the Kick pattern instrument A B and C all play at the same time, and the same for the brass, and vocal.  abm remains confused lol. 
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you understood that stuff. it was a b*tch to put in words.
<br/>
<br/>
2nd question {short}
<br/>
when i connect to the synth prog on my PC and play any instrument with an Echo from the DS the note gets stuck and will continue to play unless i hit the stop button on the DS, OR use the    "- -" button i guess the sound stopper button.  
<br/>
<br/>

I'll upload the lil song i made too whenever i get some more time</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The 'Sample offset' command (Note + 9 + Sample offset --- chapter 3.10 in the FT2 manual) makes any kind of beatslicer unnecessary. In fact this command alone is much more powerful than a beatslicer when used in various ways... you can even do some old school time stretching with it. (oh, &amp; i also have long subway journeys to work :))
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that this command may be the most tedious or difficult to implement in Nitrotracker, but also the most missed if it's never included :(
<br/>
<br/>
Implementing the command may not be that difficult, but i think getting accurate sample offset parameters might be.
<br/>
<br/>
I did think of a few practical concepts for entering effect commands though. I think the easiest way would be when you have the note data selected with the DPAD, maybe you could have a keyboard icon that you tap. After tapping this hypothetical icon, you just type in the commands and that's it. You wouldn't be able to visually see the effects during playback or normal editing, but they would be there. There's a few other concepts I've thought of that are more elaborate... maybe I'll discuss em later :)

This was made in FT2. Nitro ignores the pattern/note data for the notes that use the 9x command. I figured a way around it... by just loading the same sample I used (dog2) into an empty sample slot. Then I trimmed the sample and renamed it (dog5). I entered the notes where they should be using the dog5 sample. I noticed that the volume command showed correctly the previous entered value for volume. I then re-saved the song. Then I reloaded the song to see if the changes I made would still be there. Exaclty the same thing happened -- The notes had disappeared.
<br/>
<br/>
I then took that work-around song and loaded it into MilkyTracker. The notes were correct in Milky, but the OLD 9x commands were still there. I left the note data, but deleted the 9x commands and re-saved the file as dogshit-milky-fixed.xm.

Similarly with this... effects just haven't been implemented yet. You'll notice you can't even adjust the volume of individual notes at the moment.

Hmm, I guess it doesn't send a stop event then. In that case it would be a bug(?) in the PC sequencer, because it should send a stop-note after the echo is over. It's also possible that the Stop-Note just gets lost, because receiving packets with the DS is less reliable than sending.

That's awesome!
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a video on basic 9x usage at MilyTracker's site: <a href="http://www.milkytracker.net/video/MilkyTracker.Basic9xx.XviD.avi" target="_blank">http://www.milkytracker.net/video/MilkyTracker.Basic9xx.XviD.avi</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing a difficult part in Nitro would be displaying the offset values for the sample in the sample editor. You can see where these are displayed in Milky in the above video.
<br/>
<br/>
In FT2 they are displayed in the S.E.Ext. (sample editor extended).
<br/>
<br/>
You notice in both MT/FT2 editors when you click anywhere in the sample with the cursor, it displays the selected value for that area of the sample you clicked. Example - "000040CA" , or "000040CA-00006BFC" if you select a range. You then truncate the example value above to "40" to have the sample be triggered from that that area. (Note + 9 + offset)[C-1 . 1 . .   940]
<br/>
<br/>
Because of the limited display size in Nitro, you could probably get away with truncating the values that are displayed. Like in FT2/MT they are displayed as in the above example "000040CA" ... in Nitro you could simply display it as "40CA". 
<br/>
<br/>
Seems complicated but its actually quite easy when you get used to the concept.
<br/>
<br/>
Attached below are 4 different techniques of using the 9x command:
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://mysite.verizon.net/systmcrsh/9x-reverse-backwards.xm" target="_blank">9x Reverse Backwards!</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Note the above examples will not work in NitroTracker (yet! :)). They will work in MT/FT2
<br/>
<br/>
If you open the sample editor in FT2/MT during playback, you can visually see what is going on with the 9x command.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">EDIT: BUG</span></span> I removed my earlier posts reporting a 9x effect command bug.

<br/>
In fact, i dont know why, but the homebrew cant see any sample. I put the sample pack we can dl on your website in the repertory of nitrotracker, i make "sng" or "smp" and load, but i cant see anything !
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how i can fix it ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">InGeNus i have the m3 simply too and nitrotracker works great. you need to patch NitroTracker.nds with DLDI.  
<br/>
<br/>
first you need r4tf.dldi and the patching software. you can get them both here:
<br/>
<br/>
(R4(DS) - Revolution for DS M3 Simply compatible &amp; Win32 GUI)
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
choose r4tf.dldi as your DLDI source, and NitroTracker.nds as the binary. patch it and transfer it to your simply. you can now load &amp; save from memory card in nitrotracker.
<br/>
<br/>
you will need to use the above method and patch almost every homebrew application you want to use with the simply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm currently struggling with MIDI input via DSerial. Several other cool things will also be in the next version. I can't promise a release date though. Hmm, I should really release more frequently, considering there were only three major releases in a year.

By the way, it was NitroTracker's birthday sometime in the middle of March!

Now that 0xtob has released libntxm, I'd really like to have music created using NitroTracker in one of the games I'm working on (which will also feature graphics created using Phidias).  Would anyone here be interested in doing a track?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like something with a theramin-type sound in it.  Beyond that, anything from minimalist ambience to a funky bass heavy dance track could work.
<br/>
<br/>
PM me or post here if you'd like to contribute.  I'll send you a WIP version of the game so that you can see what you think fits.  I have more thoughts about what I'd like to hear that we can talk about, but for the most part I'm open to your ideas.

I was wondering what to maximium file size was for NTracker. I've been having several xm's coming up as zero-sized files which I figure to mean that they were too large.

Is there anyway of showing that before the file is saved?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! There's no limit for the size of saved files. The RAM size limits the maximum size of songs that are loaded/created, but if you hit that limit, NitroTracker should tell you (or at least act weird (or both)). Files coming out as 0-byte is probably a problem with the flash card you are using. What kind of card is it? In some cases you can recover the lost songs using chkdsk/fsck.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't heard of the DS Fire Card yet, so I guess it's a new device on the market. Judging from a picture of the device, I'd guess it's a clone of the NeoFlash MK5, so the DLDI patch for that card might work.

Hey 0xtob, the DS Fire Card is AKA DS Fire Link, which is by the EWIN2 team and is an N-Card clone.

Ok, more newbie questions I'm afraid - I'm not 100% sure which one I need (sorry guys, trying to get up to speed!). I guess for auto-patching dldi drivers they live on the card?
<br/>
<br/>
...there's a link to a zip here for N-Card which sounds ok...

NT is very cool though, I used to use MED back on the Amiga, then FT2 on  PC, so the idea of having a portable tracker is just brilliant.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All the N-card clones can use the firmwares of the other devices.  In this case, the DSLINKER's firmware was recently updated, and now includes built-in DLDI patching that has been confirmed to have full read/write support, meaning that the manual DLDI patches on the DLDI website/wiki are not as functional.  You'll want to download the actual DSLINKER firmware and install that onto your DS Fire Link.  Then launch the .nds file like normal and it will automatically patch it with the read/write DLDI file.
<br/>
<br/>
Now what would it take to extract that DLDI file so that other N-card clones can use it?  I would imagine that if the auto-patcher actually modifies the file itself, we could just copy and paste the 32 kb section reserved for DLDI and it would be as simple as that, but if it patches the file in RAM, it might not be so easy.
<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, the DS Link is a completely different product than the DS LINKER and is not one of the N-card clones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only in Nitrotracker it doesn't work.

<br/>
Im new to DS homebrew.  I just downloaded NT as I have always wanted a portable music system.
<br/>
<br/>
Im just wondering how do you change the hex values for each note? E.g. FF is full volume, can I change this? Can I add any effects like sample retrigger, offset etc?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you talking about playing a pre-made .XM?

...and if you mean you can't hear anything you've composed...this might be a dumb question, but have you loaded/recorded a sample for the current instrument? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm really amazed that interest in NitroTracker evidently hasn't decreased even though I didn't update it in ages :) I thank you all for your kind comments and I'm really glad I could make some people happy with this :) I'll catch up with answering now, but because it's quite a lot, I hope you'll excuse me being rather brief.

Since I just bough a expensive r4ds to run Nitrotracker on, and it turns out that I need to buy a MicroSD-car too (who sells a package that includes a reader for a card, but not the actual card?). This leaves me with an option: return the r4ds or buy a MicroSD. Therefore, I'm wondering if I can excpect any of these features in the next Nitrotracker-release:
<br/>
<br/>
* Sample-drawing with the stylus.
<br/>
* XM-effects (at least stuff like pitchbend, volume bend and others that is common in chip-music).
<br/>
<br/>
*cross my fingers*
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Also, in what timespan do you plan to release it? 2 weeks? Within 6 months? Around 2010? When hell freezes over?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The combination of touch screen and game controls feels like the good bits of using milkytracker on windows mobile plus the good bits of using lsdj on the game boy. If only the DS had more memory i really think itd be a platform for an amazing tracker.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you should develop one for the gp2x f200 :) Lots more ram (64mb)
<br/>
fast cpu and its got a touch screen too.

I've installed Nitrotracker and it's great but I can't find samples anywhere on the internet to use with it.

I know there are probably some links in this topic somewhere but its very long, and searching didn't seem to help.

That and a simple volume envelope would make a very big difference to <b style="color:#FFA34F">nitro</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">tracker</b> because both would allow long notes without having to have long samples using up the 3.5mb the ds has to work with.

I still didn't manage to get hell to freeze over, but that doesn't matter because actually I wanted to release v0.4 before that happens :)

Since some people are curious, here's what to expect:
<br/>
<ul><li>Sample looping with adjustable start/end points. Both forward and ping-pong looping will be supported
<br/>
</li><li>Volume envelopes for instruments that can be drawn with the stylus
<br/>
</li><li>Multiple samples per instrument and mapping keyboard keys to samples
<br/>
</li><li>Channel mute/solo
<br/>
</li><li>Twice the amount of RAM! (Samples use less space in memory now)
<br/>
</li></ul>This is what's there at the moment. What's left to do is bug chasing and some other minor features.

Indeed, that's a nice device! There's two things it doesn't have though: Wifi and market penetration. I think the audience of DS homebrew is just bigger. Also, where's the fun when you don't have to struggle for the last bit if RAM? :)

<br/>
Word seems to be spreading about nitro. It has fans among a few producers i know.
<br/>
<br/>
good choice of things to include in the next version. Sample offset would be the thing i want most alongside what you mention. pllleeeeeaassseee...
<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean. The gp2x is a bit niche and it has the piggy. The ds works damn well with nitro so itd be great to see how much you can squeeze out of those processors and ram :)
<br/>
<br/>
The make selection unique feature ... you can find it in renoise in the pattern arranger at the left side when you select one or more patterns then right click... its near the bottom of the menu that comes up. 
<br/>
Say you want to have 4 patterns play then play again but with extra instruments or changes. you just add another instance of the 4 patterns again to the play order .. select them then click make selection unique and it makes them into new patterns ready to be edited. This can make laying out tracks much less fiddly than a clone option on its own. There is also a "delete unused patterns" feature which does what it says and also renumbers the patterns you have used in the order they are in the playlist. 
<br/>
<br/>
If ive explained any of the above badly let me know. They are great features but they often confuse people at first glance. (They did me) I think due to being on a little mobile device nitro would  benefit hugely from them.

Ill mention one other thing that would be ideal here too even though i realise these is only remotely likely after i fly on a pig to that ski holiday in hell.... resampling. If it can be done it would be stunning. both handy as a way of saving space (with sample offset).. emulating effects and most importantly making new percussive sounds with layering. 
<br/>
<br/>
And i know its touchscreen and ft2based but there are a lot of buttons going unused at the moment. Steal a few ideas from lsdj in terms of navigating within patterns and editing/copying/pasting notes etc. If you havent used it ill gladly run through why it works so well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well.. effects.. this could turn into a long post if i went off on that as it involves a load of different techniques. broadly i mean that the things you can set up over a few tracks to simulate delays or phaseing (or other stuff) are often handy to resample and use. If i get time when im home more next week and youd like to see what i mean ill make an xm for you to explain better. Let me know if so....
<br/>
<br/>
Layering is just as it sounds really. A few bassdrum or snare sounds (for example you can do it with all sorts of course) across a few channels can sound fuller and/or just different.. it can be a great way of getting a large number of percussive sounds out of a limited sample set. It works best when you have filters to apply to each sound but is still very useful without. that. Again if thats not clear i can show you in a module.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the buttons/dpad thing... The stylus is great (though i have no problem using it and the buttons than i have using the mouse a little for music on the pc). The ds doesnt have a keyboard like a traditional tracker but when im on the pc im using 4 dir buttons to move the cursor, other buttons or button combos to cut and paste and most of the other keys to input notes. The stylus keyboard is great and means nitro doesnt need qwerty keys for note input but with all those other buttons itd be nice to see one that makes a drag selection when its held down and the dpad is moved and others for cut and paste. 
<br/>
I like the button that currently speeds up cursor movement too.
<br/>
I think itd be nice to use a particular idea from lsdj where moving the cursor over a value and holding a particular button down then moving the dpad changes that value. 
<br/>
The important point there is that the above is a bit more like traditional tracker control. Sorry to use renoise as an example again but in that you can either almost entirely use the keyboard or almost entirely use the mouse or any combination of the two that suits. Milkytracker is stylus only on handheld .. the dpad is already a big part of why i like nitro so much more.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry once again if this seems a bit garbled. Im a bit obsessed with handheld trackers so im (perhaps irritatingly) full of ideas. I know this prob isnt a priority for you so feel free to tell me to shut it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The thing I like most about lsdj is the way chabnnels and patterns are layed out, in combination with the live mode. every "pattern", as in pc-trackers meaning of the word, is just one channel wide, and it can be assigned to any channel any number of times. This means that you do not have to copy your drumloop or bassline time after time after time after time, you just make it loop through the whole song. Also, this allows very cool sequencing live.
<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, I'd like something that might be easy to implement: a way to put the direction keys where the buttons, and buttons on the d-pad. Ie, reversing it. For lefties, like me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nitrotracker is completely the coolest thing available for the DS. Its the reason I bought one. It was the first tracker software I used. Its suprisingly quick to learn on, too. I'm sure I learned how to work quickly in a tracker much faster than I would have, starting in fasttracker or renoise. The stylus is totally the way to go. I've taken my DS with nitrotracker to a few clubs and used it in my set, and I always am writing songs on the subway ( and people always stare at it ). My favorite songs i've written were made in nitrotracker with sounds recorded from the mic. Theres something about how fast &amp; easy it is to use that makes it a really amazing tool for writing songs. I'm so excited to hear that its not abandoned, I had sort of given up hope until I found this thread.
<br/>
<br/>
I have one simple suggestion that you probably have heard before. Instead of only using the up and down buttons for changing values, make all the numeric steppers like the "increase volume" one in the sample window, where you can tap and drag to change the value quickly. It would make workflow go so much faster.
<br/>
<br/>
I also really like the idea suggested be stolen from LSDJ. I'd love to use the a/b/x/y buttons (dpad in the case of a lefty) to change d-pad focus from the tracker to patterns, edit step, instrument and velocity. Like you said, 0xtob, most of the time i have the stylus in my hand anyway, so it would be an extra convenience.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If your taking suggestions, It would be cool if it was easier to change individual notes volume. Also being able to draw notes with the stylus would be cool, I don't know anything about DS coding so I don't know hard that would be to add...

<br/>
Also is there anyway I can use DSMIDIWIFI to control nitrotracker with a midi keyboard?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ratboy: I think I'll experiment with different button setups. Shortcuts for select, copy and paste could be nice. And changing the value while the cursor is over it is like my current idea for the effects input method: Having an editing toolbar on the bottom of the pattern screen that you can adjust note, volume, effect, panning etc with.
<br/>
<br/>
Gasten: That's also the approach that newskool trackers like Buzz use (I also like that very much). But NitroTracker is an (oldskool) XM tracker and this would change the whole concept of the program. There is already a left-handed mode working exactly as you described :) It's hidden in the settings tab.
<br/>
<br/>
moncrey: Wow nice! It's very motivating to hear people are enjoying my software :) I also used it once to compose in the subway. I recorded the sounds of the doors and other stuff which turned out as a really strange and annoying song :) About your request, I'll combine the two widgets for changing numerical values into one (so you can use tapping and sliding) and use that in all places.
<br/>
<br/>
eric3dee: Interesting idea. Maybe I can fit this in.
<br/>
<br/>
Mattyoak: Changing the volume of notes will come of course, but not in the next version I'm afraid. What do you mean by "drawing notes with the stylus"? I only bought a MIDI keyboard to code MIDI input support for NitroTracker using a DSerial, but I'm having some technical problems about MIDI communiation that I need to overcome first. Anyway, this is planned. A NitroTracker forum you say? Haven't thought of that actually. Maybe that would make keeping track of ideas and bugs easier. The NitroTracker Wiki didn't turn out a very good idea imo. Also, this forum here is about development, so we've become a little off-topic :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nitrotracker currently works fantasically well as a drum machine on the DS.  It is so much easier to program than say my old skool Boss DR660.  However thats all it can be used for at the moment.  Could you possibly release a quick interim build with adjustable volume/velocuty on each trigger? I just want to add some dynamics to my drum beats.

I had just had a stroke of genius :)  First off, let me say that I am anxious for you to release a version where you can hit a button to play one beat/note at a time as I suggested... that said- I had a killer idea to make Nitrotracker the MUST HAVE live performance app.  Just throwin this out there, but what if you had a button which would enter a "performance mode" where you could do things such as the note-by-note, or queue up certain patterns at when certain buttons are pressed... and what if the performance mode was designed specifically to work with the Guitar Hero DS peripheral that is coming out (I'm sure you've seen pics of this?)
<br/>
  That would just be WAY too cool to whip out my DS on stage w/ the GH peripheral and do some live performance stuff w/ Nitrotracker.  what do you think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok- so I watched the GH:DS vids some more and had a few interface ideas (hehe- I'm just piling on work for you ;) )  You could do a performance mode where "strumming" or tapping on the screen would trigger a note-by-note function, and you could map the different GH controller buttons to activate different tracks in a pattern (i.e. activate kick drum by holding down the button, mute it by letting go (up to 4 tracks since there are only four GH buttons- but that should be plenty for sure)).  This would be an live electronic musician's (like myself) dream.

<br/>
1. Maybe there could be a triplet/duplet function. I can program in 2/4. 3/4. 4/4, etc. but if I want to program a triplet in a 4/4 thing, it's basically impossible. 
<br/>
2. It took me some time to figure out what the different buttons did. Maybe if there was a help button where you would punch it once and then punch whatever button you had a question about and a box could pop up and explain it to the dullards like me. (I'm using this program on the DS games 'n' music.)
<br/>
3. Being able to create different folders and delete any files without having to go through the hassle of getting on the computer would be a plus.

Those high BPM values aren't supported by the Fast Tracker 2 Format, which is used by NitroTracker. The maximum value is 255 BPM, this is FF in the hexadecimal numerical system, and we only have a two-digit hexadecimal number available (the "xx" in "Fxx").<br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

I had just had a stroke of genius :)  First off, let me say that I am anxious for you to release a version where you can hit a button to play one beat/note at a time as I suggested... that said- I had a killer idea to make Nitrotracker the MUST HAVE live performance app.  Just throwin this out there, but what if you had a button which would enter a "performance mode" where you could do things such as the note-by-note, or queue up certain patterns at when certain buttons are pressed... and what if the performance mode was designed specifically to work with the Guitar Hero DS peripheral that is coming out (I'm sure you've seen pics of this?)
<br/>
  That would just be WAY too cool to whip out my DS on stage w/ the GH peripheral and do some live performance stuff w/ Nitrotracker.  what do you think?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> Live queuing up of patterns sounds like a good idea! In fact, a performance mode would be neat! Anyway, these are pretty advanced ideas that I'll only come to after the basic functionality is there.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>eric3dee wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Ok- so I watched the GH:DS vids some more and had a few interface ideas (hehe- I'm just piling on work for you ;) )  You could do a performance mode where "strumming" or tapping on the screen would trigger a note-by-note function, and you could map the different GH controller buttons to activate different tracks in a pattern (i.e. activate kick drum by holding down the button, mute it by letting go (up to 4 tracks since there are only four GH buttons- but that should be plenty for sure)).  This would be an live electronic musician's (like myself) dream.
<br/>
.. but whatever- its your app ;)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> If the GH controller gets reverse engineered and a library for using it in homebrew software is created, I'll certainly take a look at it. I wouldn't focus performance mode around it though since I don't want to force people to buy GHDS, but the extra buttons might come in handy.

Of course, by highlighting every nth line, other measures like 3/4 can be implemented. Triplets, however, wouldn't fit into the pattern, because they would have to be played "between the lines". There are workarounds for this like expanding the pattern. If you have a 4/4 measure and you want to have triplets, you could define 12 rows to be one beat. (To compensate, divide the "speed" value by 3). One beat would look like this:

Come to think of it, I'm using an awful lot of abbreviations in the GUI, not making it exactly beginner friendly. So I think a smaller font would be great. And tbh, I stole the current font from FT2 without asking, so I guess I better use another font :)

A weak highlight at 4 ticks, a medium at 12 and a strong at 24 ticks is the best I've been able to do with modern trackers (Aldrin even does this automatically when set to 12 ticks-per-beat.) It's very good in my experience. You can easily see where the other beats are by visually offsetting, and also gives the customary space around notes. You can of course cut it down to half.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of ticks-per-beat: if it hasn't been mentioned yet, it's something I'd like to see. It's nice to be able to get the right BPM easily by specifying TPB. Then again, this does conflict with the "tick subdivide" style of conventional trackers.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you so much for the fantastic software. It's truly retail quality!

I can run DSMidiKeyboard (over DSMidiWifi) without a problem but I can't get Midi working in NitroTracker. Do I need any special setup or something? 
<br/>
<br/>
After tapping "connect" button, though it takes a while till getting out of modal dialog of "connecting," (it's instant on DSMIDIKeyboard or KaosDS) DS begins brinking green LED looking okay... but loading any song, touching any key on the keyboard (of nitrotracker) on various octaves seems sending any Midi events. I tried to check on-off send/receive boxes, loading other songs or nothing etc but can't get working so far.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought there may be bug about it (running on R4) but seen recently a couple movies on YouTube in which the tracker triggering a V.I. in some host.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, how can one use receiving msg?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of great demo songs on the download page, and three official sample packs. The documentation has gotten a major update with lots of new tutorials covering the new features.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty happy with this release and I want to thank everyone here for their support! In case you want to have more frequent but less stable NitroTracker releases, you can become a beta tester. Just drop me a mail and I'll sign you up.
<br/>
<br/>
In other news, there is now an official NitroTracker Forum:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?board=79.0" target="_blank">http://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?board=79.0</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Since gabdev is a development board and this thread has become quite lengthy, I suggest moving all discussion to the NitroTracker Forum.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy this new release! Have fun and tell me what you think!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i can't tell if i am doing something wrong so please (anyone) correct me if i am. but one feature i would love to see would be the ability to change the pointer to a sample by name. so i can drop 1 kick drum, make my beat, then drop in a second kick and point everything in the tracker to the new sample sound with the same name. this way i could lay down my basic beat and then test out different samples until it all jives.

This bug disapeared with the triple-boot "Real-Sakura-ItouchDS" firmware.
