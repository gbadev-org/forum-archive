    <h4>#131919 - Dark Knight ez - Thu Jun 21, 2007 11:32 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This wifi-loader program should work with any slot-1 card, as long as you have the EZ-Flash 3-in-1 card inserted in slot-2. 
<br/>
This wifi loader is a quick upgrade of the EZ-Flash IV wifiloader created by Micah Dowty.
<br/>
If you're familiar with that program, you'll know how to use this. 
<br/>
<br/>
Basicly what it does is... 
<br/>
The program registers itself on a wifi access point as a certain IP address. 
<br/>
It will then accept a .ds.gba file you send at that IP address at port 6502. 
<br/>
<br/>
The sending itself is done with netcat, see the ds-scene news post for a link to that program (link at the bottom of this topic). 
<br/>
The .ds.gba will actually be stored on your EZ-Flash 3-in-1 card's PSRAM in your slot-2, and then loaded from it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, once you've transmitted the entire program... kill the sending program (Ctrl+C) so the connection is terminated, and the wifi-loader program on your DS will know it has received all data. 
<br/>
Then you can press any button to start up the transferred .ds.gba, which will then be copied from the EZ-Flash 3-in-1 card to the DS's main RAM and booted. 
<br/>
<br/>
See this location for the news and the download:

<br/>
<br/>
Also uploaded it to my own hosting account now, because you have to be a registered member at ds-scene to be able to download the wifiloader. So there you go.

<br/>
I only tried it out - and intend to use it for - homebrew games and applications.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Actually, I limited the size of the transferrable program to be 5 MB.
<br/>
Mostly because I didn't know how much PSRAM the 3-in-1 card has.
<br/>
For most homebrew that should be enough. I doubt it's enough for backups.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, that's cool... But that made me think about something... Is it possible to put a ds.gba rom (homebrew) in the EZV 3 in 1's NOR and therefore, you could boot it exactly the same way as a gba game ? (obviously, you would need a passme/flashme).. That would be great... Can someone try this please?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, 
<br/>
<br/>
First,  that would be pretty neat, in my opinion, to boot the homebrew (our own 
<br/>
homebrew especially) directly from the ds firmware (or by pressing Start, I think, when booting)
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, you could use the Rumble and RAM possibilities along with the NDS motion possibilities  (unless it's not possible to boot the game and then use the rumble etc but I doubt so.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The rumble and RAM usage is possible also when booting from slot-1 and you have the 3-in-1 card inserted in slot-2, so that's a mute point.
<br/>
<br/>
Your first point is... well... not all that great to me. Did you look into Rudolph's transfer program yet? (See ezflash forums.) By using that, you could probably put the .ds.gba in the 3-in-1's NOR, albeit without using wifi.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Two player. Player 1 uses the SLOT-1 card by itself, copies the software to a SLOT-2 card, and ejects the SLOT-1 card. Player 1 then passes the SLOT-1 card to player 2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It appears to be specific to certain devices.  If you search this forum for "Wifiloader" you'll find a topic that has downloads to the original version, which was modified to work with slot-2 Supercards.  Apparently it has now been modified to work with the 3in1, which looks cool.  I don't have one, so I can't test, but if it's anything like the Supercard version it should be very useful for testing apps quickly, without having to mess with card readers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like I said, I think that can already be done with another program without the need for wifi.
<br/>
Bringing wifi into the mix in your scenario for getting the homebrew on the 3-in-1 card <span style="text-decoration: underline">as well</span> would not be better than simply transferring it from the slot-1 card with Rudolph's, wifi-less, 3-in-1 access homebrew program.
<br/>
<br/>
@Sweater Fish Deluxe
<br/>
This version will only work with EZ-Flash 3-in-1. I used the EZ-Flash IV wifiloader and altered its code only slightly. The source code of the wifiloader can be easily modified for other devices, as dantheman mentioned.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So changelog:

<br/>
- enabled music and sound of loaded up program
