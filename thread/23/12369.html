    <h4>#117639 - lucas - Tue Feb 06, 2007 7:12 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I got myself a DS last month, and a flashcart last week... Looking through the projects, I liked Licks Media Player (ipod-like player) very much, but unfortunately it was discontinued :-(
<br/>
<br/>
So... I just decided to finish it ;-). In the end, it became a complete rewrite. No more C++, only pure C. At ths time, I only have some basic functionality, WAV playback (files must end in .wav) and libmad playback (files must end in .mp3).
<br/>
<br/>
I need some feedback, if you can try, just download at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/" target="_blank">http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/</a> . Theres two versions, a .nds and a .ds.gba. Both are compiled with libfat DLDI, so you can patch if your flashcart does not work out of the box. The source is also in the same page.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh... And this is my first homebrew, so expect many bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
You can use START to alternate between console and graphics mode.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm mostly interested in feedback regarding sound quality (how does it compre to other mp3 players for ds, e.g. moonshell) and stability issues.
<br/>
<br/>
There's 3 different play modes, mode 1, mode 2 and mode 3 ;-) SELECT alternate between these modes, but you have to PAUSE/UNPAUSE so the mode will be applied. If you happen to test, please, send feedback on which one you think sounds the best. (these modes basically do some linear oversampling, just like moonshell).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, send your wishlists, I'll implement the most popular features first!<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't really hear a difference between the modes when playing back mp3s, but when listening to some wav drumloops (<a class="postlink" href="http://modarchive.mirror.servercave.com:8081/5912/waveworld/wav/loops/drumloops_1.zip" target="_blank">these here</a>), I noticed some clicking, especially in modes 1 and 2.

IE indeed decompresses the file (because the server is telling it that it is gzipped text), but neglects to remove the .gz from the extension. Removing .gz from the filename and using it as-is will work fine.

The .tar.gz has no such problems, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm labelling this alpha2 version, it's still very experimental.
<br/>
<br/>
New feature: playlist support. Some bugfixes and some rewrite in the graphics code.
<br/>
<br/>
For using playlists, you MUST use relative paths, no absolute paths. Also, you CAN'T use ".." in your paths (e.g. /abc/d/../e).
<br/>
<br/>
I've moved to more common .zip files for the precompiled binaries, so no more confusion!
<br/>
<br/>
@0xtob: there was a small bug in the oversampling code when dealing with 1 channel stream, I think that was the cause of the clicks. Should be fixed now.
<br/>
<br/>
@felix123: the menu wasn't supposed to work. Now it is! ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
@Lick: I tried many different methods to get the sound click-free, but each one had some prolems. In the end, the best that I could do is to use a triple-buffer in the ARM7, so while ARM9 is busy decoding there's still 2 pieces in memory to play. This reduced greatly the clicks/noises, the two processors don't need to be 100% synchronized, cause even if the sound enters the next buffer, it won't cause clicks. You shold take a look at arm7/source/sound.c, functions pcmplay() and InterruptHandler_TIMER1.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

Some bugfixes and power save mode (turns off backlights).

I tried to implement ogg support (using tremor), but something is wrong. The code runs fine when outside the interrupt handler, but when I put it inside the interrupt handler, it just hangs (using IPC_SYNC_IRQ). Maybe its some stack corruption, but I don't know. Tried to debug, but I don't know arm assembly, so debugging is very hard :-/ If someone knowns what might be happening or want to fix it (patches are welcome! :-)) then please, let me know.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

You need to apply those fixes to the Tremor code to avoid some memory leak issues.
<br/>
You may also want to take a peek at the Moonshell vorbis plugin (which has above fixes already); it might help you figure out what's wrong.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the references, implemented the first fix, the second is not necessary when using the lowmem branch of tremor (even on the main branch of tremor, I don't think it's necessary: that sortindex vector is allocated with alloca, so it should be freed when the code block finishes, as it's on the stack).
<br/>
<br/>
Well... even with that fix it still dont work while running inside the interrupt. I just did a quick look at the moonshell code, and it appears that moonshell don't decode inside the interrupt (it just copies the buffers to the arm7), while the actual decoding is done in the mainloop. I'll try this approach tomorrow, but it needs some big rewrite of the sound code :-/ And I still don't know why it don't work this way...<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

then it's better to use a global (or classmember) or assign some RAM to it beforehand. It fixed some issues I had with the stack. Also I think it's better to do the decoding in the mainloop, as interrupts should be as short as possible. Tremor is actually much easier (and faster) than libmad, so yeah, a bit more work and it could be done!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just got ogg vorbis working (moved the decoding out of the interruption)! I'll post a working build later.
<br/>
<br/>
About the features, no problem asking, but that don't mean I'll implement it ;-) If you _REALLY_ want some feature, well... you have the code! Just implement yourself and send a patch, so everyone can benefit.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll comment on some of the features:
<br/>
<br/>
- FLAC support: I'll try to get this working. Don't know if it's possible, but most of my collection is in FLAC, so that's a feature I want ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
- Increased volume: I'll get this working soon. However, it's not possible to easily increase the volume without losing quality. I'm not a specialist in computational music, so I don't even know if it's possible at all (if someone know, please let me know).
<br/>
<br/>
- Seeking support: Will get this working soon. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to seek in VBR mp3 files while still having a good time display :-/ The only way would be to create a seek table, but for that it's necessary to decode the whole stream before starting the music, but the DS isn't fast enough to do this (that's why I still don't have seeking support).
<br/>
<br/>
- Video support: Won't happen anytime soon. It's VERY hard to keep things in sync in the DS, so I don't even want to try this.
<br/>
<br/>
- Other features: possible, but not in the first version.
<br/>
<br/>
So, my current roadmap is this:
<br/>
<br/>
- FLAC support
<br/>
- Increased Volume
<br/>
- Seeking support
<br/>
- Alpha version
<br/>
- Feature freeze
<br/>
- Beta Version
<br/>
- Release Candidate
<br/>
- 1.0 release<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

Basically, you need to implement soft saturation to avoid clipping (but it still distorts the audio) when raising the volume. 
<br/>
And when lowering volume, you can simply use the hardware to do that and save some CPU. That won't sound any better, though.

FLAC is better on hard drive players than on flash memory players. I don't know a lot of people who have modded their CF adapters to accept a Hitachi Microdrive hard drive, but I'm told that one of the MAX Media Players comes with a 4 GB CF hard drive.

<br/>
Yes, it's possible to distort an audio signal such that segments at low volumes are boosted and segments that approach the - and + rails are not harshly affected. Pass each sample through a saturation function that does not have a corner at full scale. I describe four such curves; with a graphing calculator, you can probably devise more:
<br/>
<br/>
One saturation function starts by plotting the following functions on y=0 to 1: <ul><li>y = 1 - (1 - x) </li><li>y = 1 - (1 - x)^2 </li><li>y = 1 - (1 - x)^3 </li><li>y = 1 - (1 - x)^4 </li><li>y = 1 - (1 - x)^5 </li></ul>
<br/>
So where g is the gain (amplification factor), and 1.0 &lt;= g, the expression for the positive half (quadrant I) of the saturation function is y = (1 - (1 - x)^g. The expression for both halves (quadrants I and III) is y = signum(x) * (1 - (1 - abs(x))^g, but ordinarily you'd generate a lookup table from the function for the positive half and then copy and rotate it into the negative half.
<br/>
<br/>
Another saturation function that doesn't need fractional exponentiation using floats is based on a cubic Bezier curve with control points (0, 0), (1/3, y1), (2/3, y2), (1, 1). The values y1 and y2 are set such that the first control point sets an acceptable gain for small volumes and the second eases saturation into full scale. The equations for quadrant I are as follows for 1.0 &lt;= g &lt;= 3.0: <ul><li>Where 1.0 &lt;= g &lt;= 1.5:  y1 = g / 3, y2 = 2 * g / 3, giving y = g*x - (g - 1)*x^3. </li><li>Where 1.5 &lt;= g &lt;= 3.0, y1 = g / 3, y2 = 1, giving y = g*x + (3 - 2*g)*x^2 + (g - 2)*x^3. </li></ul>
<br/>
Yet another is arctan(g * x).
<br/>
<br/>
Yet another is sin(clip(g * x, [-Pi/2..Pi/2])).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AAC: DSOrganize does a great job of streaming 40kbps AAC+ (which sounds at least as good as 128kbps MP3), but it's very unstable. I always like to say there should be at least two tools for any given job, in case one doesn't work quite the way you'd like. So... any chance of this happening?
<br/>
<br/>
Increased volume: I'm pretty sure it's not possible to software-amplify without losing quality unless you have a very quiet sound. However, if the DS's full volume isn't loud enough for you, you're probably in a fairly noisy environment (or have bad ears) and won't notice it anyway. ;-)
<br/>
BTW, I noticed using software amplification and turning the hardware volume slider down helps to save battery power. Those speakers are really power hungry.
<br/>
<br/>
Seeking: I think what Moonshell does is simply play really fast and not actually output the decoded sound. It doesn't have an actual timer, only a progress bar, but it seems to be accurate.
<br/>
<br/>
FLAC: A nice feature, but is it worth it? The DS's sound hardware isn't the greatest, you probably wouldn't hear much difference from a good-quality Vorbis file. And since the DS uses flash memory (or microdrives at about the same capacity), it may not be feasible. One CD's worth of FLAC files is ~300MB in my experience.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and please don't automatically turn on the backlights when the program starts! Ideally the program itself would have a way to control them, but this isn't really necessary. However, it's annoying to turn the lights off, then run a program that just turns them on again.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for your explanation, it was very helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I'm running into some problems implementing this: first I tried to implement it directly into the ARM7, hoping it would be fast enough to do it in real-time. Unfortunately, it's not fast enough. Then I tried to create a look-up table, as you suggested, but it takes more than a second to create such table on the ARM9, which makes changing volumes take too much time. The last thing I tried, which worked, but wasn't optimal, was to precalculate the tables and include them on the binary... But each 16 bits table takes 128KiB, and having, for example, 8 such tables, would enlarge the binary by 1MiB, and take 1MB of the main memory :-/
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know any other way to do this? Or is there any function which is integer-only and could be used in real-time?
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of implementing these functions using fixed-point integer math, but that's a lot of work, and I don't even know if it will work...

<br/>
I'm no expert either, but even if that could be done, and say, the MDCT takes 95% of the decoding time of the MP3, it would still be painfully slow to sample-accurate seek in a 30-min MP3 :-/
<br/>
<br/>
I guess the best solution here is the one Firon commented, which is relying on the Xing VBR header to seek with a reasonable accuracy.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

<br/>
<br/>
Many new features! Hope I remember everything, here it goes:
<br/>
<br/>
- Ogg Vorbis decoding support
<br/>
- FLAC decoding support (but not FLAC in OGG container)
<br/>
- Soft-volume control
<br/>
- Progress bar
<br/>
- Seeking support
<br/>
- Hold button (select)
<br/>
- Control with L/R buttons when lid is closed
<br/>
- Gapless playback
<br/>
<br/>
I've removed support for .wav files. It was there mainly for debugging (doubt anyone really uses it), and I've removed as part of the rewrite of the ARM9 sound code.
<br/>
<br/>
Now it's bug-fixing time. Please, only report bugs. No more major features will be added till version 1.0.

That smoothness depends on the how much CPU cycles the decoder is letting us use... I think its better to have a non-smooth screen than to have a non-smooth music playback. It certainly is possible to optimize the screen drawing code, but I need more experience with DS graphics hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a suggestion for the progressbar, I'm not sure how you render it right now but..
<br/>
<br/>
You can take the repeated image (lightblue-darkblue-lightblue) and use modulation to get the current x offset, so you can tile that repeated image horizontally.</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">for(y; y&lt;height; y++)
<br/>
  for(x; x&lt;width; x++)
<br/>
    dst[y*width + x] = progressbar[y*tilewidth + (x%tilewidth)];</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This way you can save some memory if you render in ExtRot 16-bit mode. 
<br/>
You can also animate the progressbar ilke real iPods do, by adding an offset and the modulate it:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">for(y; y&lt;height; y++)
<br/>
  for(x; x&lt;width; x++)
<br/>
    dst[y*width + x] = progressbar[y*tilewidth + ((x+OFFSET)%tilewidth)];
<br/>
<br/>
if(playing)
<br/>
OFFSET++;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This will make the progressbar animate to the left. :)
<br/>
<br/>
You can also optimize the font rendering code a bit by pre-greyscaling and pre-setting-bit15 (if pixel is visible) the font-data, instead of doing it on the fly.
<br/>
<br/>
You might also want to compile as ARM code (that should be faster). Simply edit your Makefiles on the line: '-mthumb -mthumb-interwork' and remove the first '-mthumb'. </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">ARCH   :=   -mthumb-interwork</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
I'm not sure if you already enabled ARM optimization for mad and tremor yet. But you can by defining _ARM_ASSEM_ (tremor). Add '-D_ARM_ASSEM_' after '-DARM9' in your Makefile. The same for FPM_ARM (mad). </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CFLAGS   :=   $(INCLUDE) -DARM9 -D_ARM_ASSEM_ -DFPM_ARM</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Oh, this reminded me of something very important. I know you said no feature requests for the next version but this should really only require adding/changing one line of code (mask out the button flags). I found a problem with Moonshell is when the lid is closed, the L and R buttons are disabled, but others are not. Could you please make the Hold feature disable every button except Select (to disable hold, of course)? See, with DS Phats the A button is very close to the edge of the lid. It's possible (and happens to me fairly often) for the A button to be accidentally pressed when the DS is in your pocket with the lid closed. I don't know if this problem applies to other buttons (D-Pad left, probably), but obviously if you just disable every button, you won't have to worry.
<br/>

Great work BTW, this may soon replace Moonshell as my primary music player. (And if you add stable AAC+ streaming, it may even replace DSOrganize as my primary streaming music player.)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Found a bug in alpha4:
<br/>
Played three 320k mp3's. And they all make your player freeze when they end. Also tried two 192k mp3's and it seems to skip to the next song, but they also freeze
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed in alpha3 some mp3's started to get scratches on the 2nd consecutive track, but can't test that out since each mp3 freezes at the end :)
<br/>
<br/>
About OGG, I played a 19min song and played just fine :D
<br/>
<br/>
A suggestion..i know you're no longer wanting asking about features, but besides adding moonshell-style L/R like others have asked, maybe have seek on the touchscreen like moonshell and adjust that way, or hold the REW/FF on touchscreen to determine whether they skip to next song or seek.
<br/>
<br/>
overall it's a very promising player, keep it up

<br/>
<br/>
New in this version:
<br/>
<br/>
- Shuffle mode
<br/>
- Fixed a bug that may cause freezing when mp3 is finishing
<br/>
- Animated progressbar
<br/>
- Much better quality volume control
<br/>
<br/>
Known problems:
<br/>
<br/>
- FLAC playback have some problems
<br/>
<br/>
If you are experiencing freezing, try formatting your card and copying everything again. That solves a lot of problems with corrupted FATs. If it still doesn't work, try holding A or B (or both) when starting the program (that'll disable loading of ID3 tags and playlists, respectively).
<br/>
<br/>
If you're still experiencing problems when starting, hold START while starting, and post the last message on screen.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

Can you try formatting the card and trying again (it worked for me)? I believe this is a bug in libfat or newlib (not sure yet). I could not reliably reproduce this bug :-/ There's something in your files (and probably libid3tag that I'm using to read the ID3 tags) that helps the bug to appear, but it's not 100% accurate.
<br/>
<br/>
I spent at least five hours trying to track this bug, and I've found a bug, but I don't think it's the one yet. I've reported the bug to chishm, it was a bug in newlib, and it will be fixed in the next devkitARM. The big prolem is that this bug is not in my code, so, it's very hard to track it down.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

i want an alarm clock, which wakes me either to a playlist or a single file. but after choosing the wake time, the ds has to shut off! this is most important, because ist has to be left open for the amplitude to be high enough, and no power consumption through the night.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Zero power consumption would require actually turning the system off, which means the only way for it to wake you up would be to have someone come in and turn it back on. However, you can turn off as much as possible (screens, backlights, sound etc), put the ARM9 in super-low-power mode (turned off basically), and I guess just have the ARM7 spend all its time idling. Use a timer interrupt on the ARM7 to turn it back on and activate the alarm. This appears to be what Nintendo's does. From what I've heard the battery can last 2 weeks in this state (obviously not in the alarm clock, but e.g. in sleep mode in a game, which is the same thing using the keypad interrupt).

Something like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/how20/94c50e0796b84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html" target="_blank">this one</a>?

I couldn't find it on the site that Popsci listed it as being on, but I'm sure that it can be found somewhere.

BUG REPORT:
<br/>
when scrolling, the backlight was turned off in x seconds T_T (fix timmer pliz ^^)
<br/>
Request :
<br/>
center button not only select song, it should play selected song also . !!!
<br/>
play/pause button : 
<br/>
                 [1] : song menu  : play selected song ( cant go to next song automatically )
<br/>
                 [2] : other menu : --- (song playing) pause playing song
<br/>
                                            ---  (song paued)Go to nowplaying and resume song
<br/>
                                            --- (song stopped when finish [1] ) : Go to shuffle menu ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Setting menu : just need backlight level/timeout , volume limitted, lock, fast-booted Mode (see below), about , Card infomation, ....... (if you need more idea, contact me ^^)
<br/>
<br/>
Fast-Booted Mode   ----[ON] : turn off refresh music library when boot up
<br/>
                            ----[OFF] : opposite above ^^
<br/>
so that, you should store library to a text file (TAG info included, no need to read tag again ^^)

Try formatting your card, copying everything back and try again. If you don't want to do that, or if that doesn't work, start holding A and B, but it will disable ID3 tags.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just released another version. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/" target="_blank">http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
This is mainly a bugfix release. I've fixed most bugs reported here (every one I could reproduce). MP3 playback should be much better now.
<br/>
<br/>
I've changed the default to NOT read ID3 tags. There's some problems in the code that may cause instability. If you really want that feature, you can start the program holding A and it will be enabled, but in case you run into problems, just try disabling ID3.
<br/>
<br/>
One new feature, new seekbar (just test to see). Now the default is to change volume on NowPlaying screen, so you have to press WHEEL_CENTER or RIGHT to get to the seekbar.
<br/>
<br/>
Please, test and report any regressions. If your bug is still not fixed, please post again with detailed information on how to reproduce.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not possible to implement file attributes, because libfat doesn't export them, and I don't want to keep patches outside my tree. To solve the problem with moonshell STARTUP.MP3/SHUTDOWN.MP3 the moonshl folder is now ignored, so, don't put your MP3 files there.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

The sound is still bad as in the video? Are you playing very high bitrate MP3 (320kbps and greater)? Have you tried formatting the card?
<br/>
<br/>
Can you try this build:

I've tried holding A and B to disable still the same problem!

I'm using a DS-X patched with the latest DLDI.

<br/>
The Graphical corruption has happened in every version so far, and is only on 1st 3rd ofthe top screen, some garbled lines and battery icon duplication.
<br/>
<br/>
The MP3 does play, but sounds like if it was doing fast forward!

Some small bugs fixed, some minor tweaks and optimizations. I've played for several hours, with no problems, tested mp3, ogg, flac and all were fine. Tested on R4 (dldi) and M3 SD (no dldi).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also thinking of the new features for the next version, so if you want to suggest anything, now is the time. Please, for this next version, just small features, but features that may be useful. No video or streaming support yet.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

Cant wait for the Album, Artist, etc. sort

and the Skinable feature would be awesome.

P.S Only difference in RC2 i see from RC1 is that glitch where the forward/rewind bar doesn't show up when you click left or menu.

EDIT: Okay somthing just happened, when i load it its freezing. I didn't delete any Files for that, only thing i did was play Yugioh Gx and take a save out. I put it back and its still donig the same thing.

Note: this is happening in BETA and RC2 for me

Note 2: This is my first problem with LMP-ng

It should show NULL as artist/album, this is normal. When you start holding START, the frame counter in the upper right corner is freezed too?<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

Well, I want to know something: when I'm playing a song, when I in the menu searching songs, it doesn't go equal than when I'm not playing a song. I supose that this is not a bug, and it is a problem with the nds, right lucas?

I was just going to edit my first post. Anyway, I tried with a DLDI driver for slower SD cards, and it plays MP3 fine. I only have Mp3.
<br/>
Anyways, the top screen flickers between my EZ4 top screen and the media player top screen rapidly! The driver has nothing to do with this. Maybe you should try to clear the screen on the startup? Is it to any good?

No, but it is different. When I cycle through selections it kinda flashes, but it is flickering still when doing nothing, gah, it's difficult to explain. Video;

Yeah, removed from version 1.0... It wasn't stable enough... But! I've already fixed that, rewrote the metadata code, now it also supports ogg and flac metadata. I'm writing skin support now, so you can expect a alpha preview of the next version very soon.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

Already answered, but in order to compile you'll need to port some other libraries: zlib (easy), libid3tag (relatively easy, just two or three lines patch), libmad (easy), tremor (easy, but there's two fixes already commented in this thread), and libFLAC (this one is not so easy, it depends on some things unavailable in devkitARM like ntohl, utime, chown, chmod, so you have to write some stubs / replacements).
<br/>
<br/>
The Makefile is full of '/' for dirs, don't know if it works in windows, but should work, at least with cygwin.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll also need devkitARM r20 and latest libnds / libfat.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're having trouble compiling, PM me and I'll try to help.

I've already finished the skin code, but the only "animation" so far available in the progressbar is scrolling to the left. Now I need to do some boring stuff like creating a parser for reading a config file and loading the skin dinamically (I'll probably use a zip file for the skin, with a config and 16 bits A1R5G5B5 bitmaps inside).<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

Can you provide the patches against the source trees of these libraries? If you're using libmad, then your program is GPL, and you <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> to provide either these patches (plus the original source distributions) or pre-patched source trees.

The file is a 160Kbit MP3, not much better than the 192K ones I tried earlier. Apparently it's a CBR, although I'm not sure, I'm not really sure how to know, usually in the windows explorer tooltips if they vary in bitrate it's because they're VBR. The entire album is 160 so it should be CBR.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just uploaded version 2 alpha. There's a LOT of new code, so be prepared for some new bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
The most noticeable chages are:
<br/>
<br/>
- Skin support
<br/>
- Metadata support (ID3, VORBIS_COMMENT)
<br/>
<br/>
I've provided two skins as examples for thoso who want to create their own skins. The bitmaps MUST BE 16 bit ARGB (A1R5G5B5) (I used The Gimp to create these skins). You also need a skin.conf file which configures some basic features of the skins (look at the provided examples and play a little, it should be self-explanatory). The files must be zipped and put in /lmp-ng/skins directory into the card, the program will search for them and you can load them dinamically through the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
If you create some skins, please send them to me (along with some screenshots) so I can put them on my homepage.
<br/>
<br/>
@tepples: Sure, heres the patches: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/patches.tar.gz" target="_blank">http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/patches.tar.gz</a>. I've updated the page with some info on how to compile the source.
<br/>
<br/>
@alfatreze: Please, try this latest alpha version and see if it fixes the problems. There's a big rewrite in the screen code.
<br/>
<br/>
@darkgilson: I'll try to add support for localization in the next version.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

If you're getting a black screen, then it means that the skin file could not be opened / unpacked successfully. Unfortunately, it's almost impossible for me to debug this without access to DS-X hardware, so it probably won't work unless some other developer with access to DS-X can take a look or if someone can tell me the reason it's not reading the files correctly.

I still have not switched over to it as my primary player because of one small issue. While at work I leave my DS on my desk and just listen to my music collection through the DS.

If you're still taking requests I have a BIG one.  How about playlist support for m3u and wpl?
<br/>
<br/>
I use windows media player on my desktop.  It's free and I've yet to find a better tool for organizing and tagging my vast collection of MP3s and it plays nicely with windows mobile on my wife's cell phone.  I use the sync feature to get the MP3s onto the microsd and would like to preserve the directory and playlist structure on my desktop.  I find that I cannot  seamlessly sync files + playlists on most flash memory based MP3 players.  It would be nice if LMP did this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I still have not switched over to it as my primary player because of one small issue. While at work I leave my DS on my desk and just listen to my music collection through the DS. I would prefer to be able to reach over and tap a single button to pause the player and/or advance to the next song.

<br/>
Yes, this is even more important for those who have their DS connected to their car stereo. With this setup in Moonshell I can reach over and choose songs without ever looking even in the general direction of the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

M3U playlists are supported, I don't know what is this wpl playlist, but if it's simple enough (like m3u), I can probably add support for it too. Just send me a description of the format and I'll try to implement.<br/>_________________<br/>Lucas

When using The Gimp, you just click "advanced options" when saving as BMP and selectd 16 bit ARGB, see the screenshot: <a class="postlink" href="http://img61.imageshack.us/img61/4036/argbpz9.png" target="_blank">http://img61.imageshack.us/img61/4036/argbpz9.png</a>.

One more thing, can you add a way to or _is_ there a way to remove mp3 files from the list (i get STARTUP.MP3 and SHUTDOWN.MP3 from moonshell in the list.) maybe limiting it to one directory. oh, and one more thing i promise... are you planning on adding playlist creation within the program (M3U im guessing) i know theres already support but creating them on the go would be nice.

Edit: i just discovered while the lid is closed you can hold down r and push l to pause, or you can hold l and push r to skip track, like in moonshell. but these buttons often get pushed in my pocket (yes my ds is my only portable mp3 player :P) can you add a hold button?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dragonminded does not like patches to DSOrganize, so I'm not too inclined to make such work... :-/

<br/>
It's not very hard to do, if you know what you are doing, it's less than 2 hours work, I think. Good exercise for those starting to work on DS homebrew.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

The whole POINT of the plugin system was so that third parties could extend DSOrganize AT WILL.  Why in hell would I go through the trouble of having plugins to the browser if I didn't want poeple using it?<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

<br/>
My results:
<br/>
<br/>
mp3 - skips around on every one I tried.  It plays half a second, skips half a second, etc. very jittery.  As it skips around, it screeches like a badly scratched CD.  It keeps trying (doesn't crash), and the message I get is:  <span style="font-style: italic">recoverable frame level error (lost syncronization)ue)for JS)</span>.  Sometimes it seems to go back a second or two.

OGG - Excellent!

<br/>
Flac - Excellent!

Any advice on what I could do to get mp3's working?  I doubt it's a problem with my card, because oggs and flacs are fine.  I tried 128kbps, 160kbps, and 256kbps stereo.  I made sure to try files that were made with different encoders, just in case it made a difference.

<br/>
I predict that IF LMP-ng ever gets popular enough, Apple will send a cease and desist to stop you from using the Ipod interface/"look and feel".  Apple did this to big companies like Microsoft and Hewlett Packard, as well as small internet sites like the websites hosting Mac OS X skins for Windows XP.  Right now you are not a blip on Apple's radar, so nothing is happening.  
<br/>
<br/>
So to spend all you time working on the interface is really pretty funny to me.  LOL.  
<br/>
<br/>
Since the playlist function does NOT work.  LMP-ng is pretty useless right now.  A music player w/o a playlist is worthless IMO.  
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your obscurity ... for now.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, you can be prevented from using the "look and feel" of the Ipod irregardless of the coding/programming.  If you remember, that's why Lotus won that case against Paperback Software and put their Lotus 123 clone out of business.

Which flashcart/media adapter are you using? You should beable to start LMP-ng.nds just like you start moonshell. You can even start moonshell and start LMP-ng using moonshell, although its slower and theres not much other reason to do this except if you have a Supercard Rumble series or you have moonshell set to an auto-boot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Weird thing is, I am also using DS Channels; the previous Alpha 2 version (Without auto-scanning MetaTags and saving skin preference) in the exact same location and name (LMP.nds) worked for me, yet the mod 1 does not work when I boot it in DS Channel.

Uhh...  From my tests, MoonShell sounds WAY better than LMP-ng.  The iPod interface is great, but when the audio decoder doesn't produce the quality of sound that other apps can, I go for quality of sound over interface, since the DS is usually closed anyways.  MoonShell has clear sounds all the way into very high notes, and it sounds good.  LMP sounds like it cuts treble and it distorts the sound a bit, probably saving CPU time for the iPod wheel, but then again, sound is more important than interface.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Actually, I use LMP-ng specifically because it sounded better than what I was using, which was moonshell. Granted, that was about 2 or so major versions of moonshell ago, but I'm not aware that the mp3 code has been updated since then. I also think LMP is easier to start using right from the start up, I keep my mp3s in many different folders, so the playlist thing is nice. Plus, when the DS is closed in my pocket, the L and R buttons would be accidentally hit causing moonshell to pause or skip to the next song, and LMP can lock these buttons.
<br/>
It's true, I'm no audiophile. But I don't listen to senseless rap/pop/rock, and I do have some musical talent, so I'm not totally devoid of the ability to discriminate playback quality...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

There was a version I had, not from the official site, with no textures, just plain looking menus, it sounded as bad as the Games n' Music's internal player, and...you don't EVER want to hear the noise that thing makes.  Anything beats the GnM internal player,...anything...

The 1.71 version of MoonShell has great mp3 quality and a lock feature for L and R.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for reminding me, I found some bugs:
<br/>
-OGG playback seems to use up too much CPU power. Certain songs will stutter a bit for the first several seconds, during which the interface freezes and the buttons do nothing. Also, the interface is very slow while music is playing. You practically have to pause before going back to choose another song.
<br/>
<br/>
-When moving from one OGG to the next, it sometimes plays the first few seconds at the wrong bitrate, usually sounding higher pitched than normal. It seems to depend on the songs themselves, as e.g. it happens every time I reach certain songs on the playlist, but if I go to a different song, pause, and then go back to that song it will work. Occasionally (maybe 1 in 100 times) it never will go back to the right bitrate, and will stop responding to the buttons, which is a pain.
<br/>
<br/>
-M3U playlists don't work. I've tried Unicode and ASCII. Both just display a single gibberish item that freezes the program if selected.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the main problem behind #1 and maybe #2 is that the interface just uses too much CPU power. I understand the idea was to be an iPod clone, but IMO, the iPod interface is lame. I'd like to be able to see things like the song's length and current time, touch to seek/adjust volume like in Moonshell, and that animated progress bar isn't necessary. You could get a big speed boost by drawing the text at 8x8 using the tile engine too.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there any chance of being able to browse the file system like other players? &gt;_&gt;<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<ul><li>Doesn't show "starting" on the screen, just a blank interface while it loads. If you had a lot of files, it'd probably seem frozen.
<br/>
</li><li>Skin selection, yay! Does it really need to have .zip at the end of each item though? Also, having the currently selected skin be highlighted would be nice.
<br/>
</li><li>Opening an M3U file that uses \ instead of / in paths will display a lot of gibberish. Selecting this gibberish locks it up. (Hey, I finally found out why M3U support wasn't working! &lt;_&lt;)
<br/>
</li><li>Some MP3s makes the timer jump around to all different numbers, when they didn't before.
<br/>
</li><li>Interface responds and scrolls faster, but still lags when drawing a lot of long filenames, and is still unusably slow when music is playing.
<br/>
</li><li>Volume seems to be jumping around. <span style="font-weight: bold">Sound quality is noticeably lower</span>, lots of distortion and fuzziness. Actually, one song sounds better, all the rest sound worse. O_o With FLAC, there's a barely noticable rapid thumping sound in the background, that might be a muffled click from buffer switching. (When I say barely noticeable, I mean it's so quiet, if it weren't so fast and happening only when a song is playing, I'd suspect I was hearing my own heartbeat. It could, however, be a sign of a worse bug; that's why I generally report even the most trivial issues.)
<br/>
</li><li>Still has that bug where certain OGGs will start off at the wrong bitrate if played after certain others. When looking at the console output, even that remains frozen until it returns to the correct bitrate. The result is that for between 1 and ~20 seconds, the song is played at the wrong speed and pitch and the interface and buttons are locked up.
<br/>
</li><li>Start actually does something now. Output is terribly ugly though (wrapping all around the screen), and it works even when Hold is on.
<br/>
</li><li>I notice the Frame count in the console increases rapidly when paused or stopped. Should it be doing this?
<br/>
</li><li>After scanning metadata, filenames aren't shown anywhere, which makes it difficult to find a file if you're used to finding them by name, and impossible to tell which type of file you're playing, except by checking the console.
<br/>
</li><li>The OGG freeze/distortion bug, which I suspect is related to the wrong bitrate bug, still exists. When I start certain OGGs, for about 20 seconds, the interface and console are completely frozen, the buttons won't work, and the sound is distorted. It seems to have stopped happening with a few files, though.
<br/>
</li><li>No way to shuffle a playlist?</li></ul>

It'd really be nice if, when adjusting the volume, a percentage was displayed somewhere. I hate having to guess.

<br/>
I could send the files that cause these bugs, but they're mostly copyrighted, so I can't post them in public (and you have to agree to delete them when you're done testing ;-)).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] I managed to create a playlist that will lock up the latest version when you select a song, even though it lists the files just fine. The old version I was using plays it without any problems, until it hits the files with Japanese characters in their names. These show up if you go to Songs, and can be selected, but the names show up as garbage.
