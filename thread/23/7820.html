    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmmm...weird...it wont run for me..i just get two black screens.  I'm using a GBA MP and Moonshell to start it.  At first i stuck it in it's own litlte folder and what not ...and i thought maybe that was why, so I stuck it all at the root of the compact flash card and it still diden't work :(
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I got it to work by copying the directory itself..not just the contents of the directory.  it seem spretty cool..though..it would be nice if you coudl select thigns in that first menu without using the touch screen.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by chatterbug89 on Mon Dec 19, 2005 1:02 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks very good :) But you can modify ball reflection code, because ball's trajectory often becomes straight : upper edge-pad-upper edge-pad... etc. Ball must be reflected at different angles, depending on landing angle and, maybe, some random direction :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This also happened to me seveal times.  It occurs when you slide your paddle into the ball so the ball hits the side of the paddle.  it stays making the noise and stuck until you move the paddle.
<br/>
<br/>
also the game is much improved over the last time I tried it, good job.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe it's just me..  but here's my feedback:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Instructions are almost impossible to read with font color/background. Same with text on Hall of Fame.
<br/>
<br/>
2) In all modes, I have a hard time getting the ball to bounce to the right, it always wants to go strait.  It bounces to the left without issues.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Simular, the ball doesn't change directions based off of where it hits the blocks.  Meaning, from the start, if I don't press anything (except R or A to release the ball) it will bounce up and down till the column is gone, even if it is hitting blocks on the corners.
<br/>
<br/>
4) Pressing start to pause, no way to get back to main menu till you kill off your lives.
<br/>
<br/>
5) Sometimes, I get the feeling there are two balls, but they are on top of each other, and fallow the same "path" and therefore never seperate.
<br/>
<br/>
Looks great, keep up the good work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

im not sure about m3 compatibility as i dont have an m3. i just use m3 drivers and thought it might work. 
<br/>
<br/>
@ Lynx
<br/>
wow thanx for all that mate. i might after xmas correct all these issues. i've already stuck chishm`s new cf driver in so hopefully sd and fc are now supported. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm running it from a GBA MP and it runs fine.  I also like how I can edit the .jpgs and change the blocks, power ups, backgrounds, etc.  I can't wait till you get these minor bugs fixed so I can do a full review on ndshb.com</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">right after a couple of hours this morning ive got all the above bugs ironed out the main problem with the ball reflections was that i was converting from floats to int to early now im doing it a bit later theres much more precision and it feels better to play ive also made it so you can jump back to the main menu from the pause screen and fixed it so you can read the text and ive hopfully sorted the bug where the ball gets stuck in the bat.
<br/>
<br/>
ohh and ive put chishm`s new cf driver in it to so there should be much better comatibility with diffrent formats.
<br/>
<br/>
ive edited the game link in the first post with the new version but ive not updated the source yet ill do that a little later when i have a bit more timw :)
<br/>
<br/>
hope its a bit more enjoyable now ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
