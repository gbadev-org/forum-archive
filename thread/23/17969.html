    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ImpulseDS is a racing game inspired by F-Zero X which includes a track editor, allowing you to test tracks you've created. This is an alpha version so both the track editor and racing mechanics are far from feature-complete ;-) A windows version will be released soon for quicker track creation.

<br/>
<br/>
ImpulseDS uses libfat, so if your flash cart doesn't support automatic DLDI patching then please patch it with the correct driver. <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/</a>
<br/>
-Place the ImpulseDS.nds binary on your flash cart.
<br/>
-Place the ImpulseDS folder in one of 3 places:
<br/>
   - the same folder as the .nds binary
<br/>
   - the root of the flash cart
<br/>
   - in /data/
<br/>
<br/>
Controls:
<br/>
<br/>
Button-mode controls:
<br/>
Accelerate   - A
<br/>
Brake      - B
<br/>
Turning      - D-Pad left/right
<br/>
<br/>
Touch-mode controls:
<br/>
Accelerate   - D-Pad up or X
<br/>
Brake      - D-Pad down or B
<br/>
Turning      - Touchscreen. Click and drag anywhere on the touchscreen to turn the vehicle - this method allows analog turning.
<br/>
<br/>
To exit the game and return to the track editor, press Start.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Rajveer on Thu Jul 31, 2014 9:44 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The game doesn't want to run on my M3 DS REAL. I always get the message that it "Cannot find game directory".
<br/>
I've now tried all three places for the ImpulseDS folder, but I still get the same message.
<br/>
My last try was to patch the file for DLDI myself, but it still doesn't run.
<br/>
<br/>
I liked your last 2 demos and would really like to try this one out on my NDS. But it took a while for me to find out that this thread had to do anything with "Futuracer", maybe you shouldn't change the name of the project every time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback! I haven't taken a look into this issue yet, however a temporary workaround without save ability is to use a NitroFS version I built earlier this year:

<br/>
<br/>
I only ran this version once and haven't tested it so am not sure if it will work properly.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try compiling with the latest devkitPro but I'm not sure anything has changed in libfat since the build I'm currently using (can't remember which one that is).
<br/>
<br/>
Also good point about the naming and being able to track the latest demos (I've amended the thread title for others). The reason this is a new project was because this was a complete rewrite and done in a completely different way to Futuracer, but I promise it won't change from this :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
