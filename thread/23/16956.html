    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
For the last 4 months I have been working on an x86 emulator for NDS.
<br/>
Now finally I have something to show for my efforts, so I decided to
<br/>
announce this project, and release a technical demonstration.
<br/>
<br/>
DSx86 currently emulates 80286 processor, MCGA 320x200 screen and SoundBlaster audio.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find the demo at <a href="http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/" target="_blank">http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The demo has my old DOS game LineWars II bundled with the emulator core.  The emulator runs the game between 5 and 15 fps, with rare peaks up to 30 fps, depending on the amount of ships alive and visible on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I have also a blog/diary on my DSx86 web pages that gives some background about the emulator in case you are interested.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Beta version 0.43 released! See the link in my signature.

That shouldn't be a problem. I plan to support all 320x200 modes, including CGA (for Elite) and EGA (for the Sierra adventure games like Leisure Suit Larry and Space Quest).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the links to those games, btw! Giving me a link to a game download increases the chances that this specific  game is the next one to be supported considerably! :-)

When it can run Master Of Orion...
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Master of Orion seems to require a 386 processor, so it won't run on my emulator, sorry. Some of the design decisions I have made in my emulator are bad for 32-bit support, and changing those would make also 16-bit support slower.
<br/>
<br/>
In general, if a DOS game runs on 286 processor and in 320x200 resolution it should work in my emulator in the future. The biggest worry I have is that some game uses the Parity or Auxiliary Carry flags, as I don't support those at all (and adding support would be VERY difficult without sacrificing pretty much all the current performance). There is a chance that I could code a game-specific support for those flags, but currently I just hope I won't ran into a game that uses them. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
My emulator is not based on DOSBox, I have only used it as a reference (which reminds me, I need to add a "credits" page on my DSx86 web site). DOSBox is very good at what it does, but is not the best option when absolute best performance is necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
There are still various optimization tricks I haven't used, for example if I could just get self-modifying code to work reliably I could immediately make my emulator about 10% faster, but all my attempts to use it have been failures so far.
<br/>
<br/>
But, I'll keep working on it and we'll see how it improves!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!

Not at all, I just quickly Googled for minimum hardware requirements. If it runs on a 286, then it perhaps could be made to run in my emulator.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lazy1: Thanks, I did make a lot of optimizations to the algorithm while converting it to ASM. There are still features missing (no vibrato, and I think I broke the amplitude modulation also at some point) and I haven't been working on it for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
LW2 uses only SoundBlaster digital audio (it uses my own 6-channel mod player version, 4 channels for music and 2 extra for sound effects), I was actually quite surprised that the highly optimized and time critical x86 ASM sample mixing loop runs emulated as well as it does in DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
FluBBa: Yes, I know of the table lookup method for the parity flag, it's just that I would then have to remember the value that changed the parity flag (if I use the "lazy flags" method, which sounds the most suitable), and that would add extra code to a lot of opcodes, which will slow things down. And I hate that. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Wraggster &amp; Dwedit: Also, if the game was released before around 1992, it will probably support 286, if between 1992 and 1995 it might support, if later than 1995 then it is likely that it requires a 386 processor, though of course not necessary.

<br/>
Yes it would, and it would be fun to emulate a GUS, as it closely resembles the NDS hardware. However, I'm not sure how worthwhile it would be, as most games that use GUS are coded when 386/486 processors started to be mainstream. It would help in LW2, certainly, but how fast LW2 runs in DSx86 is pretty much irrelevant.
<br/>
<br/>
BastarB &amp; ingramb: Thanks for your kind comments! I am reasonably experienced in x86 ASM, but only a beginner with ARM ASM. This is actually my first ARM ASM project.. :-)

<br/>
ggx2neo: Windows is most likely out of the question, I believe it needs protected mode support. In any case it would be way down on the priority list of software to support. Games that have a version ported to DS are not very high on the list either, as a direct port will always run much better than an emulated version. If they happen to run on my emulator, fine, but  I won't spend time adding special support for them.
<br/>
<br/>
sverx: Yes, I plan to support FAT access (if I understand correctly what you mean by it). The emulator will have a DOS prompt "C:\&gt;" where you can launch a .com or .exe file on your SD card, and give some simple commands like DIR and CD. I'm toying with the idea of actually 'booting' some real DOS version, but that might be a dumb idea. On the other hand, writing a command line parser and all the DOS commands is not very appealing either, but I'll see how it goes.
<br/>
<br/>
sfg: I'm not familiar with those titles, you'll just have to see when a full version is eventually released. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently trying to get Norton SYSINFO running, I'd like to see it's benchmark of the CPU speed. Next is the old game Paratrooper, it is small and uses CGA graphics, which is an interesting new feature to support.

Nice results, but I think a benchmark that's dominated by divisions is far from representative of the real capabilities of the emulator. Especially with an interpreter. The ratio of fetch/decode to execute for a divide instruction is going to be much different from most instructions.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this is only true if it really is just using divisions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Exophase: The 10 MHz value is based on division instructions, but I believe the 11.6 speed index is not. I haven't checked what that is based on, but if my emulator ran at the speed of 10MHz 286, it would have gotten a speed index of only around 6.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, what is interesting is that PocketDOS shows on their screenshots page a 206MHz StrongARM running Norton Sysinfo, and getting a speed index of 12.1 (with a division-based speed estimate of 33MHz). It looks to be a different version of Norton Sysinfo, but still...

The same page also show Windows 3.0 running on that thing, so I guess it would be theoretically possible to run Windows on DSx86 as well, eventually.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and those values on my blog are from No$GBA. When running on real DS Lite, it showed "Intel 80286, 11MHz" and speed index of 11.3.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then yeah, I wonder what it's actually doing. I take it the file is not freely available anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not that surprising that your emulator would perform much better than DOSBox, but I don't think that the score you got represents the maximum your computer can do. Chances are you had cycles set to something that was artificially limiting it. You should check that, and the CPU time used while emulating that section.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually surprised No$ gets results as close as the real thing. I'm guessing what you're running is very cache friendly. I take it your interpreter is sitting in ITCM? And the working set for the benchmark probably fits in dcache easily enough.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be nice to determine how many millions of instructions per second you're capable of emulating, for some "normal" sorts of instructions. Unfortunately, w/o cycle counting you can't do such a thing in the emulator and would have to rely on a benchmark to say so. Wikipedia says that a 286 at 12MHz is capable of 0.15 MIPS/MHz; personally I think this value looks too low and the real one should be closer to 0.2-0.25.
<br/>
<br/>
So we're looking at somewhere between 1.5 to 3 million instructions per second that your emulating is doing - or an average of about 20-40 ARM9 cycles per instruction. That's not especially unrealistic, although a little surprising still given all the fetching and decoding that goes into an x86 instruction. If your instruction stream is dominated by register and small (8bit) immediate instructions and you have a quick path for mod = 3 then I think these numbers are pretty realistic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I've done cycle counting with my emulator, the results are on my blog. The main opcode fetch loop is in ITCM, as are most of the single-byte instruction handlers and string instruction (REP) handlers.
<br/>
<br/>
I think your estimate of 20-40 ARM9 cycles per instruction is correct, as it takes between 11 and 30 timer ticks, including the timer start/stop overhead, to emulate an instruction. Since the timer runs at half clock speed, that corresponds to 22-60 CPU cycles (including overhead).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I think I need to concentrate on making the emulator work with actual software next, not just optimizing the performance, although I find the latter generally much more interesting. :-)

Sorry, I thought it was a new post, I didn't think to look through the old ones. I wonder exactly how much overhead the timer start/stop is adding - it's probably nothing for starting it, since all of that happens before it starts running, but would have something for getting the value/stopping it. Wouldn't it be better to keep the timer always running and record the start/stop ticks and subtract the two?

One other thing.. I just want to let you know in case you aren't aware.. if you're using code that's under the GPL (in this case debug_disasm.cpp from DOSBox) then the GPL technically requires you to make your entire project GPL, not just indicate that you're using the code. This applies even if you didn't modify the file at all.

It's also worth noting that the first game's actual gameplay takes place on a 208*160 "window", well within the bounds of the DS.

<br/>
Ant6n: My plan has been to have configurable DS keys, and your idea of having several profiles is a good one. Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
lincruste: The reason why most games will not yet work is mostly due to my "on-demand" support for opcodes. I have been adding opcodes (and their modrm bytes) only when a game encounters a previously unsupported opcode. This just so that I can see the progress, and also because when I started this project I wasn't sure if it will be doable at all, so I didn't want to spend a lot of time on something that will then have to be abandoned. So, even if a game is text only, it is no more likely to work than a graphics game. Oh, and most games should only take a few days or a week of work to support, not months. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Vague Rant: Ah, Duke Nukem might be reaosnably easy to support. I don't yet have EGA support so Duke Nukem 1 would probably take more work to support than Duke Nukem 2.
<br/>
<br/>
headspin: Ah, Sopwith, that brings back memories! :-) Might be easy to support, but if there already is a DS version it is not very high in my priority.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I am currently trying to get 4DOS running as a command interpreter. All sorts of problems with it yet, but getting it to work would allow me not to have to code a command shell myself.

Anyway, I don't have too much constructive to throw in about your project, although I am really excited about it and wish you the best of luck.  Personally, aside from Wing Commander (the thought of which on my DS makes me swoon) what I'd really love to see supported are the late-80s Sierra adventure games.  Space Quest 3, Quest for Glory 1 &amp; 2, and soforth.

<br/>
I also second the call to get your program to play Alley Cat.  Since it's a CGA game from the 8088 era that still runs on computers today, I can't imagine it would be that difficult to implement.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, to whoever it was who was talking about playing Civ I on the DS:  It's worth mentioning that the emulator SnemulDS can play the SNES port of Civ quite well.

Yeah, that's what I plan to do when I have the time. The problem is that there are quite a few places where stack access is used (all PUSH and POP opcodes, plus CALL, RET, IRET, etc). So that means duplicate code for quite a  few places, but I'm sure the gains will be worth it, considering 99% of the time the stack will be halfword-aligned. Oh, and I could also keep the aligned code in ITCM, and the unaligned version in normal RAM (as it can/will be slower anyways).

I don't know the exact structure of your emulator, but you probably decode the opcode and dispatch to the correct execution of it based on some table. Presumably the base pointer of that address might be in a register even. So you could create a second table for the case where SP is misaligned. So now you don't have to put a check every time, you just have to change the address of your table look up when the SP becomes misaligned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Ant6n: Yes, I have the main opcode table in stack, so that I can access it via SP register as the base register. I can't easily switch to another table, but I can simply change the table contents for the PUSH/POP opcodes whenever the emulated stack pointer becomes aligned or unaligned. That's the way I plan to optimize the stack handling, just haven't gotten around to it yet.

Last weekend I didn't have quite as much time to work on DSx86 as I would have liked (real life intruded), but I did manage to make some small progress with the internal DOS emulation.

...of course you could also move whatever other data is on the stack to your 'mirror' location and point the SP there as well (not much more than emulated cpu state, maybe?).

Anacobra: Thanks for your kind comments! Welcome to the forum! I hope DSx86 can eventually live up to your high expectations. I have to remind you, it is just my hobby project and the first ever emulator I have coded, so the first versions will certainly be very limited and buggy.

I managed to get Solar Winds logos to display, but even that required some new code, as for some peculiar reason SW moves data from main RAM to VRAM with a code like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
   push   ds
<br/>
   mov   ax,[6B99]
<br/>
   mov   es,ax
<br/>
   mov   ax,A000
<br/>
   mov   ds,ax
<br/>
loop:
<br/>
   mov   al,es:[di]
<br/>
   mov   [si],al
<br/>
   inc   di
<br/>
   inc   si
<br/>
   cmp   di,4380
<br/>
   jne   loop
<br/>
   pop   ds
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I really don't see what's the advantage of that instead of using source and destination indices like they are supposed to be used, and why not do it in the standard way:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
   mov   ax,[6B99]
<br/>
   mov   ds,ax
<br/>
   mov   ax,A000
<br/>
   mov   es,ax
<br/>
   mov   cx,something
<br/>
   rep   movsb
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
which does pretty much the same thing, but much more efficiently!
<br/>
<br/>
The original code runs quite slowly in DSx86 compared to the string instruction code. Hopefully the actual game code uses string instructions, I haven't yet gotten that far so I don't know yet.

DSx86 uses libFAT to access the SD card, like it was a C:\ disk drive. I have a DSTT card so that I don't need to do any patching or things like that to make it work on my DS Lite hardware, and to be honest I don't even know the details regarding this patching thingy, so I just hope you can make it work in your environment like you do with other nds files that need file access.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a bundled version, which currently has 4DOS and a couple of small games (currently PTROOPER, ALLEYCAT and ELITE) inside the nds file, so that I can run it in No$GBA without any trickery to test it easily. I won't release this version, though.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the released version won't work at all without 4DOS.COM on your SD card. I'll provide you with the necessary info and download locations for that as well when I release the emulator. Sorry for this extra bother, but I think the advantages of a real command shell are well worth the extra hassle. You can even use 4DOS to build a game menu within DSx86, using it's advanced batch file and screen writing features!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking of requiring the 4DOS.COM to be either on the root of your SD card, in the \4DOS\ directory, or anywhere on the card if you have a CONFIG.SYS in the root directory with a "SHELL=path\4DOS.COM" line in it. Does anyone have any objections to this? The last option will also enable other command shells in the future.

So just wondering, how will you use the native controls of the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
The D-Pad will most likely be the arrow keys correct? :p
<br/>
<br/>
A, B, X and Y could be Alt, Ctrl, Shift and Enter/Space? What do you have planned for this?
<br/>
<br/>
An interesting idea I had...if in the config file or some other file you could designate the controls depending on what game has been booted, because different games use a variety of different keys, (and I don't want to be playing with the touch-screen all the time) is this possible do you think? I suppose you would need a large collaborative effort to get a lot of games though I guess...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dantheman: Ok, I believe \DATA\DSx86\ would work fine as the location for the required files of DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
Fancypants: Your idea is pretty much spot on what I have planned. :-) By default D-Pad will be the arrow keys, and A will be Enter. Other default keys I haven't decided yet, but I plan to have an optional section per game in the configuration file (probably using INI-file syntax) where you can override the keys per game. You can also override the default screen handling method (blit/direct write, scaled/scrolled) and other things that might need per-game configuration. I'll provide a default configuration, but I expect the user to then modify this file to suit their needs and add their own game sections there.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I can't play WC2 using the default up/down arrows (as the ship moves to the wrong direction). The configuration file will allow swapping of the Y-axis for this game to suit my preferred up/down steering style, even when the game itself does not have this configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to have a GUI for updating this configuration info, but I'm pretty sure that won't be in the first released version yet.

The idea of having to have a config.sys in the root of my DS card makes me giggle.  However, my suggestion - and this is just my personal taste - is to confine things to subdirectories.  I find that the root of my DS card is absolutely *filled* with incomprehensible crap due to all the various homebrews and things that require files in the root, yet I can't delete stuff because I don't know what files are used by what.  I much prefer it when programs can keep things contained in subdirectories, just for the sake of tidiness.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Btw, I'm using a separate SD card for DSx86 development, mainly so that I don't destroy my other DS homebrew stuff if there is a serious bug in DSx86 FAT handling (or in a DOS program I'm running on it). You might want to consider this as well, just to keep your other important data safe. I'm a bit worried as DSx86 gives such full access to your whole SD card, so that giving for example a "del *.*" command will really delete everything in that directory. I don't think I'll support commands like "format c:", though, as that would not result in anything useful. :-)

It's a method with which you create a virtual FAT12 filesystem with all the files you need, tack it onto the end of the .nds file, and load the entire thing with no$gba.

<br/>
You can either follow the instructions at <a href="http://dev-scene.com/NDS/FCSR_Tutorial" target="_blank">http://dev-scene.com/NDS/FCSR_Tutorial</a> or simply install "DLDIrc" which includes two-click FCSR image creation as a feature.  In either case, if you choose to try it, I would highly suggest using <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=15369" target="_blank">Dwedit's "add_to_disk_image.exe" program</a> rather than the included "BFI.exe" program, as it's more stable in creating the FAT12 image.  Simply put it in the same folder, open up build.bat in Notepad, and replace the "bfi.exe -q -c0 -f=%1 %2" line with "add_to_disk_image.exe %1 %2" to make it work.

Ah, thanks for the info and links! I was aware there was a method like this, but I hadn't found good instructions on how to use it. This method allows the nds file to grow over 4 megabytes, correct?
<br/>
<br/>
It's not a huge deal having to use real hardware for much of the testing, but I'm afraid the SD card contacts (or more likely the slots) might stop working eventually when I keep inserting and ejecting the card dozens of times a day.

My guess is that if there is a limit, it would be 32 MB.  There probably isn't, but I don't have any evidence either way.  It's over 4 MB though, I can tell you that.

<br/>
Wifi transfer is also another good option, assuming you only need to transfer a small number of files each time.  As another option to Pete's program, I used httpexec for a while myself, which worked well until it stopped working on my card for some reason (which I never bothered figuring out).

No clue what libfilesystem is, but it may be less tricky to setup than FCSR image creation, in which case it would be worth looking into.

AFAIK libfilesystem is VERY simular to the nitroFS that the official carts use, just to run libfilesystem apps on a real DS you need to run it via the homebrew menu launcher application that is in the devkitPro's SVN.  To use libfilesystem you just need to set up a directory in your project, add a couple of defines in the makefile (look at the libfilesystem example in your examples folder that comes with devkitPro) and compile it.
<br/>
<br/>
The max size of an nds file with libfilesystem is approx 32MB (IIRC), also note that if you use the homebrew menu to run your apps it sets up a couple of things that are very handy for applications that use files on the SD card, like the current directory is set to the one your NDS file is in - which means that your data folder does not need to be in the root, it can be in the same folder as your nds file.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the homebrew launcher instead of the supplied launcher on my EzFlash Vi, and appart from a couple of games that expect the data folder to be in the root folder everything is in it's own sub folder - no need for the /DATA/DSx86 folder, you can just use DOS/command.com to access command.com in the dos sub folder of your SD card (making the current folder the root of your virtual C: drive)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I was updating my old project to build againt the latest devkitARM r27 and I played around with these two just recently and found out some things:
<br/>
<br/>
1) looking at the code, I prefer libfilesystem.. written "more correctly" IMO
<br/>
<br/>
2) EFS 2.0 is faster as it uses read/lseek, and open()'ing files is much quicker (the internal finding of the files is faster)
<br/>
<br/>
3) libfilesystem can be sped up by changing the code to use file desc instead of the stream... basically change fread, fseek to read/lseek in nitroSubRead()... also the open()'ing files in your project that contains lots of files sitting in a single dir will give you a speed hit (from my testing on hw.. YMMV)
<br/>
<br/>
4) however, it's probably not worth doing #3 in most projects and the improvement might seem negligable to some. Plus, libfilesystem is maintained and a part of the toolchain and also see #1
<br/>
<br/>
5) The only unstable part of EFS 2.0 (that I have come across) is the dirnext() stack problem which is used in the SearchDirectory() call. This can be fixed completely with this code:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">// search in directory for the NDS file

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
   stat(pent-&gt;d_name, &amp;statbuf);
<br/>
        if(S_ISDIR(statbuf.st_mode)) {
<br/>
            if(strcmp(".", pent-&gt;d_name) != 0 &amp;&amp; strcmp("..", pent-&gt;d_name) != 0) {
<br/>
                chdir(pent-&gt;d_name);
<br/>
                found = SearchDirectory();
<br/>
                chdir("..");
<br/>
            }
<br/>
        } else {
<br/>
            getcwd(path, EFS_MAXPATHLEN-1);
<br/>

<br/>
                break;
<br/>
            }
<br/>
        }
<br/>

<br/>
    closedir(pdir);
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
} </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

This function only gets called once to write out the NDS path first time you ever run your program (or rename/move it afterwards). Funny thing tho, I changed to diropen/dirnext/etc while using libfilesystem and still got corruption... it's as if the problem is in libfat or something.
<br/>
<br/>
6) libfat 1.0.4 (built using r27, don't use pre-built) is a lot faster than the latest 1.0.6 (and 1.0.5). I believe that new caching stuff that was put in it really killed it for my particular set up.
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to stick with EFS 2.0 (with code changes as listed in #5) and linked against an r27 build of libfat 1.0.4 ... this setup gave me almost 3x faster in loading/reading files off the SD card (im my particular project, YMMV) when compared to the stock libfilesystem and libfat that's in r27.
<br/>
<br/>
For the best of both worlds, I check for argv[0] and, if found, use that in efs_path. If that fails, only then do I let the SearchDirectory() call go do its thing.
<br/>
<br/>
wintermute may chime in on this, but these are just my own little experiments :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ritz on Tue Dec 22, 2009 7:35 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

ritz, what do you mean by this? Are you calling that function when your using libfilesystem? If you are I take it its because of the issues with the current card launchers not providing the arguments to the nds files correctly, and if that's the case you should use the homebrew launcher as that's the only thing that you can really use to launch your nds files correctly at any point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">libfilesystem is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> very similar to the nitro filesystem used on official carts, it's a library which currently provides an interface to the nitro filesystem as used on official carts. In the future there will be another couple of interfaces.
<br/>
<br/>
The 32meg limit is only when running the nds file from GBA cart or via no$gba &amp; emulators which run the NDS from GBA cart space. On slot 1 cards the limit is raised to the max file size accessible via FAT.
<br/>
<br/>
Ritz, if you feel like doing a patch for libfilesystem to use lseek,read,open it would be much appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
There may still be a few tweaks we can do to the cache stuff on DS that may help - on wii/gamecube that code made libfat 10x faster. There's also a small possibility that the speed hit may be related to the DLDI - devkitARM r27 has been patched for unbuffered IO.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really not keen on the search for nds file approach - there are some quite bad failure cases with this and obviously the ideal situation is for all card menus to support argv.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

4DOS uses a startup file called 4start.btm (or 4start.bat). Create such a file into the 4dos directory, and put
<br/>
<br/>
cd \data\dsx86\whatever
<br/>
<br/>
into it, so you go to the correct directory when you start.
<br/>
<br/>
You can put whatever other initialization commands as well to that batch file (or create a menu of your favorite games or whatever).
<br/>

Sorry I forgot to mention that on my web pages, but I'll compile a FAQ page based on questions I get here. :-)

When you get an "Unsupported INT call" I need more info from the logs, as the address the debugger points to is the NEXT command after the actual INT call (that's because you can actually continue after such a problem by using the 'G' and 'v' symbols on the bottom row). The messages with yellow text are not fatal errors, though they will probably make the game not run properly.

Ah, that's nasty, it checks the parity flag, which I don't support (as ARM does not have that flag). If you can provide me with the whole disassembly part of the log, I might be able to code a workaround for this specific game.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and there is currently no better way to continue but to reboot the console. I could perhaps add a soft reboot (relaunch the shell) later.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again guys for taking the time to test it, I know it is probably frustrating for you to test new games when they never work! It is for me, at least. :-)

Hey, by Commander Keen 2 do you mean "Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons: The Earth Explodes", or do you mean the second series of Commander Keen, which is "Commander Keen in Goodbye Galaxy: The Secret of the Oracle"?
<br/>
<br/>
Because if you were trying to play "The Earth Explodes" <a class="postlink" href="http://www.portabledev.com/pages/ds/jeuxdev.-perso/commandskeen.php" target="_blank">this</a> is "CommanDS Keen" which was a port of "Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons" to the DS. CommanDS Keen plays the first 3 episodes of Commander Keen quite exceptionally except for a bit of lag and buggy graphics occasionally, but otherwise very, very well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have tried it a little, so far I have not managed to find a game that runs with the exception of the supported games in your game-list.

Should I post every log rapport from every game i try or is it currently unnessesary since this is a so early release?

Hi Nanimes and warmly welcome to this forum!=)
<br/>
<br/>
Check Pates blog at <a href="http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com" target="_blank">http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com</a> for information regarding the installation of files.
<br/>
<br/>
I can shortly say that the .ini file should go to /data/dsx86/ and the 4DOS.COM file should go into a folder named 4dos located here: /data/dsx86/4dos/
<br/>
<br/>
To run a program in DOS, you have to mount the correct folder of the game. 
<br/>
For example, if I'm going to play paratrooper, I have to get into the folder of it first. The name of this game-folder is "ptrooper" on my card. And I put it in \data\dsx86\ptrooper (But you can put it on any other location on your cart i think)
<br/>
<br/>
To locate that location in dxs86, you have to type the "cd" command just before you type the path you would like to mount. So you have to type it like this:
<br/>
<br/>
cd c:\data\dsx86\ptrooper
<br/>
<br/>
and then push enter
<br/>
<br/>
When you have done this, the commandpromt will look like this:
<br/>
<br/>
c:\data\dsx86\ptrooper&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Now this have become the current mounted directory. now you just have to type the name of the game file that is located inside this ptrooper folder. on my card the name is: ptrooper.com
<br/>
<br/>
So for me I'm just going to type "ptrooper.com" after the &gt; sign. It will look like this:
<br/>
<br/>
c:\data\dsx86\ptrooper&gt;ptrooper.com
<br/>
<br/>
Then press enter, and voila, you are inside the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It seems like DSx86 really does not currently run any other games than those I have tried myself, sorry about that. Coding this emulator is quite a big project, almost like eating an elephant, so I have to do it one "spoonful" at a time. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like testing further games and sending me the logs, that is appreciated, but I already have quite a list of new opcodes and various INT calls I need to add before releasing the next version. I have also found some more bugs in my core emulator, so I'll be busy for the next couple of weeks just with those!
<br/>
<br/>
Echtzeit: Sorry, I don't know of an easy way to run DSx86 with a DOS game in an emulator. :-(
<br/>
<br/>
usotsuki: Interesting info about 4DOS tricks, LOADFIX and COMMAND.COM. I plan to add support for other command shells, but I think 4DOS is simply the best. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Commander Keen 4 uses "lea bx,[di]"?? Funny... I didn't add that opcode as I didn't think anyone (or anything) would use that!
<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for your logs!

<br/>
<br/>
You can hit B to skip those messages and continue with the game. There is a slight problem that hitting B does not swap the bottom screen back to displaying the keyboard, so you might need to click on the upper right <span style="font-weight: bold">X</span> on the keyboard (which at this point is not visible!) to cause a user-breakpoint, and then click on the bottom row 'G' and 'v' to continue with the keyboard visible.

<br/>
I have spent the last couple of days working on my opcode tester program (as Leisure Suit Larry 3 kept crashing on me and I couldn't find the reason), and now Ihave found about half a dozen bugs in my opcode handlers and now finally LSL3 runs fine. Also, now with the tester program working fine I dare add more opcodes, as I can immediately test that I didn't break anything when adding them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How exactly do the overflow and halfcarry flags work on the X86, and how similar are the X86 flags to the Z80 flags?  SMSAdvance exploits the fact that they work almost the same way as they do on the ARM for certain instructions, and reads the ARM CPSR flags directly, then calculates the halfcarry flag in 3 instructions.
<br/>
It also uses pre-shifted numbers, so the processor overflow flag and carry flag work directly as expected.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, this is how SMSAdvance executes the Z80 Add instruction:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

   adds z80a,z80a,$x,lsl#$y
<br/>
   mrs z80f,cpsr                  ;S,Z,V&amp;C
<br/>
   mov z80f,z80f,lsr#28

   cmn r1,$x,lsl#$y+4
<br/>
   orrcs z80f,z80f,#PSR_H
<br/>
   MEND
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
But the subtract instruction works slightly differently, since the ARM carry flag has a meaning opposite to the Z80 when subtracting, it inverts the carry flag.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also use the register values pre-shifted to the upper halfword, and use the ARM flags as-is for the x86 flags.

<br/>
I try to push back supporting the aux-carry flag "for real" for as long as I can, hopefully I can do that by coding game-specific handlers for those few games that need it.

<br/>
sverx: Why should the SB port/irq be configurable? I emulate a PC hardware that has SB at port 220 and irq 7, all games should be able to work with those settings. If they don't, it's the game that is buggy! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: Thanks for pointing out the typo in the download link! I don't think there is need for expandable RAM, I believe 1MB conventional RAM plus 1 MB EMS is enough for all games that should reasonably run on DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
usotsuki: Thanks, but I have quite a few games already to test, and my plan is now to improve the opcode support a lot before the next release, so many games should have a chance to run in 0.02 version.

sverx: I just rewrote much of the port handling. The new code makes it easier to ignore certain port ranges, so that should be in the next version. I don't want to ignore all unknown port addresses, as I need to know for what ports I still need to add support.

Wonderful :) According to some very old specs I have, a soundblaster base port address can be one of the following: 210h, 220h, 230h, 240h, 250h, 260h and 280h (including soundblaster 1.0 and 1.5 base ports...)

drdim: Yeah, MS Flight Simulator might be interesting to test. Though, I know DSx86 is still very far from 100% IBM PC compatible, so it might not be all that useful to test it yet. But perhaps eventually..
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: I've been concentrating on the coverage of my CPU emulation, not the speed of it, so if anything the current CPU emulation core is somewhat slower than before. My plan is to first add pretty much all the opcodes, and only after that try to optimize it further. First correctness, only then speed. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Lazy1: That "packed file corrupt" is a problem with the original EXE packer code that many of the old games used, there's nothing wrong with your SD card. It is caused by the games loading below the first 64KB of RAM, which corrupts the segment address they use. DOS 5.0 and above had a LOADFIX program to help with this, I plan to include something similar but haven't yet had the time. You can try launching a secondary command shell but telling it not to swap by "\data\dsx86\4dos\4dos //swapping=none" (or whereever you installed 4DOS. Notice the double slashes.

I believe I have done those methods that EGA/VGA detection in your other link uses, so it must be something else. I don't support EGA/VGA ports properly yet, so I suspect those are the culprit.
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to add practically all the missing opcodes before releasing the next version, so there should not be any opcode errors (unless the game uses something very special) after that. I also try to code some sort of simple EGA emulation, but the problem is that even the simple EGA modes are really complex (read: slow to code and to emulate), compared to CGA and MCGA modes!

It's from 1995 so I doubt it'll work.
<br/>
<br/>
But there are multiple open source &amp; multiplatform remakes, so it should be easy to make a DS port.
<br/>
It would be THE perfect single-handheld multiplayer game (with one player taking the dpad and the other one XYBA).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, like jam_888 said, if a game requires a 386 processor, it won't run in DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be technically possible to add support for 386 processor, but that would mean a major rewrite of the whole CPU emulation. Also, the resulting emulator would still run at the speed of a 12MHz 286, so it still would not run those games properly. This is why I have no plans to add support for 386 processor in DSx86.

Well, it is. It just isn't when it boots up. For DOS, the applications themselves needs to enter 32-bit mode (usually though a DOS-extender like DOS4GW or PMODE/W).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Version 0.03 released!
<br/>
<br/>
This version brings preliminary support for EGA 320x200 16-color mode, and it has the Packed File Corrupt fix. It also has much improved opcode support, there are only a few 8086 opcodes still unsupported. The graphics modes (especially EGA) use different versions of some of the opcodes, though, so those might still give "Unsupported opcode" errors.
<br/>
<br/>
I have been testing the EGA support using Duke Nukem 2 (the shareware version), which is still somewhat glitchy but quite playable. It takes a really long time to load (I always think it has hung), but if you wait for a long time it will start. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know of any problems you encounter, I'll again try to fix many of those for the next version!

<br/>
Thanks for your interest in DSx86!

<br/>
<br/>
I took a quick look at the log file, most of the opcode errors are from the few still unsupported opcodes, so these are fixed in the next version. The last two, DIAMOND and CITY, use 386 opcodes, so those won't be supported. Ultima 6 INSTALL port I/O problem is due to the limited EGA support, and the ZANY "pop ss" is just something I seem to have forgotten to add, will be supported in the next version. Turbo Science INSTALL port I/O problem looks like a Gravis Ultrasound detection problem. The INT problems look reasonably easy to handle in the next version as well.
<br/>
<br/>
The infinite loops are trickier, I'll see what I can do about those... I'll try to improve the Packed File Corrupt detection as well.
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: Yeah, I guess I need to update my main page, thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With DSx86 0.03, I was able to start an old MS-DOS game called Galactix. 
<br/>
I used "Galactix version 1.5" with settings of:
<br/>
Sound Card: None
<br/>
Pointing Device: Keyboard
<br/>
<br/>
(It crashes shortly before loading the sound stuff with any other settings)
<br/>
<br/>
The installer/setup standalone program only runs in Windows (command prompt) because it crashes in DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
A small portion of the intro runs before it crashes. Basically it shows a couple scenes and then crashes (unsupported op code) at a scene that shifts slowly upwards.
<br/>
<br/>
The game was originally shareware but was made freeware by the company with the last version (1.5) ages ago. Later the same company ported it to the Windows OS and put a pricetag on it.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find various versions of this game on the net. I still have almost all the versions that existed in the public domain.

I'll try to work on all the issues in the log files I've received during the next weekend. Currently practically all the 8086 opcodes are supported (I think only AAS is still missing), but the INT calls, es: -opcodes and other hardware-specific stuff still needs a lot of work.

You are correct. I was merely pointing out a problem that need to be investigated.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, still on the topic of Battletech, is it normal (i.e. was it originally like that) that the directions don't auto-repeat themselves? In other words you have to press a direction each time you want to go there.Holding it does not repeat the action.
<br/>
I have not taken the time to try this in Dosbox. I find it a bit weird but it is possible it was designed this way. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since you seem to know the game quite well, it is more simple to ask you directly, in order to know if this is normal or if there is an issue with dsx86.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) New debug log:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy to report that Centurion: Defender of Rome is partially working (with sound).
<br/>
<br/>
[AT] : A-train
<br/>
[START] : Barbarian (Palace) aka Death Sword, in other words the 1vs1 game in which you can chop your opponent head off -&gt; from what Iread it should be a CGA game, so the error message about some graphics mode issue might be worth investigating.
<br/>
[CENTURIO] : Centurion: Defender of Rome: Partially works and with sound! The strategix map part seems to work correctly. The battle part seemed to work too, but when I selected a unit it crashed.
<br/>
[DOC] : Defender of the Crown
<br/>
[DUNEPRG] : Dune (the Cryo game)
<br/>
[DUNE2] : Dune II (well, it's a 286 game so I had little faith it would work)
<br/>
[SH] : Shinobi
<br/>
[SIMCITY] &amp; [INSTALL] : Sim City, but ignore this. Apparently the version I downloaded is configured for EGA and I'll probably need to go through Dosbox to reinstall it and configure it for a compatible graphic mode
<br/>
[STARCON] : Star Control
<br/>
[SF2] : Street Figther 2
<br/>
[DM] : Dungeon Master
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I tried Birds of Prey after.
<br/>
The pirate executable supposed to remove the manual protection creates an error.
<br/>
Otherwise, the game starts correctly, but of course the protection asks for a question from the manual and since I don't have it, I can't answer. I'll try to track it but at least replacementdocs does not seem to have it.
<br/>
At least I can report that after 3 failed attempts, you dsx86 send you back correctly to the dos prompt.
<br/>
<br/>
This leads me to a question, in case I find other games with pirate executables. As I suppose that they often use "unorthodox" instructions, are you interested on reports on those?
<br/>
<br/>
If yes, I'll try to remember and add the report for the Birds of Prey pirate exe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Great, glad to hear that! I looked at your newest log file, thanks for it! Some comments below:
<br/>
<br/>
[AT] : A-train: Looks to be some kind of VGA detection routine, should work in the next version.
<br/>
[START] : Barbarian (Palace) aka Death Sword: It requests grayscale text mode. I'll make this work exactly like the current text mode, but with greyscale palette. 
<br/>
[CENTURIO] : Centurion: Defender of Rome: It used one of the not yet supported opcodes, which are supported in the next version.
<br/>
[DOC] : Defender of the Crown: It uses a string instruction (word compare downwards) I haven't yet coded. I think there are some other decrementing string instructions I don't yet support, this reminds me I have to go thru those as well.
<br/>
[DUNEPRG] : Dune (the Cryo game): It tries to set up mouse movement ranges. DSx86 reports that no mouse exists, so this is a bit of bad behaviour on the part of the game. I'll make DSx86 ignore all mouse operations. 
<br/>
[DUNE2] : Dune II: It uses "repne" instead of the normal "rep" for a repeated "stosw" string write instruction. I've only handled "repne" in situations where it makes sense, but I'll add support for these silly usage scenarios as well. :-)
<br/>
[SH] : Shinobi: I haven't yet coded text output for all graphics modes, which the game tries to do. Too bad I can't see in the log which graphics mode it uses. I guess I should improve my logging a bit as well.
<br/>
[STARCON] : Star Control: It tries to load ROM 8x16 character set (which does not exist in DSx86). I'm not quite sure yet how to handle this. I guess I'll need to check DOSBox sources how they do this. :-)
<br/>
[SF2] : Street Figther 2: Again an opcode that is supported in the next version.
<br/>
[DM] : Dungeon Master: Oh, word input from I/O port. This I would have missed if you hadn't made the log available. :-)

There are no "unorthodox" instructions from DSx86's perspective, so all data from all sorts of software is very useful when improving DSx86. I obviously have no control over the legality of the games people run on DSx86, and as discussion of pirated games is not allowed on this forum, I do not need to know how you have acquired the games you test. I can only test the games myself if they are freeware, but the log files themselves usually contain enough information for me to address the issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

Sure, thanks for the log!
<br/>
<br/>
Wolf3D uses ModeX graphics mode so it won't work yet, but it should work when I have coded support for that mode.
<br/>
Warcraft uses the "repne movsb" opcode which I try to add for the next version.
<br/>
<br/>
So, at least based on the issues in the logs those should work eventually.

I haven't worked on the AdLib emulation for a while. It does not support the rhythm instruments yet, and it is also missing amplitude modulation and vibrato. The last time I tried to work on it the code stopped working completely, so I had to roll back all my changes to get it to work again. It seems rather too fragile at the moment, so I should fix it properly at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of releasing it as a library or something when I get the missing features added, it might be useful for various porting projects. Perhaps even as a pair with the SoundBlaster digital audio emulation, so it would be a simple thing to port a PC game that uses SB audio to NDS (well, simple audio-wise, at least :-).
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, yesterday a little while after I posted the blog message my development PC stopped booting. I removed my SSD raid discs and got it to boot, but then it hang again when I tried to shut it down. Just FYI, as this is the PC I have the DevKitARM installed, so the problems with it might affect the DSx86 release schedule. I already ordered new components (as that PC is about 5 years old already and I've been waiting for an excuse to upgrade it), but I won't receive those for a while yet.

I have backups, it's just that it will take time to install everything to a new PC. The old PC is still somewhat working, but getting blue screens pretty often, so there really is a hardware problem with it.
<br/>
<br/>
The AdLib emulation uses 9 hardware channels (direct 1:1 mapping between emulated and hardware channels), all with different panning values, randomly assigned between 32 and 96. The low volume is mostly due to the original AdLib code mixing everything to a single channel, so it had the sample tables adjusted so that it won't overdrive the result. I doubled (or quadrupled, can't remember which) the tables, but as the values are also used for feedback and other stuff besides generating the output samples, I got some distortion when trying to go over that. When I get back to working on the AdLib emulation I'll see if I can increase the volume still further.

Well, anyway, now that we can play LineWars II on DS, who needs a PC? :P

<br/>
More seriously, as Lazy1 said, sorry for the trouble you have with your dev. PC.
<br/>
<br/>
In case you are technically able to (supposing that blue screens don't appear when you compile) , why not release a v0.03b (with all the changes you have made recently even if they are not as exhaustive as you would have hoped too)?
<br/>
<br/>
This way, even though you would not actively develop, it would be an opportunity for testers to do some more tests during that period. Tests that would not report issues that are already fixed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree with you in general cases but here we have a specific situation.
<br/>
<br/>
Since he won't really be able to work much on dsx86 for a while, the release of a 0.03b would avoid people testing to submit logs about issues that have already been fixed.
<br/>
Besides, until active development resumes, I suppose that the best thing for future developments that can be done is probably more testing (of different games or further testing of games that seem to work).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is all supposing that pate can do such a thing and thinks it is worth it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I agree with lilalurl's reasoning. Yesterday I noticed that save games don't work in Elite. I tried to fix this, but then my PC got a blue screen and didn't boot at all after that.
<br/>
<br/>
If I get my PC to boot today and get that problem fixed, I'll release 0.04.
<br/>
<br/>
I debugged the save game code in Elite, and noticed that it gives an error if the save game file has any attributes. The file had Archive attribute bit, so it failed to load. I don't quite understand this, or perhaps I have misunderstood what the DOS "get file attributes" command is supposed to return.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, hoping my PC will still work for a little while so I can get 0.04 released today.

Feel free to test again the games you tested on 0.03, as many of the problems in the logs have been fixed (I hope).

It might take some time before the next version, as some of the parts I ordered for my new PC have a "10-20 work days" delivery time. I hope I get them sooner, though.

<br/>
jam_888: I don't know what exactly is wrong with my PC, but it is so old it might just be some chip on the motherboard that has had enough.
<br/>
<br/>
Lazy1: The keyboard handling code is currently limited to one key event per VBlank, so pressing several keys simultaneously does not always work quite properly. I'll need to improve this in upcoming versions.
<br/>
<br/>
The direct screen update modes use different opcodes to the normal 8086 opcodes. I haven't yet coded nearly all the direct graphics opcodes, so those might still give unsupported opcode errors for quite a while. I'll probably never support all possible "direct mode" opcodes, but I'll add the ones in the crash logs, at least.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently CGA mode only uses direct mode (I plan to add blitted mode as well), MCGA has both available, and EGA is a mixture of direct and blitted mode (with all the drawbacks and none of the advantages of both of them).
<br/>
<br/>
sverx: Yeah, I try to emulate an AT, but the secondary PIC has no interesting interrupts for DSx86. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Sektor: VGA support is probably the next big new feature I'll work on, but I think I'll need to improve the emulation in general still further before that, so 0.05 probably does not have VGA support yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the development is mostly halted now until I get my new PC. So, you all can take your time in testing 0.04, I'm looking forward to your log files!

    <h4>#172407 - lilalurl - Fri Feb 05, 2010 1:20 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, good news:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Canditates for fully working status:
<br/>
<br/>
Might &amp; Magic 3: Seems to work perfectly and with sound. I tested by wandering a bit and initiating a battle with monsters without any crash. It can be a bit slow when selecting "start a new game" and changing areas (disk access?), you then need to wait for several seconds before things on-screen change.
<br/>
Someone who like this kind of games might give a further test and a try to the first and second episodes of the series. Otherwise, I'll test then myself but since I don't know them, I will only do basic testing.
<br/>
<br/>
Centurion: Defender of Rome : seems to no longer have the issue I reported previously. I tested: strategic map, battle, back to strategic map : no issues.
<br/>
<br/>
Gauntlet : the game seems to work. You can enter the game and control your character with some keys. It seems the game was made for joystick support but has fallback key controls so it seemed a bit weird when testing. I'll try and remap controls in dsx86.ini to get a satisfying result and do further testing.
<br/>
<br/>
Battletech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception : I am happy to report that the part that generated the error I reported previously no longer pose an issue. It seems a bit strange it created an error because it appears to be just one menu like others you can see in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Improvements but other issues (without error messages):
<br/>
<br/>
Street Figther 2: The game now partially works and with sound (without sound too). But:
<br/>
<br/>
a) there is a graphic issue: You can only see the upper part (head, arms, chest) of the first character (player 1) and the bottom part of the 2nd character (CPU). But to compensate this, you have the pleasure to see these parts twice. In other words, the first character is made of a normal upper part, then some empty space and below the upper part again!!! :-D
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it has to do with the characters being made of several sprites (like in the arcade version)?
<br/>
As I don't get an error I can't give more details
<br/>
<br/>
b) I'll need to try in Dosbox to confirm if this is an issue with the music or not: You get a random music when you start the game and navigate in the menus. It is not the music you have in other versions of the game.
<br/>
Perhaps it is a deliberate choice however. I know that for instance the Amiga version has only a few musics that are played at random during the matches (but you have the 'expected' music in menus).
<br/>
<br/>
Improvements?:
<br/>
<br/>
Barbarian: starts and then all I get is a black screen (waited something like 10 seconds)
<br/>
<br/>
Dune2 : Same situation
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the debug log. I tested a few new games. Otherwise I think I retested all those I submitted a log for before. Some of those have improved.
<br/>
<a href="http://tarantola.alexandre.free.fr/dsx86/dsx86dbg-05-feb.log" target="_blank">http://tarantola.alexandre.free.fr/dsx86/dsx86dbg-05-feb.log</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[ARCHON] : Archon
<br/>
[AT] : A-train
<br/>
[BAT] : B.A.T. : the title screen is displayed and then Unsupported INT call. One interesting thing perhaps is that after pressing the DS X button to go back to the dos prompt, it kept entering c:&gt; without any input from and no possibility to interrupt it (had to restart the DS.
<br/>
[BOPINC] : Birds of Prey run through the errrm... trial period extender ;-)
<br/>
[BUMPY] : Bumpy's arcade fantasy
<br/>
[CIV] and [MGRAPHIC] : Civilization
<br/>
[DGEN] : D/Generation CGA and EGA
<br/>
[DOC] : Defender of the Crown
<br/>
[DUNEPRG] x2 and [INSTALL] : Dune : hmm, apparently it is a VGA game, although I thought I had read it supported CGA (?). Anyway, under VGA you can get the logo and the intro to display then Unsupported opcode!. After going to the install and selecting the other video mode, that is "monochrome VGA" (never knew this existed!), you can see the logo but Unsupported string op seg/dir! Then I got an error going into the install...
<br/>
[F]: Fool's Errand
<br/>
[START], [CGAME] and [EGAME] : Gunship : The three crash, but with one of the exe (CGAME I think) for a split second when the game starts you get to see the helicopter dashboard.
<br/>
[MAIN] : Nobunaga's ambition 2: EGA game apparently. I thought it had a CGA mode but I can't see how to configure this. I'll try Nobunaga's ambition 1 later.
<br/>
[POCUS] x2 : Ports of Call : The first is Unsupported SB DSP command!, when I tried to run the game with sound (Sound Blaster I think hence the SB in the error). Then I tried without sound. Compared to my previous report you can now go further: start a new game, select some options, input some data (name etc...). You then proceed to see the world map (globe) being drawn and get a Unsupported INT call! at the end of the drawing.
<br/>
[PRINCE] : Prince of Persia hmmmmm, compared to bob_fossil I don't even get a loading screen ???
<br/>
[POPCORN] : Pop Corn
<br/>
[SOUND] and [RICK2] : Rick Dangerous 2 : First error by starting via start.com and second error by running the main executable
<br/>
[SH] and [SHINOBI] : Shinobi, two different executables, not sure if there is a difference
<br/>
[SIMCITY] x3: Sim City : Now I can start the game. I indeed had to go through Dosbox and run the installer to change the video mode (as the game only install from and to drive A: or B: you'll need to alias the directory in which sim city is located as a drive to have the game install correctly).
<br/>
You can get the title screen to display but when you select one of the starting options, you get Unsupported opcode!
<br/>
[SKWEEK] : Skweek
<br/>
[STARCON] : Star Control
<br/>
[SPACEWAR] : SpaceWar!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This makes me wonder: will DSx86 emulate a joystick? I mean, the pen can be used on the touchscreen... of course moving it, not tilting it as in a real joy. Is it possible?
<br/>
<br/>
And about AT/XT... ok, it's true you don't need the secondary PIC interrupts (well, you won't really ever emulate the RTC? ...), but I guess then you shouldn't stop with "unsupported port I/O" when accessing 0xA0 and 0xA1 ports, true? :)

Just install/setup it via Dosbox, then you have an installed version that you can transfer to your flash cart.

I yesterday installed the latest devkitARM on my laptop, and compiled DSx86 on it. I had not dared to update the kit on my development PC, but I had (nearly) no issues with the latest kit, and when I tested it on my DS Lite I noticed that all disk access was noticeably faster than with the old (r22 or r23) devkit I have been using in DSx86. So, the next version should have faster disk access.

Is the key mapping syntax clear enough? I planned to put a link to the PC hardware key numbers on my DSx86 pages, but I couldn't find a site that would have the key numbers without some other (potentially confusing) info like the DOS key scancodes.

Interesting! I have no theories how that could happen..
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, for graphics glitches you could try taking a screen copy (go to the debugger with the big X button, then use the touchpad to click on the command row P and then v) to file /SCR00.BMP to your SD card. The BMP is upside down and it is always written to SCR00.BMP, I might fix these if there is real use for this screen copy feature. I could then take a look at the image to see if I can figure out what might be the cause for that.

I believe I would need to debug these games myself to be able to find out what is wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the debug log, I'll take a look at it.
<br/>
<br/>
I can continue working on DSx86 on my laptop, but it has a 14" display,  600MHz CPU and 8GB disk, so I probably want work on any larger improvements until I get a new development CPU built.

Probably not. I might emulate a mouse using the touchpad, though.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I already fixed the secondary PIC ports in 0.04, but if not, I'll try to do that for 0.05.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">usotsuki: Thanks for the info (I had apparently forgotten to say this in my previous reply). I guess that explains why I had the idea to test it in dsx86 (probably saw online it was said to be MCGA which should refer to the said monochrome VGA).
<br/>
<br/>
Pate:
<br/>
Disk access: that will be great. I'll try to remember the issue and test MM3 first when the next release is out to see if things have improved.
<br/>
<br/>
Keyboard syntax:
<br/>
Well, I happen to know about scan codes and such so for me it is understandable. But sooner or later I think you may have some users who don't know much about this so if you happen to have some time to make a document clear enough for newcomers that could be helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps someone here with enough/talent could make either a document or perhaps a small program that would work like:
<br/>
you have a keyboard layout, you click on a key and you then select which DS button you want to use for the key, you do the same for the other buttons and you then have the program export to the clipboard the keys and values all ready to be pasted in the .ini.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Street fighter 2 issue:
<br/>
The issue is actually a bit more complex. I just tried a bit more and apparently depending on the characters involved (levels too perhaps) you might also have the first character made of bottom parts.
<br/>
Anyway, here is a screenshot (horizontally flipped and PNGed for convenience):

Well, from what I read Frontier requirements are a 286 and has a MCGA mode, so technically I believe there is a good chance that it will run on dsx86 one day or another.

Pate may have a better idea on this of course.

It should be located at \data\dsx86 on your flashcart and called dsx86dbg.log .

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">daithi81: Thanks for the debug logs! I'll try to fix at least the simple problems for the next version. If Frontier: Elite 2 runs on a 286 and MCGA graphics, it should run on DSx86 at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
BastarB: Sorry, I don't know what could cause the white screens, I don't think I changed anything so drastic in 0.04, it was mostly just new opcodes and INT handling. Version 0.05 will be based on a much newer libnds, so hopefully it will fix the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
lilalurl: Yeah, a program to write a DSx86.ini file would be quite useful, if someone is willing to code something like that I'll surely add it (or a link to it) on my download page!
<br/>
<br/>
Today I debugged Sopwith 1 a bit, as I noticed it didn't go to graphics mode at all on DSx86. Turned out it used IRET opcode to call video BIOS interrupt (INT 10h), which was a calling method that really hadn't occurred to me. :-) I changed the software interrupt handling in DSx86 (again), now the code is cleaner and works regardless of the calling method. Now the code is pretty similar to how DOSBox handles the software interrupts, but I (re)use a different opcode.
<br/>
<br/>
It is rather awkward to work on this laptop, so I didn't get much else done .

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had a go at writing a Windows configuration utility for DSx86. You can find it at:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://magnetic-inc.myzen.co.uk/dsx86config.zip" target="_blank">http://magnetic-inc.myzen.co.uk/dsx86config.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend backing up your current .ini just in case.
<br/>
<br/>
DSx86.ini must be in the same folder as the config program. The configuration list shows all the configurations contained in the .ini file. The 'new' button adds a new configuration entry to the list. The 'save' button writes changes back to the .ini file.
<br/>
<br/>
To select a key, either select it from the drop down list or click the list and press the key you want to use. This should then select the correct item.
<br/>
<br/>
Known issues:
<br/>
<br/>
- Missing DS controls for START/SELECT/LEFT/RIGHT - wasn't sure if DSx86 supported them.
<br/>
- Not all Windows keypresses can be mapped to a DOS scancode - e.g. Alt / Left Shift/ Right Shift.
<br/>
- Not sure I've added all the DOS scancodes in.
<br/>
- .ini file is not saved if you close without saving.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
DSx86 does support START, SELECT, LEFT (KEY_L) and RIGHT (KEY_R) keys, so feel free to add those if you wish!
<br/>
<br/>
Should I link to your site, or host the file itself on my DSx86 pages, which do you prefer?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to code the program, I'm sure many people find it very useful especially for mapping the keys. No need to go hunting for a scancode table any more. :-)

I've added support for the additional DS keys. My web space is just a file dump - there's no page there, so maybe you want to put it with the other dsx86 files for the time being?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) Thanks for dsx86config bob_fossil. I used it to configure the keys for Gauntlet II and have not seen any problem so far. My only potential complaint would be about the lack of linefeed between entries written in the .ini, which although not needed improves readability.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) While on the topic of Gauntlet II, now that I have configured the keys correctly, I gave it a longer try, finishing two levels and it worked fine. The only problem is the lack of sound but I don't get sound either in Dosbox so I will have to investigate on how to solve this.
<br/>
Interesting thing (I believe), the game returns correctly to DOS when you press the key combination supposed to do this (CTRL+C).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) I have tested Street fighter 2 on Dosbox. The behaviour about random music happens in Dosbox too, so there is no issue with DSx86. On the other hand, the graphics are displayed normally in Dosbox therefore there is a confirmed issue with dsx86 on this point (it is not a corrupted file or whatever).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4) Now, I have two new candidates for potential fully compatible status: Advanced Destroyer Simulator and Sherman M4. Both are made by Loriciel (or its sub-brand Futura) and more than likely share a lot of line of codes for their engines. Both seem to run perfectly from what I have tested.
<br/>
<br/>
However, both do not have sound. Sherman M4 does not offer any option on this point. But ADS offers at the time of launch, besides the graphic mode choice, to choose between No Sound, IBM sound (I suppose it means the internal beeper) and Adlib sound.
<br/>
I tried first with Adlib but got no sound. Then IBM and I expected some beeper sound but did not hear anything Or to be more precise, I believe there is a sort of background humming that you can hear when turning the DS volume to the max. But anyway it is not the actual sound, although it could be the result of a badly produced sound of the ship engine that you can normally hear in the game.

5) Debug log:

<br/>
<br/>
[4D_PRIN]: 4D Prince of Persia (a version of PoP with hacked levels) : was unlikely to run since Pop does not
<br/>
[ALIEN] : Alien Syndrome : the game starts but once in-game the graphics are all garbled (see screenshot)
<br/>
[SWORD] : Sword of Aragon
<br/>
[BLITZ] : Blitzkrieg Battle at The Ardennes: the game starts correctly and you access the main menu. However, it seems the game needs a mouse to operate because you after typing a file name with the keyboard (works), you need to press a OK button and nothing works (Tab inserts a character and does not navigate between buttons).
<br/>
[ALITZ] : Austerlitz : Unsupported graphics mode 640x200x16 (EGA). I thought I had read it supported CGA but apparently not. I don't see anything to configure it.
<br/>
[DRILLC] : Driller, CGA executable I suppose, given that there is also a DRILLE (EGA?), H (Hercules?) and T (Tandy?)
<br/>
[FB] : Fire Brigade : Unsupported graphics mode 640x350x16 (EGA) requested! : I will need to go through Dosbox to configure as it seems possible to have CGA.
<br/>
[BRAIN] and [START] : MechBrigade
<br/>
[WAR] : Modem Wars
<br/>
[CRAZY] and [MAIN]: Nobunaga's ambition 1 : I wonder if Crazy is not a sort of cracktro (I tried out of curiosity when seeing the name).
<br/>
[DUP] : Patton : I think I need to go through Dosbox to configure some things so maybe ignore this one
<br/>
[DRVKEY] and [CGARISK] : Risk : At launch, after asking which graphics mode you want, the game asks if you have a keyboard, a joystick or a mouse. I tried the three options. Selecting keyboard, the game announces it is installing a keyboard driver (???) and crashes (see DRVKEY). Selecting joystick, the game asks to calibrate the joystick and press fire and of course nothing happens whatever you do. If you select mouse the game says it assumes you have a MS mouse, launches (you can see the title screen IIRC) and then crashes.
<br/>
[START] : Roadwar Europa
<br/>
[SOR_LOR] x3 : Sorceror Lord : The game runs but the graphics are all garbled. I tried selecting CGA (in order of error reports)(with and without sound) and CGA monochrome.
<br/>
[STRATEGO] : Stratego
<br/>
[VIPER] : Day of the Viper
<br/>
[WATERLOO] : Unsupported graphics mode 640x350x16 (EGA) requested. Probably like Sim City, I need to go through Dosbox to configure (the game is probably set on EGA and needs to be changed internally to CGA, given that there is a WATER.CGA file).
<br/>
[ADS] : Advanced Destroyer Simulator : Out of curiosity I tried in EGA mode, so you may ignore this.
<br/>
[BATII] : B.A.T. : The Koshan Conspiracy Conspiracy: Was unlikely to work since the first game in the series does not.
<br/>
[MAIN] and [OPEN] : L'empereur (Koei game). Perhaps I need to try to launch it through dosbox since there is a bat file that refers to another executable (KOEI.exe) although I would think Main;exe would launch the game too.
<br/>
[IRUN] : Hostages
<br/>
[MAIN] : Genghis Khan, apparently it is an EGA game although I read it supported CGA.
<br/>
[START] : Napoleon
<br/>
[NEBEGA] : Ignore this one. It is Nebulus/Tower Toppler. It is supposed to support CGA but apparently the archive I got only contained the EGA executable
<br/>
[NM] : NeverMind
<br/>
[NUKEWAR] : Nuclear War
<br/>
[PALADIN] : Paladin.
<br/>
[PHARAOH] : Pharaoh/Nil dieu vivant
<br/>
[QUAD] : Quadralien : the game starts, you get into the main menu. But when you press F1 to start the actual game, you get an error. Also, it might be interesting to note that after the crash, I kept getting a continuous beep even after dsx86 reset DOS.
<br/>
[SHERMAN] : Sherman M4 (user requested breakpoint)

DRVKEY seems to be a TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) program. Version 0.04 does not support TSR programs, but I'll add support for them to 0.05. I actually coded the support already, but I haven't yet tested it at all.

I'll take a better look at the log file when I get home from the office.

Thanks again, I'll be busy working on the issues in your logs for a couple of weeks easily. :-)

<br/>
<br/>
QBASIC is still really choking.  GWBASIC seems to have a bunch of issues with INT10, mainly function 9 ("write char and attribute at cursor position" RBIL, <a href="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0099.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0099.htm</a>), and I think it relies on screen reading to tell what was typed.

usotsuki: I'll try to have time to test Commander Keen at some point. I'll also take a look at the BASIC programs if I happen to find them somewhere. I have already improved the screen output INT 10h features in 0.05, so they might work better.
<br/>
<br/>
bob_fossil: I found the problem with shift-S. It was a problem in the translation table, actually the problem exists in the source I used, <a href="http://www1.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/books/artofasm/Chapter_20/CH20-4.html" target="_blank">http://www1.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/books/artofasm/Chapter_20/CH20-4.html</a> (ScanXlat table has 1F5E (5E=^) for shift-S while it should be 1F53). I think I've received this report before, but just forgot to look into it. Anyways, this is fixed in 0.05, thanks for reminding me!
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think I'll use that example INT9 program to test the new TSR support in 0.05, I can then see if it works by checking that shift-S gives '^' character again! :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I downloaded Commander Keen 4 (EGA) and started debugging it to see why it won't run. I noticed that it behaves quite badly if "Get Display Combination Code" INT 10h call reports an MCGA card (as it still did in DSx86, as I had forgotten to change that after adding the EGA support). It decides to "clear screen" using an uninitialized pointer, which results in it clearing the first 64KB of RAM, which happens to be where the program itself (and quite of bit of other important stuff) is. The result is not very nice. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I changed the INT 10h call to return "VGA with color monitor", which is not yet quite supported, but at least that made Commander Keen 4 to progress up to an unsupported EGA screen write opcode (which is easy to add).

Btw, the web store where I ordered the parts for my new PC today sent the parts! I'll most likely get the parts before the weekend, so this weekend will be a "new PC building weekend" instead of a "DSx86 coding weekend". :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the actual hardware installation went rather painlessly (except that the passive cooling system I wanted to use was for Socket 479 instead of Socket P and had holes in the wrong locations, so I had to drill some new holes to the plastic attachment bracket).
<br/>
<br/>
My plan was to use this new PC as my HTPC, and take my old HTPC to be my development machine, so I concentrated on the HTPC features when installing stuff to the new PC. However, I don't think I've ever had this much problems with the OS and driver installation!
<br/>
<br/>
Display drivers for the Intel graphics adapters do not support Blu-Ray playing  on XP at all, which I noticed only after I had installed pretty much everything else, so I had to switch to Windows 7 (when I originally planned to just transfer my XP license to the new PC) and reinstall everything from scratch. But then I noticed the manufacturer of my satellite TV tuner had gone bankrupt and hadn't released official Windows 7 drivers, my old Panasonic Blu-Ray drive was somehow incompatible and caused the whole system not to boot at all, when I connected the PC to my projector it again failed to boot, etc etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I still need to figure out a couple of issues, but there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel finally.

usotsuki &amp; jam_888: The comment about Borland C++ in my old blog post was just a statement regarding the difficulty of debugging code that uses an overlay manager (in this case created by Borland), it had nothing to do with the language itself.

However, different things are best handled using different programming languages, so ASM is certainly not the best option for everything!

depend how you define easier and efficient...
<br/>
if more efficient mean "potentialy faster if WELL codded" and if easier means with almost "no abstraction" then yes of course...
<br/>
for my point of view higher level language are generally easier, faster to write and more efficient (and there's no point in optimizing your whole program, only the 5% of the code that takes 95% of your cpu time...). you also should not underestimate the compiler, he is sometime quite cleaver.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks! Yeah, I'm constantly having trouble with the EGA palette handling. Duke Nukem 1 displayed wrong colors when I used the standard EGA palette, so I switched to the CGA-compatible RGBI palette handling. Seems that Keen would need the full EGA rgbRGB palette.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to figure out yet how DOSBox handles this difference, but if/when I do, I'll fix this palette issue. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I got the other EGA games to work yesterday, but I still got some other issues I want to debug, and then I want to go through the log files and see how many of those issues I can handle in 0.05.

[EMPIRE]: Empire: Wargame of the Century
<br/>
[SWAP]: Swap : the game gives an error when launched from the main executable (not sure what graphic mode it is supposed to be), but when using the EGA batch file (adding the e parameter apparently), the game runs.
<br/>
However, there is a strange issue. The cursor (movable through the arrow keys) leaves a trail of garble. See the screenshot. Usually the trail is fully garbled but as you can see here, some part remained normal despite the cursor having moved over it).

<br/>
usotsuki, I don't think the CGA version of Keen 4 is of much use. The palette problem is not the highest priority anyways, as long as the game works otherwise. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I just found a nasty memory leak problem in the code that had been there since the beginning. I've had several games behave strangely after a longer test run, so hopefully fixing that leak helps those. I still have a problem in the new EGA code with Duke Nukem 2, which I also need to fix before releasing 0.05.

The biggest changes are the support for Commander Keen 4 (with the improved EGA mode handling), and now you can use blitted screen update mode also in the CGA graphics mode, so you shouldn't get "Unsupported Opcode" errors in CGA games any more.

For me the main advantages of the DS as far as emulation goes is the capability of the touch screen and virtual keyboard so with that in mind I have messed with a couple of old titles that you need the keyboard to play. TBH I really want to play UltimaV on a portable which is why I was interested in your project so good luck and keep up the great work.

Those opcode errors look easy to fix, same as the INT problems in the Sierra games. A good thing I added the Mode info to the log, now I can immediately see which code I need to fix. :-)

Thanks for the encouragement, I trust 0.06 will again run those games much further than what you get in 0.05. Your log file will help me a lot in achieving that.

You can get the keyboard back by using the debugger 'G' followed by the 'v' (as in Enter) symbol, instead of pressing the B button.

<br/>
<br/>
I also thought about the Tandy theory, but it does that weird INT10 call right AFTER it has gone to mode 13h (the 256-color MCGA-mode), so I doubt it is trying to detect a Tandy at that point! I checked DOSBox sources, and it just silently ignores that call, so I'll do the same in 0.06. Must be a bug in the game code, it tries to call some other BIOS function but gives the wrong function number.
<br/>
<br/>
Zandro: Glad to be appreciated! :-) Thanks for extensive testing and log files, sorry I didn't have time to handle the INT 03 problem in 0.05, I'll try to fix that in 0.06. I'll see what else I can do about your log issues as well.

Yeah, I would also simply ignore it. Also because if the game is really using that call to detect a Tandy, it should fail at this point, right? :)

Avoid the Noid is actually very playable if you skip the unsupported parts, the only problem is the sound effects like the noid laughing are missing.

How are you doing the jitter mode?

It seems a bit too blurry, are you moving the background by one whole pixel?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm follow this thread from the beginning and I'm very interested in this project. First of all, thank you so much Pate for your work, every times I test a new version and I see a little more pixels, I've a little tears rolling from my eyes.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I always test the same games from the beginning to see the evolutions and this v.0.05 is really impressive (perhaps also because I finally understood the semantics of the B button and the G in the debugger mode). I decide to report the faults I found and the games which seems to work. Unfortunately, I haven't my DS here, so, I only report informally the fault I've found, I'll upload the logs later.
<br/>
<br/>
Mario: An "I/O not supported" is report when I start the game. Then, the display is really strange, the buttons seem to do something,  but what ?
<br/>
<br/>
Maupiti Island: It doesn't run, but, I can't remember why.
<br/>
<br/>
Where Is Carmen San Diego (fr version): Only a int call in the beginning but works perfectly after (sound works great and display too). The only drawback is the mouse which doesn't work. So, I only can enjoy the presentation/animations and the music and I can't start missions.
<br/>
<br/>
Battle Chess: Works perfectly, no reported problems (juste one when I was switching from 30fps to direct screen, else no problems). However, there is no sound and I can't remember if the game was sound free (I was too young the last time I played to it)
<br/>
<br/>
Jazz JackRabbit: Do nothing, it doesn't run (I think its a VGA games). It had been released in 94, I hope it can run and doesn't require 386 opcodes.
<br/>
By the way, the setup run, had some problems but seems to finish correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
Hocus Pocus: Requires to lauch the setup first, but the setup doesn't run. (one again, nothing happened). Require probably 386 opcodes ?
<br/>
<br/>
Gobliins: The games start on the video detection then ... Opcode don't supported.
<br/>
<br/>
I promise, I upload the logs when I can, but I was excited to see that Battle Chess works and that Carmen San Diego almost worked too, I can't wait to report it.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Lazy1: Thanks for the info! Interesting that the sound effects don't work, the game looks to do something special with the timers/interupts. I'll see if I have time to look into this further.

I am open to suggestions for a better jittering method! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
vinc_e: Welcome to the forum, and thanks for the info! Looking forward to your log file. As jam_888 said, it is often better to setup the game in DOSBox and only then copy the files to DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and your English is quite fine, no problems in understanding it!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your testing!

Starting a game worked fine when I tested it, but I did some cleanup of the EGA code after I tested that, and then only let Keen 4 run the demo after that cleanup. Perhaps I broke that opcode during the cleanup. Sorry about that, I'll try to test things better next time.
<br/>
<br/>
vinc_e: Thanks for the log! Division by zero can sometimes happen when running an old game on a sufficiently fast machine so that some delay loop runs so fast it exceeds the division range. This can of course also be a bug in DSx86, or even a bug in the game itself.

0) drdim, can you give me your opinion regarding what I mention for Gunship? (I put your nickname in bold so that you can find that part easily)
<br/>
Also, reading your report for Risk, I wonder if we have the same version of Risk. Does yours offer the choice of input device?
<br/>
<br/>
0.5) Anyone cares to test Battle Chess 2: Chinese Chess? Given that the 1st works as reported by drdim, there is a chance it works too.
<br/>
If not, I will test it when I test the remaining games not tested here that I tested previously.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) Possible candidates for working status in the near future: birds of prey and Defender of the crown.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Broken: Gauntlet.
<br/>
<br/>
3) I have an issue regarding the beeper/PC speaker emulation. In Alley Cat, when you fall from the clothe lines to the ground there is normally a crashing sound. However, it is not heard in dsx86
<br/>
<br/>
4) Might and Magic 3 was also tested. Perhaps there were some improvements for some disk accesses, however at least for the majority it remains rather slow (supposing of course that the long delays when switching areas are because of disk access).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5) debug logs:

<br/>
<br/>
I have put some * in front of the games in the list that require specific attention in my opinion (for sure, at least something has changed).
<br/>
<br/>
[SF2] :  : Street Figther 2, same in-game graphics issue as before
<br/>
*[SWAP] : Swap : Same graphic issue as previously (cursor leaving a black trail). However, there is change with the non-EGA executable: it now works. However, the graphics are displayed with a series of strips (similar to the ones left by the cursor black trail in EGA mode)
<br/>
[EMPIRE] : Empire: Wargame of the Century : Unsupported INT call, however it is quite strange because when this happens there is an in-game/DOS message on the top screen stating something about an error opening a .MAP file. I guess I should try it in Dosbox.
<br/>
**[ARCHON] : Archon: Some progress : Now the game launches, the board is getting filled in (consider it as an intro.) but after pressing F1 to start a single player game, I get an unsupported opcode.
<br/>
[AT] : A-train: Some improvements I think. I know get an Invalid path error (?). Guess it is time to go for Dosbox.
<br/>
[START] : Barbarian, starts but does nothing (same as before I think).
<br/>
*[BAT] : The game no longer crashes (intro screen) but it now waits for mouse input and apparently it has no keyboard shortcuts, so I guess it will have to wait until some mouse emulation is implemented.
<br/>
*[BIRDS] : Birds of prey: the game now runs, the 3D graphics are displayed. I did not do much however since I don't know the keys (need to learn those) but I suspect it is a candidate for working status.
<br/>
*[] : I suppose (from the order in the log) it is Bumpy Arcade Fantasy. Strange that there is no name for the executable.
<br/>
[CENTURIO] : Centurion defender of Rome: still working fine
<br/>
[CIV] : Civilization : Well, now you have error logs from 3 users for this :-)
<br/>
**[DGEN] x2 : D-Generation: Sorry, my memories are really mixed about the log and I don't have access to my DS right now to test again.
<br/>
However, I remember correctly that first I tried the CGA version: The game now starts and you can play on the first screen. However, when you go to the exit to go to the second screen, you get an in-game/DOS message saying that the hardware/configuration has changed and ask me to reinstall. I guess I'll try it in Dosbox too... although I am pretty sure it is was caused the first unsupported opcode.
<br/>
Second one is for the EGA version. It launches but then dsx86 GUI disappear and does not display anything (no error report) although I believe it is what cause the second reported unsupported opcode.
<br/>
* [DOC] : Defender of the Crown : The game seems to work almost fine now. There is an in-game issue I believe (based on the other versions of the game I played): there is a jousting tournament event in which you can take part. On dsx86 it plays very fast, I don't think this is normal (slower in Amiga, Amstrad CPC and GBA versions). Need to Dosbox test I guess.
<br/>
** [DUNEPRG] x2 : Dune (Cryo) : I think you can now see a few more intro screen if you wait but then get Unsupported opcode.
<br/>
But, if you skip the intro (escape), you can enter in the game and everything seem to diplay fine. However, although I am not 100% certain (more like 99%), the game has probably has a hotspot interface (i.e. you press a key to access some menus/actions) which move the cursor to desired actions for people who don't have a mouse. But although the cursor moves to the menu/action it automatically goes back to the top left corner.
<br/>
[DUNE2] : Dune 2: Get stuck at some point when starting (no dsx86 error message).
<br/>
*[F]: The fool's errand : you can see the first screen but then get an unsupported opcode.
<br/>
*****: [GAUNTLET] x2: Gauntlet : it no longer starts! (unless I changed something in the config. but I believe I did not)
<br/>
*[START], [EGAME], [TITLE]: Gunship. As reported by drdim, when launching with the CGA executable, it seems to work fine. However, after waiting a few seconds, I get a mission summary stating something like mission over and then it goes back to 4Dos. Not sure if this is normal and if <span style="font-weight: bold">drdim</span> gets the same thing.
<br/>
[KOEI], [MAIN] and [OE]: Nobunaga's ambition 2. I have not yet tested it in dosbox so you can ignore this.
<br/>
[POCUS]: Ports of call, same issue as before (works until the end of a world globe drawing, then Unsupported INT call!)
<br/>
*[PRINCE] : Prince of Persia. Strange that I cannot get as far bob_fossil.
<br/>
[4D_PRIN] : 4D Prince of Persia
<br/>
[POPCORN] : Pop Corn
<br/>
[RICK2] : Rick Dangerous 2
<br/>
* [SH] &amp; [SHINOBI] : unsupported opcode when you reach the screen mode selection screen
<br/>
[SIMCITY] : Sim City : same as before (access the main menu but when selecting start a new game Unsupported opcode
<br/>
[SKWEEK] : Skweek
<br/>
[STARCON] Star Control
<br/>
[SPACEWAR]: Star Control
<br/>
*[ALIEN] : Alien Syndrome: Some improvements (?) Graphics are still garbled but less than before. See screenshot (I'll let you guess if I vertically flipped it or not ;-))
<br/>
<a href="http://tarantola.alexandre.free.fr/dsx86/aliensynnew.png" target="_blank">http://tarantola.alexandre.free.fr/dsx86/aliensynnew.png</a>

Previous screen. was: <a href="http://tarantola.alexandre.free.fr/dsx86/aliensyn.png" target="_blank">http://tarantola.alexandre.free.fr/dsx86/aliensyn.png</a>
<br/>
*[SWORD] : Sword of Aragon : I get a DOS illegal function call. Need to check with Dosbox to see if it is an issue with dsx86 (or perhaps 4DOS).
<br/>
[BLITZ] : Blitzkrieg Battle at The Ardennes : same as before (need mouse input probably).
<br/>
*[DRILLC] : Driller: Improvements I think. Now you can reach the main game menu, asking to select keyboard or joystick. But when you press space to begin a mission, you get Unsupported string op seg/dir!
<br/>
*[START] and [WAR] : Roadwar Europa :The game seems to work now (?). In some game screens the text is really hard to read, I don't think this is normal (even in zoomed mode and on some other screens it is prefectly readable). After a while, the game asks for the game diskette??? I guess I will go through Dosbox. And if I remember, next time I test it with dsx86, I will take a screenshot of the hard to read text.
<br/>
**[CGARISK] : Risk : the TSR keyboard driver installs fine and the game starts. On the game screen however, although I can move the cursor via the keyboard, I can't seem to get any interaction. Need to test in Dosbox I guess to report whether this is a dsx86 issue.
<br/>
*[SOR_LOR] : Sorcer Lord: the game runs, but after a short while Unsupported opcode (I think it was right after seeing the enemy moves, i.e. when it was my turn to play).
<br/>
[STRATEGO] : Stratego
<br/>
[ADS] x3 : Advanced Destroyer Simulator : Unsupported opcode! comes from the EGA executable. The sound issue remains.
<br/>
[BATII] : B.A.T. : The Koshan Conspiracy Conspiracy
<br/>
[KOEI] : L'empereur (Koei game) I think (I still need to dosbox test it...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

**[CGARISK] : Risk : the TSR keyboard driver installs fine and the game starts. On the game screen however, although I can move the cursor via the keyboard, I can't seem to get any interaction. Need to test in Dosbox I guess to report whether this is a dsx86 issue.

1) Gunship: I don't run "cgame" directly but start "gs.com" in the gunship folder. With that, I can select "no joystick", "no intro" and cga.
<br/>
<br/>
If I run it with intro I get an I/O error (possibly because this is one of those games which "hacks" the pcspeaker - even dosbox doesn't emulate that correctly)
<br/>
<br/>
btw - I have so much fun playing Gunship on the NDS! The DOS version has a very crappy control layout but mapped on the DS buttons it's a great experience! PC speaker also sounds great in this game (you almost think it's a tandy!)
<br/>
<br/>
2) Risk: We possibly have the same version ( <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/computer-edition-of-risk-the-world-conquest-game" target="_blank">http://www.mobygames.com/game/computer-edition-of-risk-the-world-conquest-game</a> ). It works in Dosbox. If there will be mouse support in future DSx86 versions, it'll probalby run better because then, there is no need of this mouse emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

drdim, it's interesting to hear you enjoying a game running in DSx86! For me DSx86 is still just a proof-of-concept project, so it continues to amaze me when people are actually using it to play a game. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see about adding a simple mouse emulation in the next version. Originally DSx86 only had mouse emulation and no keyboard emulation, so I have some code for that ready to use.

<br/>
<br/>
edit: oh just tried to run in dos box said cannot run in dos mode still is there some way to run it in dsx86 i did make it so i do have source code
<br/>
<br/>
edit: another edit i got it working so it runs using an old borland compiler but one big problem it rapidly does the program thousands of times over without input though when on dosbox it work fine might be bug in code but possibly dsx86
<br/>
<br/>
edit: one last final edit now i worked on it a little to put in a menu but now it has an if statment if (x == 1) something like that and it works on dosbox but when i put one in on dsx86 it says unknown command 1 oh and withe the menu it does not rapidly do it anymore wierd ha

<br/>
That would be great.
<br/>
<br/>
While on the subject of mouse emulation, if you think of improving it (after implementing a basic one), may I suggest as much flexibility as possible, notably regarding the buttons behaviour.
<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is it would be nice to have possibilities such as (supposing the mouse emulation will work like a touchpad, a bit like in scummvm DS):
<br/>
<br/>
a) using some of the DS buttons (configurable per game via the .ini) as mouse buttons
<br/>
<br/>
b) having some DS buttons switching the mouse buttons behaviour from "normal" to toggle.
<br/>
In some games, when you want to move something around you have to hold a mouse button down, which can be tedious. What I would like, is the ability to simply move the cursor above something, press a button which will simulate a holding mouse button behaviour, then move and press the button again to end the holding mouse button behaviour.
<br/>
<br/>
c) a bit similar, having the possibility with one DS button to switch the default mouse button bound to a mouse tap, either in a holding way or a toggling way. In other words, while by default it would be left click, you should, depending on your config., be able to:
<br/>
a) hold a button (trigger probably) while tapping to get a mouse right click
<br/>
b) or press a button and have every tap give a right click until the button is pressed again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just mentioning all of this so that you get an idea of the different ways of having the mouse clicks working that could be requested (at least by me) so that you can have them at hand if/when you decide to implement full mouse emulation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ps: I can't seem to make any progress with the INT 03 anti-debugging code handling in games like Castle Master, so those won't be handled in the next version. I haven't found proper information about the system either. I found a change log entry about this issue in DOSBox 0.62 version, but haven't been able to locate the changes in question from the sources, so I don't know what is required to make this work.

Its possible to have two opcode tables.  One for slow "memory could be VRAM" operations and the second "just regular DOS memory".  Most opcode handlers (that doesn't touch memory) are the same.
<br/>
<br/>
When someone loads b800/a000/etc into segment register, you switch to the slower opcode table.  When, after segment register changes, all segment registers are "clear from graphics", you switch back to the faster opcode table.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, perhaps I will at some point need to move to separate opcode tables. I've been trying to avoid this as it will make the code both slower (I would need to move the opcode tables away from DTCM) and larger (as each opcode table is 1KB, and in the optimum solution I would like to have opcode tables for IRQ handling, normal RAM with direction flag clear, normal RAM with direction flag set, and similar pairs for each supported graphics mode). I would also like to have one more pair for handling EMS memory better.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a one-week Easter vacation coming up in a few weeks, perhaps at that time I'll have time to experiment with several opcode tables.

If we assume interrupt handler is independent of segment registers, even if they were loaded with 0b800 by user, it still could be handled by primary non-graphical table.

Nothing, but I was thinking of an *optimal* solution. If I had an opcode table dedicated to IRQ handling, I could just switch to use that table (where every opcode points to IRQ start routine), so I could take the IRQ check away from the actual opcode loop.  That might save several CPU cycles for the price of 1 KB of RAM.

Yes, but even faster would be just to swap a single pointer. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I'll seriously consider having several opcode tables when I have time to make larger changes to DSx86.

I have an M3 Lite and was able to successfully DLDI patch and run the 0.03 and 0.04 versions.  Every now and then, I would get a libfat error...but at least I could run the program and play some games.  After patching the 0.05 version with DLDI, I always get a libfat error no matter what I do (I've reformatted the card, tried an alternate DLDI patch for the M3, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
Could my issue be due to the new devkitARM with the newer version of libfat?  Is it something on my end?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I know next to nothing about DLDI patching, I only have a DSTT card that does the patching automatically. I hope someone else with the M3 Lite can offer some help about this issue. Or, if there is something I need to change in the DSx86 code to make it more compatible, let me know.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, version 0.06 has been released!
<br/>
<br/>
It has much improved EGA graphics handling, including over 40 new EGA opcodes supported, based on the debug logs I have received. Thanks again for those!
<br/>
<br/>
This version also has various UI changes and improvements, see the release notes or my blog post for details on those.
<br/>
<br/>
The "Unsupported INT call" problems have not improved in this version, I plan to work on those in the next version. Also, I didn't have time to add mouse support yet into this version, sorry about that.
<br/>
<br/>
Please keep sending me the debug logs, and thanks for your interest in DSx86!
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: I don't know yet. I actually thought about versioning this version 0.10 instead of 0.06 as it has quite a bit of changes, but then decided to continue with the old numbering scheme. If I had had time to add mouse support, then I might have numbered this 0.10. :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great stuff on a new version Pate
<br/>
<br/>
Just quickly tested the same games as last last time and here is my log:-
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://pastebin.com/mtv3UFer" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/mtv3UFer</a>
<br/>
<br/>
ULTIMA - Works this time round (Unsupported INT call 0.05) but the main graphic takes an age to draw (dot by dot). Then just loops and doesn't accept keyboard command to progress.
<br/>
UlTIMAII - Same issue as 0.05 Wrong disk
<br/>
ULTIMAIII - Now get an Unsupported OP Code (blank previously)
<br/>
ULTIMAIV - Damn yo got me with this one. Looks like all was OK (menu etc. load up real nice) then on key command get Unsupported OP Code (menu didn't load previously)
<br/>
ULTIMAV - Same - unsupported OP Code
<br/>
<br/>
Both LSL (Lesuire Suit Larry) and POLICEQ give unsupported INT error that can be enter through. The games now load and look great (graphics on 0.05 were horribile so something has changed) however none of the onscreen text displays (blank bubbles). Both of these games ehen exited cause issues to the debugger (text not displaying on bottom screen) and these issues need a hard reset to disappear. Could be something to look at maybe.
<br/>
<br/>
BARD - Bards Tale OP Code error as before
<br/>
DK - Bards Tale II - Now a string error (was OP Code previously)
<br/>
DRAGON - appears to work in CGA mode (gave a string error when selecting party previously) however EGA mode gives OP code error
<br/>
ROGUE - OP Code error
<br/>
SENTINEL - didn't show this last time (works on other EMUs etc.) however thought I would add as EGA give Op code however CGA works however the entire screen is not fixed - i/e when you move it moves to the edge of the screen and then the whole screen moves so it comes in from the other side. Wierd behaviour which is why I thought I would mention it (did it in 0.05 as well)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway great to see the updates comming and as per above some definate progress in the games I was checking so still moving in the right direction :) 
<br/>
<br/>
You got my hopes up with UIV fired up and the menu started playing (what can you do with UV ;) ). Hope the LOG helps and good luck with it all :)
<br/>
<br/>

midwinter: Thanks for the log! Looks like the Ultima unknown opcode problems (same as with Rogue) are caused by it trying to execute data instead of code. I'll need to test the games myself to see what is wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
The EGA opcode errors seem to be new, they should be fixed in the next version.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi again, I've just tested the new release and some things seem to work more nicely. :)
<br/>
<br/>
This is my log <a class="postlink" href="http://www.filefactory.com/file/b0a8gbb/n/dsx86dbg.log" target="_blank">here</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Just some notes:
<br/>
<br/>
Biomenace (1, 2 and 3): All have unsupported opcodes when you wait on the boot screen for too long.
<br/>
<br/>
Jill of the Jungle: Has an unsupported INT call when you pass the boot screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Monster Bash: Produces a black screen on top which does nothing, the keyboard is functioning (lighting up) but doesn't do anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Wolfenstein 3D: When booted, has a long strip along the top with what seems to be the main menu but nothing can be done from this point.
<br/>
<br/>
That seems to be all! Thanks for your continued work on this project you should consider trying some other things (such as snes as an example) as most people have said "emulating DOS is impossible" which you have proven them wrong. :P Even if you aren't emulating DOS in it's entirety.
<br/>
<br/>
One more note, when playing I noticed that there are some "buttons" along the bottom of the DS touch screen just under the keyboard. Is this a mistake or do they do something?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I like the new keyboard!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Also just wondering, is there a way to assign multiple keys to buttons on my DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Looks like I still have work to do with the EGA opcodes. At least the number of missing opcodes gets lower and lower by every release. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
narcissu: Welcome to the forum! Very useful log you had, it had some interesting obscure opcodes (like "move code segment to stack pointer" which I had thought nobody would ever use! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Fancypants: Thanks for pointing out the keyboard glitch, that is fixed in the next version. Multiple keys are not yet supported (mostly as I haven't had requests for that), I'll see if I could add such a feature. Oh, and about emulating some other hardware: Sorry, I only know x86, so I don't think I am qualified to try to emulate anything else. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Wolfenstein 3D uses VGA ModeX which I am not yet supporting. It will come eventually...
<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few games seem to attempt to run data (that is, the instruction pointer goes to area where there is no executable code), so this is beginning to be the most critical problem that I need to fix. Obviously, that is also quite a difficult problem to debug.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is there a guide to custom key mapping when manually setting up the ini file? i'm a bit confused on what syntax is required to map something.
<br/>
<br/>
any thought to adding in a gui for mapping keys while inside the emu?
<br/>
<br/>
i haven't been playing around with your emu for that long so forgive me if this has been said before. if i set a folders attribute to "hidden" from within my o/s, dsx86 can not see the folder. so trying to clean up my firmware?s view results in folders that may contain dos games to not be available when running the emu.
<br/>
<br/>
when using the keyboard to jump/shoot in duke nukem 1 i notice that the keyboard is"sticking." if i hit ALT, then that key remains pressed. i have to press it twice after that, once to bring it back up and once to press it again. the same goes for ctrl. i have verified my dos files by crc against a known good and uncorrupted copy.
<br/>
<br/>
finally, it would be nice to see a path in the ini that mounts our virtual c drive. so i can mount to c:/data/dsx86/roms or something. all the change directory inputs can be tedious on the small keyboard.

finally, it would be nice to see a path in the ini that mounts our virtual c drive. so i can mount to c:/data/dsx86/roms or something. all the change directory inputs can be tedious on the small keyboard.

Log here:- <a href="http://pastebin.com/CBZg4knw" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/CBZg4knw</a> (I havn't changed sierra to the actual game title as I figure you are getting what you need without knowing the specific game - correct me if I am wrong)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway checked some of the other Sierra adventure games to see if they all did the same thing. KingsQuest and PoliceQuest2 both gave errors that could be steped through and the game works aside from the text issue. KingsQuest2 and SpaceQuest on the other hand give no error however they suffer from the text issue (no game text is displayed on screen).
<br/>
<br/>
The ancient Art Of War crashes the app. No log etc. and need to hard reset the DS
<br/>
<br/>
Midwinter and Mechwarrior (tried this because I thought it was reported as working but going back a page drdim I see you said it just returned Opcode error) both errored as per log

Thanks dantheman, I had no idea there were so many "R4" carts out there.  I've purchased stuff from Divineo before and recently saw that they listed an R4 SDHC for sale.  I thought that might be the one to get, but now it could just be a cheap knock off?  I'll have to do some more research.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

mortys: Thanks for the info! Sorry, no mouse support yet in the next version, I'll try to add that during my Easter vacation.
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: For mouse support I need to add mouse cursor emulation for both text mode and all the graphics modes, and I also need to support games that use custom mouse cursor shapes. Quite a bit of work, as it is different for each graphics mode. Oh, I also tested your CHEAT program. Looks like it uses stdin for it's input, and that is not properly supported in DSx86 yet. That's why it just quits immediately.
<br/>
<br/>
usotsuki: Nice to hear that! I got Norton SYSINFO to run also. I'll try to add upwards scrolling to the next version. I also plan to switch to a "dirty buffer" blitting method for the text screen, so no more text mode opcode errors. Haven't yet started work on that, I hope I have time to do that during the weekend before releasing 0.07.

I noticed on your log you made a comment about DSx86 showing an error popup when used in NO$GBA. I had a quick go and all I was getting was an error because it couldn't load dos due to the path/directory mappings etc. so just thought I would ask how you got DSx86 working with NO$GBA?

Looking forward to the new release which is hopefully imminent.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at your past releases to date it looks like you have been adhering to a rough 2 week window and you recent comments (do 0.07 over this weekend) would seem to support that so is that what you were looking to do (fortnightly updates) or will you just update as required/able and the seeming fortnighly updates are just because it has worked out that way?

Well, I have a special development version of DSx86 (actually it's just a set of compiler defines) where I include 4DOS.COM and the files needed by the game I am currently working on into the DSx86.nds file, so that I can test it inside NO$GBA without needing to copy it to my SD card all the time.

<br/>
<br/>
Log of the games I was testing:- <a href="http://pastebin.com/RPBf2Kce" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/RPBf2Kce</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Quick Summary,
<br/>
<br/>
Bards Tale (BARD) and Bards Tale II (DK) both give Opcode errors. Seems to be on the sound which continues after a soft reset.
<br/>
Dungeon Master - Works without error but the graphics are messed up. Gives an ingame error about DM master disk so ??
<br/>
Dragonwars - Seems to all be OK in CGA - EGA works this time round but the graphics are messed up so not uasable
<br/>
The Sierra games I checked were as you stated still with the text issue (but no DSx86 errors) with one exception - PoliceQuest2 - all works OK including the text (menus and ingame). 
<br/>
Rogue - No error this time but the main character graphic is not displayed on screen. Possibly so others as well (only looked at it quickly but ladders etc. seemed missing but mosters showed etc.)
<br/>
Sentinel - Same scrolling screen issue in CGA however EGA works without error this time but the graphics are messed up (unusable)
<br/>
Ancient Art of War - same issue - locks system need to hard reset
<br/>
Mechwarrior - works. Some minor graphical issues (on main menu when flicking options and som screens) but very playable (played a mission and killed mech etc.)
<br/>
Midwinter - Unsupported INT call then can be entered through to ingame. All seemed to be OK however freezes when selecting action (i.e. when the action graphic is on screen). I deleted the user break points out of the original log but here they were for that game only <a href="http://pastebin.com/yvGGtNYi" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/yvGGtNYi</a>
<br/>
<br/>
UltimaI - Same issue as previous (ages to draw main logo then loops_
<br/>
UltimaII - Unsupported INT calls. No wrong disk issues this time and able to enter errors but don't think I was able to get ingame (cant read my cryptic notes)
<br/>
UltimaIII - All works OK however some speed issues (wind dir and charatcter anims) but these are present using DOSBox as well
<br/>
UltimaIV - This time I get an error about "packed file is corrupt" when trying to start. You can run through creating new character etc. it just when trying to actually start the game (after create chr or using journey onward).
<br/>
UltimaV - Now come on Pate - this is the one I wanna see woking ;-) but no Joy this release - unsupported Opcode
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm.....think that is about it. Lots more progress this release so great stuff :-) Couple of titles to try for those interetsed ( PoliceQ2 and Mechwarrior) 
<br/>
<br/>
On other matters - I can imgagine why you would want a version running under NO$GBA for dev/testing and debugging etc. Pain needing to swap out the card etc. to the PC but I guess Nintendo never intended memory to be added to the DS so it is what it is.
<br/>
<br/>
Great to hear you are intending regular updates, I know I have been looking forward to seeing them.
<br/>
<br/>
I notice that for some games (especially text) when the image is scaled is very hard to read. I know you are working with limited realestate (or screen size) but is that the best that can be done or is it fesiable to have some sort of scaling option like 95%, 90%, 85% etc. to try for better viewing (assuming some games will scale better than others at different percentages)?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway couple of games to play with and will be keen on seeing what you come up with for the next release :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and good luck</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pipe Mania graphics have regressed from 0.06 to 0.07. They were in colour (EGA mode I think) but now they're grey scale. I also noticed that on startup or restarting, there is a slight delay before 4DOS starts up. This delay wasn't there before on 0.06. If you get chance, could you also look at resetting the sound when you restart the emulator - the last played sound is repeatedly outputted after a restart from an unhandled opcode error.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">jam_888: You mean the Liero game? DSx86 does not support extended memory, it is a protected mode feature and I plan to only support real mode.
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: Thanks for the log and info! Looks like many games show distorted EGA graphics, I'll need to work on that for the next release.
<br/>
<br/>
Interesting idea about scaling options, it would not be all that difficult to add a scaling factor setting. I'll look into that.
<br/>
<br/>
bob_fossil: Strange that the graphics have changed, I don't think I changed the palette or graphics detection routines for this version.
<br/>
<br/>
The slight delay when starting is caused by the new text screen blitted update. The screen update operation starts running only after the emulator is fully up and running, while earlier the libFAT and INI file checks wrote directly to the physical VRAM. So it is not actually any slower than before, it just does not update the screen during the initial stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to remember to send sound reset commands when (re)starting the emulation. Funny enough, it actually works now pretty much like some sound cards did in the real PCs, the sound might stay looping even when you reset the PC. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your testing DSx86!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok this must seem like the stupidest dumb ass idea  but when and if you get your cpu past 15 mhz can you put in 486 support i know its stupid even for 386 to be put in there but a 486 is more backwards compatible sowith only emulating that you would be able to run 486 and backwards were as if you put in 386 support there is a backwards compatabilite issue you would only be able to run games in protected mode even with a 486 you probably wont be able to run any 486 games you would be able to 386 and backwards with out multiple cpu emulation and confussion just tell me if im wrong and thanks as always pate :) to bad you don't support extended memory :( but everything else more than makes up for it :)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: 486 do support switching between protected mode and real if im correct other wise what i wrote before is bull crap<br/>_________________<br/>i'm in the corner of your eye were you never want to look <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?noymnnmtwmm" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/?noymnnmtwmm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sigh... all is nigh glorious.
<br/>
<br/>
I have one log for now.. <a class="postlink" href="http://pastebin.com/JYpDkNdw" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/JYpDkNdw</a> Creepers (one of my childhood favorites) spits a non-fatal Unsupported port I/O issue when using SB/16 sound.  The OPL emulation is good, and so is the PCM sound, but following the play of any wavsample causes the error. It's captured disassemblies are showing two different initial command proceedings, then all the rest is the same (excepting the header info: AX, BX, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
Before that, however, I often experienced fatal Unsupported Opcodes during the Psygnosis intro and after the main title screen when switching to Direct update mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for sharing your progress with everybody!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#173261 - sverx - Mon Mar 29, 2010 9:19 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very good work, Pate :)
<br/>
<br/>
Now <a class="postlink" href="http://wcms.teleion.it/users/cgq/tnq-three/index.html" target="_blank">Three</a> is playable, but there's no music or sound anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
The game detects a <span style="font-weight: bold">SoundBlaster</span> but if you select it then the game gives a lot of "Unsupported SB DSP command", <a class="postlink" href="http://pastebin.com/Rv5bJwG9" target="_blank">here's the log</a>. (Looks like "8-bit Auto-inizialize DMA DAC" [1Ch] and "8-bit Exit Auto-Inizialize DMA operation" [DAh] aren't supported... that sounds very strange to me...)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, right, an important question: which value are you reporting to command "Get DSP Version" [E1h]? I'm asking that because the game reports it as a SB MONO only... I have these quite old info about DSP versions:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">100h to 1FFh: SB 1.0, SB 1.5 
<br/>
200h to 2FFh: SB 2.0 
<br/>
300h          SB Pro 
<br/>
301h to 3FFh: SB Pro2 
<br/>
400h to 411h: SB 16 
<br/>
412h          SB AWE 32 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Stereo started from SB Pro. 16 bit audio started from SB 16, of course.
<br/>
<br/>
PC speaker sound also doesn't work. I was driving the speaker directly thus having a PCM reproduction (1 bit resolution... lol...). I guess you didn't implement this kind of reproduction, but I've seen it used in some games... and in FastTracker II, mainly :)
<br/>
<br/>
Then... Eye of the Beholder <span style="font-weight: bold">works almost perfectly</span> :) :)
<br/>
VGA/EGA/CGA modes ok, Adlib sound is a little bit low. No mouse support yet, so it isn't easy to play.
<br/>
<br/>
DuneII ... still no luck :|
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this release! :D :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Zandro: Thanks for the log!
<br/>
<br/>
sverx: Glad to hear that Three works! Thanks for the link to it, I used Google Chrome to translate the site from Italian to Finnish, and I think I pretty much understood what the page said. Pretty good machine translator Google has. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
DSx86 reports SB version as 0x201, which is SB 2.0 (mono). I could support more advanced SB models, but decided to start simply.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info about the needed SB commands, I haven't supported any auto-init versions yet, only the manually restarted DMA methods. I hadn't yet run into a game that would use those auto-init methods, I'll look into using Three as a test bench for those. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the PCM PC Speaker is somewhat difficult to support, I guess I should buffer the speaker frequency commands and translate them to samples on-the-fly to be able to play them as 8-bit samples on ARM7. This is not very high on my priority list, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your testing!

Oh! I thought almost every game using SB' PCM was using this mode... double buffer with IRQ is just so neat ;)
<br/>
(edit: since you're still not supporting auto-init modes, maybe you could report version 1.05 so that software knows that auto-init mode is not supported. Three, for instance, should use manual-init mode then... well, it has never been tested btw ;) )

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello again, I have recently downloaded the new version and am thanking you for it. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Although it hasn't done much in compatibility for the things I play, it's always good to see updates. Although I did encounter one error once (twice now after booting Monster Bash and rebooting the system), while playing a game and rebooting the system the bar on the bottom screen that has the HDD and screen-scrolling feature etc. was completely blurred. It didn't cause any problems other than not fixing itself until the homebrew was rebooted.
<br/>
<br/>
I will post a log soon of the games, once I get access to my other computer.
<br/>
<br/>
Quick Summary:
<br/>
<br/>
B:
<br/>
[Biomenace] (1,2 and 3) all continue to work until at random points there are "Unsupported INT calls"
<br/>
[Monster Bash] has begun to open but crashes with an "Unsupported INT call"
<br/>
[Beneath a Steel Sky] (a 80386 game rumoured to be able to run on 286) without executing the game 4DOS returns a message "Fatal error, 80386 processor is required"
<br/>
<br/>
C:
<br/>
[Commander Keen 4] works well as in the last few releases.
<br/>
<br/>
D: 
<br/>
[Duke Nukem 1] Works well with no complaints as of yet.
<br/>
[Duke Nukem 2] I think the loading time has become even longer and gameplay slightly slower. But still continues to function.
<br/>
<br/>
J: 
<br/>
[Jill of the Jungle] has begun to work and is operational yet has the graphical glitch similar to Wolfenstein 3D where the screen is separated into several pieces. Also if you allow the title screen to continue the game says...
<br/>
"The game features a Sound Blaster-compatible musical sound track. Do you want the musical soundtrack?" At this point the game crashes with an "Unsupported opcode!" EDIT: After rebooting once again instantly the game crashes with an an error "386 opcodes not supported!" This is really weird! The game was launch-able prior to this, when did it become 386 dependent?
<br/>
<br/>
M: 
<br/>
[Major Stryker] is working perfectly with no errors encountered thus far.
<br/>
<br/>
S: 
<br/>
[Secret Agent] unsupported graphics mode - "Unsupported graphics mode 640x350x16 (EGA) requested!"
<br/>
T: 
<br/>
[Tyrian] (While I was just seeing what would happen I tested a 80386 game :$)  crashes at the beginning with an "386 opcodes not supported!"
<br/>
<br/>
W:
<br/>
[Warcraft] (yet another 386 game) has a peculiar error
<br/>
"DOS/16M error: [15] protected mode available only with 386 or 486"
<br/>
[Wolfenstein 3D] freezes while displaying several screens of the menu in very small view. Unplayable.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for this wall of text, now I was just wondering what about the 386 were you to not implement? As from my summary there were 3 different errors regarding the processor.
<br/>
<br/>
As another 386 query, is it possible to use a RAM expansion to help allow the running of 386 games? Through the use of a RAM expansion you could create a parameter where, if the expansion is not detected it runs pure 286 information, or with the RAM expansion included it allows access to such capabilities while providing some more power to help stabilise high requirement games.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Sorry if this is a bit of rambling, I'm a bit tired and it's 12:42 A.M. where I am at the moment. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

386 is a 32 bit CPU, and has <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_mode" target="_blank">protected mode</a> too, beside real mode.
<br/>

Maybe -when dsx86 will be 100% complete- Pate will find twice the time already spent to 'upgrade' it to 386/486. I wouldn't do that, btw ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've narrowed down the problem a bit. After several tests, Pipe Mania works OK. The graphics display only seems to go wrong after I tried running 'Bumpy' (Loriciels, 1992). The game appeared to hang, so I used the 'x' key on the virtual keyboard to enter the debugger to restart the emulator. If I then run Pipe Mania, I either get grey scale graphics or no graphics at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Altered Beast appears to run and is playable (well as playable as it can be :) ).

<br/>
<br/>
Fancypants: Thanks for testing, looking forward to the log! As sverx said, adding 386 support would be a lot of work and I am not convinced that it would be worthwhile. 386 opcodes often run at half the CPU cycles 286 processor runs those same opcodes, so to emulate a 16MHz 386 I would have to get DSx86 running over two times faster, which is simply not  possible. There is not much sense in releasing an emulator that emulates a 5MHz 386 machine, as all 386 games are meant for at least 16MHz 386 machines. Oh, and the 386 opcode in Jill of the Jungle is probably a misreported problem in DSx86, or a jump to a non-code location as Dwedit suggested.

Sprite hardware is ideal for emulation of DOS mouse pointer and CGA/EGA/VGA textmode cursor.  Many DOS games use mouse.

chkdsk is a data drive/partition scan and verification utility that looks for such errors, and can remove or correct these invalid entries that might otherwise not be addressable.

<br/>
To run chkdsk with intent to correct corruption, start a command prompt (start &gt; run &gt; cmd) and type: chkdsk (cardletter): /F

p.s. I have an Acekard2i, and do have issues with file corruption, but not particularly with the firmware (as I only power off after it has already passed control on to something else).</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Zandro on Mon Apr 05, 2010 5:17 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AtH: Nothing to be sorry about, the idea to use a sprite for mouse pointer was a good one, and it seems to work pretty well. I don't think I need to scale the pointer itself when the screen is scaled, I just need to scale the sprite coordinates. I have tested the mouse using "MJLAPTOP.EXE", a Mahjong game that uses 640x200 CGA mode and needs a mouse. Seems to be working pretty well. Oh, and yes, I am aware that BP register indexes the stack segment, the problem I had was that the opcode table had a pointer to the [BX+DI] handler instead of [BP+DI] handler. A simple typo, in other words. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Nanimes: Thanks for the log!
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: Well, I thought it was interesting to see how far I can get in Windows without major upgrades to DSx86. I got the 640x200 CGA loading screen to display, but then it wants to go to 640x480 VGA mode for the actual desktop, and that is not supported yet in the next version, so it won't actually run yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I am working on VGA Mode-X, as that is the most interesting of the yet unsupported modes. It is nice to work on, as I can use my old LineWars II game again as a testbench, it has a VGA 320x480 tweaked Mode-X option with split screen handling. It is very nice to debug it as I have the original source code and I can look at the sources to see what is supposed to happen with each of the graphics operations. With other games it usually takes a lot of time to figure out what it tries to do (when it doesn't work:-).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI Pate
<br/>
<br/>
I Haven't tested any other games but have logged a few hours in Mechwarrior (used to love this game as a kid) and it is playing pretty good. Actually it plays better on the DS than it does via Dosbox on both the PC and PSP and it seems to be related to speed. It is slightly slower on the DS so combat it a bit easier so not sure if that is because emu on the DS is slower or slightly faster with DOSBox. Because I am not as young as I once was and can't handle the faster (so it seems testing it across 3 platforms) pace it certainly has been easier playing on the DS ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Only issues after extended play time are mior graphical glitches etc. with  the only one being a pain is you can't really read what type of mission it is when on the mission selection screen (I have just been taking whatever mission it is). 
<br/>
<br/>
One thing however I thought I would bring to your attention after a bit of playtime was key behaviour.  Either via Vkeyboard or button, pressing (and holding) down only registers a single key stroke whereas normal key behaviour for pressing a key is register keystroke, slight delay and then repeated keystrokes are registered. After having to press a button (or tap) repeatedly in MechWarrior where as normal play behaviour (to increase contract values) was just press and hold button this stood out. 
<br/>
<br/>
No biggie obviously just thought it might be something to consider as you develop DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
Really looking forward to the next release so keep up the great work :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I pretty much listed the new features above, in my blog there is also a long list of somewhat game-specific fixes I made, based on the log files I have received. So, feel free to re-test all those games mentioned! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Still many issues remain, but one thing at a time...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your interest in DSx86!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great stuff Pate - been checking this thread in anticipation of your release so looking forward to checking it out (have added a few more games to my card to check as well as my usual suspects).
<br/>
<br/>
Got everything ready but only had time to check the 1st game on my list which was Bards Tale. Works great. No errors. Has music but not sure about ingame sound. Plays great as well so off to a great start so fingers crossed the trend continues for when I get to U for Ulitima V ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Spent a few mins messing around with the mouse/keyboard switch thinking that the little pad/space where it was written enabled touchpad mouse emulation before I realised that obviously you had only button mouse emulation (DOH!!). 
<br/>
<br/>
So on that score did you have plans to add touchpad emulation of the mouse? 
<br/>
<br/>
Some apps do it (Only one I can think off hand is the ST emu which has a switch between KB and mouse pad so you had a reasonable area to use) so you might be able to grab some code to save some time and I reckon your current design has room to fit in a decent pad. No biggie just wondering what you had planned. The current setup works pretty good from my quick look.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks again and I will report back later when I have tested all the games I have on my card :-)
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Testing Pool of Radiance (the first Gold Box game; SSI) on 0.10
<br/>
<br/>
Notes to testers:
<br/>
* wheel copy protection could be annoying, even if you have a legal copy its much easier to use cracked version with universal answer "SIRJOE"
<br/>
* to select menu item you must use HOME/END/ENTER buttons
<br/>
* put the game in the C:\POOLRAD\ folder and check if POOL.CFG reflects this setting
<br/>
<br/>
Result:
<br/>
1. The game almost works!  At least, no abnormal termination: graphics okay, keyboard response is perfect, etc.
<br/>
2. Special effect on the second title screen doesn't work (it could deal with the palette)
<br/>
3. After you create a character and want to add it to the party, the game says "PUT SAVE DISK IN C:" again and again, no way to exit :(
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: Gold Box series could run on the next DSx86 version, but it needs to improve slightly disk emulation.  My first thought was about write protection.  I changed C:\POOLRAD\ to C:\DATA\DSX86\POOLRAD\ and even C:\DATA\DSX86\ , but this doesn't help.
<br/>
<br/>
If we run for perfectionism, some work with palette registers is welcome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure if anyone has said this yet but Dune II works almost prefectly (although a touch slow) in DSx86 0.10. The only thing it can't do is play digitized sound effects. The setup.exe can't detect the eXtended memory (XMS).
<br/>
<br/>
Also Galactix 1.5 (MS-DOS game from Cygnus Studios) freeware is now able to run but it can't use adlib/sb/etc. The adlib sound seems to freeze up and then freeze up DSx86. It is able to use Nosound=PCSpeaker but after the first wave the game freezes when the second wave door opens up. Btw, an earlier version of DSx86 i think 0.04 or 0.05 was able to produce adlib music but it would crash before the menu stuff. (I've kept all versions of DSx86 from 0.01-0.07 and now 0.10)

I'll try to get a log up soon. Been kinda busy.

<br/>
Ultima 6: Working great!  Only problem is when you switch from U.EXE to play the game (select Journey Onward or create a character), it gives a "Packed File is Corrupt" error.  You can run GAME.EXE directly and it works fine.  I haven't played through the game, but I'd expect to see a similar problem when you beat the game and it switches to the ending.
<br/>
Music has problems, and sound effects are much louder than the music.
<br/>
<br/>
Pharoh's Tomb:  Game runs, sprites display fine, but text is screwed up.  It displays a bunch of international characters it shouldn't be displaying, then characters keep piling at the top of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Zany Golf:  Works perfectly!  Only problem is you get an unsupported opcode when you quit the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Rogue:  You get a strange "Diskette/Version out of phase" error message.
<br/>
<br/>
Megaman 3: Game runs, but scrolling is jerky in EGA mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Turbo Science:  Game gives an unsupported opcode error "mov al,es:[bx]"
<br/>
<br/>
Manic Miner: Gives "Packed File is Corrupt" error
<br/>
<br/>
Civilization: Crashes when you attempt to get past the intro.  Playing Adlib music gives an Unsupported Port IO error.

    <h4>#173515 - Pate - Mon Apr 12, 2010 6:12 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for all your extensive testing again! Glad to hear in general you notice some progress with this version. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: DSx86 already supports most of the LIM EMS 4.0 features, so it reports EMS version as 4.0, so MOO will run when it has enough EMS. Also, glad to hear some of my fixes fixed Street Fighter II, I didn't check that at all myself.
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: Thanks for the report and log! The SB DSP Command 0x10 means "Direct 8bit DAC output", which seems to be the most common still missing DSP command. I'm not yet quite sure how to handle that, I guess I need to assume the output rate is the same as the timer interrupt rate and use that as the output frequency.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with Ultima V does sound strange.. I downloaded Ultima V myself, but I haven't played any of the Ultima series games so I am a bit at loss as to how to start the actual game..
<br/>
<br/>
I seem to have a problem in the unsupported opcode reporting in The Ancient Art of War, it should not let you continue after those, but it misreports the problem location and thus reruns a wrong opcode (that happens to be supported:-).
<br/>
<br/>
About the touchpad mouse, I've had requests for either a touchpad mouse emulation, or to swap the screens so that you could "click" on the actual items on the emulated PC screen. I'll need to experiment with these options to see how they would work.
<br/>
<br/>
AtH: I'll see if I can figure out what might cause the disk problem.
<br/>
<br/>
About Wolfenstein 3D: I hadn't realized there are different versions for 386 and 286 support.. I just downloaded the version at <a href="http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/wolfenstein-3d/" target="_blank">http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/wolfenstein-3d/</a> and debugged it to make it work.
<br/>
<br/>
phoenixclaws: I've been shying away from the XMS support, as I feel that is closely related to protected mode support (which I don't plan to support). DSx86 actually emulates a 80186 processor which does not have  protected mode. About 4DOS 8.00, feel free to test it, but version 7.50 is the only version that is "officially supported" by me. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Dwedit &amp; narcissu: Thanks for the logs!
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I forgot to announce here that bob_fossil updated his dsx86config program, the latest version is available from the DSx86 download page.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found a problem that caused the garbled graphics in my Master of Orion tests, it was a bug in my MOVSB opcode for Mode-X, not a problem in the EMS emulation after all. So, there is a small chance that Master of Orion might run in the next 0.11 version, but it is still too early to say for sure.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your testing!

XMS isn't critical since as far as I can tell it is only used for the Voice samples that would run during the introduction of Dune II. During game play both SFX and Music is playing so it is basically 99.9% playable. 
<br/>
<br/>
I beat the first mission which is basically the tutorial. I forgot that this game has copy protection so I have to dig up the manual to test mission 2 and beyond.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh a swapscreen/touchpad mouse would be wonderful for playing Dune II.

I point out that a particular post in that thread above mentions how XMS does not need protected mode. Though I'm not an expert in DOS programming (and i've done very little programming) but I'm just trying to be informative. :)

Well, maybe it's already useless to say that, but I can confirm: it works ;)
<br/>
<br/>
It works with SoundBlaster / SoundBlaster PRO (it's using stereo OPL, I guess (right?) ) / AdLib / PC Speaker. No digitized voices ("Affirmative!", "Yes, Sir!") because of lack of XMS.

Speaking about XMS... well, since XMS api are accessed through interrupt calls, maybe it's possible for you to code it... I remember there weren't so many functions there... allocation&amp;deallocation of a memory block, copy from XMS/conventional or the opposite... well, would be cool :D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Pate :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah Ultima V issue is pretty wierd as all the other keys appear mapped OK however the arrow keys and special keys (home,pgup etc.) seem to map odd keys. For the arrow keys it seems the first press does nothing and then the second press gives the wiierd key behaviour (like K instead of UP etc.). 
<br/>
<br/>
You know I was just messing around then after downloading a couple of versions in case it was something specific (it wasn't they all display the same behaviour) and was bashing around all the keys (like shift, caps etc.) and I did get the player chr to go North once. Buggered if I could repeat it messing around for 5 mins (shift was definatley pressed I reckon) so go figure.....
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if the link was allowed but one of the versions I just tested was from <a href="http://www.abandonia.com/en/downloadgame/843" target="_blank">http://www.abandonia.com/en/downloadgame/843</a> so you could try that. In regards to testing just run ULTIMA.EXE and then select J (for Journey onward - will have a party loaded allready). Then just try to get the damn chr to move (normally arrow keys - but might also map numpad keys - what were your plans on the numpad by the way?)
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Art of War no biggie for me as I am unlikely to play it (can't say I ever have since I was a kid which is why I had it to hand). I was only using it for testing as I had it on my HDD so was thinking the more titles I threw at your app the better idea you would get regarding compatability/testing. On that score as I said when running install for Space Quest 3 I was getting errors left right and centre (IO inputs etc.) so issues with disk functions I think so did you want to get a heap of errors or would you rather focus on getting a few things working well (which I think is how you started with Keen4 etc. and it is just us pushy buggers throwing all this stuff at you ;-))?
<br/>
<br/>
As for the mouse like I said I was busyily using the stylus on the small box where you had keybd/mouse text thinking it was a touch mouse pad - silly me. The AtariST emu on DS has a pretty good implementation (he switches between keyboard and mouse via an icon) but I reckon your layout would allow a reasonable sized space to be made available for this.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Dwedit - Tried Ultima6 and I found it unplayable (too slow). Was it running allright for you? I did try your trick of running the exe directly to see if that solved the packed file is corrupt error in UIV but running avatar.exe as opposed to ultima.exe still gives the error. What version of Rogue were you running? Mine worked aside from the main text chr and some other chrs not  showing (i.e got no disk error).
<br/>
<br/>
Also anyone setup any batch files to load games etc? I spent like an hour + doing one today as I had 35+ games to test and was sick of typing all the paths etc. and got it all setup and working great but when I ran it on the DS under 4DOS I get an error due to the choice command. Before I check it out anyone care to share an alternative?
<br/>
<br/>
And lastly Quest For Glory all seems to be working great for those that might be interested in checking it out :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nobunaga's ambition: Glitches on the fonts. Can't read all words.

Lazy1: Yeah, I noticed that the Adlib volume is especially low in Wolfenstein 3D. I'll need to double the volume when I next time work on the Adlib emulation.
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: I'll try to test the Ultima IV,V and VI and see if I can improve them. In general, the more and varied errors in the logs the better, as that will give me a better idea about issues still needing fixing. I'll usually do the easy ones (usually the graphics opcode ones belong in this category) first, but many logs show the game attempting to execute data, which I can not do much about without testing the game myself.
<br/>
<br/>
sverx: I'll see about the XMS support, but first I need to fix the EMS handling and other issues, the number of 286 games that use XMS is rather low, I would think. Heh, glad to hear this was the best beta version yet. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
phoenixclaws: Thanks for the vogons link!
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I noticed that the REP SCASW downwards opcode was not fixed in 0.10 after all, I had fixed the special case when CX = 1 but not the general case! Silly me... Well, it will work in the next version. :-)

Here was a quick log. I eventually redid my batch file making sure to test it using 4DOS on the PC before putting it on the DS and I get some INT errors when running it (can sort of "B" through it but it doesn't let you use the list just eventually runs the first game which was Bards Tale).

Well, that's another thing that goes in your 'future enhancements' list, with that SB DMA auto-init ;) BTW if you're interested in playing with XMS, you can start from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-4765.htm" target="_blank">here</a>... well, maybe you could trace int 2F calls?

Or a way to change the DOS version from 5.00 to something else?

midwinter: Thanks for the log and the batch file! Supporting batch files to enable easy game selection is pretty high on my TODO list, so I appreciate an example I can test. Looks like the problem is that I don't currently support DOS "Duplicate File Handle" call. I think I should finally emulate the DOS "System File Table" properly to add DUP support. That might improve other software that do lower-level disk calls as well.

Ah, a typo indeed! Thanks for pointing that out. I was wondering why a debug log still showed that as an unsupported INT call in the latest version, even though that code has been there for a couple of versions! :-)

This article is all written in Korean, but you can see some useful dos programs. 
<br/>
The arthor of this article didn't use any emulator in windows 7, so he says that a lot of dos programs he has didn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
MdirIII is popular shell program in Korea, but in dsx86 it doesn't work at all. It would be useful if it works in dsx86.
<br/>
Gwbasic works fine in dsx86.
<br/>
Gulnagi(글나기) is Korean keyboard typing training program. I didn't try it yet.
<br/>
Max 4.0 is program that talking with computer. It also didn't work in dsx86.
<br/>
Hanme taja gyosa(한메타자교사 a.k.a. HTT) is another typing training program, which also didn't work in dsx86.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll show you logs for the programs later.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Pate - Just read your blog, so you got the mouse touchpad emulation working pretty good huh? 
<br/>
<br/>
Love your idea of flipping the screens to have direct screen interaction. Looking forward to testing it out and seeing how it works in practice (assume you drag the stylus to move mouse but can dirctly tap to register position and mouse click etc.).  
<br/>
<br/>
I still like the idea of having a little pad actually on the lower screen with the keyboard however (so you have full access to keyboard with mouse support without the need to use a swap key). I envision its fuctionality similar to that of a laptop touchpad - i.e several sweeps required to move mouse a long way in a direction and double tap for click etc.
<br/>
<br/>
All looking great so bring on the next release :-)
<br/>
<br/>
If you ever need help with testing etc. just sing out. Been great playing Bards Tale on the DS using your Emu.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Then I also found a strange problem with DuneII save files... does anybody else noticed something strange? I also had problems with my microSD so I'm still not saying it's a dsx86 problem, will check again later.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sverx: Thanks for the log! Both problems look easy to fix. I hadn't coded support for "ror sp,1" as I considered that one of the "scary" opcodes no-one would use. :-) It is interesting to find out all sorts of weird tricks coders have used in their games.
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: I'll consider the small touchpad mouse emulation option as well, for a later version. By the way, I found and fixed the cursor key bug in Ultima V, so that should work in 0.11. I had actually two bugs in my DOS Console I/O function which caused this problem. Most games seem to use the more direct keyboard functions instead of the DOS wrappers for they key input, so this was the first game that had a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
The new SystemFileTable DOS file functions seem to work now, so the next step is to support the DOS handle duplication call to see if that will make the 4DOS .BAT files work properly.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pate: looks like there's a strange problem affecting <span style="font-weight: bold">DuneII</span> save files. Yesterday evening I did some tests and the results are very strange, so I'm thinking that maybe there's a cache / deferred microSD write issue... well, I don't know, tell me your opinion about that.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the details:
<br/>
<br/>
Say you want to save your progress in the game. You have two options:
<br/>
- choose an empty slot (this will create a new file)
<br/>
- choose an used slot, overwriting a previous save (this will overwrite the previous file already on the card)
<br/>
<br/>
If you choose the 1st option, everything works fine. It saves and you can load it again later and continue from the place you left. :)
<br/>
<br/>
If you choose the 2nd option, something goes wrong. It saves (or at least looks like it's doing it!) but when you choose to reload that game you'll either reload the <span style="font-style: italic">previous content of that file</span> (!!! 8| 8| ) or you'll just load <span style="font-style: italic">garbage</span> that will prevent your game from running. :(
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to have someone else confirm this behavior so I can exclude it's something weird with my setup. Anyone? :D
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
empty slot save - restored fine

Just a quick question what version of Captain Blood are you using? I have downloaded this from a couple of sites and thety dont work for me (in DSx86 or DOSBOX - just hangs without doing anything -dbox - or drops to cprompt - dsx86). Loved this game on my ST ages ago but never did get around to completing it so could be an option for DSx86 :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

FYI, my home ADSL is not working at the moment. I am in the process of upgrading my ADSL to ADSL2+, and it seems that the phone company has now switched their end to the faster speed, but they should have mailed me a corresponding ADSL2+ modem, which I haven't received yet. If I don't get it today, I won't be able to release the new version during the weekend. Let's hope it will get here today.

In better news, I think I found and fixed the Dune 2 save game problem, and also the 4DOS %select command is working properly in the next version (for game selection batch files and things like that).

I think what vandyk means is he wants you to add Supaplex to your TODO list as it isn't working properly with Dsx86.For what its worth I checked it out and the mouse disn't work (possibly because it is an animated sprite or somesuch) and as such I couldn't get it to start (loads fine etc. but no mouse).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
sverx: I opened the Dune2 savegame file in "r+" mode, while I should have opened it in "w" mode. I only used the "w" mode in the DOS "Create or Truncate file" call, not in the plain "Open File" call. I am still a little bit unclear about the difference between opening a file for write only (which Dune 2 does, and expects the existing file to get truncated), and using the Create call, which also truncates a file if it exists already.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Pate - Great to see you managed to get a release out (been eagerly waiting to check it out) :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Log file:- <a href="http://pastebin.com/W5eb0b05" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/W5eb0b05</a>
<br/>
<br/>
On the log file - Its easy to get multiple entries in the log of the same error (by hitting B to try and step though etc.). I try and go through and edit it to take out the repeat entries but it is a bit of a pain. Any value in tyding up how you write to this file (i.e check for exact error and NOT write)? How have others been giving you thiers (did they include multiples and is it an issue for you)? One of things where I toss up continuing as is or doing up something to redo the file to remove multiples. I think this log went from  150+k to 15k
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway onto the testing :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Batch File - works a treat. Still took me awhile to run my tests mostly because I wanted to do hard resets to make sure no carried over issues but at least this made it easier to run games in order etc.
<br/>
<br/>
General stuff:-
<br/>
<br/>
Still some issues with not dumping memory etc. when exiting via the debugger or in game. I had one game where it was drawing the screen overlaid with graphics from the last game (AOW and BTech). Easy enough just to do a hard reset (which is what I did for all) but just an FYI
<br/>
<br/>
Touchpad switching - You make note of if the select button is not mapped it can be used so what happens if it is? Reason I ask is you are switching via the toggle in order (ie no mouse, mouse using keys then touhpad) so the only way to proceed once the screen is flipped (that I can see) is via the select button. Might be an issue if you went from NO mouse to Mouse via keys as you can only get back to no mouse via screen flip etc. Possibly not an issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Touchpad switching - if screen is scaled the select button will not flip the screens. It is possible to flip the screens when scaled using the touch toggle control (bug or deliberate?).
<br/>
<br/>
Touchpad mouse - Right Mouse button? What or where is it? Was tryingto figure it out in EOB (which plays great using the Touchpad except for how to handle right button).
<br/>
<br/>
Touchpad Mouse - Anychance of a toggle controling behaviour i.e between click on touch (touchy for some games) and just moving mouse with maybe a double tap a click? I still like the idea of a virtual pad (with a left and right virtual button) actually with the Virtual KB.
<br/>
<br/>
All mouse issues below relate to touchpad mouse only - Not encounted issues with the dpad controlled mouse
<br/>
<br/>
Ancient Art of War - Game now seems to be OK
<br/>
Bards Tale - Touch Mouse NOT working (everything else appears OK). Just seems to flick of to the bottom right corner and cannot be controled)
<br/>
Bards Tale II - Same issues as above with Touchpad mouse
<br/>
Battle Tech - OK
<br/>
Battle Tech II - Same issue as previous - unsupported SB DSP command 10
<br/>
Carrier Command - Unsupported Opcode that can be "B'd" through. Title vector graphics not drawn properly not os the curser drawn so the game cannot be controled via KB or mouse (VKB keys do work).
<br/>
Dragon Wars - No Change EGA/VGA graphics stuffed - unplayable.
<br/>
Dungeon Kepper - No Change Error and messed graphics etc.
<br/>
Eye of Beholder - plays great with the new touchpad except for right mbutton issues - see above
<br/>
Gunship - Now EGA give INT and Op code errors - prgress seems o have been made however not playable
<br/>
<br/>
Kingsquest 1-4, Lesuire Suit Larry, Police Quest, Space Quest 1-2 - All have same text/graphics issues. SLightly different this time round in that some chracters are displayed (like a g mixed with c or $) and in menus every second one can be read however text box text is just garbeled. Slightly different but still the same issues obviously
<br/>
<br/>
Police Quest II - OK 
<br/>
Lords of Midnight - OK
<br/>
Lords of Midnight - Doomdarks Revenge - OK
<br/>
Mechwarrior - OK however Touchpad mouse is not behaving as expected. Works but doesn't seem to move around as it does in dosbox
<br/>
Midwinter - OK - Touchpad mouse however moves around edges of screen only - cannot use
<br/>
Midwinter II - Now appears OK however suffers same touchpad mouse issues as above
<br/>
Quest For Glory - OK however touchpad mouse whilst appearing to work doesn't select properly in menus etc.
<br/>
Rogue - Unchanged text/graphic issues
<br/>
<br/>
Ultima I - Now can get ingame (looks great) howver now get INT calls moving etc.
<br/>
Ultima II - no change same issues
<br/>
Ultima III - OK 
<br/>
Ultima IV - Now get an unsupported Op code error (with the packed file issue).
<br/>
<br/>
Ultima V - woohooo :-) All looks great Pate. Will look forward to playing this (have logged a fair few hours in Bards Tale so might have to continue that before I start this ;-)).
<br/>
<br/>
OK thats about it and appoligies for the large post. Impressions are the touchpad mouse has great potential but I reckon it needs to be a bit more flexible (i.e not be locked into the forced click behaviour when you touch the screen etc.). Having a flick through EOB I can certainly see the benefits as movement etc, was great (even if this game relies on right button for combat which was an issue). Obviosly there are some issues with how it is behaving with some games but your implementation of the button mouse is pretty good so looking forward to what you can acheive with the touchpad.
<br/>
<br/>
Still moving in the right direction Pate (improvements in some games and no introduced issues that I could see) so great release. 
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the great work and thanks for this release :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tomorrow I'll test the new version with some other simulations aka Falcon XT, A-10 Tank Killer 1.5 &amp; Gunship 2000.

Thanks for the quick and thorough testing! Yes, I think I need to filter out duplicate entries in the routine that writes the log. I have received both filtered and unfiltered log files (some even leave all the errors of the previous versions in the log files they send, which is a bit annoying :-).

If it is mapped, you can't switch TO touchpad mouse emulation, but you can switch back (so the mapped PC key only works when NOT in touchpad emulation mode).

It is not supported, as I couldn't figure out how to do that! Actually, I am open to suggestions on how to improve the touchpad mouse support.

<br/>
Thanks for the info! Perhaps I have a different sound setup as I didn't get any digitized effects. At what point in the game those happen? Also, do you have a log about the I/O port issue? I have noticed in Populous II (which I have also been debugging) that some SB digitized effects play noise in DSx86. I suspect it is one of the ADPCM modes.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I've had several emails stating that many games that used to work now give "Not enough memory" errors. I am a bit at loss as to what could be the cause for this, as I haven't noticed any such errors myself, and the amount of conventional memory is only 3KB less in this version than in the previous one. DSx86 leaves much more conventional memory free than for example DOSBox, so these errors must be caused by something else. If you happen to run into this problem, please let me know as much info about the situation as you can (output of the 4DOS "memory" command, the exact error message, what game, etc.).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your testing!

The unsupported INT is "CD-ROM - INSTALLATION CHECK", and it is safe to bypass with the B button (it returns with no registers changed, which means no CD-ROM driver installed, which is correct). I don't have an ORION.COM in my MOO directory, only ORION.EXE.

I just noticed that the MOO INSTALL program does not show properly the selected hardware options. This might be due to my 6x8 font not containing characters below ASCII code 32. I'll try to add these characters to the next version.

Indeed, this would be extremely useful for some games. I've been playing <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bimshwel.com/renk/moraff/1bipbop2.htm" target="_blank">Bip Bop II</a>, a really, really terrible Breakout clone (I mean just awful; it's fun to play because I had it back in the day, but it's so bad), but the touch screen clicking poses a problem. In Bip Bop II (there was no Bip Bop I), clicking fires a bullet; unlike other Breakout clones, your bullets don't break blocks, but rather are able to hit the ball and cause it to ricochet back toward the blocks; it's just another method of guiding the ball. The paddle is also controlled by moving the mouse. The current touchpad setup results in the paddle constantly firing any time you move it. The d-pad controls avoid this but obviously make the game a lot tougher since it's designed for mouse play (and in fact touch screen play is even better).
<br/>
<br/>
That aside, the game runs perfectly so far; even the built-in screensaver (hit P to pause and leave it a couple of minutes) works fine. Great nostalgia trip, thanks again.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Wow, I imagine this has been mentioned before, but this actually runs Halloween Harry/Alien Carnage (which is now <a class="postlink" href="http://www.3drealms.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">freeware</a>); the game nominally requires VGA support and DSx86 throws errors pretty much any time something new loads with regard to the game asking for 640*480 display, but if you keep hitting B to pass by them you can get all the way in-game. Totally amazing. (Make sure you skip the cutscenes.)<br/>_________________<br/>I've got nothing to say, but it's OK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Pate
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the DS I have never really used a touchscreen device. From having a quick look on the net it would appear (for things like windows PDA's etc.) that right mouse clicks are generally handled by press and hold (like 1 sec) behaviour. 
<br/>
<br/>
Could also have a toggle and having a mess around last night it would have to be mapped to either the D buttons or the left sholder button (of course I have righty bias ;-)). Personally I would have picked the sholder button but I know you have these mapped to the screen movement.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I reckon you could do a couple of configs such as:-
<br/>
<br/>
Operate as true touchscreen (so as is but implement right click functionality) - touch positions cursor and registers left click whilst a touch and hold postions cursor and registers right click.
<br/>
<br/>
Second scheme could be simply move the mouse cursor with stylus and a double tap registers left click and either a toggle (swith between left right click) or button (like left sholder) could register right click. Sort of evision this like the laptop touchpad.
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly you could implement something like that AtariST emu has which is the virtual pad that had the two virtual buttons. Could utilise full screen or a small one (which would require sweeping movements to move mouse large distances). This would work quite well in using the stylus to move the cursor and then pressing either the lft or right button for desired action.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone used some of these touchscreen devices and how have you found the interfaces?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That seems logical and could emulate all mouse combinations.  Also any ingame support for left-handed should work (or DSx86 itself could swap buttons in ini-file).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it will be better if mouse emulation switches to the physical (COM port) level.  Then the original MOUSE.COM could handle INT 33, mouse cursor, button swap, middle button emulation and all his work.

I would rather have stylus tap = left click and left shoulder + stylus tap= right click. This way you could play more naturally and seamlesly (although it's some games will need your solution)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still haven't had the time to test this release but, speaking about mouse emulation, I found the better one IMHO was the system they used in scummVM DS port. There are two ways to use it:
<br/>
<br/>
"Way 1"- When you press <span style="font-style: italic">left</span> on DPad the left mouse button gets selected. Then, from this moment on, when you touch the screen with the stylus, you're left clicking with your mouse.
<br/>
When you press <span style="font-style: italic">right</span> on DPad the right mouse button gets selected. Then, when you touch the screen with the stylus, you're right clicking with your mouse.
<br/>
When you press <span style="font-style: italic">up</span> on DPad all the mouse buttons gets UNselected. Then, when you touch the screen with the stylus, you're simply moving the mouse to that position.
<br/>
<br/>
"Way 2"- (starting with mouse buttons unselected) you move your mouse around on screen by touching the touch screen and when you want to click you simply keep the stylus down on the screen while pressing the left (or right) Dpad key. This way you're left/right clicking with your mouse.
<br/>
<br/>
I could play <span style="font-weight: bold">entirely</span> <span style="font-style: italic">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis</span> using this system ("Way 2"), with very little problems. Very very VERY enjoyable!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Incidentally, is there a way to have a custom setup "stick" for a single game which uses multiple executables? The example in mind here is Alien Carnage, which is launched through a single executable, CARNAGE.EXE, but the game is actually made up of a number of executables, e.g. HARRY0.-0, HARRY1.-0, HARRY2.-0, etc. (yes, these are executables, they have the MZ bytes and everything). As the game switches between executables, the custom setup I had for CARNAGE is dropped, because I don't have that setup for HARRY5, etc. Is there a way to either use wildcards in setup names or to force a group of executables to use a single setup?<br/>_________________<br/>I've got nothing to say, but it's OK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

sverx: That sounds like a nice way to handle all combinations of mouse clicking with the touchpad. I prefer using D-Pad over the shoulder buttons, as the shoulder buttons are usually used for screen scrolling and the D-Pad is pretty much unused with the touchpad mouse mode. I'll see about implementing this in the next version.

Having messed with it further, it's actually somewhat useful in this case. I have A as Enter (Accept) and B as Escape (Cancel) in the menu, while in-game A is Ctrl (Thrust) and B is Alt (Fire); it makes the game feel almost "native" in terms of control schemes. It actually supports the Gravis Gamepad originally so I imagine if you ever code gamepad support it would work somewhat similar, but until then, if you do make a system which fixes the sticky options issue, it might be nice to be able to override the sticky setting (i.e. the game uses the setup CARNAGE except for HARRY9, the menu, which has its own setup). This is getting way ahead to niche usability stuff though, so I understand that it's probably not something you'll be looking into immediately.<br/>_________________<br/>I've got nothing to say, but it's OK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can confirm EoB I is running greatly on 0.11 -- in the fact it even plays SB music, that is hard to get under XP!  Also special effects are greater on DS, than on modern PC because of more appropriate speed.  But without right mouse button you'll be killed in the first battle.

<br/>
<br/>
Eye Of The Beholder 3 - <span style="font-weight: bold">Doesn't run</span> - Gives "386 opcodes not supported" error.
<br/>
<br/>
Formula 1 Grand Prix - <span style="font-weight: bold">Doesn't run</span> - Boots to Micropose screen then freezes, no error given.
<br/>
<br/>
Ishar - <span style="font-weight: bold">Playable with sound</span> - Runs perfectly. Slightly difficult to select language selection during bootup (uses numpad instead of number keys if I remember correctly).
<br/>
<br/>
Ishar 2 - <span style="font-weight: bold">Playable with sound</span> - Like the first, runs perfectly. Same issue with the numbers though.
<br/>
<br/>
Legends of Valour - <span style="font-weight: bold">Playable with sound</span> - Perfectly playable using the touchpad mode (though needs the right button)  if a little choppy in places.
<br/>
<br/>
Lord Of The Rings : Fellowship of the Ring - <span style="font-weight: bold">Almost Playable</span> - VGA mode runs at perfect speed but the palette is messed up. EGA and CGA the palette seems fine but the game runs really slowly. Also the screen where you choose either a new or old game only shows a black screen (in any mode)but the keys to select the options still work. Only PC speaker works, enabling Soundblaster gives "unsupported SB DSP command 10 " error.
<br/>
<br/>
Lord Of the Rings : The Two Towers - <span style="font-weight: bold">Almost Playable</span> - Same issues as the first game, though VGA mode gives a "unsupported port I/O" error. 
<br/>
<br/>
Star Trek - 25th Anniversary - <span style="font-weight: bold">Playable with sound</span> - Runs pretty much flawlessly (of what I played anyway)
<br/>
<br/>
Ultima Underworld - <span style="font-weight: bold">Doesn't Run</span> - Gives "unsupported INT call" on bootup. Setup utility just gives continuous scrolling text so can't be used.

DSx86 does not use the traditional cycle counting emulation method, so it is a little bit more difficult to implement this.

Vague Rant: About the sticky configuration, I was thinking that perhaps that could be arranged simply by making the current CONFIG value clickable (or "touchable"), so that you can toggle whether the current setup sticks or is replaced with a new setup when the executable changes. Yellow text when sticky, white when changeable, or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, looks like I finally managed to solve the "anti-debugger INT03 problem" that has crashed some games. Took a lot of debugging and comparing the executed opcodes between DSx86 and DOSBox, but now it looks like DSx86 emulates the single-step and breakpoint interrupts used by that technique properly. Should be working in the next version.

Can you please tell me how the mouse is handled by DSx86 ?
<br/>
<br/>
For now I only tested one game : <span style="font-weight: bold">Captive</span>, one of the best Dungeon Master clones. Here's my feedback :
<br/>
- At start you're prompted to choose between VGA &amp; EGA, surprisingly VGA works (was sure VGA was unsupported by DSx86...). Even better it's only in this mode that the cursor shows up ingame.
<br/>
- The intro cutscene work in VGA with sound (SB), skipped in EGA (as in original)
<br/>
- At first look the game seems to run just fine (at least as good as the Atari ST version), with sound
<br/>
- The cursor can be moved in DPAD mode but disappears in Touch mode as soon as you touch the screen
<br/>
- The 83-key US keyboard limits the gameplay as some movements/actions are mapped on the numeric pad. Maybe this could be implemented in the ini configuration tool you provide, so we can map extra keys to DS buttons without having you to do a full 120-keys keyboard
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Master_Thief: Thanks for such thorough testing! Gotta admire your beautiful formatting of the game list! :-) There were many relatively easy to fix issues in your debug log, so many of those should be fixed in the next version. Of course that does not necessarily mean the games will run, but they should progress further at least!
<br/>
<br/>
MrSkiz: Thanks for the encouragement! Yes, DSx86 is still very much in beta, and I keep adding features and fixing bugs all the time. The touchpad mouse still needs a lot of work, but what exactly would you like to know about how I handle the mouse emulation?

Pate - tried out a few more but most looked to be 386+ or required protected mode (so I assume 386+). One I did try was Castels 2 - Siege and Conquest which didn't make it to the menu with the following opcode error:-

<br/>
<a href="http://pastebin.com/9NxKJ3jw" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/9NxKJ3jw</a>

Another one I tried was Asterix: Operation Getafix because I read that it was slow on dosbox and I wanted to see how it went with DSx86. Both VGA and CGA work but they are both Slow (unplayable).
<br/>

Looking forward to the next release :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Master_Thief: Thanks for the additional testing! I took a quick look at the debug log, some things seem easy to fix. The 386 opcode in Hobbit looks like something that might be caused by a copy protection bypass crack. I have been thinking that maybe I could support some 386 opcodes (like long conditional jumps as in that Hobbit game or 32-bit string opcodes), even when I won't support 32-bit register opcodes.
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: I added that opcode in your Castles2 log, the game should run further in the next version.

I agree :-) Great work Pate 
<br/>
<br/>
After owning a PSP and messing around with that for awhile I brought the DS for my daughter because of the interface (touchscreen etc.). TBH whilst I knew the DS wasn't a powerful unit (so would be limited in its hombrew capability) I was a bit underwhelmed by the DS emu/homebrew scene in general (are a few great ones however).
<br/>
<br/>
Gotta say I am mightily impressed by DSx86 however and it is certainly giving me a reason to pinch my daughters DS ;-)

Hey Master_Thief - how did you get ideas to run DSx86? 
<br/>
<br/>
Stuffed if I could get it to recoginise a file system (so 4DOS wasn't loaded). What do you need to do to get it to recognise the PC HDD? 
<br/>
<br/>
When I saw your screen dump I wanted to check the screen scaling/display between DSx86 and scummvm in like for like games (such as Police Quest and Kings Quest etc. as they use the same game source). Whilst I need to clarify it (was what I was going to do with Ideas is it can run DSx86), it looks like the how the full screen is implemented in scummvm displays text better than that scaled DSx86 
<br/>
<br/>
Hi Pate - Whilst I am talking about full screen were you going to look at different scaling options for FS in DSx86? As per above I reckon scummvm is displaying the text slightly better and it seems they use the full width and slighly stretch the top and bottom. Also just an FYI scummvm has an implementation of what I was talking about with the virtual KB and Mouse together on the touchscreen.
<br/>
<br/>
Hows the next relase comming along?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, the current scaling options are not final, but I think they work well enough that I have not been working on them for a while. If I find a better scaling method I can either switch to that or add that as another option. I guess I'll need to look into ScummVM one of these days..

Well, some days slowly, some days I progress faster. :-) The next release will have 640x480 and 640x350 mode support, and I also fixed the text font problem in Space Quest I, which might fix the problem in other early Sierra games as well (haven't tested any other game). Lots of new EGA and Mode-X opcodes added, but I haven't done any improvements to the mouse emulation yet, and I noticed that mouse does not work at all in Windows running in DSx86. I'll try to do some more fixes during the weekend before releasing the next version, but the above list is the current status. I would like to debug some badly behaving games, but that usually takes about a full day per game, so if I do that I won't have time to do much else.

Hey Master_Thief - how did you get ideas to run DSx86? </span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
You have to first patch DSx86 with the R4 dldi file.
<br/>
<br/>
Then in ideas, File-&gt;Properties, then choose the R4 option in the DLDI drop down box.
<br/>
<br/>
There's no support for flashcard writing though, so there'll be no logfile created and setup programs won't save changes so it's uses are fairly limited (not to mention the slow speed).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because you can run 2 instances of ideas just wanted to run them side by side for some of the same games to see how the scaling compares. Only just had a quick look at 1 game and whilst the graphics look the same (to my eye at least) the text is definatley clearer/better in scummvm. Will have a play tomorrow maybe.

<br/>
<br/>
No improvements in the mouse emulation yet, as I concentrated on improving the general compatibility, especially with the games reported of almost working.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been discussing with Robin Watts about the scaling issue, and it seems the current scaling method is pretty much what can be achieved with a fast blitting routine. Robin is looking into efficient software scaling, so perhaps in some future version DSx86 will have a scaling method with a prettier output. That might not be fast enough for action games, but we shall see.
<br/>
<br/>
Many issues still remain, but this version hopefully can again run few more games than the previous version.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your interest in DSx86, I'm looking forward to your test reports again!

Mate you almost missed your release window. I know I checked this thread a few times today waiting to see a new version and almost went to bed before it was updated (had to check it one last time).
<br/>
<br/>
Good to see once again you didn't dissapoint :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Couple of general observations. Log file - looks like you added some code to clean up the output? Not mentioned in your blog etc. but was expecting to have to clean it (kept hitting B in the debugger) and lo and behold was nice and clean allready so assume you fixed it all up.
<br/>
<br/>
Graphics - few games seemed to be much more crisp and nicer looking (noticable on menus or loading screens). Not compared versions so could be wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Graphics - I know you said you havn't done anything with the scaling etc. but did you mess around some with the jitter code? Once again haven't compared versions but text in some games seemed a bit clearer using this versions jitter. Might just be me thinking it looks better ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Log File:- <a href="http://pastebin.com/My7pUSR2" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/My7pUSR2</a> (stripped as per above - looks like all errors are accounted for)
<br/>
<br/>
Testing Summary (decided to copy Master_Thief's format) - I had Playable as playable (might be minor issues such as TPM implementation), Issues meaning it loads without error and gets ingame but there are issues and will finally use not working if it is completely broken and not running at all.

Lots of <span style="color: green"> Green </span> so great job Pate. Few games with issues but I think a couple that did have issues are showing improvement and of course a fair whack now appear resolved with this release. Only one game (sentinel) seems to have been adversly affected with this release (blank on EGA). BTW great work on resolving the text issues for KQ, LL and SQ etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another great release Pate and having a play with EOB and the TPM implementation in that game it is going to be great when you have the RMB sorted as it plays great. Was TPM in your plans for working on next or will you try for more compatability based on feedback?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great app Pate (allready got lots of gaming goodness to play with ;-)).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A gen a great update on dsx86, keeps getting better and better. very nice!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've tested the following games;
<br/>
<br/>
ShufflepuckCafe: freezes after the begin screen
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Supaplex</span>: Works at normal speed (<span style="font-weight: bold">no slowdown</span>). Screen "hapert" when the screen follows "murphy". Still, <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT SAVE</span> in supapalex (not save when completing a level).
<br/>
Stunts: Works good (gives a "Unsupported INT call" hid "b" and it runs good).
<br/>
TIM (the incredible machine): Screen, Zoom mode= OK / Scale mode= bad
<br/>
testdrive: Works good
<br/>
Skyroad: Works Perfect
<br/>
<br/>
It's nice to have "stunts" on the DS, very nice. 
<br/>
With the save of Supaplex, can this may be be fix?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thanks for this 0.12 dsx86 version Pate. <span style="font-weight: bold">Keep up the great great work!</span> </span>

Ive got the same issue, i have try same different setups, no success yet.

- You have to set your 4dos version to 4 (in dosbox you must type: "ver set 4" then type: "win") unfortunate this command don't work in 4dos.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by madd on Sun May 09, 2010 6:47 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: Thanks for the nice list of games! Yeah, I added a filter to the debug output so it won't repeat the previous error. No change to the scaling modes, must be your wishful thinking that makes them look better in this version. :-) Yeah, mouse improvements are the focus of the next version.
<br/>
<br/>
madd: Thanks for the info! I guess I have a somehow hacked version of Windows 2.03 as mine works fine on DOS 5.00. Anyways, looks like I need to add a DOS version change functionality to the next version. "VER SET 4" sounds like a command that I could try to implement to DSx86. I'll also try to take a look at the Supaplex save problem at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your testing!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ultima 6:
<br/>
Gives a "Packed file is corrupt" error when it switches from u.exe to game.exe.  Running game.exe directly works fine.
<br/>
After getting a "Packed file is corrupt" error, running any other program causes 4DOS to yell about a "4DOS server error -- Memory allocation error" until DSX86 restarts.
<br/>
<br/>
Turbo Science:
<br/>
Finally shows the intro, but gives an unsupported opcode afterwards.
<br/>
730B:12BD 26082D or   es:[di],ch
<br/>
<br/>
QuickBasic 4.5:
<br/>
It shows a lot of Unsupported Interrupt messages, then starts up.  The mouse, and menu navigation works, but none of the menu items do anything.  No window accepts input from the keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
Manic Miner (Warajevo Standalone version):
<br/>
Gives "Packed File is Corrupt".  Same memory allocation error if you try to do anything after that.
<br/>
<br/>
Zany Golf:
<br/>
Gives an invalid opcode after you quit.
<br/>
<br/>
Pharoh's Tomb:
<br/>
CGA emulation errors.  Looks like it installs a custom font, and the emulator doesn't recognize it.  Also has problems when redrawing the top status bar.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heya Pate,
<br/>
<br/>
With DSx86, <span style="font-weight: bold">Galactix</span> from Cygnus Studios seems to work but it randomly freezes. This forces me to make a breakpoint and reset DSx86. In NoMusic mode the game is less laggy/sluggish and very playable but not as enjoyable without the music/digitized sfxs.
<br/>
<br/>
The game can utilize either NoMusic (AKA PCSpeaker SFXs), Adlib, or SB/PRO music. With Adlib it glitches right at the first note and holds through the playing of the song until the music resets during an event. But then it holds the first note of that song. SFXs under Adlib are through the PC Speaker which is fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't use SB/Pro, either one that is, since I get unsupported port I/O for any of the settings as far as I can tell. The defaults back when i used SBPro was 220H, IRQ 7 but I suppose that varies.
<br/>
<br/>
With Music I get very random freezes in the intros and during gameplay. Without music I don't get any obvious freezes so far. The logs user breakpoint is from one such instance.
<br/>
<br/>
The game is freeware and looks pretty nice even in scaled mode on the DSx86. Supports both mouse and keyboard. It plays better using the Mouse/D-Pad which uses the L and R mouse buttons for A and B. Makes the game very playable. When you hit both A and B the Claw in the game goes out just like it did when I played ages ago when there was no Middle mouse button. A fun and entertaining arcade-like SHMUP.
<br/>
<br/>
In case you need a copy of it I have all the DOS shareware releases and the final freeware version before they closed up shop. Then they came back as Mountain King Studios and released many of their DOS games as WIN95 games. The DOS versions still float around if you look hard enough.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dwedit: Thanks for the info and log! I suspect the difference between u.exe and game.exe is that when running game.exe directly DSx86 detects the probable packed file corrupt problem and loads the exe higher, while it does not detect this when u.exe does the loading. I'll need to add a proper "loadfix" command at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
About the button remapper, have you tested RyouArashi's new DSx86Cfg DOS program? You can run that inside DSx86 to configure the buttons, so it is almost like the feature was built in, you just need to restart DSx86 for the changes to take effect.
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Big thanks for the big list again! Good amount of green there, I'll try to check the games that don't give debug log info myself at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
phoenixclaws: Ok, looks like Galactix is one game I need to check for myself. I don't support AdLib timers (as no game has so far used them), but based on your description of the problem it looks like Galactix might use them. If it is freeware but not available on the net, I would be interested in a copy, thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
jinjin: Good to know about Sango fighter. I haven't seen the need for A: drive support, as you should be able to install the games using DOSBox.
<br/>
<br/>
Zandro: I haven't kept the example DSx86.ini up-to-date. Things like that would work well in some wiki-style page, but I don't know how to set something like that up, nor am I all that interested in spending time on learning that. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in hosting a wiki or some such for games that work in DSx86 and recommended key configurations (and FAQ etc), that would be much appreciated! I'll of course link to that page from my DSx86 page, which I would like to keep more development-oriented.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your testing!

The code in Orion is a bit suspect, though, as the subroutine performs an unsigned multiply to get the result in bytes, but then it performs a signed comparison to check if the result is &gt; 120 000. This will always fail if the free space is over 2GB. I'll at least need to adjust the return values so that the result will never get over 2GB, even if you use a 4GB or larger SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
About the subst/assign, I don't think I support those in the DSx86 internals. I'll see how difficult it would be to support those.

<br/>
<br/>
edit: I mean if it's so then you'll probably have 4KB clusters, and you should have less than 65536 clusters free to get a result that fits into a 16 bit x86 register: this means you've got to leave less than 256 MB free for that function to work correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you can reformat your microSD with FAT (FAT16) filesystem, if its size is less than 4GB (as probably it is). Giving the cluster a 32KB size then you'll have no problems if your microSD is 2GB and you'll have to leave less than 2GB free if your card is ~4GB. (Don't give the cluster the 64KB size, or it'll overflow the 16 bit register again...)

Actually, the sub_4378 function first multiplies sectors per cluster * bytes per sector, and then multiplies the lower part of that * free clusters, so the quantity that has to be &lt; 65536 is bytes per cluster.
<br/>

<br/>
True, because 65536 is ZERO on a 16 bits register...
<br/>
<br/>
...but there's also the fact that FAT32 supports more than 65536 clusters, and you'll obtain just this % 65536, since this number will be expressed in a 16 bits register (BX, DX hold the total number of clusters modulus 65536)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About the RAM expansion pack.. If there is documentation about supporting that, I might add support for it. I don't see a great need for it, but using EMS from the expansion pack and leaving more main RAM free might be a good idea at times.

Devkitpro server seems to be undergoing repairs now so I can't check whether there are instructions on RAM expansion pack usage.

The reason I mentioned:
<br/>
<br/>
A possible issue with this is if a program should call command.com WHILE it is running (e.g., the SHELL command in GWBASIC/QBASIC, and the system() call in C), which might cause 4start to run again.  (Obviously if all you run is games this is probably not a big deal.)

Yep, the primary 4DOS shell is started with the /P switch.

About the disk space problem.. Looks like DOSBox always reports free disk space as 256 megabytes.. Perhaps I should also fake the free disk space in DSx86, instead of reporting as close to real values as possible. That might avoid problems with 64K clusters etc.

May I suggest you simply divide by 2 the cluster size and multiply by 2 the sectors per cluster number (in AX) until the cluster size is &lt; 64KB? This way the total/free space amount will be correct, at least for disks &lt; 4GB ...

<br/>
<br/>
Another info : DSx86 works fine with <a class="postlink" href="http://y.effinger.free.fr/dskiosk/?l=en" target="_blank">DSkiosk</a>, an excellent homebrew menu/launcher. I don't know if there's an impact on performance though...
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to make my proper start.btm to have a little menu, DSx86 starts to be very fun to use. I'm really looking forward to touchpad mouse improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
About touchpad mode, could it be possible to make it like a Wacom tablet ?
<br/>
    - touching a location on the screen teleports the cursor
<br/>
    - left click by touching rapidly on screen, double click by double tapping, right click by holding left or right trigger (if you're lefty)
<br/>
I like this mode for the effectiveness at aiming a spot, more intuitive clicks and so it don't waste NDS buttons that can still be used for keyboard commands but I don't know how to make "drag &amp; drop" (even if it as a rare thing in the DOS era...) unless we use the second trigger (but how to move the screen in scale mode)
<br/>
<br/>
About scale mode, it could be effective to move the screen by holding left or right trigger (lefty mode) then use dpad or abxy (lefty mode).
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to implement/use a standard joystick driver as some games make use of it ?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. : you see a lot of "lefty mode", it's because that I'm actually one of those misfits :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm also thinking of making the screen scrolling aware of the mouse cursor position, so the scrolling logic would try to keep the mouse cursor visible. In the higher resolution modes there is a need for finer scrolling in any case, but I still think that the current left-middle-right position is OK for the 320x200 modes. Or do you think that should have finer increments as well?
<br/>
<br/>
It would be easier to have an NDS button handle the mouse button, as I'm not quite sure how well tapping would work, with the 60Hz input scanning speed. I guess I should just test that..
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also a bit worried about changing the current scrolling and mouse logic completely, but perhaps there is no proper way to both keep the current logic and add a new improved logic at the same time.

Sorry Leniad, I seem to have indeed missed your question. :-(

I think the current 6x8 font is a good compromise between readability and space usage. I could possibly go down to 4x6 font which is still mostly readable, but as that would still show only 64 instead of the whole 80 characters on a row, I'm not sure if that would be worth it. The current font displays around 42 characters per row on the DS screen, so the 40x25 text modes fit the screen pretty nicely, and you can see over half of the normal 80x25 text screen. 4DOS even understands the 24-row limit properly, so you don't need to scroll up/down when on the DOS prompt.
<br/>
<br/>
I know there is a trick to use sub-pixel drawing on the DS LCD screen, but my understanding is that it only works in monochrome, and as the PC text mode is 16-color, I can't use that trick.
<br/>
<br/>
What text-mode programs specifically you find problematic with the current font, and would a 4x6 font really help sufficiently with those? 
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and thanks for the encouragement! :-)

Not sure of the game list but HGG and the Zorks etc. are all supported by this hombrew (a pretty cool one at that). The download above actually includes all you need (i.e games as well - and there are a heap). If you didn't know about it - check it out :-)

Hi Pate - how goes development? You sort out the executing data issues? Looking forward to the next release :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#174164 - Pate - Fri May 21, 2010 4:58 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello midwinter, thanks for asking. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to fix the data execution problems as well as I would have liked. I did manage to fix Jumpman 2, the problem in it was caused by a segment wrap when moving data using a string operation with a downward direction. I fixed all the string operations in DSx86 to handle segment wrap properly, and that seemed to also help with the WC2 issue that I thought was caused by bugs in my EMS memory handling. So, some progress regarding this issue will be in the next version.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I have studied Abandoned Places and Moonstone quite a bit, but still am not close to a solution for their problems. AP allocates less memory than it should, and then overwrites the interrupt handler code with the data it reads from a file, which then crashes the next time the timer interrupt is called. With Moonstone I have narrowed down the situation where it locks up the touchpad to a single routine, but as it has five subroutines and the main routine has a loop that goes over all the screen lines, it still needs quite a bit of debugging to find the actual problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I got frustrated with those and started working on the touchpad mouse issues yesterday. First I added support for BIOS pixel drawing routines, which seem to be needed by some games (giving Unsupported Interrupt errors at the moment), and then I plan to use those routines together with the mouse code in my tester program to adjust the mouse (and zoom mode) behaviour for each graphics mode.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Great to see another release :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Tested my usuals with results below. Both the Bards Tales are now not working, most stayed the same and now Quest for Glory (TPM mouse now works properly) and Ultima I Work. So overall mixed bag :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Just left the new parameters as default. Gotta say I am not a fan of setting options via the INI (been spoilt as you have given us the option to change via app previously so did you plan to include same for these new options?)
<br/>
<br/>
Still a fair few games that had issues with the TPM (mostly registering position etc.) and to me it looked like for some to be related to screen size/scaling.
<br/>
<br/>
One observation after having a mess around with EOB was sensitivity of the TPM (not registering clicks). Not sure if this was related to position (i.e same) or speed (i.e fast taps not registering) but it certainly seemed if your tap behaviour was slower it registered all clicks correctly. Also not sure about the actual dpad press registering the click. Possibly a tap whilst holding button L or R could be an option (need to mess around with what you have done a bit more - but would like to see numerous schemes supported - toggled from within the app of course ;-)).

Dwedit: The problem in TURBOSCI looks easy to fix.
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: I forgot to mention in my blog that I added some new checks for opcodes that use the DS segment for graphics operations, and the BARD problem is one of these. Should be fixed in the next version. Sorry to break games that used to work, but I sometimes need to add new checks to make sure my emulation is not just skipping some operations (like it must have done with BARD in the previous versions).
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to have the TPM options settable from the DSx86 UI, but the problem is that the touchpad is used by the mouse emulation, so there is no room for clickable toggles! Anyways, this might not be the final TPM version, so let me know if you can think up better control schemes etc. Oh, and if you can provide more detailed info about how the TPM emulation is not working in those games, that would also help me in improving the emulation.
<br/>
<br/>
phoenixclaws: Sorry I did not have time to fix the Galactix hanging problems. I did study it a bit and fixed the port I/O problems, but the hanging problem is still there. I'll look into it in the upcoming versions.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Pate
<br/>
<br/>
On the TPM options I just figured you would have them above the current mouse screen toggle (gotta bit of room in that box). Similar to the screen scaling option which can only be set outside of the TPM, you set the TPM mode using the Virtual interface (i.e TMP Mode 1, 2 etc) and then that scheme is used when you enter TPM mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just had a better mess around with EOB. Very playable with the TPM (even got used to actually using the DL and DR as mouse buttons) but the sensitivity definatley has issues. Navigating via the virtual arrows will be fine and then all of a sudden you will be tapping away and nothing is happening. Seemed pretty inconsistent which was why I started to use the DL button.
<br/>
<br/>
Onto TPM Issues:-
<br/>
<br/>
Bards Tale I and II - Mouse cursor can be positioned anywhere on screen and on switch to TPM mode the cursor appears in the lower right corner (blinking occasionaly). Cannot be moved from this position.
<br/>
<br/>
Dungeon Master - Mouse behaviour is same if scaled or zoomed. Doesn't matter where the TPM is tapped/toched the mouse is relatively offset (left/above). The offset diminishes to 0 for the top left corner of screen (so touch and cursor = same position) so if you touch top right corner cursor position = x to left and x decreases as you move to top left corner (positioning is relative for wherever else it is - i.e bottom left cusor is offset directly above).
<br/>
<br/>
Midwinter I and II - Cursor is only able to be moved around the extent of the screen. Doesn't matter where the touchpad is touched this will correspond with the mouse moving around one of the 4 edges of the screen. Seems to be a bit of a dead zone in the middle and then TPM movements outside of the middle area of the TPM correspond with realtive mouse cursor movement (slower neaer the middle zone) along one of the external edges of the screen. Offset is based mostly to the right (i.e toucing in the middle of the screen will result in cursoer movement on the right edge of screen until you are much nearer the left edge then the cursor will flick over to the left edge).
<br/>
<br/>
FYI (strange one maybe) - the results listed for UltimaIV are as run via my batch file (so paked file error and OP code error). Interestingly if you run it normally (navigate to right directory and run Ultima.COM then select Journey onward) you get it dropping to the dos prompt with only the packed file is corrupt message (NO op code error). This is the same if you run Avatar.exe direct. However using loadfix"avatar" or run via the batch file you get the Opcode error. Anyway just an FYI (might help or mean something).
<br/>
<br/>
Hope the TPM behaviour detail helps some. You know QFG which did have TPM issues in pervious version now was working great so you must have done something right ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Hey Master_Thief - how long does it take you to test all those games? Pretty decent effort methinks :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#174213 - Pate - Mon May 24, 2010 5:39 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MasterThief: Thanks again for your extensive testing! If you happen to have download links for the games with problems, that would help me in testing them. For example, I tried to look for the "Abyss" game but only found games with "abyss" as part of their name. 
<br/>
<br/>
madd: In your log the XOR error looks to happen in SUPAPLEX, for example, and that is similar to the Bard's Tale problem, it uses DS segment to address the video RAM. That should be fixed in the next version. Turbo Debugger is using 386 opcodes, so it won't work in DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: Thanks for the extra info! I'll see about adding TPM configuration with the touch screen. I think the scroll and tap on/off setting would be the most useful, or do you think something else should be configurable on-the-fly as well?
<br/>
<br/>
About the TPM problems, it looks like some of the games use a different method to read the mouse position. I'll need to test those games myself, and also compare the mouse coordinates in DSx86 with DOSBox. I should be able to fix the coordinate problems with that, but can't promise yet whether they would be in the next version.

Trolls works fluently in EGA mode (there's no background however in a level), VGA also works but the fps is too low to be able to play it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@Pate - 99% of the games I've tested are ones that I own the original games so I wouldn't know where to download them, though after a quick search, they all seem to be downloadable from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.theoldcomputer.com/roms/index.php?folder=PC/Abandonware-DOS/Games" target="_blank">here</a>. The Abyss however is actually called The Catacomb Abyss (I shortened the name for my batch file and forgot to put the full name when compiling my list, sorry).
<br/>
<br/>
@midwinter - The testing this time took around 6 hours. I had 3 podcasts to listen to, so spent sunday afternoon/early evening listening to them and testing the latest version.
<br/>
<br/>
@MrSkiz - I've taken a look at setting up a wiki and have just quickly set up <a class="postlink" href="http://dsx86-compatibility.wetpaint.com/" target="_blank">this</a>. Take a look and see what you think (it was just a quick 10 minute job so there's not much in the way of content at the moment, but it should give you some idea as what it would look like).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">aero7707: Welcome to the forum, and thanks for the log! The low audio volume, especially with the AdLib emulation, is a known problem. I plan to fix this along with some other problems in the audio emulation during my summer vacation, which will start after 5 weeks. I have kept those things at a low priority, as they at least work in some way already. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Ok, that's fine, I think it was mainly that Abyss that I wondered what it was. I very much appreciate the time you spend on testing DSx86, so again thanks for that!
<br/>
<br/>
I will certainly add a link onto my DSx86 pages to a wiki page if some of you decide to start updating such, and would much appreciate it! I would rather spend my time with coding instead of keeping a wiki page up to date, so I will probably not do much updating there myself, though.

So far it's set up so that you need so sign up to add new/edit the wiki pages and the forums can currently be posted in by anybody. This though can be altered to allow anybody to update the wiki pages but I'm not sure that would be a great idea. Or it could be altered so that only I can update the wiki pages and everybody can post there list in the forums/comments sections and I'll add them to the list.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Pate - On TMP control schemes I was thinking something along the lines of:-
<br/>
<br/>
1.) Touch Pad touch registers Mouse click (as per your first implementation) - Directional Left and Right (DL &amp; DR) are used to toggle which mouse button is used (Default  L - and just have a L or R in the box to designate which is active). Touch anywhere will move cursor and register click. Hold touch keeps the button pressed.
<br/>
<br/>
2.) Toupad moves cursor. DL and DR used to toggle LMB and RMB and tap registers MB (L or R as per toggle) click.
<br/>
<br/>
3.) Touchpad moves cursor - DL and DR button registers MB click
<br/>
<br/>
4.) Touchpad moves cursor - hold DL or DR to designate MB click type whilst tapping (so hold DL and then tap touchpad to register MB click at that position).
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if that makes sense. Basically you toggle how the MB is used prior to switching to the TPM and then whilst in TPM behavior is as per above (so aside from sceme 1 - movement just moves cursor and then DL and DR designate how taps or MB clicks are registered).
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief - CC was Carrier Command (no idea why I expanded the others and didn't for this). Like Pate reckon the banner is great and so is the compatibilty page. Only thing was how come you went for an add supported host? Aren't wikki pages a better option (no adds and popins/ups etc.)? I was just entering my list in an Excel sheet and then populating all the formatting etc. so really easy so can give you the data however you want it. When I get time will try and add some more games :-)
<br/>
<br/>

Strange that you have problems with the WC2 intro.. I just yesterday played through the whole intro without problems. I do have the WC2 Speech Pack, so the whole intro has speech. Perhaps that has something to do with the problem?
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: I think I see what you mean with the TPM control schemes. I'll keep this in mind and see what I can come up with. The current schemes take care of some of your schemes but not all.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I got the graphics problems in Catacomb Abyss sorted yesterday, so it should work properly in the next version. Still fighting with the more serious data-execution-problem games though.

Going to update the comp-wiki now.
<br/>
<br/>
@Pate: 
<br/>
Thank you for the constant updates and the interesting blog. I like to read it, although I know nothing about programming.
<br/>
I have sent you an e-mail with the .log-file as well as some comments and files.
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://pastebin.com/pKmUYFT0" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/pKmUYFT0</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
@master_thief
<br/>
Could you eventually put up an explanation on how to use the 4DOS prompt commands like LOADFIX. 
<br/>
And also how exactly to load, for example Dreamweb without the sound. I was an AMIGA500 child, so I never really got into DOS. (sorry)
<br/>
Although I don?t really like the comp-wiki, I already registered and will add some games to it. :-)
<br/>
Maybe it would also be good to make rules for testing games. Like:
<br/>
trying to reproduce an error twice, so that one can be sure its really there. 
<br/>
And when having problems, like "out of memory" or sth. like that, to be sure to restart DSx86 and try it once again. 
<br/>
<br/>
I wish someone had the time and the ability to put up an official wiki, that can be edited by everyone. Without the ads... Because, after an atomic worldwar, wikipedia will probably still be there, But wetpaint-compatibility list probably won?t...until then... I?ll contribute to the actual comp-list.
<br/>
<br/>

About "EMU386" Running on DS it sass "EMU386 not installed", but taking a closer look in the Assembly code with the "Turbo Debugger 5", it don't detect the CPU as a 286. Maybe whit a little editing it could work.
<br/>
If this is working (or implanted) it would by very very nice.
<br/>
<br/>
I do have fount a working program to edit/simulate the core. The programs runs fine, it makes use of .red scrips. I'm not sure if this is something like the "EMU386".

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A couple of alterations to my previous list.
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to fix the "386 opcodes" errors in Might And Magic 4+5. I set the soundblaster from the default of IRQ5 to IRQ7 and that fixed the "386 opcode" error. They both now work pretty much perfectly (the mouse is a little choppy).
<br/>
Also Sherlock Holmes is playable if you skip the intro.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also manged to test a few more games these past few days.

re EMU386: I've also tried to test it out but I'm not sure if its currently possible. It needs to be installed as a device driver in your config.sys file, but I couldn't find a way to do this for DSx86. I tried putting "DEVICE=C:\EMU\EMU386S.EXE" in my bat file but just got an "unknown command DEVICE" error.

<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday i saw in the "dos memory area" that there is a "unknown owner area" at 001010 - 04200F size, 41mb. I'm not sure if this could be  my "Supercard Lite slot2 card". Supercard Slot2(Not rumble) device have an 32MB "extended"memory.
<br/>
In DSLinux it reeds 34mb as extended memory (intern memory).

<br/>
If so, this good mean that "Warcraft 2" maby could work in the future, the speed of the memory dassent matter with this sort of games i believe.
<br/>
<br/>
About the EMU386, i don't think it could work using the "DEVICE=C:\EMU\EMU386S.EXE" even if this command is supported, from what i could see is, that the processor does not become recognized by this program. I do think with a little editing in the code or implementing it in the emulator it cold be working i believe. But i could be wrong. I'm still surging for other solutions, also what the solution colt be for EMU386.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that in dosbox it is pasable to set the core speed and to emulate the CPU recornization.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm using a Supercard lite for DSx86, also with dslinux for the "extra" ram. It dosen't matter with micro sd cart reader you use to boot a application from (R4 or sclt) to excess the "ram" beside the 2gig micro sd cart itself (no speed issues or slowdowns).

After comparing with dosbox, there's no background in EGA either so it's not a bug in dsx86. Sorry for the misinformation, please update the wiki accordingly.

So did you actually boot dsx86 from the Supercard? I'm asking because I have a M3lite (Slot 2), and dsx86 fails at fatInit(). There's also another guy having problems with a Max Media Dock and HBMenu, so I'm strongly suspecting there's something wrong with current devkitARM/libfat/slot 2.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I managed to compile a working libfat example from devkitPro r3497, so I'll just try to do a bisect.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think the mouse is working for windows yet (not 100% on this though), but in 0.12 it wasn't working due to the PS/2 mouse not being currently emulated.

Thanks for the info. It was clear to me after your first response, so thanks for the info. 
<br/>
Indeed, at my excitement i totally misplaced it when i posted it.

Yes i boot DSx86 from the Supercard lite with no problems or what so ever.
<br/>
Devkitpro supports slot 2 devices. You just have to "dldi patch" the DSx86.nds and your ready to go. I've never experiments that a program that was build with Devkitpro was not working on my supercard lite after dldi patching it. (i don't know why it don't work an your "M3lite (Slot 2)" card, i hope that you had something of the "dldi file" i posted, to make it work on your card).

Verry nice, also thanks for your testing!.
<br/>
<br/>
Tonight i have same time to do the testing with CTload, i think the best way to test it is to make use of the "UMBPCI.SYS"from the "umbpci", from the info, it should take less "memory" to emulate, if I'm not wrong.

    <h4>#174335 - Pate - Sun May 30, 2010 7:25 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">elhobbs: I believe the EMU386 is a program that attempts to support some 386 opcodes on a 286. It probably traps the "unsupported opcode" interrupt, which DSx86 does not generate (yet), so it most likely won't work on DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not have plans to support 32-bit registers, but I might add support for some 386 opcodes that are just enhancements over the 286 opcodes, like long conditional jumps. There are not that many games that would need these and still run on a 286, so this is not a high priority for me.
<br/>
<br/>
madd: There is no need to use UMBs on DSx86 (which is why I haven't coded support for that), as DSx86 already leaves 629KB of low memory free. All the device drivers are in "BIOS" so they don't take space from the RAM memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Thanks for the additional debug logs and test reports!
<br/>
<br/>
fanman93: Welcome to the forum! Windows 2.03 seems to need a PS/2 mouse, which DSx86 does not yet emulate. It's on my TODO list, so it should work eventually.

The id was indeed to "trap" the "unsupported opcode interrupt", i also thats that "386" needed a upper memory to function. It is indeed useless to use "UMB'S" or trying to add more memory. Thanks for "waking me up" ;)

Just an FYI Pate - I posted about DSx86 (was talking it up ;-)) on another forum and one of the people came back reporting that when you close the lid it freezes the game. Just tried it then using LSL and all seemed fine (at age prompt) but thought hang on better check another so did Ultima V and sure enough if you close the lid when you reopen it the game was frozen. Havn't had a good look at it but might be something to add to the To do List ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief - Sure that damn wiki pages just infected me with something (was cheking it to see if the games had allready been checked). Now keep getting some script error about some bloody chineese site redirect or something - any one else had issues? Gotta move it to a cleaner host I reckon.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the next release - whats the focus now? Seems the TPM implementation is the one that stands out (plenty of games incorrect screen positioning etc.)
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">midwinter: I haven't gotten much development done during this week, so the last blog post pretty much has the most up-to-date info. I did manage to find out what causes the problems in the Moonstone game, but haven't yet figured out a way to fix all of them.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't done anything special about the lid switch, but my understanding is that it might be wired to some power saving stuff in the hardware, so I'm not sure what to do about that. I'll look into it at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
Current focus is mostly just to fix the opcode issues, thanks for the extra log btw. The TPM issue is a difficult one, I tried to look at DOSBox for reference, but then I realized that it does not need to keep the hardware cursor in sync with the emulated cursor, as it only shows the emulated cursor. I think the problem is that a game can scale the coordinates it reads from the mouse driver however it wishes, and then draw a software mouse cursor, and I don't think DSx86 has any proper way of knowing where the game decides to put the cursor. So, as I haven't yet figured out a solution, the TPM issues will probably be the same in the next version. Perhaps your original idea about a simple touchpad area on the lower screen would be the best after all.
<br/>
<br/>
The opcode error in the log about Another World is not related to 386 opcodes, so it could perhaps run on a 286. It's that annoying INT 03 thing again...
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Thanks for working on the wiki, I believe an ad-free host would indeed be a better solution.

Hi Pate - No worries on the log - mean't to post it earlier but have been pretty busy. Bugger about the TPM mouse issue, thought it might have been an easy fix as most of the issues are related (offset - only extents etc.). Maybe an option could be some sort of calibration routine that way I guess you would know where the game is putting the cursor and then offset accordingly?? No idea - just thinking along the lines of lightgun type emulation in MAME etc.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Version 0.14 released!
<br/>
<br/>
This version has mostly minor fixes and improvements, no user interface (or touchpad mouse) changes yet.
<br/>
<br/>
olesolo: If Master of Magic needs more EMS than what DSx86 currently shows available, it won't run until I add support for some RAM expansion packs. I am currently very close to the 4MB memory limit of NDS, so increasing the EMS memory size is not possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I might actually have to make the EMS memory a bit smaller in the future, as DSx86 still misses various features that will need some more memory. Or, I could take the MCGA Direct mode away, as it currently takes 8KB of text segment, 4KB of data and 5KB of ITCM memory. That mode is not used by very many games that would not run nearly as well with the blitted mode. I'm actually keeping that memory as a reserve so I won't take it away until I absolutely need to. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, please send me debug logs again, and use the compatibility wiki for other info!

I don't see Privateer working for a while (or at all possibly). It uses a really specialized kind of memory handling (JEMM) that took a long time for even DOSBox to handle correctly. Plus I think it required a 386 back then. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/wing-commander-privateer/techinfo" target="_blank">[Mobygames - System Specs Source]</a>

I'm not sure how relevant this is but if you read the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.japheth.de/Jemm/README.html" target="_blank">"readme.txt"</a> on the site there is mention of Privateer and Strike Commander.

<br/>
midwinter: OK to post results here, but I think they will be more widely usable on the compatibility wiki. Too bad about the Bard's Tale, I had hoped it would run properly now. Fixing the current issue looks easy, however the problem in REVENGE in your log seems to be of the "executing data" type, so it will be more difficult to find and fix.
<br/>
<br/>
olesolo: Thanks for the log! The 386 opcodes in TIE and AESOP are of the kind that could be supported, so if the games don't really need 32-bit registers those might possibly work in the future. Privateer won't, though.
<br/>
<br/>
vandyk: Have you used the CD command to go the supaplex directory before launching the game? Sounds like supaplex.exe does not find the files it needs, and it tries to load the files from the current directory.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for testing again, keep the reports coming!

Did you get the saving to work?? Because I just get a "restore game failed" error. But other than that it seems to be running fine, if pretty slowly on anything but low detail (though I did get an "unsupported INT call error" when pressing shift, but that could be skipped).

That's weird, I managed to get it running fine??

From the testing I've done so far (currently about half of my games) there's plenty of progress in the games that had problems or weren't working at all.
<br/>
<br/>
The Catacomb Abyss, Armageddon and Apocalypse are now all working perfectly. Corporation, Crime Time, Goblins 2, Allan Border's Cricket, Crime City, Heimdall, Igor - Objective Uikokahonia, The Immortal, James Pond 2, Ken's Labyrinth, Lord Of The Rings : Fellowship of the Ring, Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes - The Case of Serrated Scalpel, Martian Memorandum, Stunt Car Racer, Populous, Nippon Safes, Mystic Towers and Out Of This World are also now all working.
<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy Whites Whirlwind Snooker, Laser Squad, Lord Of the Rings : The Two Towers, Moonstone, Speedball 2, A-Train, Batman Returns, Battlechess 4000, Gunship 2000 and Raiden have all improved over the previous release (but currently aren't quite playable).

Btw, I managed to fix the horizontal scrolling jerkiness in Supaplex and Crystal Caves, however fixing that made the scrolling in Commander Keen 4 very jerky. Argh! I hate it when fixing the behaviour of one game makes another game misbehave. Well, I guess I still need to think of another approach to this fix.

olesolo: Thanks for the log! The 386 opcodes in TIE and AESOP are of the kind that could be supported, so if the games don't really need 32-bit registers those might possibly work in the future. Privateer won't, though.

<br/>
vandyk: Have you used the CD command to go the supaplex directory before launching the game? Sounds like supaplex.exe does not find the files it needs, and it tries to load the files from the current directory.

midwinter: OK to post results here, but I think they will be more widely usable on the compatibility wiki. Too bad about the Bard's Tale, I had hoped it would run properly now. Fixing the current issue looks easy, however the problem in REVENGE in your log seems to be of the "executing data" type, so it will be more difficult to find and fix.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ha Master_Thief that's epic. I know how long it took to run through my paltry list so I can only imagine how long it would take for ~250. 
<br/>
<br/>
Great effort - I reckon you need to ask Pate do do you special test build. Somthing similar to a batch file so you set up your games list up and have DSx86 run first item on list, have a special key to dump memory properly (that virtual x dump/reset need work Pate - currently need to do a DS hard reset which is a bugger as DSx86 doesn't reset properly) and then it automatically runs second item etc. Would save a heap of time for testing. I know for me even using 4start.bat the fact that you need to hard reset the DS and then relaunch DSx86 menas it takes ages to work through.
<br/>
<br/>
And yeah - populous doesn't work for me. Could be the build however. Have to run via batchfile or vga switch after populous.exe etc. so might try another source when I get the time. Going to have to go through your list and see if there is any thing I fancy sourcing to play on the DS and thanks also drdim for those urls - will likewise have to go through those at some stage :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Hey vandyk - do I read that right - you finally got Suppaplex to work? I know the saves are an issue but you actually got it to run on the DS yeah?
<br/>
<br/>
Hey Pate - on the TPM whilst I reckon some sort of calibration could be an option however it does seem as if there are a couple of consistent behaviors (like the 0 offset top left corner increases as it moves away from that point and only being able to move around the extents) so might be some scope for workarounds maybe?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
drdim: Thanks for testing, and for the list of games. Should be very useful!
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Big thanks again for your herculean testing effort! Lots of interesting stuff in your log, mostly graphics opcodes which are easy to fix, but also a couple of weird issues and a few data execution problems. Will keep me busy for the next couple of days for sure. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: Yeah, I'm aware the soft reset does not fully reset the DSx86. The problem with this is that some of the internal data structures are in the PC-mapped memory area (F000 segment mostly), which can be overwritten by a badly behaving game (especially those "Packed file corrupt" games), which then can't be reset in any other way besides fully booting DSx86.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll work on the TPM issues at some point, but I'm currently more interested in fixing the "Not working" games on the compatibility wiki. I think you can live with the D-Pad mouse in the games that don't work properly with the TPM, but you can't work around the "Not working" issue. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I got the horizontal scrolling finally working properly. I finally figured out that I need to report the opposite "in VBlank"/"not in VBlank" bit to the PC program, as I actually blit the screen during the NDS VBlank time (which from the emulation point of view is the active screen scan time), and then do nothing with the PC emulated VRAM while the NDS screen scan is active, so I can report VBlank to the PC program during that time. Weird but works. :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No worries Pate - Actually in terms of regression testing your dev work to date hasn't really buggered anything. Maybe in terms of the compatibility wiki and testing for all the currently working games just leave the last known working version and then maybe just test the games that have problems? Would certainly be quicker and then if/when major work is undertaken could hit the relevant games (e.g. if you work on TPM then retest games that could use TPM).

regarding Dune "386 opcode":
<br/>
This is because of the "dune.bat", it says:
<br/>
<span style="color: green">@echo off
<br/>
logo
<br/>
duneprg ENG VGA EMS 386</span>
<br/>
It is just there to play the logo before startup. I changed the 386 into 286 and it all works fine. So it?s just a bad written .bat.
<br/>
The setup program of Dune creates a differently named .bat-file.
<br/>
The game seems to run fine since 0.13, but without sound for me. Tried all audio devices. It also doesn?t play sound on DOSBox. (Dune downloaded at abandonia, maybe it?s a no sound version)
<br/>
<br/>
@Pate
<br/>
Regarding sound -general question-
<br/>
I think I have somewhere read a comment from you about the "SB DSP" op-commands, and how your sound emulation works in general.
<br/>
But I can?t remember where that was...maybe if you could point me out to where it is written. The information could be included to a FAQ on the Compatibility List.
<br/>
<br/>
I got around the skippable "SB opcodes" opcodes in "The Island of Dr. Brain" (debug.log sent) and  "Ecoquest 2" (no debug.log sent) by making sure that the Soundblaster-device isn?t selected for both Music and for Audio/Speech on the game-setup menu
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding sound -Thunderboard detection-:
<br/>
Ecoquest 2 - the installation.exe of this game detects a Thunderboard device for the Audio section. It can be selected in the menu and the game runs fine (the same in DOSBox)
<br/>
The Island of Dr. Brain - installation.exe does not detect the Thunderboard device for Speech section. It can not be selected. (the same in DOSBox)
<br/>
<br/>
and...Well great progress, I like horizontal scrolling :-)
<br/>
<br/>
@drdim: these lists could also be very useful for a FAQ. I was looking for a thing like this on wikipedia with no luck.
<br/>

@midwinter: look at this page on the compatibility wiki for a preview version of the planned software sub-pages <a href="http://dsx86compatibility.pbworks.com/Xenon-2-Megablast" target="_blank">http://dsx86compatibility.pbworks.com/Xenon-2-Megablast</a>

@Dune2 (problems mentioned before in this thread)

I didn?t have problems with freezes or with overwriting savefiles in 0.13.

(although regarding the freeze issue, I only played for about three hours without a freeze) Maybe you should check if the Dune2 version is updated with the latest update, this could eventually help.

Just a bit of work for somebody to update. Hadn't even realised you guys had a discussion going on there so had a read and noticed you posted a question about graphical interfaces. I had a huge DOH! moment - never even thought to try something like that. Used Dos Navigator for DOSBOX on the PSP so thought I would try that and it actually works pretty good :-)
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/dn/" target="_blank">http://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/dn/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Download the 1.51 binary and dump it on the card and then run DN.  Gives and INT error (log below) but that can be "B" through.
<br/>
<br/>
When it first loads (provided the screen is zoomed to the Top Left which is the default at start) then just switch to the mouse and click into the left navigator pane (easiest to navigate via this pane). Then you can switch back and navigate with keys (easier) or just use the mouse. Actually works really good - just having a play then and could load and exit (back to DN) games really easily so could be a good tool maybe for testing.

Anyway folks check it out and let me know if it helps :-)

The 386 opcode on the logs really is a 386-specific opcode, so I was wondering how it is supposed to be running on a 286 with that. :-) I'm not sure what/where I have described to SB DSP stuff of DSx86... If it's not on my blog (or in this thread) I don't know where it might be. 
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding a FAQ, the most frequent questions I get asked are "When will DSx86 run 386 programs?" (Answer: Never), "The music plays very silently, can you fix that?" (Answer: Yes, I plan to fix this and other audio issues during my summer vacation), and "Will game X work in DSx86?" (Answer: Please test it yourself and report the results!).
<br/>
<br/>
madd: Thanks for testing, glad you find the debugger "E" command useful. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Yeah, I also noticed the graphics corruption problem in Heimdall. No idea yet what causes that.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, Supaplex should perhaps not be on the compatibility list with the "Perfect" status, as the scrolling is pretty bad and the bottom score panel does not stay put. Since it will work better in DSx86 0.15, it can't be perfect yet in 0.14. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I again downloaded new games to test, and managed to fix the .DSK file problem in Wizardry 1 (and probably other Wizardry games). That was caused by the game trying to open file "WIZ1    .DSK", and my file routines not removing the spaces from the file name.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Btw, if you need game screen copies on the compatibility wiki, you can use the DSx86 debugger for that. Just break into the debugger with the upper screen showing the image you want, and use the debugger "P" (for Printscreen) command (followed by "v" for Enter). That will write a SCR00.BMP file to the root of your SD card. It always writes to that same file, but if you feel it is worthwhile I'll add a proper counter to the file name for the next version. Oh, the BMP is upside down and 512x240 pixels, but you can flip and crop it with any image application.
<br/>
<br/>
That's what I use for the game screen copies on my blog.

The standard DS homebrew library contains a function to dump a specific VRAM bank into a screenshot, which can be written to the filesystem, effectively allowing a programmer to include screenshot functionality.  However, it can only be done with a single screen (the "main" screen, decided by the programmer), and it must be something the programmer manually supports in the program.  Hacking the screenshot ability into already compiled homebrew programs that don't support it would be very difficult, and I've never seen it done, so for those you would still need to use an emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

any comments on the SuperCard DSTWO (with onboard CPU/RAM) and the announced release of an official SDK? it would be nice to see a development fork to support the additional hardware. perhaps we could be playing 386.

I did not find info about the speed and type of the CPU, though, so it's hard to say how useful that would be. If it would happen to be faster than the current ARM9 (though I somehow doubt that), then it could perhaps be used for the 386 CPU core emulation, with ARM9 emulating the VGA features and ARM7 emulating the SoundBlaster. That really sounds intriguing. :-)

the dingoo cpu has already been over-clocked to 465 MHz by the person who ported dingux to the a330. many have already reported stable over-clocking of 433 MHz. it would be intesting to see how well the scds2 cpu over-clocks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Full Throttle, it requires an 80486DX whit an minimum ram of 8mb (according to mobygames).
<br/>
It runs fine/Greed on the NDS by using ScummVM Emulator with support of a slot 2 card with extra ram. When testing an my superCard-lite, there are no slowdown or what so ever (tested the uncompressed game files) also not in the video's and by using sound/speeds.

<br/>
<br/>
My summer vacation begins after next week! I have moved all the bigger issues forward so that I'll start working on them during my summer vacation, when I can focus on these properly. Can hardly wait. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Please update the wiki after you have tested this 0.15 version, and send me the debug logs again. Thanks!

Right now Pate is trying to get as many features that affect multiple programs. We can hope that he might be able to figure out your problem too.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your continual work on DSx86 :) and I'm glad that DOSBox has been of help since they (about 4 to 6 dedicated programmers) have worked long and hard on that program for many years. I helped out a tiny bit one year (still part of the beta team.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

drdim: I use a game called Doubolo for testing the 640x200 EGA mode, and it scales normally, from 640x200 to 256x192. What exactly do you mean by only getting 4:3 aspect ratio correction?
<br/>
<br/>
vandyk. I quickly looked into the Supaplex save problem, but couldn't find other options than to save onto a floppy, and as DSx86 does not yet support A: or B: drives I moved on to other issues. Does Supaplex have the option to save into C: drive?
<br/>
<br/>
phoenixclaws: Yes, I use DOSBox all the time to test and compare games I try to run in DSx86. My usual method of debugging the games is to first run them in DOSBox and checking with the VS debugger what DOSBox does with the game at the situation I am studying, and then running the same game in DSx86 with iDeaS, and using the iDeaS debugger to debug the DSx86 behaviour at this same situation. :-)

MrSkiz: If 3DS can be made to allow the running of homebrew software, it does sound like an interesting platform to develop an advanced version of DSx86 on. We shall see..

<br/>
Necrotek: Thanks for the info, it certainly was not obvious. I only test the games up to starting of the actual game (and I suck in playing games anyways), so it is very useful to know a game is playable all the way through.

Glad to see a lot of improvement, I'll need to check Castle Master and Bubble Bobble for what I broke in them in the new version.

GODS should work in the next version, I fixed the major graphics issues it had. There is still a problem with the zoom mode as I want to fix the weird graphics mode handling properly and not just for this game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First I would like to thank you Pate for an incredible emulator. Its very exciting to me and brings so much to the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this is nothing new...
<br/>
<br/>
I know that probably most people might just use Windows 2.02 as a graphical user interface but I found a very small File Manager/Menu that is freeware and really works well for navigating your folders and executing executable files. Additionally it offers other file management.  After version 0.15 Wolf File Manager began to work. 
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, as many probably already know, AUTOEXEC.BAT files work with DSx86 when they are placed in the root of the C:/ drive. So now Wolf File Manager starts when you run DSx86.nds. For convenience I put the edited AUTOEXEC.BAT and WFM.EXE in an archive so all you need do is extract it to the root of your flash card and when you run DSx86.nds WFM will start.
<br/>
<br/>
Download it here 
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?0wyj02qzko0" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/?0wyj02qzko0</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an after thought I added the AUTOEXEC.BAT for Windows 2.02 so if you have the Windows folder in the root of your C: drive just place the AUTOEXEC.BAT file found in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Windows202AutoStartUp</span> folder in the root also. It runs the VER 4 command automatically before running win.com. 
<br/>
<br/>
I found Wolf File Manager at DOS Museum, check it out  and the other great files such as ZZT which seems to work great in DSx86. Sorry you need to do the simple search in the corner because the direct links were to long. There are also a bunch of Ultima style RPGs that I haven't checked for compatibility.

Crookedmouth: Welcome to the forum! Good info about the file manager and menu options!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Here's an odd configuration file related issue, I noticed with Pushover.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Start game with push.exe
<br/>
<br/>
2. After configuration, frntend.exe is launched which shows title animation. dsx86 uses my defined frntend entry from the .ini file.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Games starts up. dsx86 claims frntend.exe is the current config but the emulator has switched back to the default configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried the same with DosBox and at point 3, DosBox was showing Push.exe as the current process and not frntend. Looks like the switch back to the parent process is not seen?
<br/>
<br/>
Two other things: Here's a log file from <a class="postlink" href="http://pastebin.com/AbshiceB" target="_blank">Cannnon Fodder</a> and could you make the tab key a bit wider as I keep getting a q instead of a tab keypress. :)
<br/>
<br/>

    <h4>#174582 - Pate - Mon Jun 28, 2010 8:30 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, thanks for the info about the config issue, it is certainly possible that return to parent process is not always detected properly. I'll look into this.
<br/>
<br/>
A few versions ago I increased the Tab key touch area leftward, so that you can aim for the left edge of the Tab button and it will register as a Tab key press. That should help you avoiding the 'q' button presses. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
The Cannon Fodder log looks like the game has jumped to F000:FFF0, which is the PC reboot address. I haven't yet coded support for that behaviour (as I'm not quite sure what would be the best way to handle a game requesting a reboot), but it is on my TODO list. This also happens in Wayne Gretzky Hockey and Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker if you answer the copy protection questions wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, btw, the new extended keyboard stuff as mentioned in my latest blog post might affect your dsx86config program. Just a heads-up in case you wish to add support to the extended keys.

<br/>
  ... do you plan to add support for <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covox_Speech_Thing" target="_blank">Covox</a>/Disney Sound Source? I guess it would be quite simple... just reserve an aligned 4 bytes buffer (actually a 32bit var somewhere) and impose to one of the DS audio channel to play it continuously, at high rate, the higher the better I guess.
<br/>
Then every time there's a byte sent to the parallel port, just multiply it by 0x01010101 and write it to that 32 bit var. This should do the trick :D
<br/>
<br/>
Two list of games supporting that printer-port-connected-DAC can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mobygames.com/attribute/sheet/attributeId,43/" target="_blank">here</a>,<a class="postlink" href="http://www.mobygames.com/attribute/sheet/attributeId,44/" target="_blank">here</a> and some also <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mobygames.com/attribute/sheet/attributeId,45/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting idea sverx! I did not realize a DS audio channel could play a 4-byte buffer in a loop, I thought it needed a minimum of 16 bytes (or was it words). Is there more info about that trick somewhere (how to initialize such a playing method)? I think that would solve the SB DSP command 1C problem as well, where the PC timer is used to handle timing and the SB DSP is sent one DAC byte at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and my own LineWars II game also supports Covox audio, so I don't have to go far to look for a test program. :-)

To play that, you just give SOUNDxSAD the buffer address, SOUNDxPNT should be 0 and SOUNDxLEN should be 1, then start replay with SOUNDxCNT = BIT(31)|BIT(27)|(64&lt;&lt;16)|127 ... which is SCHANNEL_ENABLE|SOUND_FORMAT_8BIT|SOUND_REPEAT|(64&lt;&lt;16)|SOUND_VOL(127)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: I forgot the freq. You can use libnds defines and use SOUND_FREQ(n) with n like 131072 (4 times 32KHz), IHMO.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I believe you should flush that part of the data cache after every write operation or it'll result in a lot of samples 'skipped'. Then, to have less delay possible in the sample reproduction, I'd use the higher frequency possible, but making sure that it doesn't slow down main memory access too much. I'd start with 23KHz x 4 for SB (it should be impossible to achieve more than 23KHz on a real SB using DSP command 1C, since it requires 2 writes -command&amp;data- for every sample) and I'd use 44KHz x 4 for DAC (I believe nobody's using more than 44KHz replay rate...)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps to improve, now I'm waiting to test it in the next release :)
<br/>
<br/>
(for the 1st parallel port the base I/O address should be written in BIOS at address 0x408. Usually the value there is 0x378)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: of course exadecimal is better ;)
<br/>
edit again: maybe you should avoid the caching and the flushing writing directly to the buffer uncached address, I guess it's faster.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The Cannon Fodder log looks like the game has jumped to F000:FFF0, which is the PC reboot address. I haven't yet coded support for that behaviour (as I'm not quite sure what would be the best way to handle a game requesting a reboot), but it is on my TODO list. This also happens in Wayne Gretzky Hockey and Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker if you answer the copy protection questions wrong.

The same files with DosBox seem to work OK - the game starts up and is playable so I'm not sure why it's trying to reboot.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I noticed the extended keyboard stuff. I'm guessing this is the default for entries and that you'd only want to turn it off for certain games. Not sure how to specify whether a particular entry in the config file needs non extended keys?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yesterday evening I tried "Pinball Dreams", I didn't see it was already on the list as "Not Working"... well, in fact it doesn't work, it freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
Turns out that in the directory there are a lot of SDR files, which are executable files (they have the 'MZ' well known signature) and I guess these are TSR that works as sound driver (even 'nosound' has one).
<br/>
<br/>
Pate, are you already supporting TSR?
<br/>
<br/>
I think this would be a perfect game to try sound routines, it has separate drivers for SB, SB2, SBPro and SB16, a driver for the PC speaker (which I believe it's using PWM) and a driver for Covox too.
<br/>
<br/>
PWM could be also achieved on dsx86 using a similar technique to which you're using now for SB direct sample... in this case I guess you just have to dynamically adjust the maximum value the program writes to the PIT (I guess you won't ever know that before...) so that it becomes 255 in your 8 bit buffer... or -even better- turn it into 65535 and you could use a 2x16bit sample buffer... well, this sounds good also for your SB direct sample and for DAC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">bob_fossil: Cannon Fodder probably detects something about the PC it does not like, so it wants to reboot. I'll try to look into that problem at some point. I have no ideas about how to select between extended/non-extended cursor keys in dsx86config, I'll leave that up to you. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
sverx: Yes, TSR programs are supported. I need to debug Pinball Dreams myself, but I'll probably test with other Covox programs first.
<br/>
<br/>
The PC Speaker PWM handling could indeed also use this trick of yours, I think the only problem is detecting when to use PWM and when normal PC Speaker sounds. I haven't yet looked into this to see whether it can be detected simply by the values/commands sent to the speaker ports.
<br/>
<br/>
The advantage with the 16-bit samples would be that I only need 2x sample rate instead of 4x rate, correct? I'll test this as well. The 8-bit direct DAC audio sounds pretty good already, but no harm in testing various options. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll look into using non-cached RAM address as well, so far I haven't had a need to make a distinction between cached and non-cached RAM, so I am pretty unfamiliar with this thing.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I just quadrupled the AdLib-emulation audio volume (so it is now as loud or even louder than the SB sounds) and am in the process of implementing the rhythm instruments. I also looked into the auto-init DMA for SoundBlaster, but haven't implemented that yet. In any case looks like the focus of the next DSx86 version are the audio features. :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pate: yes, using 16 bits samples the sample rate can be halved. Of course your 'original' 8 bit value should be multiplied by 0x01000100 to fill your 32 bit buffer correctly with two 16 bit samples.
<br/>
<br/>
For the PC speaker mode, check <a class="postlink" href="http://www.qzx.com/pc-gpe/speaker.txt" target="_blank">this document</a> taken from the GPE. In short, you can say how the speaker is working checking the 'mode' of the PIT and the value of the speaker port. If the speaker is connected to the PIT (bit 0 of port 0x61 set to 1, also bit 1 has to be set to 1 too) then it could be playing 'normal' square waves OR it could be playing PWM if the PIT mode is set to the so called <span style="font-style: italic">interrupt on terminal count</span>. Otherwise, if the speaker isn't connected to the PIT (bit 0 of port 0x61 set to 0) then the speaker could be playing -at 1 bit resolution- using bit 1 of that same port. (it's very noisy, but I did this in my games because I wasn't satisfied by the PWM very very low volume...)
<br/>
<br/>
About non-cached RAM: in this case you can write directly to memory avoiding to flush your cache and save time and cache contents too.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sverx, I just got your "Three" game playing music both with the DAC (Covox) setting and with Sound Blaster setting. The music has a bit more distortion than I think it should, but this same distortion happens in my LineWars II game using the Covox option, so it is not a problem in "Three". I'm not sure what the problem might be... I guess "Three" uses mod-style music with several samples mixed into the output, similar to what LineWars II does? Perhaps the SB and Covox hardware had some low-pass filters so that this distorion was not so apparent. Or perhaps we were not so critical about sound quality back then. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, it was a bit too time-consuming using your "Three" game to test the audio features, as many times I forgot what I was testing when I got so into the actual game. It is too addicting! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
The current status of the SB auto-init DMA support is that it works in situations where both the SB's DMA Block Size and the DMA controller's buffer length are divisible by 128. Weird things will happen if they are not.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll take a look at that Railroad Tycoon, I suspect it might use the EGA/VGA boolean operators, which I have noticed are broken in DSx86, due to my exotic graphics memory layout.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, lots of audio improvements are coming in the next version. :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's nice you found my old game worth a try ;) Thanks :) Yes, Three uses a very very <span style="font-weight: bold">very</span> simple mod-style system with 4 channel (mono/8 bits/not interpolated/not ramped) mixed together. In stereo "where available" (are you already supporting that too?). [Those were my first module playing routines ever...]
<br/>
The sample mixing rate is variable and depends on CPU speed (8000 to 44100 AFAIR) so I guess it's not going very high on DSx86... you can try switching off sound effects and see if the rate changes (well, you could actually see the exact rate trapping the SB DSP command...).
<br/>
The same with Covox (and PC speaker too), of course only MONO.
<br/>
In short... do not expect that to play perfectly ;) (my DAC didn't have any filter at all in it, I can assure you... on the other hand don't forget the DS audio resolution is 10bit/32KHz...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
This version has mostly audio-related improvements, so not a lot has improved in the compatibility front, sorry. I hope the next version will add more compatibility improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know of any new problems that have crept up, as this version has some internal architectural changes which might have broken something.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your interest in DSx86!
<br/>
<br/>
sverx: Only mono audio support in DSx86, as the stereo SoundBlasters would need stereo FM sounds as well, and the poor ARM7 can not cope with 36 sound operators that should be mixed at 32Khz speed.
<br/>
<br/>
bob_fossil: I removed the "Direct" screen output mode in this version, so that option can be removed from dsx86config as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, the weather forecast here predicts temperatures up to 30 degrees C for the whole of next week, and we don't have air conditioning here in the north, so I might not get all that much done in DSx86 next week. My brain does not work in such temperatures!

Golden Axe: Graphics are really nice, music plays well.  It's a little bit slow.

Carrier Command (one of my old favourites): Seems to work well with minor glitches.  The mouse pointer is not visible in any mode except CGA.  Mouse also not visible when using touch pad and CGA.  CGA+D-Pad is ok, but not very usable for a mouse orientated game.

I haven't had any problems yet with the last version of Norton Commander, 5.51, so far.

Btw, I tried some of the old Sierra CD games with DSx86 0.20 and now the digitized voices work but they are heavily distorted. You can make them out sometimes. The sound is like Joey from Beneath the Steel Sky distorted.

The digitized sound distortion/warble is a known problem, I believe it is caused by the screen update code.

If it does, then this is the cause. :-) I'll need to figure out some tricks to improve this, currently I have no good solutions in mind.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Grr, too bad DSx86 can't run Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers.. It requires support of the DOS/4GW (Dos Extender) with 32-bits... Which I doubt will ever be supported unless SCDSTWO releases their SDK. And then only maybe. Other games used DOS/4GW, notably Doom, Star Trek: A Final Unity, and a lot of others... Though yeh all this required at least a 386 or a 486 to play some of those.
<br/>
<br/>
See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra</a>'s_Creative_Interpreter
<br/>
<br/>
Everything before SCI2 should be runnable on DSx86 but some of the games have timer/trigger issues with it.
<br/>
<br/>
LB2(Laura Bow 2 Disk or CD) for instance. I tried playing it but after you try to hail a cab you don't get in it. You just stand there forever with the cab running. Also in the intro there is a part where some cloaked man puts a strangled mans body into a trunk but he stands there forever until the music is over and then he puts the body in the trunk. So something isn't working quite right.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Pate, 
<br/>
thanks for the new release, it?s great as always.
<br/>
I tested a couple of games and I am going to update them on the wiki soon. Here?s my log for v0.20: <a href="http://pastebin.com/trj62AAk" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/trj62AAk</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The debug.log includes Opcodes for:</span>
<br/>
Ugh!
<br/>
Warlords
<br/>
Murder in Space
<br/>
(Captain Blood) 
<br/>
(Visions of the Aftermath: Boomtown)
<br/>
Island of Dr. Brain, and other Sierra games (skippable codes when running setup)
<br/>
Troddlers
<br/>
Die Hard 2
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">and reports for:</span>
<br/>
Gods
<br/>
Battle Isle
<br/>
Dizzy Prince of Yofolk
<br/>
Dizzy Bubble
<br/>
Alien Breed
<br/>
Elf
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
some general questions:
<br/>
Does v0.20 also support the extended key for right shift? (for Elf-game)
<br/>
If there are any more keys supported than these mentioned in your previous blog entry, could you eventually also post these key-codes?
<br/>
<br/>
I?m regularily finding 000-Files in the root of my microSD, I think this is related to DSx86. They have a long numbers as names and are about 2 kb big (32 kb on microDS) 
<br/>
I always delete them, but I?m still a bit curious about how/when they are created (does anybody else have this?, I?m using cycloDS with b3 firmware)
<br/>
<br/>
@midwinter: thanks for the tip with the DOS Navigator (long time ago)
<br/>
It seemed to be interesting with the integrated text-editor, but there were a lot of opcodes.
<br/>
And to be honest. I dig your .bat file, now that I got used to it.  (I put sections in it like: "Play", "test" and "test with next version" with some big X-es and underlines etc. around it. It?s probably the fastest way to start a program without using up additional memory-space.
<br/>
<br/>
Happy playing/programming/testing to all.

<br/>
phoenixclaws: Looks like there are some issues with the PC timers still, I'll see if I can work something out. 
<br/>
<br/>
sePL80: Thanks for the logs and testing info! The opcode problems in Ugh! and Warlords are taken care of by the internal architecture change I am working on. Same with Alien Breed, but it also uncovered a new bug introduced in 0.20. The beginning of BIOS F000:0000 area gets overwritten by my SB Direct DAC initialization, and Alien Breed seems to have hit this problem. Sorry about that..
<br/>
<br/>
The other games I need to test myself to see what is wrong in them, except the Die Hard 2 problem which is quite interesting! It sends byte 43h to port 36h, which is not a recognized port. Immediately after this it setups new timer speed to port 40h, which suggest this is most likely a bug in the game, as sending value 36h to port 43h would actually be the command to prepare for a new timer value. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
The key code for right shift is 36 (hex), which is not an extended key code, so it will work also in versions prior to 0.20.  For a list of key codes, take a look here. DSx86 should now support all of those: <a href="http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/books/artofasm/Chapter_20/CH20-1.html" target="_blank">http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~lockwood/class/cs306/books/artofasm/Chapter_20/CH20-1.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The 000-files do sound like some sort of lost files, which points to a problem in libFAT. I don't use the absolutely latest version in DSx86, as I can't get iDeaS to run with it, for some reason.
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: Duke Nukem 2 works fine here, so I don't know what might be the problem.

They're something to do with the batch files. If you open them in notepad they contain the list of games in the first section of the batch file. Not sure when/why they're created though as after testing all my games there was just 7 created.

<br/>
<br/>
Looks like several games now freeze, that is somewhat surprising. I found out that the freezing problem in Castle Master is due to my swapping the vertical retrace bit in the VGA Display Status register. I haven't yet looked into it properly to see why that would cause a freeze, though. I'll try to look into several of those freezing games to see what is going on before releasing the next version.
<br/>
<br/>
The Sierra game problems are weird, as those opcodes are supported and that code has not changed between 0.15 and 0.20. I'll need to check that myself as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I just tested Catacomb Abyss, and for me it doesn't even load properly in 0.20. In my current 0.21 development version it runs fine, though. Start Trek - 25th Anniversary freezes similarly in 0.20, but again runs fine in my 0.21. Perhaps the problems are caused by the bug in 0.20 that overwrote the start of the F000 segment.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Pate - if the mission was to improve sound you certainly succeded. Finally got around to checking through my games list over the last few days and either hearing sound (or improved sound) was definatley noticed. Great stuff :)
<br/>
<br/>
Log file was here:- <a href="http://pastebin.com/HWxHHH22" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/HWxHHH22</a> however I reckon there are a few error entries that were not written to the log. For example Battle Tech II gave a port issue and then later a 386 opcode error (?? not idea why that one) however only the port error was in the log. There was also an INT error for Stunts (that can be B'd through however that also isn't in the log).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway in regards to the testing :)
<br/>
<br/>
BattleTech II - Still issues using the TPM (port and this time a 386 op code error) however I allso had a crash/gamefreeze whilst using the TPM.
<br/>
<br/>
Carrier Command - Same issues as before (mouse cursor and graphics)
<br/>
<br/>
Dangeon Master - Somthing has changed - now the copy protection screen error the text is blacked out and the screen/DS is locked
<br/>
<br/>
Eye Of the Beholder - This game is working great (TPM etc.) however I did notice that there seems to be a weird issue with the dpad keys. Basically the directions are not mapping correctly to (i.e N,S,E,W) to the Direction pressed (U,D,L and R). Didn't really get a chance to check however has anyone else noticed this? (could have been an issue previously).
<br/>
<br/>
Gunship - CGA is fine but EGA has a wierd ingame issue that you cannot target and use weapons.
<br/>
<br/>
Populous - I get an opcode error but others have reported fine. I still need to source and check another version
<br/>
<br/>
Rogue - Same issue with CHR being drawn on screen (Gold and potion CHR's are not displaying)
<br/>
<br/>
Sentinel - VGA graphics are all messed up so not working.
<br/>
<br/>
Disk Navigator - Now get OPcode errors and it isn't working
<br/>
<br/>
Ultima II - Now appears to be working fine whereas it wasn't
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmmmmm........thats about it from me. As I said the sound really stood out as improved (i.e actually working in many instances or music and sound effects now working etc.) so as that was the goal - well done, another great release :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the next version so keep up the good work.
<br/>
<br/>
Also just out of interest how feasible is some sort of memory dump and restore? Most EMU's include a save/restore state and I just wondered if that was even possible (does DOSbox have anything like this? I am assuming not due to the variable dump size etc. however I guess my thinking was DSx86 was working within confined restraints (mem size) so might be possible to write 4 Meg file etc.). Anyway was just wondering :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't coded DSx86 with a memory dump feature in mind, so it might be rather difficult to implement. Not impossible, but not quite straightforward, either. I'll add this to my TODO list, but no promises. :-)

    <h4>#174732 - Pate - Sun Jul 11, 2010 10:36 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the 386 opcodes themselves do not necessarily need access to the whole 4GB memory address space, so if a game would only use 386-opcodes in real mode that could be supported. However, most games that need 386 processor want to use DOS4GW or some other protected mode enhancement, so by adding only real-mode 386 opcodes only a few more games would work, and even those might run too slow to play properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, implementing a MMU emulation is not impossible, and as DOSBox already does that I would have a good reference, but again I think the resulting performance would be the biggest hindrance.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got enough things to do with 286 real mode support for a while, so I haven't even looked at 386 support all that closely.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Nintendo 3DS looks like a great platform for full 486 (or even Pentium) emulation, so hopefully it allows homebrew development eventually. Could be that it is fast enough to run a port of DOSBox, though, in which case there would be no need for a platform-optimized emulator.

Of course the U,D,L and R aren't mapping correctly, thats because in TPM mode the L and R are mapped to left and right mouse clicks so when I was using L and R the direction was simply picking up a movement IF the mouse cursor was over an ingame movement button.

Perhaps the most noteworthy change is that this version runs Windows 3.0. I also tried to fix many of the problems introduced in the 0.20 (and some in 0.15) versions, so this is mostly a bug fix version. I have also done quite a bit of internal refactoring, so this version is also somewhat slower than the previous versions. Sadly that can not be avoided until I get the whole refactoring done.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you haven't noticed, I also released the source code for my AdLib emulation last week, so feel free to use that in your own programming projects if you want.

Not sure when I'm going to get the rest tested though, unplugging the charger earlier this week, ripped out the centre bit of the <a class="postlink" href="http://i25.tinypic.com/1zf51xu.jpg" target="_blank">bloody slot</a>. So my DS currently has a flat battery and no way of recharging it :(
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT - One other thing I noticed, was that the screen scrolling wasn't working as it should in some games. In a couple of the games I tested, the cursor would go completely off the side of the screen before it would start scrolling the screen, in Willy Beamish the screen scrolled when the cursor only got half way across the screen and in Blood Wych the screen doesn't scroll at all.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://dsx86compatibility.pbworks.com/" target="_blank">DSx86 Compatibility List</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
phoenixclaws: I'll try to figure out something for the digitized voices, and I think I need to test that game myself to look into the timer issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Thanks for the quick test! My aim was to fix the games broken in recent versions, glad to hear I reached that goal. Sorry about your broken DS, hope you can figure something out. The poor thing probably got overworked by all your intensive testing of DSx86. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I was afraid the new D-Pad scrolling might not work properly in some games. The problem happens probably in games that use relative instead of absolute mouse coordinates, and draw their own mouse cursor. In this case the game can scale the mouse coordinates in whatever way it wishes, so the mouse does not need to match the coordinates DSx86 thinks the mouse is at. I need to improve on this handling, but I haven't yet figured out a way that would work in all situations.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you for your testing again!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Pate. Another interesting new release. 
<br/>
However I sank my Nintendo into a bathing lake 2 weeks ago...
<br/>
and right now I can?t afford a new one... I hope to be back with a bigger DS soon...maybe just in time for DSx86 v1.00? (or sooner I hope)
<br/>
If someone would is interested to further test the games that I have been testing, you?re welcome..
<br/>
<br/>
matster thief: 
<br/>
The only solution I can think of right now is a charger thats running with "induction?" energy. It?s a device with which you can load your mobile phone (or any other charged device) by just laying it on a "charger mat".
<br/>
So just look for "induction charger" on the net and you should be able to continue to play with your DS.

<br/>
<br/>
as mantioned by sePL80 a "solution" would be to use an induction charger... not sure they do it for the dsl through...
<br/>
other solutions would be:
<br/>
-solder a new port.
<br/>
-use an external battery charger.
<br/>
on this merchant: <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14429" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14429</a>
<br/>
you can find replacement port for DSi with "sku.42224" or for DSlite with "sku.15854". you can also find some external battery charger as for example "sku.25618" I've not seen a wireless charger on this site through...
<br/>
<br/>
obviously, replacing the port would be the best option, but it is not easy to do...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
edit: hum forget about induction charger, all the one I find for DSLite use a kind of clip on design and use the charger port...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry to hear that my two active testers have broken their DS! :-(
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Thanks for looking into testing with iDeaS, though I think it takes too much time to be worthwhile. Would you mind updating the compatibility wiki for the games you have managed to test? There does not seem to be all that many 0.21 version test reports there yet..
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to get the "Not Working" games (that at least partially work in the latest version) updated, in case people look at the list and decide not to try the game even if it would work fine in a newer version.
<br/>
<br/>
For DSx86 news, I just got the internal refactoring done, and it did make the emulation quite a bit slower, so now I am looking into optimizing the code again. I am also toying with the idea of attempting to emulate also the protected mode of a 286 processor. That would make DSx86 able to run Windows versions up to 3.11 in Standard mode, which should then run most of the 16-bit Windows software. I fear emulating a protected mode would really slow things down, though, so I'm not sure if it is worthwhile. On the other hand it would be very interesting for me to learn the internals of protected mode CPU behaviour...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, keep the current emulation method for real mode, and just use the slower one for protected xD
<br/>
<br/>
As for disk images - Windows 3.x (including WFW 3.1x) will install on a real DOS if you just throw all their files in a folder (say c:\winstall), and run setup from there.  You'll obviously need to take the files out of the disk images to do that (winimage, mtools, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
3.0 in particular is picky about what can and can't be running in 286 mode (less so 386 mode).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So onto the testing.
<br/>
<br/>
There's been improvements in a few more games. Along with some speed increases in a couple of games (Bubble Bobble, Lemmings and Oh No More Lemmings all now run much faster)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Heroes Of The Lance</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - No lomger has corrupt graphics
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Jimmy Whites Whirlwind Snooker</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Mouse now works perfectly
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Legend</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - The cursor is now visible
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Spellcasting 201</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - No longer has graphical glitches  
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Terminator</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - No longer has any grphical glitches, though is still a little slow
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Adventures of Robin Hood</span> - <span style="color: orange">Partially Working</span> - Now gets ingame, but gives an "unsupported opcode" error at random.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Veil Of Darkness</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - No longer has graphical corruption when leaving the house
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Worlds Of Legend - Son Of The Empire</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - The cursor is now visible</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Though there's been a few that have taken a step backwards.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Curse Of Enchantia</span> - <span style="color: red">Not Working</span> - Now freezes with a black screen after the intro. 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Darkseed</span> - <span style="color: red">Not Working</span> - Now freezes when it gets ingame
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Falcon 3</span> - <span style="color: red">Not Working</span> - Now freezes after selecting mission
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Gunship 2000</span> - <span style="color: red">Not Working</span> - Now says it needs a 286/386/486 processor.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Hired Guns</span> - <span style="color: orange">Partially Working</span> - Now gives an "unsupported opcode" when moving cursor ingame.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Igor - Objective Uikokahonia</span> - Partially Working  - Now gives randon opcode errors. Soundblaster gives "unsupported port I/O" error (can't be skipped)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ishar 2</span> - <span style="color: orange">Partially Working</span> - Graphics are now corrupt (pallette not correct) 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Lords Of Doom</span> - <span style="color: red">Not Working</span> - Now gives an  "unsupported opcode" error after title screen
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nomad</span> - <span style="color: orange">Partially Working</span> - Now has lots of graphical glitches  
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Transarctica</span> - <span style="color: orange">Partially Working</span> - Graphics are now corrupt (pallette not correct) </span>
<br/>
<br/>
Also there's seems to be a strange issue with Realms Of Arkania. Running it on my flashcard it always freezes with a blank screen on startup. However when I tested it using ideas the intro ran fine then gave an error about there not being enough room on the disk. So I tried it again on my flashcard and it still just gave a blank screen, I tested it on a different sdcard and downloaded a different version of it and it still wouldn't run on my flashcard but ran using ideas.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">usotsuki: Yeah, I don't plan to sacrifice the Real Mode emulation speed to support Protected Mode. The new internal architecture should support adding protected mode as a separate memory access technique, like RAM, EGA and Mode-X are currently.
<br/>
<br/>
another world: I'll see what I can do about making Win 3.00a working better in DSx86. The improved zoom mode and stylys accuracy are both on my TODO list, but I also have all sorts of cleanups remaining from the internal refactoring, so I'm not sure what I have time to do for the next version.
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: Yeah, you are right, I have been working on DSx86 for over a year now. Strange how time flies... :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Great to have you back on the testing team! :-) The games in the log file all seem to be executing data instead of code now, so I'll need to debug those myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I debugged Curse of Enchantia, and found a bug in my refactored CMPSW opcode. I fixed that and Enchantia stopped hanging, so at least that should run better in the next version. I have also reverted back to my original CPU type reporting, as I noticed that Windows is happy with a single protected mode opcode that it uses to distinguish between 286 and 386.

    <h4>#174909 - phoenixclaws - Sun Aug 01, 2010 8:29 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah I knew you'd have an update for us today :P.
<br/>
<br/>
Awesome to see the size of the program shrinking some more. Now it's smaller than the size it was at 0.02. Also all the various bug fixes for games are great.
<br/>
<br/>
One tiny bug I noticed (right off). I see there is a readout for Screen size in the middle box in the upper screen. Well if you put the lower screen into mouse/touchscreen mode (push select twice) then the screen size data (320x200 for instance) overrides the text that lets you know that you are in touchscreen mode. Nothing serious but rather obvious :p.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Pate - you are still too good - great to see another release :)
<br/>
<br/>
Missed the last one and by the time I was in a position to look at it I figured I might as well wait as you have been damn consistent with the updates. Just finished and all looks good. A couple of improvements in my games list now with only a couple left having issues. I didn't notice any difference in speed but then I haven't had a play with it for a couple of weeks so I others may be better placed to tell if there is any slowdown in some games.
<br/>
<br/>
BattelTech II gives unsupported OPcode when using the mouse still (however the graphical issues are now resolved) and I still get an OPcode error with Populous (although others have reported no issues - I have yet to source another version) and lastly Disk Navigator now gives a single INTerror that can be "B" through and looks to be working pretty good (testing booting into and out of a fair few games without issue).
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I did notice the mouse scroll when zoomed that I hadn't noticed it previously so that was a bit wierd (havn't changed default behaviour have you?) but no biggie (I thought I had it set - i.e default - to null). For the games I notice that Carrier Command is now all sorted so great stuff as well as the graphical issues with BTech II are likewise resolved. Couple of games still have persistent issues (the Gunship EGA one is wierd) but they are detailed in the game list.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Plenty more improvements again Pate, keep up the good work :-)
<br/>
<br/>
BAT 2(minus the intro and sound issues), Flashback and Formula One Grand Prix are the new games playable in this version and a handful of those broken in previous versions are now working again.
<br/>
<br/>
Raidens graphical glitches are now fixed (which did indeed fix Alien Breeds too), Allan Border no longer freezes, Nomads graphical glitches seem to have been fixed too minus a minor one during the intro, the cursor is now visible in Killing Clouds so is now playable and Plan 9 now gives one of those new fangled "mode-x opcode" errors which can be skipped but is in theory now playable.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Allan Border's Cricket</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works Perfectly 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">B.A.T 2</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Playable, though the intro isn't working properly and the sound isn't working at all.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Curse Of Enchantia</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Darkseed</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly  
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Falcon 3</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly, though is pretty slow ingame. Choosing config on title screen freezes game though.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Flashback</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Formula 1 Grand Prix</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly, though is pretty slow
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Gunship 2000</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly, though is pretty slow

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Killing Clouds</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nomad</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly, some minor graphical glitches though
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Plan 9 From Outer Space</span> - Partially Working - Gets ingame, but gives "unsupported mode-x opcode" errors at random (though these can be skipped)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Raiden</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly, though has lots of slowdown
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Realms Of Arkania</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works if you run bladem.exe though is a little slow. The intro doesn't work though (running blade.bat) it just freezes with a black screen(no error given).
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Transarctica</span> - <span style="color: green">Playable</span> - Works perfectly</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Though there's been some that have taken a step backwards (or have stayed the same just now have different errors).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Colonization</span> - <span style="color: red">Not Working</span> - Now gives an "unsupported opcode" where it used to give an "out of conventional memory" error
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Guy Spy</span> - <span style="color: orange">Partially Working</span> - Now gets in-game but gives an "unsupported EGA opcode" when entering game in both EGA and VGA modes. CGA seems to be running fine.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Hexx - Heresy of The Wizard </span>- <span style="color: orange">Partially Working</span> - Now gives an "unsupported INT call" error when entering game
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Race Drivin</span> - <span style="color: red">Not Working</span> - Freezes with blank screen after selecting your options 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Space Hulk</span> - <span style="color: red">Not Working</span> - Now gives an "error in midi driver" error.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ultimate Soccer Manager</span> - <span style="color: orange">Partially Working</span> - The game works, but freezes at random</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to take a closer look at Battle Chess 4000, Sleepwalker and Wizardry 6 though as my versions still don't work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for all your testing again! I've been busy with work-related stuff for the past few days, haven't been able to work on DSx86 at all since the end of my summer vacation yet. :-(
<br/>
<br/>
phoenixclaws: Ah, I forgot to hide the new resolution display in the touchapd mouse mode! Well, luckily that is just a minor cosmetic glitch.
<br/>
<br/>
midwinter: Thanks for the log and info! Yeah, I added screen scroll to the D-Pad mouse handling (mainly for Windows) in 0.21, I think.
<br/>
<br/>
aero7707: Thanks for the info!
<br/>
<br/>
Master_Thief: Thanks for your testing again! Good to hear I managed to improve some games. I downloaded my versions of Battle Chess 4000, Sleepwalker and Wizardry 6 from Abandonia, and just tried to run them (mostly without configuring them first). I didn't test them thoroughly, but was able to move the cursor or get ingame in all of them, so I wasn't sure what else to test. :-)

Not a lot of changes in this version, as I have been busy with other stuff. I tried to fix some problems introduced in 0.22, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, could some of you testers look into the "Not Working" games on the compatibility wiki that have last been tested with 0.13 or 0.14 versions? It would be nice to get the status of those updated to reflect the latest versions of DSx86. Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sata: Welcome to the forum! The horizontal jittering in the older Commander Keen games is probably due to their using yet another method to sync to the vertical retrace signal (or possibly they don't sync at all!). It was rather difficult to get the vertical sync to work even as well as it does currently, so I am not sure if I can still fix it further to work also for the older CK games. I'll take a look at this after I have got DS2x86 running.
<br/>
<br/>
jam_888: I am not sure I understand what you mean, what direct keyboard input you mean? Perhaps you mean the proper stdin/stdout handling that is still missing? This is on my TODO list, but currently I am more interested in getting DS2x86 running so far that I can see if and how much speedup it will give compared to the plain DSx86.

I'll take a look at this after I have got DS2x86 running.e</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Do you plan on adding 16bit protected mode for the DSi?

Standard mode Windows opens up a tonne of cool apps and games. (especially a few favorites like Warpath and Oil Baron)

<br/>
<br/>
This version is built with the latest libnds so that it can run in DSi mode (with the proper hardware). No other changes yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Lazy1: Thanks for the compliments! A great idea about adding 16-bit protected mode features! I have been wondering how best to take advantage of the DSi mode, as adding 386-opcodes would be a lot of work and the resulting speed would still be very disappointing. Adding 16-bit protected mode opcodes (and thus emulating a proper 80286 processor) is a much better idea, as a 80286 processor can access only 16MB of memory and the protected mode features should be reasonably simple to add (now that I have already done that for DS2x86).
<br/>
<br/>
The packet driver would be interesting, but the problem is that I had to remove the WiFi code from the ARM7 side in order to fit my AdLib emulation there. I might attempt to make them both fit at the same time, but I don't consider that a very high priority.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the protected mode idea, I think I'll attempt to do exactly that! :-)

Does it work with other cards? Does the latest hbmenu(compiled with latest libnds for DSi sdmmc) work? If not, we may need to tweak the sdmmc delay in libnds to fix that.

<br/>
There was a change in sdmmc delay in SVN after the libnds release, some cards(like one of my cards) may only work with SVN not the recent libnds release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would this be a DSi only feature?

Or would us cheapos with a lite be able to use the 16bit protected mode version?

The emulation itself takes about a megabyte, then there is the megabyte of normal DOS RAM, so there can only be less than 2 megabytes of extended RAM on DS Lite. On DSi I think I can add something like 12MB of extended RAM, which should be enough for many Windows applications.

yellowstar, Sir_Voe: I wasn't aware of a "sudokuhack", and still don't quite know what it means. Also, looks like the libnds was updated several times last week (which I missed), so in fact DSx86 0.24 is not built with the latest version that works with the sudoku hack. I don't know how I could test whether it would work even when built with the current libnds, I can only test with the CycloDS iEvolution, sorry.

mmm... would that mean also having XMS on DSx86? (I really don't know if there was XMS [or EMS] on 286, I skipped that processor completely...)

I added some preliminary Smooth scaling support, so far only in CGA and MCGA modes. Also, this version is again built with the latest (Feb 14th) libnds, so it now might actually run with the so-called "sudoku hack" in DSi mode.

@Lazy1: I just tested Oil Baron on the latest DSx86 build (which has the Win 3.0 Standard Mode support) and it seems to work. Starts up at least.. And it does not need DSi mode, it will run on DS Lite as well.
<br/>
<br/>
@sverx: I added built-in HIMEM.SYS support for XMS memory handling into DSx86. Looks like in "DS Lite" mode there will be about 570KB of XMS memory available (and 1.5MB of EMS). I could enhance the memory system so that the 2MB memory area could be provided as EMS or XMS depending on the game/software, but that will be for later.
<br/>
<br/>
@noggingthenog: I don't have a way of testing the DS memory expansion pack support, so I'd rather support DSi mode in situations where extra memory is needed.
<br/>
<br/>
@reveur81: Looks like you sent me an email about this problem as well? I replied to your email and attached the 0.21 version. It looks like the game does not realize it is running on a 286 machine, so there might be something wrong in my implementation of whatever method the game uses to determine the CPU type. I have had to change some of such code for Windows 3.0 Standard Mode, so the situation might be different in the next version again.

Wonderful :) Can I suggest to place a slider on the lower screen to change XMS/EMS memory size? So that if you need XMS only you just slide completely -say- on the left and you'll have the whole 2MB available for XMS... many games/programs usually need a given amount of either one or the other, not both...
<br/>
<br/>
[edit: Dune II incidentally requires 2MB (total? or they mean XMS?), according to what's written on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.abandonia.com/en/boxshot/24317" target="_blank">the box</a> ;) ;) ]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Version 0.30 released!
<br/>
<br/>
I actually released this last Sunday, but the forum has been down since.
<br/>
<br/>
The new version 0.30 implements 286 protected mode features, so you can run Windows 3.00a in Standard Mode! It works in DS Lite and DSi mode, but you will have much more memory available in DSi mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to test which 16-bit Windows programs you can get running, and let me know of the problems you encounter.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sverx: Yeah, I plan to add something like that. I think my problem with that is that I think the setting should be game-specific for maximum configurability, but since 4DOS already takes some EMS it is difficult to change the amount of EMS/XMS after some EMS is already in use. But I'll see what I can do.

Btw, DSx86 version 0.31 has been released a while ago. Sorry for being away for a while, but my work place has recently started blocking some sites, including this one (silly workplace, if you ask me). I can only access this site from home, and when at home I usually prefer coding over visiting forums. :-)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Setting DSx86 EMS to the minimum (256KB) leaves DuneII enough XMS memory to run with digitized sound effects even on my DS lite, even if you really need to select 'Soundblaster' (and <span style="font-weight: bold">not </span>'Soundblaster Pro') from the game setup to achieve it... I suspect it's because it would try to store stereo samples otherwise, and this would require more memory. Sound score volume (OPL generated music) anyway is quite high compared to the digitized samples, I believe it's because of the amplification you applied in your adlib emulator. Another INI switch to disable that would be perfect ;)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW I'm experencing problems with the game, and it was working until some DSx86 versions ago. When you move an unit it just disappear from the game. I'm not sure if it's a bug in your emulator or something went wrong with my DuneII, but it remains even if I don't use any XMS/sounds/effects. I'll try to run some other tests as soon as possible.

The problem with Dune II is probably in DSx86, and it would be a big help for me if you were able to determine in which version the problem began. You can download most of the old versions from my pages, just try for DSx86XXX.nds, where XXX=version number, like 031 (as in <a href="http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/DSx86031.nds" target="_blank">http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com/DSx86031.nds</a>).

Anyway, I've been playing a bit of DSx86 lately, and maybe this has been reported already, but the PC speaker audio in Ultima IV doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't get PC speaker or SoundBlaster audio to work in Wizardry VI either. PC speaker just makes squealy noises (not surprised it doesn't work, the PC speaker audio in that game and VII is quite impressive), and SB mode doesn't do much of anything, except make small click noises. The graphics seem to be working fine now, though. I had tried the game a while ago in a previous version, and it didn't work very well.

The PC Speaker emulation in DSx86 does not support the digitized audio trickery used in some games, and also the SB Direct DAC support is rather poor. Perhaps these cause the problems in those games.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean the Smooth mode causes problems specifically in Wizardry VI, or in general if you have configured a game in DSx86.ini to use Smooth scaling? I'm not sure I understand correctly what you mean..

Do you have a link to that thread? I was looking around a bit, but I saw the link to this thread in the readme file, and figured that was a good place to start.

<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I figured that much.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why the audio doesn't work in Ultima IV, though. I'm just using the regular default version of the game (no 256 color graphics or anything like that), and it doesn't sound like it's using any sorts of trickery in DOS or DOSBox.
<br/>
<br/>
Though I am using the GoG version of the game. I have another version that came on a magazine demo disc, I could try that and see if there's any difference.

<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I didn't word that very well. Just in general.
<br/>
<br/>
Say I have the U4 config set to be smooth, I switch to U4 in-game, and the screen goes all screwy. I have to switch through the options until I get back to smooth to fix it.
<br/>
<br/>
So I just set all the defaults to jitter, so I only have to tap the option once to get back to smooth.
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, to anyone who's interested, I've found a pretty decent little text editor that works in DSx86: <a href="http://www.gdsoft.com/shareware/ne300b.zip" target="_blank">http://www.gdsoft.com/shareware/ne300b.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
All of the other Borland Turbo Vision based editors work too, and a couple other ones, but too bad I couldn't find one that ran in 320x200 (though I can understand why).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even though the Homebrew Bounty is over, I have been using those threads to post info about update versions.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I guess I'll need to check the Smooth default in ini file, I don't think I have actually tested that ever! It probably skips the 16-bit color setting when using the ini file, and thus the screen gets corrupt. Should be an easy fix, thanks for letting me know!

<br/>
<br/>
I also need to work on the text mode proportional font system, so I guess I should again take a few days to work on DSx86 instead of DS2x86. I'll try to find this Smooth mode problem as well.

They don't glitch up like Smooth does, but they don't switch away from Zoom mode, either. So I just set it to Jitter, and then I only have to tap the vid mode once after switching to my config. I'm running on an original "fat" DS, if that makes any difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Would be nice if the vid/config didn't go back to default every time a new program launches. I like having the defaults for the command prompt, but some games switch between different EXEs (or COMs) as they're running.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This version has the following fixes and improvements:
<br/>
- Fixed a couple of bugs in the proportional font 80x25 Smooth scaling.

Hopefully this version fixed the mode change problems for you, Asaki. I did not change the config going to defaults when the exe changes, as I fear that will cause problems, especially for new users.

Maybe you could help me out some more. I am now trying to run Little Big Adventure, which isn't listed on the compatibility list.

It's a game from 1994, which can run in DOS.

The video card is set on "Don't know", and the sound card on "No sound", "No music".
<br/>
The game starts, but the screen is completely black, except a small line at the top which displays a scrambled image. I recognize the menu, but as soon as I press a button, (either on the DS or the keyboard), the game freezes.

With VESA compatible, it starts, but as soon as I push a button, the game freezes, but not the emulator, I can still tap on the keyboard...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSx86 emulates CGA,  EGA, MCGA and VGA. It emulates a SoundBlaster 2.0 or lower (and upper, to some extent... BTW mono, AFAIR)
<br/>
Should work with any SB address/IRQ/DMA but if it isn't so, try 0x240/5/1.
<br/>
Where can I read the system requirements for this game?

<br/>
edit: found them in Wikipedia. It says

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It starts only if I set it on "no sound" and "no music". But it freezes as soon as I press a button...
<br/>
What's frustrating is that when I stay on the menu long enough, it shows actual scenes from the game, they are a bit slow, but else perfect ! Why can't I press any damn button ? I'm going to ask at an LBA forum if anyone has encountered that kind of problem while emulating it on PC.

If we also can get mplayer running on the 286 then we can play Youtube and Dailymotion video on the nds :) Required tools can also be found on the same provided url ^^.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://imetal.nl/" target="_blank">Website / Blog</a>

<br/>
In the hopes that people don't flame me too much I'd like to start by saying that I googled about this a lot and read through everything related to DSx86 which I could grasp uppon.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a code I could map to a DS button to switch back and forth from TPM mode while in Smooth screen mode?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
