    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a (small) step in network security tools for DS :
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a port of ptw attack against WEP, this attack seems to be the least ressource/time consuming. More details about how it works <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cdc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/aircrack-ptw/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
I've only used the source provided by the windows port, and parts from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/" target="_blank">aircrack-ng</a> (because there's no "libpcapDS" for parsing capture files).
<br/>
You might want to try it with the sample file provided by by aircrack-ng in their <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aircrack-ng&amp;s=ptw%20cap#sample_files_to_try" target="_blank">wiki</a>.Or please use it with your owns caps (remember : only ARP packets with this attack) and tell me if it worked, and how long it takes for which key length. (sometimes it's very very fast, or it may takes 1 minute,...up to seven once for me, or it may just not find the key).
<br/>
<br/>
Just launch aircrackDS.nds (after the DLDI patching) and do have a capture file named /ptw.cap
<br/>
<br/>
Waiting for your feedback ! (and hoping i'll find a way to implement the dump and play part...i've seen that jsr has already worked on this !)
<br/>

I've never used the aircrack program before, so am I right in assuming that this tool just parses the capture file to find the WEP key?  I would need to use an external tool to actually get a capture file for my own home network, correct?

yes, you're absolutely right. The amount of ressources needed by older methods prevented a port to ds. Now we can say that it's "tryable" (this word exists ?), while i think i've just begun the easiest part of the project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For my part, I already port Aireplay (part of Aircrack suite) a while ago but i kept it internal (unless one version that i made public) because of 2mbit limit (for capturing).

But keep the  good work, it's very interesting and you learn a lot about Wifi Encryption.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice app.
<br/>
<br/>
However, i need to know how to create the ptw.cap file. I have 2 other apps that do packet cpature for the ds ("myfirst.nds" &amp; "wifi_lib_test.nds") but neither of these will create a file - they just show the captured frames on screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I know wifi_lib_test.nds is version 0.3a and was written by "stephen stair" and i don't know anything about the other one, but i think it is now called blue-something. Sorry i can't give more info on the other programs.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of another DS app to create these files or should i wait for the author of this whizzy new app to add one?

Now i seem to receive all packets if my access point is configured to not use security.

But once i enable WEP on my AP, i only capture beacons again.
<br/>
<br/>
So I think it may be the "DS hardware WEP engine" that prevents the lib from getting the "raw no decryptable by hardware" packets.

Well, the data of packets that are just having a wrong CRC (because of falsely decrypting) should be still be placed in the mac memory. Only the events that indicate the receive (circ-buffer-pointer moves, rx irq) are not triggered.
<br/>
<br/>
The irq can be replaced by the rx stat increase irq, which seem to count thrown away frames too, and the location can be calculated.
<br/>
<br/>
However, you might get a falsely decrypted packet instead of the raw, as the HW is trying to decrypt it (but fails the CRC check). Since you know the falsely assumed key, you should be able to retrieve the original raw frame.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Credits of the idea to receive of CRC-corrupt packets in such a way go to Martin from nocash)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This program doesn't capture packets.  You have to use a program on a PC/Mac/PDA to capture the packets and create the ptw.cap file and of course you could just crack it on that same machine, copying the file to DS would not be practical.  This is just proof that the DS is capable of cracking WEP.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You cannot capture packets on the DS.  You must create the ftw.cap file using something else like a laptop, then transfer it to your card to let your DS decode it.  This is mostly a demo and isn't very useful due to this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmm,i dont rlly understand what ya saying(kinda n00b in this),but im using r4ds and i got a ptw.cap txt file(looks like it but called c-file)and a ptw.cap,aricrack ds now says:
<br/>
parsing cap file...
<br/>
recovering WEP KEY...
<br/>
but nothing happens,and when i drag both ptw.cap files into the aircrack thing called wzcook(icon) it just says ssid/wep key and than it says that its stored in c:/ wepkey or something but the txt just says ssid and wep key but doesnt give numbers(i know ssid but i need wepkey)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry to bring back an old topic, but has there been any progress with this? Also so this "blueDS" app is open source as well. I've been trying to google this, but what exactly is "ptw.cap" is the sniffing that is done by blueDS actually the same stuff that goes into the cap file? Or is does an application process parts of this before it saves the file? If not, then is it posable to merge both of them together? Also if it isn't why can't the DS save it? I need to recover my old router password because it won't reset from some reasson, so I'm more then happy to leave it on all night, or longer... Also it would be mighty convenient when I'm on the road ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
