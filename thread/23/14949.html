    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just finished a little tech-demo, and i thought i'd share it here. Its name is "Ragdoll-demo", and as you can guess, is about ragdoll physics. One of the reasons i did this was that i wanted to use the nds motion pak i purchased ;) Anoher reason was that i wanted to get a better feeling on how this kind of physics was working.

This may be a silly  suggestion, but how about a "dont clean screen" option, so the ragdoll makes a trail as it falls?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@jay001 : nothing for now, but i have one idea on my mind. Which includes ragdoll ;)

@Darkflame : thing is, with the video fresh rate, it's filling the screen with white lines, you see what i mean ? you don't see movement, you only see the screen turn white as the tobject moves<br/>_________________<br/>NDS Lite Gold/Silver, MK5/R4DS, MSI PC54G2, D-Link DI-624</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are using framebuffer mode, then you can make "trails" by lowering the R, G, and B component of every pixel by 1 every frame.  That is how I made the trails in the pixelbounce demo on ndsmotion.com.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
