    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I got tired of scrolling through a flat text file to see if I had a particular game before buying it at a swap meet.  A few weeks ago I buckled down and threw together a program that can load SQL dumps and display them on the DS.  Included is the ability to load multiple tables and filter down based on the text of one or more columns.  Since everything visual is gathered from the database it should be compatible with just about any SQL dump you throw at it.
<br/>
<br/>
Should support:
<br/>
 - CREATE, INSERT instructions
<br/>
 - As many entries or strings until memory runs out
<br/>
 - SQL style character escapes ('' not \')
<br/>
<br/>
Known issues:
<br/>
 - No scrolling for more than 9 tables in a database.
<br/>
 - Only handles "text" (should handle integers but I never tested it).
<br/>
 - Hacky UI.
<br/>
 - No support for multiple databases.
<br/>
 - "Contains" option is not implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
Possible additions or updates:
<br/>
 - Contains, group select, greater/less than support
<br/>
 - Better string handling to take less memory and run faster
<br/>
 - <span style="font-style: italic">Your idea here!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
To use this, DLDI patch with your particular card driver.  Create a directory named database at the root (can be hidden if you want).  Every file inside /database/ will be loaded and treated as a SQL table dump.
<br/>
<br/>
The file itself is available <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dragonminded.com/ndsdev/SQLDisplay.nds" target="_blank">here</a>.  If there is sufficient interest in this application I might add more features as listed above.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could have done with a few years back when I was collecting Perplexcity Cards (think trading cards, but with pretty nifty puzzles on them).
<br/>
I was always forgetting which ones I had...this would have be usefull.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I might try this out later with an SQL dump from my review website.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
