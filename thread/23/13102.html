    <h4>#127139 - nornagon - Mon Apr 30, 2007 9:41 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's been a while, but I've been quietly hacking away at World of Sand for the past few months in my (abundant...) spare time. Anyhow, it doesn't really feel very beta any more, so 0.1 it is!
<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who like to download stuff and check it out before reading the changelogs (it's just like Christmas!), <a class="postlink" href="http://2-2-dihexanol.net/worldofsand-0.1.nds" target="_blank">the download</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't really keep a sane changelog, since version control only came in halfway through my hackage, so I'll try to come up with a sort of vaguely complete list off the top of my head.
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Speed. Speed, speed, speed -- WoS now utilises both the arm7 and the arm9 in its schemings^Wcalculations, so the peak fps is somewhere around 21fps instead of 10.
<br/>
</li><li>New materials: Spout, Snow, Liquid fire, Concrete, Acid and Antimatter, plus several new reactions (those you'll have to discover for yourself :))
<br/>
</li><li>You can now draw lines of varying thickness.
<br/>
</li><li>You can toggle the flows on and off.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
I guess that's about all the interesting stuff. I should really get around to posting the source code somewhere. It's horribly, disgustingly ugly, but there's some sneaky stuff done with FIFO and shared iwram that could very well be useful to someone.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, this game is incredible!  I must say I wasn't expecting much, but this is very good.  The menu is very professional looking and well layed out.  My one question is what does it do when you hold L and tap the screen?  It doesn't seem to do anything for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#127690 - Sweater Fish Deluxe - Fri May 04, 2007 1:50 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Holding L and tapping the screen will turn off a flow of sand, but you have to tap specifically at the point where the flow is appearing at the top of the screen.  If your touchscreen is poorly calibrated as many seem to be, you'll have to tap somewhat to the left or right of where the flow actually appears.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if a description of the currently highlighted element would show on the top screen.  Some of them are obvious, but I have no idea what many of othem are supposed to be.  I sitll enjoy watching the reactions, but they'd be more interesting if I understood what they meant. split up the menu based on the drawing characteristics (i.e. which ones draw as particles versus which ones draw as solid lines).
<br/>
<br/>
For the time being, could someone just tell me here what each element is?
<br/>
<br/>
I especially like the fact that if put a solid object in the path of the steam, it will re-condense into water.  Lovely.

    <h4>#159712 - another world - Fri Jul 04, 2008 10:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry all for bumping an old post but i wanted to make nornagon aware that lots of people are still very intrigued with this game. from a coding standpoint you did some great things here, the way the collision detection functions and the interactivity right down to a single grain of sand is amazing and top notch. 
<br/>
<br/>
there is so much more room on the interface for more elements, and *tools* that we could play with please consider updating and adding to your project -=).
<br/>
<br/>
i do have some quick suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
-provide left and right handed controls 
<br/>
-allow the user to use 'L' or 'R' to switch the different pen sizes. you could leave on the 'top of the screen tapping' for turning off the sand without holding the shoulder button. as it is you have to tap right up at the top, an area that isn't played with normally. 
<br/>
-allowing perhaps the shoulder buttons to switch the top screen with the button and providing the ability to select tools (etc) with the stylus.
<br/>
-a bit of repetative elevator style music would be another great addition.
<br/>
<br/>
cheers,
