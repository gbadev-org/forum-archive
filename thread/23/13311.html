<br/>
<br/>
Basically its a dump of my subversion tree that should allow you to compile Dungeon Crawl and glkpogo for both PC and NDS. Hopefully it shouldn't be too hard to fix it so that libpogo (which both crawl and glkpogo uses) uses devkitarm r20 and DLDI for instance.
<br/>
<br/>
There's some documentation in the archive, check trunk/README first.

So anyway, what all exactly does it take to give any open source homebrew project DLDI support?  I'm just curious.

Is it something that takes months to program or is it something that is simple enough to do in a matter of an hour?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's funny, I started to look at it yesterday. The FAT part should be fine now (yeah it was about an hour matter), but other libs have evolved since then. I did small fixes and got tons of warnings for other parts, that I'm ignoring for now (maybe it's just some dirty tricks...or everything will explode).
<br/>
I'm trying to build Crawl first, but it needs various fix as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm very lucky if everything works without requiring to look deeper, which can take a long time. 
<br/>
When I'll have something working, I'll release it with the sources.
<br/>
<br/>
Why does it take weeks to work a few hours: I don't often use my NDS when I'm not traveling, so I'm less likely to be motivated to do something related to NDS (and I'm lazy anyway).
<br/>
Though, I'd like to have Crawl with DLDI support, so I'm doing it, but slowly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most parts of the keyboard panel code in crawl are commented, I don't understand why. I ended up using libpogo keyboard with crawl panel displayed on the top of it (just for having a pretty one).
<br/>
I'll clean up and comment my modifications, then do a release in the next days, I guess, at least for libpogo and crawl.

    <h4>#133368 - DragonMinded - Thu Jul 05, 2007 8:33 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Putting DLDI support into an app is easy cheese.  It's the same as compiling in a hardcoded driver for the old gba_nds_fat.  DSOrganize uses gba_nds_fat and still has dldi support.  Have a look at my fat library: <a href="http://www.dragonminded.com/ndsdev/libfatdragon%20src.zip" target="_blank">http://www.dragonminded.com/ndsdev/libfatdragon%20src.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a drop-in solution for those already compiling gba_nds_fat as it uses the same interfaces, but includes DLDI support.  It also compiles as a library.  If you wanted to just look at disc_io.c and io_dldi.h/s and insert yourself, it's a simple adaptation from the dldi setup in libfat.  I can't do this because I am at work right now, but one of you here should be able to get it in 10 minutes.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The FAT/DLDI part was easily fixed using directly libfat (24th jun post).
<br/>
But the code released is not a working version, more like in the middle of some (small) changes or something.
<br/>
<br/>
Only some small things to fix I guess, but it requires a lot of code reading, understanding, testing. The many layers doesn't help, but it's interesting.
<br/>
Though, I miss a good debugging environment, I should look to improve that first.
<br/>
<br/>
I was doing something else lately, but I found a quite annoying problem in crawl, so I'll fix it before doing a release.
<br/>
In the glkpogo version of frotz, there is a pb somewhere in the init. Nothing shows up yet.
<br/>
Anyway I guess I'll do a release of the current patch at the end of the WE, so other people won't start from scratch if they want to look at this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The libpogo (sober) keyboard is back because:
<br/>
- the mapping is not the same as the bmp panel 
<br/>
- I had some pbs with the colors
<br/>
Maybe a 10 min fix (at least for the mapping), but I'll do it later.

The game lasted 1053 days, 00:00:00 (39 turns)

<br/>
<br/>
See, I only really lasted less than five minutes so I'm not sure what this whole summation of staying alive for almost 3 years on the first level of the dungeon.
<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd post a possible bug.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I'm using an R4, latest firmware, and the game patched perfectly.

Anyway, thanks again.

If you look around on the floor, the cursor is highlighted on both the top and bottom screen, and when you move the cursor around to look at other areas, the previous place you looked at remains highlighted.

<br/>
<br/>
I noticed another thing: the '9' key is missing out in libpogo keyboard... And there is no '^P', used to see the previous msg in the buffer, I guess.
<br/>
The keyboard used for the releases of <b style="color:#FFA34F">crawl</b> were better in many ways, though it's all commented out in the sources. It seems he was planning to use libpogo keyboard everywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the other bugs in my TODO list, though I guess I'd better focus on having glkpogo to run.

It doesn't offer any unique features or customized fonts or coloring.

It's a real shame because it looks very much like he's dropped out of the scene for good and won't be releasing any more upcoming versions.

So anyway, is there any possible chance to incorporate the font for <b style="color:#FFA34F">Crawl</b> to be used with Nethack?
<br/>
The Nethack lettering is unbearable to read, especially given the white, blue, and red coloring that it uses.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to clean that up for better presentation?

<br/>
Even using a single color for the font would be much more presentable than the weird shading the game uses.

Again, thank you for your work with <b style="color:#FFA34F">Crawl</b>.  It's never going to be removed from my card unless you release an update fixing some of the bugs that were found in the game.

It's been about two weeks now and I'm just curious if you're still actively working on cleaning up some of the bugs and missing features in DS Crawl.

<br/>
Also, is it possible to splash a little color in the text for Frotz?

Example:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm doing nothing related to NDS lately... I bought a n800, so I spend a lot of time on it. I'll still use the NDS anyway, as it's a really different kind of device. But I won't try anymore to do on the NDS what I can do better on the n800.
<br/>
<br/>
A while ago, I tried to uncomment the old keyboard code in DS Crawl. But it brings up many problems, so I'd better try to improve the current one...
<br/>
I also noticed we can do ctrl commands using right shoulder button (it's written in sasq doc), so the current keyboard is enough. Crtl-p shows the buffer, as expected.
<br/>
Otherwise, I fixed a small display glitch and started to look at another one, but nothing worth a release yet. As far as I know, there are no blocking bugs in DS Crawl, so there is less motivation to go further.
<br/>
<br/>
I just built the Magnetic Scrolls interpreter. Nothing to change, just a Makefile to write properly. Sasq wrote in the README that it doesn't handle graphics. So I tried with a simple mag file, and it seems to work.
<br/>
