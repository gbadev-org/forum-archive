    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody!
<br/>
<br/>
After <span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, here is my second game on NDS, <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>, that can be translated by "Puzzle of connections". Yes, I tried to give a "Japanese touch" to my game  ;-)
<br/>
This game is loosely inspired by <a class="postlink" href="http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9519" target="_blank">Match-it</a>, a 1989 arcade game from Tamtex. The rules of this puzzle game are very simple: you have  to remove all the tiles on the screen by connecting tiles that have the same color and same symbol. The link between these two tiles must be free and must have at most two corners. Obviously, you play in limited time! Some tiles are special: stars and moons. You can connect stars with stars whatever their colors, same thing for the moons. Moreover, when you remove these special tiles, you stop the time for some seconds.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
At each level, the time goes faster and faster. At highest levels, your brain will be strongly solicited to track as fast as possible the tiles to remove! Luckily, if you are stuck, you can use some limited help by pressing button X. This help will automatically remove identical tiles. You begin the game with 3 helps, and you gain one more help at the end of each level if you didn?t use any help during this level.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that you come up with a puzzle that is impossible to complete when you cannot remove any more tiles. This is rare, but I detect this case. Consequently, if the game doesn?t tell you that there is no more moves, then there remains a solution. If there is no more moves, then this is a game over, but I am working on a better solution.
<br/>
This is only a early 0.1 version of the game, fully playable, but it lacks some features: highscores management, better graphics, as well as some new entertaining features in the gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
One more thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">play this game on a real DS, and not on an emulator!</span> It would be tooo much slow, with to much graphical bugs.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I must second that! Although the idea isn't new, the game is very well executed, and graphics and music are very pleasant.
<br/>
<br/>
My feature requests would be stylus support in the menu and the ability to pause the game with start (instead of jumping back to the menu directly :)
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah i'd agree whole heartidly about everything 0xtob said, the stylus support in the menu isn't a necessity but it'd be handy.
<br/>
<br/>
and a pause / save function too. either save or like a code based system to enter back into the level you were previously at. i know unfortunately though that the levels are random but harder as you go up, not sure you could implement a code based system so a simple save state type thing would be good too if possible.
<br/>
<br/>
otherwise fantastic. a pause would definately be handy though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, Hogmeister and 0xtob. I'm glad to know that you appreciate my game. Your suggestions are very good. I have just finished to implement stylus support in the menu, it was very easy to do and it is indeed very handy. The pause and save functions are also very good ideas, I am now working on it. Expect a new version of the game this week end.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you have more suggestions :-)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://stravingo.over-blog.fr/" target="_blank">My games (<span style="font-weight: bold">Ka-BoOm</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Setsuzoku no Puzzle</span>) and apps (<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Weather Report</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">Treasures of Gaia</span>) on DS are available on my blog!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to say, I really like this game. Took me a while for it to click into place but once it did, I couldn't stop playing it. :) Great to hear that you've added stylus support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I love this game too.  Been playing it almost exclusively the last two weeks.  
<br/>
<br/>
First couple times did horribly and couldn't complete even the first level and wondered how anyone ever got anywhere, but then it clicked, and I think my farthest now is completion of level 13.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the graphics look fine, but would love to see a pause, or save and quit.  Though closing the lid between levels and making sure not to hit L or R works for now.  :P  And of course, high scores like you mentioned.  Wifi competitive games?  :D
<br/>
<br/>
Was thinking since it's a score-based game, what about converting leftover time to bonus points as an incentive to complete the levels faster?
<br/>
<br/>
Love the game though, keep up the good work!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  Make that level 30 now.  :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
