Long story short, I've made a 'survival guide' to help anyone who wants to chat with this app. Currently there is no server, but that can change if someone brighter than me can get the delphi source for the server(look for wifi_voice_chat_source archives) and cross compile for linux. Alternatively some kind soul with a win32 based server could just use the included server.exe application..
<br/>
<br/>
Everything needed is included in the following 7zip file.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps everyone out..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you tried running the server under WINE?  The one here:
<br/>
wifi_chat_v1.x/20071002_wifi_voicechat161/sources/server/voicechatserver.exe
<br/>
<br/>
appears to run fine under WINE, but I can't test.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
