<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd put my last version of my game up if people are interested but work will not be continuing on this project due to too many problems with the code...... I can't get streaming sound without killing sound effects.... the ad hoc multiplayer is very basic, I havent made the master chief model or animated the other models, the textures are too basic, the collision detection with the ground is too poor..... i dunno, just seems still far too much to do and i have run out of steam.
<br/>
<br/>
I was going to try to pretend it was an offical release by bungie :) but it is just the next step from my renegade game.....
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway here it is.....
