    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone is making a PC emulator. I know that someone named Flubba had made PCEadvance for the GBA but he isn't making it for the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
I would absolutely love to run some old retro PC games. I realize that a emulated PC program would probably run at about 486 speed but still, there are a plethora of great games during that time frame, and more importantly they make small foot prints on the micro disks. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering, is there anyone working on a PC emulator? It would be the greatest thing ever, especially considering how touch screen support works well in games designed for the mouse.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But since it's been brought up, why isn't there any PC Engine emulators for the DS?  I don't think there's even a single buggy, unplayable alpha of anything that anyone's tried porting over.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess the DS is just the red-headed stepchild of the emulation scene these days, but really by now I would have expected a decent PC Engine emulator regardless.  It's a great and very well-loved system and at least seems like it would be possible to emulate on the DS.  Or is there some technical problem?  Something about the Turbo hardware that would be particularly difficult to emulate on the DS?  Or is it because there's no portable core for that custom 6502 CPU or something?
<br/>
<br/>
Well, hopefully one of these days...
<br/>
<br/>
I'd much rather have PC Engine emulation than 286.  I mean, come on...Commander Keen?  Really, now.

Nah, I tried working on a Colecovision emulator at one point, but it wasn't fun at all.  Way too abstract for my tastes.  Some people seem to enjoy that type of coding though.  Or maybe they're just masochists.

As I understand it, most of the loopy/FluBBa/Dwedit emulators are still designed to compile and link on ARM's $6,000 toolchain. Yes, there is an academic discount, but I don't know anyone who would go back to school just to be able to afford a copy.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
