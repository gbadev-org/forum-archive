    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all!
<br/>
<br/>
I have written this Java application which provides a graphic user interface for exporting 3D models in (.3ds, .X, .m2d, .mesh) format to .bin that I think is the most used in NDS Homebrew Software. 
<br/>
Furthermore I wanted to integrate another GUI for convert .bmp to .bin in the same application.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the binaries of my NDSModelExporter at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.box.net/shared/ri2qblig48" target="_blank">http://www.box.net/shared/ri2qblig48</a>
<br/>
<br/>
For make 3D exports I use NDS Mesh Converter which is coded by PadrinatoR and you have the source code at this location <a class="postlink" href="http://www.box.net/shared/7hdxqq54c4" target="_blank">http://www.box.net/shared/7hdxqq54c4</a>
<br/>
<br/>
To make BMP2Bin conversions I have used bmp2bin which is in the binaries of DevKitARM toolkit.
<br/>
<br/>
Special greetings to Dark Knight Ez for open the source of his DisplayList library.
<br/>
<br/>
Bye!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Somehow I think I missed PadrinatoR's actual implementation...
<br/>
Was fun to even see some main.c code reused in there, not to mention that it's actually all open-source.
<br/>
<br/>
More on-topic regarding your own contribution: I think its great to see these more versatile model tools becoming GUI capable like this, possibly being easier to use for some people. Good job to you both. And thanks for the mention. ;p
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
On a sidenote: are these temporary download locations? Would you guys like me to put these up at the AmplituDS site in one package? Or perhaps only host them there without actually putting them on the site itself?

I've talked to PadrinatoR and he said me that box.net isnt temporary, but if you like to host a package in your site with the app and the source of PadrinatoRs program, or link them... you can do it without any problem. :D
<br/>

I hosted a couple of batch files that simply appended a bootloader onto a homebrew application. Someone complained and they removed my files. Fortunately I had sent them to several different servers and kept copies on my own computer. Also note that Electronicfiles.net also did this to me (I'm thinking someone from the forum where I posted about them, wanted to do something to annoy me, or something).<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

I have been using this converter to convert my models, but it exports colors too, so lights don't work. I've made this app to fix CallLists created with this program so that you can apply them light. (Yeah, I know, I could have modified source code of the converter, but I wanted to learn how CallList work :P).

WinterMute has mentioned many times the toolchain is in desperate need of a 3D mesh conversion tool to be integrated into it. I think if you can recode your app to be in C/C++, it would be a great addition to devkitPro. What do you think?

I don't see why the GUI should be in C/C++.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The frontend/GUI is optional in use, one can directly use the NDS Mesh Converter via command-line. Seeing as how almost everything in the devkitPro package is command-line only (correct me if I'm wrong), I don't see the issue here. Including the Java frontend would just be a bonus to people who do have Java and would like a GUI. Or the frontend can <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> be included in order to avoid (silly) questions about why the Java app won't work on some PCs.

Edit:

Replaced most occurences of GUI with frontend to avoid confusion.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you have to install .NET framework. I don't now what version exactly since I have versions 1.1, 2, 3 and 3.5. If you can't make it run, compile it on your computer. I did so under Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (it's free).</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by AntonioND on Mon Oct 06, 2008 2:35 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
