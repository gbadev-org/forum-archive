    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm temporarily back in the scene.. whoohooo.. The new BoyScout v.0.94-2 distribution is meant to fix the channel 3 playback problems on the GBA, I have no flash linker being back in Sweden with it being in the UK, but I think the library is all nice now, atleast VBA1.5 seemed to think so after some bug fixes.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone have any example code which plays back a song done with Boyscout?
<br/>
I've tried with the last 2 versions, and all I get is a horrible "BZZZZ" noise.
<br/>
I basically cut and pasted the code from the Manual.html (changing the data name to match my own songs).
<br/>
But it never works.
<br/>
<br/>
I am using devkitadvance, and testing with the latest Visualboy. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd really like to get this working, as the tracker is really cool to use.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Akolade if you give me your email address I'll send you the Visual C++ project I'm using to compile the playback examples, it's got some simple source and uses devkitadvance.
