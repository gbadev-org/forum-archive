    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If anyone of you make music for videogames, or have made some decent ones for your programs, could you tell a musical novice what kind of equipment you use? Computer programs, midi controllers, keyboards, etc? I've become interested in how I would go about writing music for

my programs when the need comes, and I might ask around to see how

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My main tools are Yamaha Motif 6 + Cakewalk HomeStudio 2002. I compose some of the parts using guitar, since my guitar playing skills are much better that my piano skills. If the MIDI file is good enought, I convert that to MOD. I have some issues with the HomeStudio software, but I cannot afford anything better at this point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
