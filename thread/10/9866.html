<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on a game and I have gotten to the point where I want to add audio so I took a look at BoyScout. But, once I exported a song I couldn't get it to play correctly. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried many different song files (including one of the supplied demos) and there seem to be two different possible outcomes: Sometimes, at first glance, it sounds like it either playing very fast or the first note is being played over and over again, and sometimes it fails to produce any sound at all (despite my desperate attempts to make it do so).  Below is a link to the code I am using:

<br/>
<br/>
The given song is a chromatic scale up and down, followed by a long series of repeated notes.  This particular build gives no sound at all.  
<br/>
<br/>
Any help here is appreciated.  Thank you in advance.
