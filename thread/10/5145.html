    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been interested in starting GBA coding for a while now, but I've only just recently tried it. On tepples' advice, I've been screwing around with Allegro for about a year now, and last month I started to code, using the TONC as my guide.
<br/>
<br/>
It's all been going good (perhaps TOO good :o ) so far until I tried to stick some audio into that little box. To be honest, I've got zip idea at all where I should begin, there's people yelling in my left ear to try and program my own music system with interrupts (scary word :S), and there's people yelling in my right ear to tell me to download things like MASO, Krawall and AAS....
<br/>
<br/>
Where should I begin, folks? I'm in your hands!
<br/>
<br/>
Preferably, I'd like a set of neat tools which'll just convert whatever tracker file into an .o, and something nice and neat which I can link to and not look at too often.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm using DevKitARM R11 - GCC 3.4.3</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would use Krawall or AAS unless either their licensing terms bug you, or you want to write your own mixer/player. In that case, I would write my own mixer/player.
<br/>
<br/>
You can program sound without using interrupts, but it's more straightforward to use interrupts, IMO. Either way, if you are finding yourself scared off at the thought of having to deal with them then you might not be ready yet for sound programming.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you can accept the GPL, you might want to use TOD's sound engine. It's a bit hard to get it to play music in any known format, given that I was probably smoking something when I wrote its music engine, but for sound effects it's OK until you get something else working.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

*hugs*
<br/>
I'll have a look into the evil murky deeps of TOD, as you suggest.
<br/>
Also, if anybody else is having trouble with the music of the music, I suggest a trip down to <a class="postlink" href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeaxs/gbacomp/" target="_blank">Headspin's Guide to Compression, Files Systems Screen Effects and MOD Players for the Gameboy Advance</a>. Useful informations, and also, more importantly, he MIRRORS THE DOWNLOADS. So they're right there. That is a good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for all the advice, folks! ^_^

This day was won by the wonderful folks at AAS, the only audio folks whose makefile I could get to work! Plus they're the bees knees. Have yourselves a sandwich on me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The Apex Audio System, a neat GBA Audio library:

I'm using it in my current project, I find it nifty exceptionally. Give the main man a bell, and you'll be well on your way in no time. Bear in mind that this way you'll skip all of the icky bits, and people will FROWN at you in the street for not making your own mixer.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you're not hip on your makefiles, you might find intergrating AAS a bit odd.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
