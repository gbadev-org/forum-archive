    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whenever I try converting my own .s3m using the s3m-converter that comes with the VHAM lib's I get "SAMPLE(): unexpected eof". I don't have this problem with any of the pre-made examples and I can run them fine in code. I was wondering what typically causes this error? I am creating the file in MODPlug Tracker. Should there be any settings I should be aware about. I am using 16Khz 8bit samples, although I have also used 8KHz 8bit samples and received the same error. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I cannot convert my 8bit Stereo 16KHz audio file with DarkFader's wav2gba program it keeps exiting with "data not found" in the header portion of the file. I am confused! Any help is very much appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
