    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some looping sounds make a click noise when the note is changed
<br/>
is a volumeramp the way to get rid of this or can it be something else
<br/>

<br/>
How much do you think I should fade out each sample?
<br/>
and how many samples should I fade?
<br/>
Maybe it should be different depending on something but I dont know what!
<br/>
<br/>
Do someone know how fasttracker or modplugtracker made it? 
<br/>
in these programs it doesnt click!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance
<br/>
<br/>
I forgot, I also wonder what kind of fade I should use something like
<br/>
vol -= x; 
<br/>
or maybe 
<br/>
vol = (vol * 7) &gt;&gt; 3;
<br/>
<br/>
and should non-looping samples do it as well?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
