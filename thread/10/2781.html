    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no standard music format for the GBA (as there was on the SNES). It's up to each individual programmer to write their own software library for playing music.
<br/>
<br/>
There are also a few music players out there that are quite good and are either cheap or free for non-commercial use. James Daniels' excellent <a class="postlink" href="http://www.apex-designs.net/tools_aas.html" target="_blank">Apex Audio System</a> is probably the best choice if you are going the non-commercial route. Or you can purchase [url=mind.riot.org/krawall/]Krawall[/url] if you don't want to display a logo.
<br/>
<br/>
MOD is the most popular file-format to support because it is simple, low-tech, and provides more than enough quality for most GBA games. Most individual GBA music players will have their own quirks, though, with regards to things like how many channels they can support and what special effects they provide. (8 channels is really the defacto standard, and while many players support more than that, 8 is really all you should require.)
<br/>
<br/>
If all you want to do is compose music that could be played on the GBA, I suggest you strictly adhere to the MOD format and its limitations, and keep it down to 8 channels, with default panning for MOD (channels 1, 4, 5 and 8 are left, channels 2, 3, 6 and 7 are right). This should make you compatible with most players.
