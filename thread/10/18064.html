    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since Krawall Advance has now become open-source on GitHub,  I am planning on using it for the audio in the game I am developing. But the copy of Krawall has a problem - it only has the source code, not a compiled binary, which I don't want and don't know how to compile.
<br/>
I also found an old build on another website, but it's from long before it became fully open-source, and it's the non-commercial version, without XM support, and I composed all the music files in XM. And furthermore, XM cannot easily be converted to S3M, at least with OpenMPT, as it cuts off huge chunks of each pattern to shorten it to 64 rows, thus messing up my songs.
<br/>
I have also been considering using DevKit Pro's own MaxMod, but it has one glaring flaw - it uses a different set of instruments for each file, and all of my files use the exact same set of 41 samples, so all the samples are duplicated many times, wasting a lot of space. Worse, the converted files seem to be in binary format, so I can't edit it with a code editor. Only Krawall is smart enough to use a separate sample file from the songs which also removes duplicate sanples, which I can use for every song. 
<br/>
Can anyone get a compiled EXE of the converter on GitHub? I've got all the samples in unsigned 8-bit RAW format and in 8 channels and everything; I just need the converter.[/list]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Where can I get the "bank" converter, then?

If you're referring to mmutil, I have proven that it does duplicate samples. I imported it as raw data in Audacity, and the same samples were repeated many times.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I never tested it myself, but MaxMod author said it would not duplicate samples. <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=164147#164147" target="_blank">See this post</a>.

I've tried with many options, but it still has a bunch of duplicate samples! 
<br/>
I looked at the forum and I saw that someone had the same problem, but it didn't get answered properly. I also tried making an account and posting my problem onto the forum, but it says the moderator must approve it first...and he doesn't seem to be looking at all, as I haven't got it approved for several days.

Can soneone PLEASE either sort out the MaxMod problem or provide a compiled build of the new Krawall? I'm really desperate to have working music in my game that doesn't waste a ton of memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can either try fixing the problem on MaxMod <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/devkitPro/mmutil" target="_blank">mmutil source</a> or try a workaround, for instance creating a single XM and playing it from a given point (see <a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211048/http://www.maxmod.org/ref/" target="_blank">mmPosition()</a>)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yiQrz9" target="_blank">libXM7</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yJwcOo" target="_blank">NDS programming tutorial (Italiano)</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://disjointedstudio.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Waimanu DS / GBA</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://adshomebrewersdiary.blogspot.com" target="_blank">A DS Homebrewer's Diary</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, but neither of these work for me.
<br/>
1. I don't know how to. If I had that much coding knowledge, I would have Krawall already compiled and I wouldn't have created this topic.
<br/>
2. Combined, all my music tracks exceed the maximum limit of patterns that can fit in one XM file. Also, the number of ticks per row is different in some songs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
- ask on <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/devkitPro/mmutil" target="_blank">MaxMod mmutil github</a> if someone is willing to fix the sample duplication problem
<br/>
or
<br/>
- reduce the number of patterns so that it fits a single XM file (or use two XMs, if you could tolerate *some* sample duplications).

Thanks, I'll try both of those. But I have to make a GitHub account first. I'll let you know if either of those work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
