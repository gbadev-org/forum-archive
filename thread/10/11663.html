    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just have a couple questions about the saptapper ripper program.  First, how does it work, and second, is it possible to write a similar program that runs on the GBA?
<br/>
<br/>
The program would parse a GBA cartridge, then offer to play all the tracks detected, sort of like a music-test feature.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SapTapper seems to work just like the scan function in the new Sappy. I'm not sure how it does the player parts but the song data seems straightforward enough.
<br/>
<br/>
A Sappy on the GBA would be cool yeah. I guess somehow creating a .o file with the necessary data and linking it in would work. All the player needs is it's own LUTs and the song table.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
