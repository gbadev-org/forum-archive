    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just out of curiosity... I'm following Deku's VBL-interrupt sound guide, and I'm not sure how he's coming up with the values for the buffer lengths... For a frequency of 42048 it's recommended to use a buffer 704 samples long... while this seems to work fine, why is it 704 and not (42048 / 60) = 700.8, thus 701 samples or so? Are the extra three samples just dropped, doesn't that affect the audio? Or (much more likely) am I misunderstanding what's going on?

Thanks for satisfying my curiosity! ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because the GBA does not run at 60.0 frames per second. It runs at one frame per 280896 CPU cycles, which is about 59.73 frames per second.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
...do you have more interesting durations of things that happen in the machine in - terms of clock cycles?
