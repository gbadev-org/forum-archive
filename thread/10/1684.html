    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am playing about with making an Advance Wars clone (just for experimentation), and wondered if anyone knows any way, or a good way, of ripping sound and music from a ROM Image...?  I would like to use some of the MOD samples and some basic sound samples (don't worry -- I don't plan on releasing it! :P)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To rip the sounds, get a program that can read raw binary files. Most games store their samples in 8-bit signed format; some store samples in 8-bit unsigned format (which enables a minor mixer speedup); a few (such as Super Puzzle Fighter II) compress their samples because there are so darn many of them to fit in 8 megabytes.

To rip the music?  You'll have to reverse engineer the music engine, the same thing that NSF and GBS ripping experts do.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
