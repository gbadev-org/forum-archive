How do its capabilities compare to those of the GBA's GBC tone generators or those of the NES?

2A03: two pulse (variable duty), one triangle, one noise, one arbitrary waveform

SID: three pulse (variable duty)/sawtooth/triangle/noise (selectable), ring modulation, output filter<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Several games were made for both the C64 and the NES. Guess the music of thoose could be used for some kind of comparison.
<br/>
<br/>
Bubble bobble is one of them: <a class="postlink" href="http://taito.overclocked.org/bbobble/bbsid.zip" target="_blank">c64</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://taito.overclocked.org/bbobble/nesbbmusic.zip" target="_blank">nes</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd have to say there are more good tunes on the C64 than the NES but there are a couple of cool tunes on the NES as well, I think it has more to do with the composers than the hardware (though the C64 is more advanced).
<br/>
Codemasters has some NES games with "C64 like" tunes, also Solstice from Rare uses the technique with playing 3 (or more?) different tones on the same channel changing the frequency very quickly.
<br/>
Also I just listened to the music in Racing Gears Advanced (I think was the name), some really nice music there, one of the songs seems like it's from The Last Ninja (though it isn't).

<br/>
Sampled audio on the C64 was kind of complicated, but some games used it (Ghost busters and Impossible misson for example). As far as I know it was not possible to play any other tones at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, the SID had no explicit support for sampled audio, so what they did was set it to output a DC level, and then they played the sound by adjusting the volume :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#39158 - serf - Tue Apr 05, 2005 7:25 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm ... I looked this up on Google, and there's a great article on sampled sound on the C64 <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/chacking/c=hacking20.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the 6581 had some interesting design flaws, among them that it tended to output a DC voltage by default.  So, indeed, by modulating the master volume (4 bit register), you could indeed play sampled sounds.  The article even suggests that this trick could be used in parallel with the SID voices, at the cost of some distortion of the SID voices, which could be minimized (at the loss of some sample quality) by using only the lower 3 bits of the master volume register for sample playback.  The 8580, the 6581's successor, fixed many of the 6581's "flaws," among them the DC offset.  (The 8580 could be modded in hardware to regain the DC offset, however.)
<br/>
<br/>
The same article describes (and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/chacking/ch20addendum.txt" target="_blank">another file</a> elaborates on) a method for playing back sampled sound at even higher quality using the SID voices set to output pulse waveforms at frequency 0 -- though apparently you have to put up with a certain amount of ringing at the PWM carrier frequency.  The more SID voices you use, the higher the quality.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows more, I'd love to hear it -- I know nothing about the topic that I didn't just read in those two files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep, I burned my original 6581 and had to replace it but they only had the new 8580 so I had to mod it to be able to listen to samples. If I remember right it had a sound in pin which you just hooked up to +5V through a resistor or so. The soundtrack to Turbo Outrun uses a lot of samples and normal SID voices at the same time, a good example of how things can be done on the C64.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I like the Butterfly tune.

Two good C64 game tunes which are not available on the NES are:

<br/>
EDIT
<br/>
I just read the readme.txt in tepples "evidence" .zip file.
<br/>
There is a reason Butterfly sounds good. It is a s3m (mod) tune, not a NES/GBC chip tune.
<br/>
While the instruments in the s3m tune are claimed to be sampled GBC instruments, I would not accept this as evidence on the capabilities of the GBC tone generator. I assume the same is true for the other two tunes?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Open Butterfly in Modplug Tracker to verify this. The basic NES waveforms are 1/8 duty pulse, 1/4 duty pulse, 1/2 duty pulse, 32-step 16-level triangle wave, and pseudorandom sample-and-hold noise. Pulse can appear on channels 1 and 2, triangle on channel 3 (with no envelope), and noise on channel 4.

Maxx Unlimited is also a .s3m file, but the tune from Silver Surfer is the first track of silversu.nsf from Zophar.net's NSF collection, played through Festalon.

It was a really long time since I poked around in with the C64 so I don't remember what "most of it" is...  ;)  some obvius stuff that <span style="text-decoration: underline">should</span> be emulated is ofcourse the CIA timers and some kind of vblank irq I suppose. So maybe something like this?
