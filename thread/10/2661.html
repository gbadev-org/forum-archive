<br/>
<br/>
i'm coding using devkit_v4 and C
<br/>
<br/>
I am having trouble using FRAS with my project. 
<br/>
<br/>
When calling a fras-function somewhere in the code, the linker includes those functions from the fras-library (of course). But as soon as it does that, the program refuses to work at all...
<br/>
<br/>
i had to call one of jeff frohwein's functions defined in crt0.s (__FarProcedure) in order to be able to call the fras-funcs without generating an error.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now it compiles w/o any error or warning msg, but locks right after being loaded into an emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
This also happens when i include the fras-functions from the asm-sources instead of linking to the library...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if there was something wrong with the interrupts not being set up properly, the program should show something at least, but not lock! (i'm starting the timers before i call any fras-function, but they don't increment...they just stay at zero)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it might have something to do with crt0.s, but it's just a guess....
<br/>
(i've enabled interrupts there and they're working as expected)
<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks a lot
