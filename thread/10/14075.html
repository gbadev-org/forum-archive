I thought a good idea for a ds music program would be some sort of monophonic synth.
<br/>
<br/>
Touchscreen could be for keyboard interface/control and perhaps some settings, but with all the other buttons you could institute many cool features.
<br/>
<br/>
say perhaps the left and right buttons could scroll thru rates, attack, decay, LFO , pitch bend, modulation, etc and up and down could control these settings
<br/>
<br/>
still leaving many other buttons for potentially other settings.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also the ability to save preset setting could be handy in this type of application.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe (please correct me if I'm wrong) I heard this of something like this suggested for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would make the DS an even more handy music tool (ds midi wifi could even be instituted for it...)
<br/>
<br/>
anyway as I am unable to program I hope this idea tickles somebodies fancy</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Electroplankton has no keyboard for starters, secondly is more of a sound art project than a useable functioning synth.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know there are no LFO, attack, delay, resonance, etc functions in Elektroplankton.
<br/>
<br/>
The only module which has anything like what I suggested is the last voice one on Elektroplankton, even then it only affects one sample.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is all true. I have been spending time building a wav table based synth for the ds and got it working but, not with out a lot of huge pitfalls to get over. The problem with developing effects for the ds is the way in which the audio channels are designed, in that they are to user friendly and thereby making it troublesome to design effects for. The GBA was built for effects because, of the way that fifo for sound was built which gave you a windowing(buffering) feature already built in. Though it was a lot hard to program for. I'm in the process of testing to see if a can get a similar buffering thing working for ds using some of it's built in timers

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good luck with your programming, If you need some help testing I'm quite happy to help out, (I have a CycloDS evolution and a DS-x), but alas have no programing experience.

In the meantime has anyone else tried - <a href="http://www.ds-scene.net/?s=viewtopic&amp;nid=4331" target="_blank">http://www.ds-scene.net/?s=viewtopic&amp;nid=4331</a>

its a new wav based looping/scratching music software,  alpha release but works perty well so far</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
