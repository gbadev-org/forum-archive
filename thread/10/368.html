    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
I really need something with all of these features, so I can finish my current game - Cauldron :-
<br/>
<br/>
(1) Needs to be free!!!
<br/>
(2) 4 sounds channels at least
<br/>
(3) Play looping samples
<br/>
(4) 'Non flushable samples.' 'non flushable' ie it won't be overwritten by other samples if too many effects are being played. This is so i can have bubbling lava in some rooms, start the effect playing once and not worry about it being flushed out by explosions etc.
<br/>
(5) Play a music file (MOD/whatever)
<br/>
(6) Option to pause and resume playback
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas before I start the task of hammering one out on the kb?
<br/>
(BTW Krawall doesn't support all these features as far as I can tell)
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers
<br/>

couldn't you do that as a looped mod file playing in the background (the bubble noise), the play your sample over top?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And a downloadable demo would be nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
