<br/>
<br/>
I would like to generate random noises on my GBA. I found this website (http://belogic.com/gba/) with good tutorials but I wonder if I can use this on my GBA without breaking it...
<br/>
<br/>
Any chance that someone knows?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, the famous \"Audio Advance.\" This is an exact mapping of the hardware on the GBA, with brief examples of how stuff works. Although the information should be accurate, it won\'t help you very much if you are new to sound programming. I would recommend a tutorial I saw written by DekuTree (someone with the link please?) which will take you through writing a software mixer on the GBA. It, combined with this reference you\'ve found, should be all you need to get going.
<br/>
<br/>
If this seems a bit much, you may look into a pre-made audio engine. I personally prefer Krawall, but others have their own opinions and in the end it\'s a matter of preference.

There's no real risk in breaking your GBA by doing some audio-programming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some sites claim that it's possible to "break" the GBA's audio hardware by writing directly to the sound bias register, but in practice, that's not true. If you make a mistake, the worst you'll ever hear is a loud pop, no harm done.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
