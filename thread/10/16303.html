    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not sure if this issue has been addressed. Also, my first thought was to post on the ModPlug forums, but to be honest they seemed a bit unorganized and I thought I might do better here. I followed the read-me file and went to install the DLS, but all that happens is my processor seems to be loading for a second but nothing ever loads. Has anyone else had this issue with the ModPlug Quick Start Kit?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have never used Quick Start Kit, always just installed the barebones.

The DLS is just a windows DLS that should already be on your system.
