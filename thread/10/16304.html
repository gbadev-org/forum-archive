<br/>
<br/>
I honestly can't remember what I did but I somehow managed to break AGBMidi.
<br/>
<br/>
BLAH
<br/>
<br/>
So now, I'm re-writing everything.. and asking for a few suggestions:
<br/>
 -What would you say is an "ideal" channel count? 8? 12? 16? 24? 32?
<br/>
 -(For those folks that are more creative than me) What would you suggest be the new name? "AGBMidi," sounds kinda lame.
<br/>
<br/>
So any suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
Current aims so far are:
<br/>
 -Relatively fast mixing (~1.8% CPU per channel @ 18157Hz)
<br/>
 -Relatively low RAM usage (~2-4KB EWRAM, ~1-3KB IWRAM)
<br/>
 -128 point reverberation setting (Will sound a bit metal-ish though. BLAH)
<br/>
 -128 point master volume control
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Feel free to suggest certain things.. I might add them, too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some suggestions:
<br/>
- Include a default sound font with the lib.
<br/>
- Previous release had sound effects support? If not, add it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.playeradvance.org/forum/showthread.php?t=19881" target="_blank">Sh*tty RPG</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, sound effect support is implemented, along with song-style sound effects (as in SFX played as music data).
<br/>
<br/>
The default sound bank isn't actually a soundfont; it's a DLS file, but the converter needs its own format, so I have to reconvert everything, but when finished, both the DLS file and the needed files for the converter will be released.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ASSD - Advanced Sound Synth Driver

<br/>
Currently, mixing a 32 byte long square wave at 8363Hz @ 18157Hz, took 1.8% CPU, which is pretty good so far. So I'll check the rest later, OK?
