    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am having problems using AAS. Here is what I do. I have a 6 channel mod file which plays ok. I set AAS to use 16 channels. My mod is using only 6 channels so I should have 10 channels left for other sounds? No?
<br/>
Well, when the mod plays, I can only use channels 6 to 8 for other sounds.
<br/>
<br/>
When the mod is not playing, I have all 16 channels free.
<br/>
<br/>
What am I doing wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is, although perhaps it could be a bit clearer:

The number of channels you can access is limited by the number that are already being used to play a MOD. So, if you're playing a 3 channel MOD in AAS_CONFIG_CHANS_4 mode then only the first channel (channel 0) will be available for playing sound effects. If AAS_CONFIG_CHANS_8 were used in the same situation then the first 5 channels (channels 0-4) would be available.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, I just found it in the docs. Shame on me :) I am getting a little nervous with this compo deadline...
<br/>
<br/>
Everything works now but, I noticed that the general sound volume is a lot lower than with commercial games I have. I tried using the AAS_CONFIG_CHANS_16_LOUD but it doesn't really make things louder compared to other gba game. I am testing on a gba (not sp). When using headphones, the sound is loud enough, but when using the external speaker, it is really low even with the volume knob to the max. I can hardly hear the music. And I am playing the sounds at max volume (64) and mod at 100 so we we can still hear the sound fx.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could try putting it in mono or reducing the maximum number of channels. The problem with having a large number of channels is that the volume range has to be split between them so the more you have, the quieter each one becomes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, MOD volumes are set in the range 0-256 (not 0-100) so maybe that's the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know, I put it lower because I was not able to hear the sound fx while the mod was playing. But now, by putting it in mono and 16 channels loud mode, it is louder. If I have enough time (which is not likely) I will put an option to set sounds to stereo/mono. Because with the headphones, it sounds very good in stereo :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are your sound fx normalised?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes they are. Anyways, in mono, its loud enough now. Compo entry sent :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I know why my sounds sounded lower. Most of the sounds have low frequencies. My sound fx are mostly explosions and projectile hits. The mod file has drums, bass and low guitar chords, so, there are not a lot of high frequencies. That little gba speaker doesn't reproduce low frequencies very well. And that would also explain why it sounds a lot better with headphones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you render the .mod to a mono .wav in Modplug Tracker, and then you use a 3rd order Butterworth high-pass filter with cutoff frequency 800 Hz (<a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/gb_speaker_filter.png" target="_blank">picture</a>), you can hear how it would sound through GBA speakers. For instrument samples with a lot of bass, try playing with the EQ and perhaps a bit of overdrive (<a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/cep-overdrive.png" target="_blank">picture</a>) to get them to sound bigger in the midrange and high end.
