    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After recently downloading and using PogoShell v1.0 (which is a great little util!), I listened to some .NSF NES audio files provided with it using the built in replayer. Not only did it sound really good and crisp, but it was LOUD as well... something that all the mod players seem to lack!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was wondering if its a good idea to use NES audio in a gba game (ie. is it quick enough), and where can I get the replayer as used in the PogoShell distribution? Is there a windows based NFS tracker, or is NerdTracker the only option?
