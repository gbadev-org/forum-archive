    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I?m a brazilian guy that love games and development and  I?d like to know if someone could help me ! My english isn?t very good, but I?ll try to do you understand me:
<br/>
I was doing a game to GBA and I?m converting it to NDS. I?m doing 2 games, a original game ( Hayate Blade ) and a remake from a SEGA Genesis RPG game, "Shining Force 2". The graphics engine is ok, but I can?t get information about how can I put "music" in game. This always was the problem with my games. I think to do the game to PC (musics is easy), but I love "video game consoles", mainly portable like NDS, and cuz of it I need some help !!
<br/>
I?d like to can a "routine" to play PCM (.raw) musics in the games. The Shining Force 2 have a CD Music call "Symphonic Suite" (beautiful musics) and I?d like put this in the game, converting to ".raw" and using it. There?s are games like "Elite Beat Agents" that have a lot of musics and with a goos quality !! 
<br/>
Please, I know that the game will have a good quality of graphics and AI, but I need help to put the musics there... select musics, turn the volume on and off, do fade in and out... and put special effects too... 
<br/>
I?m not using PAlib or ASlib, only "libnds" (DevKitPro). I prefer and like it.
<br/>
Please... help me !!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Usually if you're using recorded music, you need to compress it in order to fit a decent amount on your storage device. But you have to choose a codec that the target system can decode in real time and leave some time available for game and graphics code.
<br/>
<br/>
On the GBA, one of your options is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GSM Player</a>, as seen in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">Luminesweeper</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
On the DS, there are libraries to play MP2, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, etc. The source code for MoonShell and DSOrganize is available.
