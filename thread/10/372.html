    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was looking for some utils to convert sound to the gba format,
<br/>
i came up with simon.exe, but that doesn't work for me.
<br/>
Since i miss a file called: "VCL50.bpl", is there someone who
<br/>
has this file for me?
<br/>
<br/>
Or does anyone know a better sound converting utility?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">VCL50.bpl is the Borland Pascal Runtime library. If try searching on Google for that probably you will find the runtime. Also I think Borland released some of their old DOS products (TC,TP) for free, so you may want to check their web site too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
