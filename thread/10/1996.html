    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I've managed to sample a 6 second loop. My code does this :
<br/>
DMA1 sends data to the FIFO each time timer 0 overflows, and when timer 0 overflows an IRQ is generated. Each Time an IRQ is generated, I keep a variable in IWRAM that is incremented by one.
<br/>
The sound frequency I use is 6000Hz, and as my loop is 6 second long, everytime my variable reaches 36000, I reinitialize my variable to 0, stop the DMA transfer and reinitialize it so that the sound loop is played from the beginning. That's a personnal algorithm, and it's the first time that I try sampling a sound loop in software.
<br/>
The problem is that at each loop end, there is some distortion, and I doubt my code is the best.
<br/>
How does professional developpers manage to have a clean and precise sound looping?
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions are welcome.
<br/>
Cheers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You may have a data alignment error.  Audio should be aligned to a 4 byte boundary.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, most GBA games I've played do sample looping in software, within a soft mixer. The mixer is set up to play at a rate that divides evenly into the length of a frame.  This way, you can time things in vblanks.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
