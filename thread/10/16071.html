    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have modified pimpmobile to allow sound effects to be played alongside tunes. The only slight drawback is that you have to manually add sounds to the module files using a music tracker. Although that's quite easy to do with something like ModPlug Tracker.
<br/>
<br/>
It allows you to play any sound effect in any of pimpmobile's 32 mixer channels and at any pitch or volume. Say you have a song that uses 16 channels, that means you have 16 free channels for sound effects. 
<br/>
<br/>
In one folder there is the modified libpimpmobile source code and in the other is a ready-built demo with source code and data files.  The only requirement for building the library and demo is that you have a recent version of DevkitARM installed.
<br/>
<br/>
The readme file gives you all the info you need.
<br/>
<br/>
NB: I am not the original author of pimpmobile, and he is apparently making an official update. But until then, my slightly modified version works just fine. :)

As far as I can tell, pimpmobile is the only free library for the GBA that is any good. Well, NOW it's good since it can do sound effects. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately, I'm having troubles unpacking the archive once I've downloaded it. WinRAR gives me errors of the kind "Unknown method in &lt;filename&gt;" on what seems to be all files apart from the readme.txt in the root. Should I use some special program to decompress the archive?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">About a DS port: I've been thinking of doing an NDS port, but I never really got around to the part of making it all compile. I've considered using the hardware mixer, but that seems to have too many restrictions to get it to work properly and the pimpmobile mixer is quite fast. It might be worth doing the mixer in software and using the rest of the hardware channels for sound-effects - if I ever get around to do a DS-port, this is what I imagine I'll do for the first version at least.
<br/>
<br/>
The API interface for an NDS version will most likely be separate from the GBA-version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, and just to let you know, kusma. I have had a few problems with the converter program. When converting more than one .xm file at once, it sometimes misses out some of the samples, depending on which file was converted first. It happened when I had some matching samples between two .xm files, but it also seems to happen under other seemingly random circumstances.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, but I'll try and have a good look at it myself and work out what's happening.  I already thought of a workaround by using separate sample banks for each song, but that would defeat the object of not having duplicate samples.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I never heard of that bug before, but I haven't really tested the code that much. I'd love to get a test-case for the issue if you have, though! Anyway, thanks for letting me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
