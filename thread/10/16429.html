    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I search for a basic soundfont that could be used for a DS midi player.
<br/>
Something of decent 16 bits quality for a DS :
<br/>
- 16 bits 11khz/22khz ?
<br/>
- with the 128 basic midi instruments (not necessary with all the useless ones)
<br/>
- one sample per instrument / one bank (i'm not an expert)
<br/>
- small size (i would start with 1-2Mb but i'm open minded) 
<br/>
<br/>
I have hard time finding something basic on the net, and i guess guys who coded some midiPlayer would have that sort of things in stock.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, for 16-bit samples, and your average sample being about 8192 bytes long, you'd be getting this equation:
<br/>
<br/>
2 * 8192 = 16384
<br/>
<br/>
Which is 16KB.. and times this by 127 instruments...
<br/>
<br/>
16 * 127 = 2032KB
<br/>
<br/>
Which means that you've already reached 2MB, and that's not including a single drum kit, and only 1 sample per instrument/patch/voice.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer 8-bit samples (if size is what you're after), but if you're after quality, you should go with 16-bit samples at either 16384Hz or 32768Hz (usual mixing frequency).
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and usually you wouldn't use SoundFonts for a DS MIDI player, you'd use DLS files (DownLoadable Sounds, if I remember right), which are pretty rare to find, but if you can afford Awave Studio, this will let you convert from too many formats to, again, too many formats.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well DLS seems harder to find than what i already look for ...
<br/>
Unless someone would have some material to share.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably end with soundfont. I could probably go for a little more than 2Mb (maybe &lt;10Mb with a standard drum kit) ... if someone got one ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You might start with the <a class="postlink" href="http://freepats.zenvoid.org/" target="_blank">freepats</a> samples. Some of them are in excess of 200k (with some layered patches up to about 2MB--per instrument) but I think quite a few of them are fairly small. If you're willing to sacrifice multisampling and clone patches for similar instruments it might just fit.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'd sooner convert the midi file to a mod format and tweak the instruments by hand. This is going to be smaller and sound better in 99% of all cases.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

well, in my DS-midi experiments i <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=16205&amp;highlight=soundfont" target="_blank">used</a> 1Mb GM soundfont which comes with freeware "SynthFont" software... also, with some sf editor like "Viena" (free) you can autoresample whole soundfont for size...
<br/>
(or better decompile it with sf2comp, process with sox, compile with sf2comp back) 
<br/>
<br/>
if i'm not mistaking this is that soundfont

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, the 1MB soundfont.
<br/>
Yeah, it's pretty small, but not suitable for NDS, as it uses low-pass filters, etc, unless you force these manually.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
