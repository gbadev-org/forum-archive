    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering if anyone can provide me with some (rough is fine) specs for the built-in speakers in the GBA, GBA SP, or GB Micro.  DS and DS Lite would be interesting to know as well.  I'm interested especially in the frequency response (and maximum volume would be nice to know too), and specifically, I'm wondering how the frequency response is around 40KHz (yes, 40KHz, which is inaudible to humans -- see <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11082" target="_blank">my previous thread</a> from about a year ago if you're wondering why I care).  Apologies if this is a stupid question, I've searched around Google with no luck, and I'm not skilled enough on the subject to figure it out myself.

Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you just search speaker sites and look at what a tweeter from some of the high end manufacturers can do.. they top out at around 22-30Khz..  So, to think a cheapo speaker like in the GBA/DS is going to have close to that?  No likely.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
