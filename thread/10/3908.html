    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just quickly, when playing with the BoyScout sound engine recently I found that the no$gba emulator would say my work had errors, about 4 a second. I'm am virtually certain the rest of my code is fine since it is a library I wrote and have been using for a while without errors appearing.
<br/>
<br/>
I commented out the BoyScout code and had no errors from then on. no$gba doesn't tell me what my errors were.
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone can test code they have written using BoyScout and tell me what sort of report it gets from no$gba. Just curious to see whether I have made a mistake or if it's something I can fix in the BoyScout code.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

Version 2.0 now up - guaranteed at least 100% more pleasing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh. Try doing the same with tepples' TOD! 
<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it, until we know what no$gba considers the errors to be it's no good speculating or worrying. I'm still waiting for my Shareware version of no$gba... seems to be something of a problem to supply at the moment.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">TOD M3 will make thousands of undefined I/O reads at program startup under specific conditions. DevKit Advance R5 beta 3 changed crt0's behavior such that a multiboot program run as a ROM doesn't copy appended assets to EWRAM. The find_first_gbfs_file() in the version of GBFS used in TOD M3 didn't skip over the I/O areas between EWRAM and ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
To work around those thousands of errors, use Multiboot Menu (which forces the assets into EWRAM), or upgrade to version 20040208 of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">GBFS</a> and recompile TOD.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
