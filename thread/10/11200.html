Mod players are cool.  I'll admit that I really do like midi players though.  It's a lot easier to find midi musicians.

One problem with using .mid in your program is that you have to have samples for all General MIDI instruments and all General MIDI drums, which can take a lot of space.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Is this something that a non-techie can do?

How much is a lot of space?  (Definition changes with the medium.)

And converting a MIDI file to MOD using MODPlug tracker only converts the intruments you use also.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to convert some MIDI files at the moment using MODPlug, but it dosn't seem to recognise the GM instruments or something (playback is silent). The MIDI's play file in WMP so I don't know what's up. Perhaps I have to manually replace the instruments. I heard there are lots of GM collections on the Net in Sound Font format. I suppose there is a util out there for converting them to WAV.
<br/>
<br/>
There is another util called PTMid which can convert MIDI to MOD and it attempts to compress the channels down to 4. But I didn't like the GM set it uses (which only includes about 8 instruments).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah it has the gm.dls instruments on the left panel, but strange thing I got it to work. I changed the file browser from "All Modules" to "Midi Files" and then it loaded and plays ok. Heh then I tried loading it again with "All Modules and it worked again. Strange, must be a bug or something.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
