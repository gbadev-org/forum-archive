    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am a complete GBA Audio noob. I just got interrupts and Krawall to work in my game last night. 
<br/>
I am a complete audio noob also. I think I flunked 6th grade music class because I couldn't play "Hot Cross Buns" on my recorder.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I downloaded ModPlug Tracker, and I think it is cool.  I wish I had music talent, then I'd make something funky.  But I did a little tutorial and created this catchy little beat.   Now I wanted to get that beat into my game.  Just to say I made this song and it is in this game that I made.
<br/>
<br/>
Well that's where I run into problems.  When I use the converter.exe that comes with Krawall (the free version), I don't get any data listed in samples.s.  The song.s file seems to be ok, and I get no complaints from the converter tool, or when I compile my game.  Only problem is I don't get sound.  Most likely because there are no samples.
<br/>
<br/>
So I looked at the examples I was using in ModPlug (they dO play in my game.)  And I noticed that all the samples I'm using in my song are 16-bit, and the samples the examples use are 8-bit.
<br/>
<br/>
So my questions are: Do I have to convert each sample from 16-bit to 8-bit on my own?  If so, is ModPlug Tracker capable of doing that? If not, what software (preferably freeware) is capable of doing that?  And are there libraries of sounds available that can be used in ModPlug (It appears the default ones that come with the App are all 16-bit)?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for any help you can provide.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm hesitant to post as I don't really know about the specifics of what you're doing and someone here may know what the problem really is, but my recommendation for a free, simple to use audio program thingy is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.goldwave.com/" target="_blank">Goldwave</a>. It's not completely free, it will annoy you with register requests when you start it up and only allow you to do so many actions on one go but it's pretty solid and has a lot of features you may want in the future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, thanks for the reply.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I may have just found my solution.
<br/>
It's called WavePad:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nch.com.au/" target="_blank">http://www.nch.com.au/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Very easy to use freeware, and it has a batch processing feature.  So I just get all my .Wavs (the 16-bit ones) from ModPlug Tracker, and then use the batch processer to convert them all to 8-bit.  There's quite a few options, I just didn't choose any... and it lets you choose the frequency also.
<br/>
Push the button and it converts them all.  Then, of course, I have to go back into ModPlug and change the samples to point to the converted ones.
<br/>
<br/>
The sound is noticibly not as good.  But I don't think it matters for the crap I'll be putting out. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't actually loaded it up into my game yet, but I did the Krawall conversion and the samples.s file now has data.
<br/>
<br/>
btw, if anyone out there likes to make music in a mod tracker. (It seems really fun if you aren't tone deaf like me.) and would like to help me add a song to my compo entry.  I'd be more than happy to include it and give you credit in the game.  You can call yourself the composer, sound engineer, Maestro... whatever.  Game is simple arcade-style basketball.  I draw a blank when I try to think of music that would go along with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tepples, thanks a lot for the tip. It was a pretty useful tip :)
<br/>
That definitly is the easiest way to convert a sample to 8-bit.
<br/>
<br/>
Also Krawall rocks.  It is such a good feeling to hear a swish when the ball goes through the hoop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
