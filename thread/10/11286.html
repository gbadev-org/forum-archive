<br/>
<br/>
I have tried some wave files that I found from some online poker sites and after converting them to raw and changing sample rates to get it to play it doesn't sound that good. Does anyone know if there are sounds for dealing, beting, raking the money available from the homebrew scene? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
