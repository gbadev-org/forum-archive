    <h4>#102767 - kusma - Sat Sep 16, 2006 9:50 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A friend and I have been developing our own mod-player mainly targeting the gba. This was done because we were really fed up with the lack of proper sync-features in krawall, and because we wanted a little project. Now I would say that the player is becoming more or less mature, and I was wondering about how many people would be interested in a new mod-playing library.
<br/>
<br/>
The current feature-list is something like this:
<br/>
* MOD and XM support. Some S3M code written, but we never bothered to bring it to a working stage. IT support planned.
<br/>
* Decently fast (faster than krawall on all my tests, a tad slower than AAC)
<br/>
* Good sound-quality
<br/>
* Relatively low on IWRAM consumption
<br/>
* Rather clean C/C++ source code, some inline assembly in the mixer innerloops
<br/>
* Most weird MOD/XM/S3M special cases documented and taken care of
<br/>
* Mixer optimized for ARM7-CPUs without cache
<br/>
* Binary-only data files intended for ROM (no asm-files generated), with a conversion tool taking care of (converting) unsupported sample-formats
<br/>
* Module callbacks (basicly E8x and Wxx)
<br/>
* Separate sample-bank to save ROM space
<br/>
* "Game type" sample based sound effects support
<br/>
* All limitations are compile-time defines. No hard limit on channels etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, our plan was to release this under a Zlib license, allowing for basically free use. But as time went by, we kinda never got around to do it. Considering that the gba seems to be "on it's way out", I'm a bit unsure if it's worth the hassle of packaging and support ;)
<br/>
<br/>
How does the scene feel about this?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and just a note - this is the mod-player used in the two last Shitfaced Clowns demos, "Five finger discount" and "Who's your favourite clown".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA is not on its way out until the flash card companies stop selling everything but NoPass-RW. Even if so, such a music player would be useful on the DS as well. I've been looking for a music player for my next DS project. Heck even on the PC it might be useful provided that the mixer has a C counterpart.

in most our test-cases, around 10% cpu, peaking at around 15%.  the theoretical speed is somewhere around 1% cpu per active channel, but we don't get that in any practical cases.

<br/>
<br/>
nearest neighbor only as of now, but a linear interpolation innerloop has been written. it's not integrated into the source-base though. By good sound quality, i basicly meant that we retain as much precision as possible. the mixer does some kind of crazy 32 bit unsigned mixing with dc-offset tracking, but the effective precision is 16 bits per channel internally, and is being converted down to 8bit as a last step. we did a dithering-version, but it sounded like shit. I'll look into re-engineering it at some point ;)

The mixer does indeed have a c-counterpart. I've been looking a bit on porting the stuff to DS, bur as I haven't flashed my DS yet, I'll wait a bit with this.

I'm having some issues with the legal department at work (as in them not giving me any feedback), so the licensing is still a bit shaky. I don't really want to do a public release without getting a green light from my employer, as my contract has a paragraph about ownership of code.
<br/>
<br/>
The project has already been green-lighted unformally, so there's not really any real danger of this not going through. I just want the paperwork done in a clean fashion. Even if all would end up failing, I'll still release it - just not with their blessing.

Feel free to do so... The example-thingie can easily be used as a basis (and I guess it would work for some), but i don't intend to maintain an application myself.

It looks like the current API doesn't support playing an additional sound effect (like one particular sample from a mod) mixed in while another mod is playing, does it?  (like for sound effects)

Nope, the api doesn't support it yet. you can still include the mixer-headers and playback itself, but that's quite a nasty hack ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll look into adding it in a clean way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, not yet. Sorry for the lack of activity, but I'm kind of busy making a demo for Breakpoint right now. Anyway, I've changed lots of things, and it's soon time for a new release not too far after easter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here is an example of XM that don't work properly: <a href="http://thoduv.drunkencoders.com/tmp/plays_quite_wrong.xm" target="_blank">http://thoduv.drunkencoders.com/tmp/plays_quite_wrong.xm</a> (note it has been generated from a MIDI file with gmid2mod).
<br/>
Also, I did not try to play it on a "blank" project with no other IRQ/DMA than sound (I've read that some modplayers are incompatible with DMA or HBL irq).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, WinAmp has the same crap going on. I don't know how it sounds in your test, but it might be the song itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would you mind if I add this to the (currently in-the-making) test-suite? That way I'd be able to make sure I don't break it again by accident :)

<br/>
edit: Uhm, no it's the oboe. And it sounds like it could be other issues as well. The player reports missing effects EC and K, as well as volume command A7. Guess it's time to implement note-cut and vibrato. K seems to be a non-existent command, but I'll see if I can just ignore it instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it sound a little wrong with any other player (the mid-&gt;xm conversion lowered the precision of some effects/note/I don't know what), but it sounds very wrong (to the point you can't recognize the theme) with pimpmobile.

No problem: it's not mine: it's a MIDI file from vgmusic.com converted to XM using gmid2mod.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry for the delay in the response. It turns out that the issues I'm talking about is only present in the current SVN HEAD. Pimpmobile R1 plays the tune back pretty much identical to Fasttracker 2 and XMplay (the two players I use for reference - XMplay for convinience, and FT2 since it's the original XM editor). It's important to know that Pimpmobile doesn't do any interpolation, and that changes the sound a bit. FT2 and XMplay both have optional interpolation.
<br/>
<br/>
Neither of the cases (r1 and SVN HEAD) are anywhere near what you describe with "to the point where you can't recognize the theme", so I'm wondering if you are suffering from some integration issue instead...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh well... I tested this music with the example given with pimpmobile, and... it worked.
<br/>
So, this is finally an integration problem, and furthermore, a stupid problem... sound bank: it was only created for one song, then overwritten by the second to be converted, etc. Makefile, I hate you !
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks a lot kusma ! I'm still looking forward any of your awesome player's updates ! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm still glad it was reported, since it has triggered a problem in the SVN HEAD version of the player, and I'll make sure this issue is resolved before releasing the next version.
