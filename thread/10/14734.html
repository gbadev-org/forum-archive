    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To make video game music? I'm talking about just basic music. I'm talking about programs that would allow me to start making Super Mario Bros(the original) style music and after a while move up to more detailed music. So I guess, basically, what program do you guys use to make your music?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends on what the game uses.
<br/>
<br/>
Generally:
<br/>
If it's a tracked format like MOD, S3M, IT or XM it'd be ModPlug Tracker.
<br/>
If it's MIDI-based, it'd be something like Finale or Anvil Studio. MPT can also export to MIDI.
<br/>
If it's streamed, go nuts with Fruityloops and Reason, stuff like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're interested in making actual NES-compatible music through NSF files, check out the NES Music section of the NESdev forums.  There are several options, though I personally have only explored FamiTracker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Start with tracked. Play around with Modplug Tracker. I can get you samples to make the music sound like NES.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
