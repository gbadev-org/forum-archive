    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am thinking of implementing sound in my game, but i am too lazy to write that on my own (because i have no idea about sound programming) and now I am searching for an engine/library that is easy to use and provides features such as midi/mod file playback and normal wave playback (i want to use the midi/mod for background music and the wave sound for effects).
<br/>
<br/>
Any input about sound programming would be appreciated :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">JD, i tried your sound engine and it's really great!
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that the GBA can process stereo sound (my knowledge about the gba sound hardware is quite low :)), but is it really worth using stereo sound? Since the gba sp only got 1 speaker i think it might not really have a large effect on the overall sound...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are varying opinions on this. It would seem that most publish-standard games feature at least <span style="font-weight: bold">some</span> stereo support, even if it's just fixed panning (ie. some channels are 100% in the left side, others are 100% in the right side).
<br/>
<br/>
It has been my experience that the mediocre quality of the GBA headphone jack tends to cause some signal leak from one side into the other anyway, so the benefits of full-panning are debatable. Still, many choose to implement full panning in their mixers.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm. I never payed any attention to whether any of the gba games I own were stereo or not. To me it just seems like a waste of cpu time/resources, unless the stereo sound is communicating something about the game world that the player couldn't know otherwise. I should've said that was an opinion, though.<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok some stories about Krawall :)
<br/>
<br/>
We've now used it in I believe 4 published titles and a few to come out soon (Lord of the Rings - Two Towers and Return of the King,and Sims - Bustin Out, and Digimon Racing.)  Our sound artist loves it due to its good support of MOD style music files.  The interface is very easy to use and the library has a few options to allow for either larger memory foot-print or faster execution.  In high-quality mode (which uses linear interpolation at the mixer level to really improve sound quality), it takes 15-28% of our overall CPU with 16 stereo channels playing at 16Khz.  The varience depends on the music actually playing and the library mode we use.  We've yet to have any weird problems using it which is a big bonus when compared even to the Nintendo Musyx crap.  That and its artist tools pretty nice too.  I've not had much experience with other players though so I'm willing to hear other stories as well :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For a fast-paced action game - stereo is probably a waste.  For a turn-based RPG, not at all.  If you've got the cycles, use them.  It only costs a touch of battery life so why not give to the people who play with head-phones?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is a shame that sound/music still isn't getting much attention imho. It can add SO much to a game, EVEN on Gameboy Advance. Music is perfect to get a player in a certain mood, and subcontiously decide whether he/she finds the game ie. challenging or annoying...
