    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been trying to get some music/sound systems working tonight, but the only succes so far is with Krawall. Nice 'n all, but doesn't play .mod files. 
<br/>
<br/>
I could not get NMod to compile, and then I tried AFM. That compiled fine, but all I hear is a buzzing noise. Has anyone built a simple testapp without all kinds of libraries (DarkFader's stuff for instance?)
<br/>
<br/>
All help is welcome!:)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
psss... you can convert your old 15/31-inst .mod to s3m when needed, search the web for some utility to convert your modules.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.geocities.com/gabriele_scibilia/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/gabriele_scibilia/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am probably gonna stick with Krawall and I know there are some tools around for converting formats. However, I just like to choose between some players.
<br/>
<br/>
And I got a bit annoyed that I simply wasn't able to get them working at all! I don't want to stick with a soundsystem merely because it was the only one I got working, you know...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, Krawall is nice; no doubt. But it isn't the very cheapest (performance wise) I believe, and I simply don't want to spend any money on it.

Call me a cheapskate if you like, but I'm not spending money on such a thing until I actually really need it (and I don't).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
