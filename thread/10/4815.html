    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
I have been dabbling with GBA music and trying to attempt MOD sound loading.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if commercial games use music trackers other than the MOD style. Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how are these files incorporated into the rom?
<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to your input,
<br/>

Many thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can't speak on behalf of commercial developers, but MOD is sort of the "barebones minimum" for playing music on the GBA. Which is not to say that it is insufficient - on the contrary, a good MOD player is capable of playing the music from most GBA games, I expect - but it requires the most work from the composer and encoder to make their music conform to a rigorous format, and it may be inefficient in other respects as well.
<br/>
<br/>
More flexible and complicated formats that extend the limitations of MOD include XM, S3M and IT. (There are others too; those three are the ones that come to mind, though.)
<br/>
<br/>
MIDI is kind of a different beast. Although composers love it, it's less friendly to programmers, I believe, and I think might be frustrating when working with the hardware. YMMV.
<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I've written a MOD player and find it more than sufficient for my needs. You obviously need to decide based on what you expect your needs to be.

They must be encoded by a custom program to convert from the source format to the raw binary data the music player needs. (If you write a music player for a format like MOD that adheres to the file specification as well as the general music-playing specification then you would be able to append the files directly on, although this would usually mean both including extraneous data and losing the opportunity to compress.)

<br/>
<br/>
I have become familiar with the 4-channel MOD file quality. I just downloaded a few of the other formats you mentioned such as the .XM , .IT  and .S3M and was quite impressed at the huge improvement in quality.
<br/>
<br/>
Would I have to write my own program which converts the MOD file into a raw format or are there any available on the web?
<br/>
<br/>
I guess that this converter would basically pick out the 'juicy bits' and disregard things like sample names, headers and stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">People write converters to adapt the music file to the specific needs of their player. You won't find a converter unless there's a player it converts toward.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you're writing your own player then you may as well write your own converter as well. It's pretty unlikely that you can learn the intracies of a music format without figuring out how to parse the file while you're at it.

Either that, or every GBA music format under the sun is theoretically GSF. It's an existential question.

<br/>
<br/>
1. Midi based composition
<br/>
2. Mod based composition

3. Proprietory composition tools + engines.

<br/>
It really depends on the developer and what overheads they have with ROMs, CPU ... etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't compress samples, there's not much memory in the GBA to try to decompress them on the fly, it's quicker to stream them from the ROM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The GSF format is just essentially a rip of a GBA rom, designed only to play the music and nothing else.  Most games seem to use the sappy engine.  Then there is krawall, apex audio, shinen, and of course other proprietary drivers that I have dealt with.  The easiest ones to rip, are those songs that use a function that initializes a song by its number.  This includes Sappy, Apex.  Shinen GAX, and Krawall use rom pointers,  which means that unless the developers wrote their own select by number functions, they are that much more of a pain to rip.  Many newer games are continuing to use the sappy engine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
