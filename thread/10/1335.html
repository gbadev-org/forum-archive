    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It doens't, the GBA basically doesnt have a seperate 'processor' for sound, it has two outputs, for left and right and the main CPU gives it the sound for those outputs.
<br/>
<br/>
So what im saying is that it doesnt support MIDI but you can write your own interpreter and mixer to play it.

Tepples; this question has come up twice now, should you include it in the FAQ or? Anyways its up to you ;) just a suggestion.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've added information about tracked music formats (mid, mod, xm, s3m) to the FAQ.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm thinking of splitting the FAQ into sections: one for graphics, one for audio, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At first I used various sources (mikmod and fmod docs mainly) handling

modules playback routines filling a mono single buffer (GBA implementing

details later) with songs being played at wrong rates/frequencies, FASTER AS I DECREMENT THE (RE)SAMPLING FREQ.

My "sound culture" is really poor (as my english) and I soon realized I've

to code it using double buffering techniques hoping it resolves my playback
