<br/>
I dont exactly understand how it works, but as far as I known
<br/>
the note shouldn't be retrigged, what about if it is an another instrument?
<br/>
is the target equal to that instruments finetune/relative note then?
<br/>
and if glissando is turned on do this mean that I only should make bigger jumps or that I should jump to semitones, for example if I play a C-5 and do the portamento up 1 unit, then If I do 300 with glissando should it jump to C#5 or C#5 + 1 portamento unit
<br/>
<br/>
some info would be great, or a doc that explains the effects more in detail then fmoddoc.txt does.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
