    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was looking at the BeLogic example on how to use sound on the GBA and it worked great. The problem comes in when I want to use my own sounds.
<br/>
<br/>
I decided just to "borrow" a sound from the AAS examples and see if i could use it (its Ambulance.wav), and I use this tool "objcopyroda off the devrs.com/gba website. Its what was told to use when converting sounds. Well, it doesn't work. I see a te screen for a little while, then it disappears. I checked the file and its in the PCM format. So whats wrong?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
