    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a gba cart that is kind of broken, it won't save. (trust me I've tried everything it's a hardware problem) It's nearly useless for playing games. 
<br/>
<br/>
So I figured I'd turn it into a music player. I know mod is crappy, but using it is the only way for me to fit a substantial amount of songs on my cart, it takes the least memory.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to convert mp3 -&gt; wav -&gt; mod, with zero success, I've used about 20 different audio tools. Can anybody guide me on how to do this task? I don't care about how easy it is to do or how much quality will suffer, I don't even need a GUI for the roms, I just want it to sound like the mp3.
<br/>
<br/>
Your ideas are appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While you can convert an MP3 (or similar format) to MOD, the only thing that will change from that is how it is played, and the requirements to play it. The MOD file will still be bloated because it will have contained simple sequencing information, and one large waveform sample, which is the music itself.
<br/>
<br/>
To make it short, MOD and MP3 are 2 completely separate formats, and chances of there being a true MP3-&gt;Mod converter to take advantage of what MOD offers is so slim, you'd think there was no chance.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why convert to MOD? Even though it *is* possible, there's no reason to. Just play the WAV file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">an mp3 converted to wav and then to mod would make the filesize X times larger than the mp3 was because you essentially are left with just one huge wav. mod file sizes are small because they are the actual song compositions themselves. mod files contain all the note, etc. data and everything in individual channels.
