    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all.  I am wondering if anyone knows of a good music composition program for the GBA that works for Mac OS X.  It seems like most people are using Boyscout, but I don't think that it works for mac.  People seem really satisfied with it, and I would like to use it, or a similar program.  From what I understand, the GBA allows you to use the same sounds as the GB.  Does Boyscout allow you to write using these sounds?  Any help is appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PlayerPRO, while now abandonware, is probably one of the best programs out there, and it's free, so it's worth a look.

It exports to all common formats (MOD, S3M, MIDI, etc.).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you for the help.  The program works great.  The only problem is that I don't know where to get the .sfil files for the instruments.  Is there a program that allows you to extract them from other sound files?  Or possibly an archive of common sounds in .sfil format?  I couldn't find any good PlayerPRO forums (probably because it is abandonware) so I am posting my question here.  Thank you again for the help so far, and also for whatever help you all give me now.

These are type "System 7 Sound", used for system sounds from Mac OS 7 through 9. They contain a 'snd ' resource in the resource fork. SoundApp might be able to convert an AIFF or WAV file to System 7 Sound.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all.  Sorry about the delayed response, I have been gone from the computer for a week or so.  I have one last question about PlayerPRO (again, there seem to be no active forums for it, so this seems like the only place I can post questions).  I am wondering if there is a program that allows the user to open a pre-existing wav file (or any other type of file) and export one of the instruments from that song.  Is this possible?  I haven't been able to find any good instrument archives online (I am probably the worst google user in existence), so it would be great if I could take pre-existing songs and take their instruments for my own songs.  If there is no program that can do this, then can someone recommend a good online instrument sound archive?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, lets be theoretical for a second.  Let's say that I have a song that is not copyrighted, and/or that I have the author's permission to use parts of the song in my song (like it is a friend of mine or something), and/or that I will be the only one to see the song, i.e it will not be released or published ANYWHERE except on my own computer for my own ears.  Then, in that case, theoretically speaking, is there a program that would let me extract instruments to use for my own use?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In other words, you can extract instruments out of files that contain composed musical data in them. MOD, MIDI, S3M, XM, etc. These all contain the instrument samples embedded in them (except MIDI which relies on an external sound bank).
<br/>
<br/>
Files that contain raw sound, such as WAV, MP3, etc. have no knowledge of the individual instruments or their orchestration, so you won't be able to distinguish multiple instruments playing at the same time.

I have always wondered if you can remove something panned off centre by altering the orientation of the songs panning and then readjusting. Should work technically.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

in those cases, it's usually quite simple to get a render of only the instruments from the composer himself, so that shouldn't be an issue. but if you're serious about using high quality samples, there are good commercial sample-packs out there. otherwise, there's allways sites like freesound.iua.upf.edu, but you might need to browse for a while before you find something good there...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
