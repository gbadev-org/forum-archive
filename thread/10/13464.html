    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm able to play some wav files with my sound engine but some others just don't play at all. When I compare the working wavs with non working ones, I'm unable to find the problem. For example, I have 2 sounds with the following specs:
<br/>
<br/>
Mono
<br/>
8 bits
<br/>
44 khz
<br/>
352 kbps
<br/>
<br/>
One plays, the other one doesn't. Is there any other sound attributes that I should take care of?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
