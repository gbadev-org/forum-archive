    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heya. I have tried to make the latest public gba release of NMOD (1.3c) work with DevkitARM. My test binary runs perfect, but there is no sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I have done:
<br/>
<br/>
- nmod.s has been compiled into the project with -mthumb-interwork
<br/>
- I have removed the "extern "C""'s from nmodgcc.h because my project is in C, not C++.
<br/>
- I have added the IWRAM_CODE attribute to NMOD_Timer1iRQ
<br/>
- I have set volume and inited the interupt
<br/>
- I used the standard DKARM crt0 and lnkscript.
<br/>
<br/>
Have anybody got a recent example of how to incorporate nmod into your DKARM project?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: This has been solved.
<br/>
<br/>
Cause for malfunction: Broken binary converter.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now all that's left is a little flickering in the HBlank Interrupts (gah!). Oh well, I guess that it's a question about that, and then not as good sound quality (FRAS didn't play the MOD very well).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
