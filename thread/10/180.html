    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found the same problem - it sounds ok on the emulators, just as it sounds in the tracker, but sadly the sound doesn't seem to work the same on the real thing :( A real shame as it's a great idea and very flexible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seems lots of people are having audio problems on this forum.  Unfortunatly people are writing examples/libraries and making it work on the emulators presumably because more people are coding on emus without real hardware to test it on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've stuck with the CodeWaves modplayer so far - it does all i need it to, and its simple to use. But then i made a couple of tracks with the BoyScout tracker but i can't use them on the hardware! Anybody skilled enough to rewrite the playback code for it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the playback code comes as a C source file with the package. i'd have a go at it myself, but i'm bogged down with an AI project :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
