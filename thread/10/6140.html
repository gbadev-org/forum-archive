Moral: Don't save audio for last. Have at least some GBC style bleeps and bloops even before you decide on a mixer engine.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you know what's supposed to be going on, you'll often percieve it as such. However, when presented with an abstract, unfamiliar game situation (Imagine those two balls were in something like E-Motion, or JezzBall), you wouldn't know whether they collided or passed through each other.
<br/>
<br/>
An interesting fact is that although sound is important, the graphics are what tell you what is going on and how you need to react to it. 'ting' or no, balls are moving from the top corners to the middle, and from the middle to the bottom corners, sound doesn't change that.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... maybe if it were faster, I would experience the illusion more strongly.  As it is, I see the objects interpenetrate for too long to see them as bouncing.  If I really try, I can sort of percieve that there's a small solid core in the center of each ball, and that those are the parts that are bouncing, but it's a stretch.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, on my set up at least, the balls pause after the collision when sound is active, spoiling the effect somewhat. But don't get me wrong, the effect is noticeable, and sound effects are something that I wish I could do better.

<br/>
They are the hardest thing to do IMO. Doodling a few gfx it's easy enough to produce something not too offensive to the eye, but trying to create a sound that isn't an irritating buzz, screach or beep is nigh on impossible. Even worse, play a NES (or some 8-bit platform of your choice, except maybe the Spectrum! ;)) game, and most of the sounds are cute tinkles, squeeks and 'boings' -  the GBA should (is) capable of doing the same without relying on 10kb pcm files, but it's a very black art.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Black art? Heck no. Everything you always wanted to know about the GBA's tone generators* is explained at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.belogic.com/gba/" target="_blank">The Audio Advance</a>.

What I mean is that figuring out what to put in the various sound registers to produce something that is pleasing isn't as immediately obvious as saying "that's a nice shade of blue for my main character's t-shirt" and doodling a few pixels.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
