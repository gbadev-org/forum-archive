    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm building a combined Sudoku and Memory-game (the latter being the famous game in which you pick two cards each time and have to try to find matching ones). Graphics are on their way, the game engine is up and running, but music, I have no idea how to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
Not technically, I haven't tried yet but I'm sure I can program that. But my ear for music, well, have you seen those people in An American Idol? Speaking in the words of Simon: "absolutely horrendous", that describes best my musicality.
<br/>
<br/>
The game I am developing will require a sort of long-during music, something that you can bear to listen to for, say, an hour. Not an hour-long composition, but the assumption is that the game doesn't evolve into higher levels. For example, Mario games have different tunes for different types of levels. But different types of levels are not really Sudoku-like. So, tunes that can run into eachother, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone less musically-challenged on this forum that would like to share their work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, that would be the adequate term for it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I don't want to use anything that would have a license restricting me from using it. I understand that elevator music is not the most exciting thing to compose, but maybe someone has pleasure in it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't decided on the license yet. It will be as free as it gets, probably GPL. Or maybe the NASA Open Source Agreement, just to make it seem as if this is some NASA-engineered thing (note: it is not!), which seems cool enough by itself. 
<br/>
<br/>
The format needs to be a usable format. From what I've gleaned, most reasonable formats can be used or converted for a GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can probably do something in MIDI format if you really just need a piece of music to go by. I'm afraid I'm no tracker, as I prefer a score with real staffs to work on, so you'll have to find someone to convert it by hand for you if you want it to play in a tracker-based music engine, which is much more common (and faster CPU wise) then decoding MIDI files directly.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want something you won't need a license to play, it will need to be originally composed. I would recommend checking out the guys as VGMusic.com. (go to the forums there.) If you post your request there, you will likely get some compositions back as replies. Mostly MIDI format, but like I said that can be dealt with easilly.

By putting an adapter API over the playback library, it can later be replaced with something else if need be.

Just kidding, although that would be cool.

Maybe just add a music infusing program?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
