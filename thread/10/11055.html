    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, I've just compiled the example that comes with Krawall, but although I dont get a single error or warning, it refuses to work; when I load the bin file on VisualBoyAdvance I just hear a few clicks at the start, and then nothing.
<br/>
I'm using DevKitAdv, and here are the contents of my make.bat file I'm using to compile it:
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
  set path=C:\gba\devkitadv\bin
<br/>
  gcc -mthumb -mthumb-interwork -o example.elf main.c samples.s secondpm.s krawall.lib
<br/>
  objcopy -O binary example.elf example.bin
<br/>
</span>
<br/>
Can anyone see if I'm doing something wrong when compiling?
<br/>
Thanks a lot!
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had this problem, and the issue was not the makefile, but the fact that my s3m file was using 16-bit samples. Krawall only supports 8-bit samples, so double check that. Also, it would help to see your code as well, as sometimes the issue (if it\'s not that) is more apparent there. The fact that it compiled and appears to produce sound of some kind is a good indicator that the makefile works right, as long as it\'s recieving the right file.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, it's Krawall's example, with no changes at all, what I'm trying to get working, so I assume both the samples and the code are right :(
<br/>
Any more ideas?
