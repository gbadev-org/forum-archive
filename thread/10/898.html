    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am quite interested in using sound on the GBA but I really know nothing of sound programming in general (I have simply never done any).  I wonder about the high sound quality you have in games (such as Golden Sun), because the original Gameboy has a very poor sound quality and I understand that the GBA has the same 4 sound channels as its predecessor, as well as 2 channels for WAV files.  WAV files take far too much place to make anything more than sound effects, I would assume.  Therefore, what is the trick to getting high quality sounds and music out of the system ?  Does it take some kind of SPC/MOD/IT format to do the job ?  Then, what about those Mod tracker programs ?  I found one, but it seems like it would take hours to enter a melody manually.  Is this the way it is done or are conversion programs in common use (like MIDI to SPC ?) which would enable you to type up sheet music in a MIDI editing program and convert it ?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for asking so many questions, but I really have no idea how it all works, and I would be interested in learning about the way it is done, to be able to put some good quality music and sound effects into a game someday.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. A user can create .mod, .s3m, .xm, and .it files with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.modplug.com/" target="_blank">Modplug Tracker</a>.

Doesn't it take hours to enter a melody manually with MIDI too?

I've opened .mid files and saved them in .xm format with Modplug Tracker, but last time I did it, Modplug Tracker's .mid importer was a bit rough around the edges.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So MOD files are actually the best way of making music on the GBA then?  I had about the same questions as Shadow, but I seem to have the answers now...
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I would like to code my own MOD player for GBA, but I need to know a few things, and was wondering if I could get some help.
<br/>
<br/>
I searched far and wide, and was unable to find any details on how a MOD file is built, or how it works...  I would need that to code anything.  :(
<br/>
<br/>
When and if I get this thing coded, would I be using the GBC sound systems, or would I be using the Direct Sound system for playback?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would use Dsound.  In general, if you want to use the tone generators in addition to Dsound, you normally use a format other than .mod, possibly something home-grown.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
