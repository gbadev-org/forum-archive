i was just wonder if anyone has played around with the SP system and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.littlesounddj.com/" target="_blank">http://www.littlesounddj.com/</a> ... (to know if the wav channel sounds ok)
<br/>
<br/>
i figure the SP will have the same sound architecture as the GBA but you never know if i'd be in for a pleasnt surprise.

<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know if there are any plans for making a GBA version of lsdj</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Jaggie: Actually, the GBC sounds quite horriffic too compared to the old "brick" GB. That is unless you have modded your GBC to feature the bass sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally i think that the GBA SP sounds a lot better than the GBA and the GBC, it has a much more mellow sound beaten only by the original GB.
