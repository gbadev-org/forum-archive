This file analyses an audio file to show you a distribution of sound pressure, which is basically the difference between one sample and the next.
<br/>
<br/>
What you'll find is that you can represent sound in a format based on Pressure instead of Sound Waves using less bits.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand compression but am not comfortable with it enough to pursue my findings.
<br/>
<br/>
This program works only with 16-bit UNCOMPRESSED data
<br/>

<br/>
This file was created because I have believed for years that you can better represent sound using relative data instead of linear. This has confirmed my beliefs (although it's nothing new, 1-bit sampling is based on this philosiphy).
<br/>
<br/>
As for my representation of a wave, I believe that a simple set of vectors that closely follow the waves will draw a simple picture of the wave. Low-bit data will then correct that, for example:
<br/>

The diagram's plus signs represents a basic Vector. The periods are simply so that it LOOKS like a wave. Low Bit data will then fill in the important variations instead of a FAT 16-bit value.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True, audio tends to have sample-to-sample correlation. Taking the differential between samples removes this correlation, resulting in smaller numbers to feed to the quantizer and coder.

I've worked with 1-bit sampling on the NES, and it was horrid. Because it used a fixed step size, waveforms would either distort ("slope overload") or have horrible hissing as the reconstructed waveform goes up and down over the original ("granular noise"). Here's a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ece.drexel.edu/commweb/dm.html" target="_blank">picture of what I'm talking about</a>. Various ADPCM (adaptive delta pulse code modulation) schemes improve on this by using automatic gain control on the differences; to learn how, download the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#8ad" target="_blank">8ad codec</a> and read the source code.
<br/>
<br/>
And this "simple set of vectors that closely follow the waves" is in effect a downsampled version of the original waveform. Storing the downsampled version along with the differences between this downsampled version and the original waveform is called "sub-band coding" or "wavelet coding"; MP2 audio uses a form of this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nowadays 1-bit coding is sampled at 5Mhz, so instead of a hiss there is sonic noise. But I would treat 0101 and 1010 as either 0101, or 0000 by letting the next bit decide. For example if the next bit was 0 then 0101 is 0000, and if it was 1 then 0101 is 0101.
<br/>
<br/>
Well as for the sound analysis, I've tested it on various wave forms and am pretty shocked with the results. e.g. I expected noise to have a near equal distribution but instead it had a slight weight on either side of low and high differences.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
