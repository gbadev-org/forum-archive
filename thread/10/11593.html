    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to figure out how to calculate the time in seconds/miliseconds when a note in a mod is played.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, my song has tempo of  125 with 5 ticks/row - and  total of 64 rows (per pattern)
<br/>
<br/>
So on row 30 (of pattern 1) a note is played - say C-5 Sample 1 - how can I calculate in seconds or miliseconds, the time until that note is played?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  Maybe it is as simple as .02 seconds per tick??  So if 5 ticks/row - then that it .1 seconds per row so 30th row would be 3 seconds?  But I don't see how tempo plays into that...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tempo tells how long each tick lasts. There are (2.5/tempo) seconds per tick.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Thats exactly what I wanted to know.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess my calculations worked out because I was using .02 and my tempo is set 125.
