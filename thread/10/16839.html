<br/>
<br/>
I was playing FFI&amp;II: Dawn of Souls [GBA], and rather liked the harp being used, as it sounds really nice and hasn't been used in the previous games. I was wondering if anyone has found a harp similar to it, or where it was sampled off? You can have a listen to it by looking for FFI&amp;II videos on YouTube.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW:
<br/>
'XMid-DS' has been renamed to 'XMid' and the GBA version named 'XMid-AGB'. Work on XMid-AGB is 100% complete, but I'm still working on a DS version that works with DKP ARM7+9 templates.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can you tell me which part of the game you heard it in?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, you hear it in many of the FFI songs, mainly 'Prelude' and the final song before Chaos (don't know its name). Not sure if it's 'safe'/legal to upload the samples, that's why.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
