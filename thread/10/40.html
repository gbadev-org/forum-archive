    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been coding on a new version of NMOD.
<br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know, NMOD is a fast (10% cpu usage for 6 channels 16kHz!), in stereo, music MOD replayer for GBA with 2 sfx channels.
<br/>
<br/>
This version hasn't been released yet, but these are the changes that will be done:
<br/>
- Update sound buffers at the users choice.
<br/>
  Not during timer1 interrupt anymore, but after vblank or before vblank...
<br/>
 (useful for scanline effects, or just heavy cpu intensive rendering.)
<br/>
- Support for multiple playing frequencies (6kHz, 8kHz, 11kHz,16kHz,22kHz,32kHz,44kHz).
<br/>
- Support for 2 sfx channels.
<br/>
<br/>
In short, this will make a perfect sound solution for your game/demo.
<br/>
And fast!
<br/>
<br/>
There is one down side though, because of personal reasons I cannot release sourcecode anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Update soon - keep on track!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">.. but I'm a novice, and I have a lot of problems when I try to integrate it into my environment.
<br/>
I use the whole Dooby's gbalib project template (for IRQ and crts+lnkscript), gcc 3.0.2 under win32.
<br/>
Have you got some tip for me? ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
