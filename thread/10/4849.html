    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok not really a "modded" Gameboy, but I have an Xport2 (www.charmedlabs.com") that has 16MB of RAM. that Ive got plugged into the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
My goal is to decode AAC externally (on the Xport) but play it through the GBA.  Since the audio would already be uncompressed ready-to-go, could it be placed in the GBA's audio buffer directly or would the data still need to be converted to another (GBA) format at runtime?
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA native audio format is signed 8-bit mono PCM; stereo uses two separate streams. You can probably easily coax your AAC decoder into outputting this format.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Fortunately, the ouput is PCM...
<br/>
<br/>
but it seems most of the (source code) examples/demos Ive seen convert the wav file to an .h file and compile it with the mainline code and then access it as you would any variable...
<br/>
<br/>
BUT...
<br/>
<br/>
in general, I just need to read the wav data into local memory (RAM) and then send it to the sound chip, correct?  Would that cause any syncing problems between how fast I read from external and write out to the audio?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
