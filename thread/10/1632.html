    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am just wondering if it would be possible to have a quasi-MP3 player using this method. Using WinAMP's diskwriter module, you could uncompress MP3 files to WAV files, then convert them to 8 bit, mono WAV files. Once this is completed, is there a way to compress these files (since WAV files are usually pretty big) in a readable GBA format? Are there tools that will automate the WAV to GBA conversion process? Or do you simply store them as is on the GBA? Will they be playable? If I'm not mistaking, the GBA cpu runs at 133mhz. I'm no expert in this matter, but I had an old Pentium computer that had enough power to play MP3s. Is this a CPU problem or a sound device thats not powerful enough? I'm really interested in this matter and would like to see what I can come up with!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a million for your answers and suggestions! Even links on the matter would be appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Someone has created a program that automates the MP3 -&gt; GBA sound file conversion. Does anyone know how to do this manually? Using what tools? Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To convert an MP3 file to a GBA ROM manually:
<br/>
1. Convert the MP3 file to a mono .wav file with Zinf beta, Winamp, XMMS, mpg321, or any other MP3 decoder.
<br/>
2. Downsample the .wav file from 44100 Hz to 18157 Hz using some sort of resampling tool.
<br/>
3. Use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#8ad" target="_blank">8ad tools</a> to convert the .wav file to a .8ad (Pin Eight ADPCM format) file, and then put that in a GBA ROM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Stupid question... Is there source code for a GBA ROM available that's basically a menu system? Lets say I want to put 15 songs in a single ROM, will the GBA support it? If so, do I need to code a menu to be able to change songs, or is all that done automatically? I downloaded the demo of GBAlpha Walkman (link posted in previous post) and it has a nice menu and you can select the song... It had a full song and the rom was just over 5 MB. The quality was very acceptable! Isn't there a tool yet that automates these steps? (Other than GBalpha walkman)
<br/>
<br/>
Using the GBA as a quasi-MP3 player... thats just too cool! And no need to buy the 99$ add-on... This is my goal... And I'll make it freeware. I don't believe in charging money for these kind of applications.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PogoShell can do this, provided that you have a supported flash cart.

You can do this with PogoShell: put each song in a separate ROM. Future versions of the 8ad demo player will support multiple recordings as well.

You still need to buy the [url=http://www.success-hk.com/pp/item_detail.asp?itemID={B8CD332E-7B48-408B-9A2D-DA3DBA5E46E0}]$130 add-on[/url] unless you only want to run the ROM in an emulator, and in that case, you might as well just use Winamp.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great, thanks for the info, I'll dig deeper PogoShell-wise... And yes, thanks for pointing that out, I had omitted to mention that the Flash card was necessary!
<br/>
<br/>
Now the only downside that I can see with having a single song per rom, is that it will not keep on playing and loop/repeat... I'd like to use my GBA as a music player when I go skiing, biking, etc... No moveable parts, what else could you ask for!!! I got in touch with the creator of GBalpha Walkman... He's still working on the english version, I'm trying to see if I can't help him finish it. His menu system is really nice, I like that demo! I don't care for the kareoke part of it, just the player...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
