    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to do audio synthesis on the GBA? I want:
<br/>
<ul>Stereo audio
<br/>
Each channel to have up to four basic waveforms
<br/>
Noise generator and background sampled sound</ul>
<br/>
The program will have to do nothing else but a menu to control it.
<br/>
Is the GBA's 16.7MHz fast enough to cope with this? (I presume I will have to stick with fast integer math and lookup tables)
<br/>
How would I go about it? Would I have to use an extra buffer?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to mess with them, I believe the 4 compatability channels from the old GB can do them. The first two are pretty much set, the 4th is noise, and I think the 3rd you can define your own waveform. I'm unsure about this of course. If thats the music you need to work with, you can use them. Alternateively, you could always include the waveforms yourself and use the directsound channels. I think the 4 compatability channels are generally frowned upon around here, so that might be a better way to go.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think your better off generating the basic waveforms using an algorithm like Flubba suggests, since then you can define the characteristics required on the fly, such as velocity, frequency, amplitude etc. Also, playing raw samples would require a accurate timer to calculate when the next sample should play, and there will be a clicking sound between them if the samples arn't played exactly after each other or without interpolation.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
