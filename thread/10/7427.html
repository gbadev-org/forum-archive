    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, after fighting with Krawall for awhile, I'm about to give up and switch to AAS -- losing a little flexibility with my music formats.
<br/>
<br/>
But before I do, I wanted to see if anyone here has run into this....in Krawall, all of my sound effects seem to be playing at about half volume.
<br/>
<br/>
I have verified that the sound wav peaks out at maximum amplitute, made sure the volume in the respective mod file is at peak, and set 
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">kramSetSFXVol(256);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I can't seem to find any other places to "turn up the volume" for the sound effects.   
<br/>
<br/>
Running the same sound effect through AAS yields more reasonable volumes, so I can verify that the problem is not that the original sound file is too quiet.  
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe if you'll look in the documentation, there is a second function for playing sounds that allows you to specify volume, panning, and such.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I had seen that one, but it didn't do the trick either.
<br/>
<br/>
What I finally found was the function kramSetMasterVol(), which was not documented in the Krawall API reference manual.  The default is 128, but you can pump all the sound up to 255, if everything is too quiet.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to mention it in case anyone else has trouble with this.  And now I guess I can finally decide to stick with Krawall instead of switching to AAS 
<br/>
<br/>
(AAS really seems nicer in some ways, but it's so dang picky about what types of music files it allows...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another thing to watch out for is panning in your S3M: sounds that are played all in the left or right channel can get surprisingly quiet. For a recent project I worked on, the musician ended up having to get rid of all of their panning for that reason.
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you're mostly concerned with sound effects, though. But I thought I'd mention this.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess the trick with panning is to keep the audio at roughly 2/3 or something and make fully panned sounds full, so as to reduce the effect.
<br/>
<br/>
I always believe that if a musician is going to write music for a game, they should be able to fairly easily test the music with the game's sound engine somehow.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
