I know one tool called MKS4AGB,Its an Nintendo Official Product but you get that NO WHERE.
<br/>

<br/>
I meant to say that,If you already have a compiled GBA and want to insert a MIDI file onto it. How do you do that?
<br/>
<br/>
And another thing I wanted to know is how to add sound to my Game,But Tepples answered that already.
<br/>
I'll try to get those tools to start making like a type of jukebox to try and test out the sound stuff.

<br/>
<br/>
Me and my teammates have acquired some official Nintendo development stuff. This includes the MIDI-based music engine used in so many GBA games commonly known as Sappy.
<br/>
<br/>
MKS4AGB is Sappy's main conversion program.
<br/>
<br/>
Husky is an ignorant fool because he -knows- very damn well that MKS4AGB and the Sappy playback library are official, professional tools that most of the people here, as far as I can tell, can only have proverbial wet dreams about.
<br/>
<br/>
I consider myself lucky to know how to use this library.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Some background info on Husky, he's also known as Scixzor and is banned from several other forums on account of being an incurable dumbass on many levels. I don't mean to flame, but it's true.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is only a step 2 if by some miracle the developers do give you the source code.  This would be incorporate a midi playback engine into the game, include the midi file, set up code to play it where you want it played, then recompile the rom.   The chances of getting to doing step 2 based on developer giving you the source code is slim to none.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, games using the Sappy engine are relatively easy to insert new songs into.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have the kit, you can only insert data from other Sappy games. Find the song's header and each track and dump all of these. For each "GOTO" or "PATT" command (one byte each), subtract the track's starting offset from the pointer that follows to make them relative in a way. Then, reinsert each track in some free space of the target rom and add the new track offsets to each GOTO and PATT command to make them absolute again. Find the Master Song Table and make one of the entries point to your new song's header.
<br/>
<br/>
If you -do- have the kit, you can just convert a midi, edit the .s file to have absolute offsets, compile it with DevKitARM and insert it into the file as described above.
<br/>
<br/>
I even wrote some tools to aid in this: Juicer and Fruitf*cker.
<br/>
<br/>
I have said too much now ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You're a moron. The GBA BIOS sound driver is rubbish, and can be defecated upon from a great height by Apex or Krawall, or a dozen others for that matter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Granted.

Husky-chan: If you're trying to perform what is called "ROM hacking" (inserting your own content into a proprietary commercial ROM), there are other boards for this. If you're not trying to hack a ROM, PM me with a full explanation and I'll unlock this.
