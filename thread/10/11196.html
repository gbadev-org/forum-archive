Is it possible to sit someone down in front of a midi keyboard and get the computer to record a mod?  My guess is yes, now that I think about it.  Pianists are easier to find than geeky pattern based music composers. =)

Do you know if there is a way to edit a MOD file visually? I like to be able to see it in patterns and all, but it\'s much easier for me to compose music by looking at real notes on a staff. Does one exist? If not, how difficult would it be do write one do you suppose?

I don't think it will be too hard. But if the music is not quantized and follows an irregular form like dre style broken chords then you will have trouble annotating it. The same goes for swing.
<br/>
<br/>
Packages like cubase will display a quantized version of your track to some degree. And there are plenty of free scoring programs so at least one has to be open source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Really, the only odd timing I would need would be triplets, and these can be accomplished by arranging the event timings in multiples of 6 or 12, to accomidate both regular timings and triplets to some extent. The only thing really preventing me from writing my own is a lack of knowledge of the s3m file format. If I could get some of that info, I would do this no prob.

Arpeggios can be encoded with "note delay" effects. I don't use .mod so I don't know its effect codes, but note in .s3m the code for delay a note by 1 tick is SD1, for two ticks is SD2, etc. If you're grouping multiple tracks into a staff, just draw the chord and put a wavy line to its left; that's the common practice notation symbol for arpeggio.
<br/>
<br/>
What trackers call "arpeggio" is something completely different, more akin to tremolo, which also has its own symbol in CPN.

<br/>
There are three ways to handle swing: note delay (as above), changes in the "speed" (ticks per row) parameter per row, and setting the 12th note (i.e. 8th note triplet) as the row.

OctaMED was ported to PC and renamed MED Soundstudio. Unfortunately it never got passed v1.6 and was buggy as hell. I was a beta tester for it for about 4 years then I realised it was never going to make the elusive v2 so I gave up. There is a short article on it on <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octamed" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>. RIP OctaMED, I'll miss you! *sniff*<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wow. OK, time to make history then I guess. Be it buggy as hell, I need something to make it work, otherwise I am going to go mad. I appreciate that there are converters and such, but I have never found them to be good enough to use for my purposes. OK, one last question I think.
<br/>
<br/>
I\'ve looked at these specs before and they are great for reading a file. However, how would I go about actually writing one? What is absolutely required to make a .s3m (or any mod file I guess, since they appear to be so similar) play?
