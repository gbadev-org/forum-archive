    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have some midi files that I want to convert to digital modules, but I've run into a sort of wall. I know converting with Modplug still requires some editing of the output because the conversion isn't perfect, but my problem is that I want them to use samples from a soundbank that I currently use for midi playback on my PC. It says that Modplug supports soundbanks, but they don't ever seem to be used when I import them in.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know how to deal with this situation?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you using SF2 or something? In the past I've gone to the trouble of extracting the samples myself (using some forgotten Linux tools) and importing them the traditional way.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't used ModPlug much at all so this is just a wild guess, but are you sure the instruments are mapped right? After import, check to make sure they appear in the instruments list and the numbers in the tracks correspond to the correct instrument numbers. (It's shenanigans like that that in other trackers that made me extract/load them manually.)
<br/>
<br/>
You might have better luck converting your sound bank from whatever format it's in to .xi or .iti assuming ModPlug recognizes those. I think Awave Studio comes recommended for this.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Another thing you could do is, depending on your target platform, find a Midi player. If you're coding for the GBA, I can make you one easily, but if you're on the DS, sorry but I'm not familiar with it yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm. I thought there was a useful freeware version. There must be something up to the task anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awave Studio's "freeware" version is a 30-day demo that IIRC, lets you save instruments but not collections (multiple instruments in a single file (like a .dls file))</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's also a neat little program called "MIDI2XM" that converts Midi files to XM files, as long as you tell it what XM instruments to use for what patch. Dunno where I found it though...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
I found it. You can get it from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.un4seen.com/" target="_blank">http://www.un4seen.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got sound fonts to work fine in Modplug. I managed to convert a midi in Modplug tracker, set all the instruments from a sound font and import it into a GBA game I was working on (Using pimpmobile) and it sounded fine.
<br/>
<br/>
You right click on the left of the screen where you see all the folders and instruments, then click on "Add Soundfont" then you load your soundfont (I used .sf2 soundfonts) then it will appear as a folder.
<br/>
<br/>
Now in your converted midi, you can go to the instruments panel then you can drag instruments from the soundfont's folder into the waveform section of the instrument panel. All the mappings etc should be done automatically if it's a decent soundfont.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
