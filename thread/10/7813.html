    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just wondering if this replay can be made to work on a GBA. I wrote it for Java mobile devices originally, but it seems mobile sound is not quite there yet. Converted to ANSI C in a fit of boredom (quite common these days...)

It uses a tiny amount of memory, has very good quality, and should be pretty quick as well. There's an SDL test program and linux binaries in the archive.
<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of a solution in search of a problem :)
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that looks like you could run it on GBA just fine. All you need to do is set up a simple double buffer playing on one of the hardware channels, and call the mod update just like you do from the SDL callback.
<br/>
<br/>
The first issue of my <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.gbadev.org/program/sound1.html" target="_blank">sound tutorial</a> covers setting up such a double buffer, and you can ask here if you have any trouble getting it to work (assuming you haven't done much GBA coding before).<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
