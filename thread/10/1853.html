    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool Edit's bit rate reduction introduces less noise if you follow these tips I picked up when arranging songs for s3m:<ul><li>DON'T use noise shaping. Noise shaping is designed for sampling frequencies greater than 32 kHz. In some cases, you may not even need to dither the sample at all.</li><li>If apparent signal-to-noise ratio is more important than headroom, increase the volume of your samples. Use a limiter (Effects &gt; Amplitude &gt; Dynamics Processing or Effects &gt; Amplitude &gt; Hard Limiting), or possibly even an overdrive (Effects &gt; Special &gt; Distortion). If the sound is louder before you truncate it, it'll sound louder compared to the -45 dBFS noise floor of 8-bit linear PCM.</li><li>If necessary, use a higher sample frequency.</li><li>Bury the sample in a mix. If multiple instruments are filling the acoustic space, the listener typically won't notice the roundoff noise.</li><li>Don't edit the sample once it's 8-bit. Keep a 16-bit version handy for when you want to make changes.</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
