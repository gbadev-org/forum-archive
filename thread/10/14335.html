i finally got somewhat of this project done... its an IT player, stereo mixer, and the loader also supports mod/s3m/xm, its about 70% finished now
<br/>
<br/>
a beta converter is up for download, what you'll want to do with it is:
<br/>
"mutil input -g"
<br/>
input is mod/s3m/xm/it, -g makes GBA file</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great work! Good sound quality, and a really cool converter-tool. I did spot some rendering-errors on the first tune I tried, though (I believe it to be either the portas or the fade-out, a bit hard to tell without trying to isolate it). What's the approximate performance of the player?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">last tests i did a few days ago:
<br/>
<br/>
no$gba was used (hardware results were slightly more, but i didn't test so much yet)
<br/>
<br/>
cpu per channel:
<br/>
hard pan: 1.3% 
<br/>
center pan: 1.36%
<br/>
other pan: 1.55%
<br/>
<br/>
i think the player could use some more optimizing... one 20 channel xm took 40% cpu, 9% of it was player load
<br/>
<br/>
also the effects aren't fully implemented/debugged yet, but most problems with module playback should be fixed soon</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I probably should.  I tend (out of laziness, not out of principle) to file bug reports only when I have an educated thing to say in my report.  In this case, the documentation was sparse enough that I tend to assume I'm just doing something stupid.

eKid:  what's the best place to submit a bug report?  email?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">email, but its probably not so necessary yet since all the features aren't finished (i probably shouldn't have called it a beta version yet)
<br/>
a more stable version will be available soon</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
