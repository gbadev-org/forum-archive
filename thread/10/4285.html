<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how to create accurate Digitally - generated ,Low -Frequency Sinewaves ,between 100 and 800 Hz. ,using the GBA  Direct Sound ?
<br/>
<br/>
    This facility, in conjunction with other non-gaming applications for the GBA will take center stage in a science project that I am currently involved with.<br/>_________________<br/>"I beheld the Beast, the Monster I had created"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can generate a sine table and then play that over and over on either of the PCM channels. See the BeLogic documents to learn how to play a sound.
<br/>
<br/>
But be warned that the GBA's sound output hardware performs high-pass filtering, so don't expect a flat frequency response even on the headphone jack. The high-pass characteristic is especially strong on the internal speaker (where I've modeled it in Cool Edit as a 3rd order Butterworth high-pass with corner point at 800 Hz).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
