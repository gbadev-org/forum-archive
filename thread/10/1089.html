    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just have a quick question....  I have been playing around with the wave output on the GBA for a while, and have been dissatisfied with the sound quality I am getting.
<br/>
<br/>
I am feeding it an 8kHz PCM wave file, and of course the quality sucks, but it's sounding even worse on the GBA.  I think it's in all likelihood because I am casting the s8 data as a u32 in my playback function.  The problem is that I can't seem to get around doing this, as the register (DMA1SAD) takes u32 data as far as I know...  am I mistaken on this?
<br/>
<br/>
To show what I am talking about, here's a sample of what I am doing, along with the original wave.

So does anyone know a better way of doing this?  Thanks in advance....  (no pun intended)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
