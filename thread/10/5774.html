    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
I have been attempting to code my own mod player on the GBA and am back at it again after some timeout.
<br/>
<br/>
I can run my modplayer on an emulator but it sounds a little bit grainy.
<br/>
<br/>
When I run it on the real thing, it sounds even worse and I notice that the code runs into the display time (instead of being confined to VBLANK).
<br/>
<br/>
At present, I have made use of only the MODSPEED and when I take into consideration the TEMPO so that I can get a better sound, It throws my whole project into chaos.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can see, my code looks fine but when I run it, it doesn't work as planned.
<br/>
Are there any anomalies which can affect the code? (i.e from within the compiler or the emulator).
<br/>
Perhaps I have left something very important out?
<br/>
<br/>
I am keen to get my project finished and would be grateful for any advice on this subject.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't recommend DekuTree's tutorial enough for this sort of thing. It covers everything you might need and highlights potential pitfalls. As useful as Devoto's original Pern Project tutorials IMO (and Deku uses better coding practices ;)):
