    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been looking all over the net for a mod tracker that has a nice GUI like fruity loops. I don't like the way all the mod trackers I have seen work. They all have those columns that you have to type in the notes/effects. And they all read the notes from top to bottom which i find very counter intuitive. I want a program that you can sequence the patterns in a similar fassion as in fruity loops. If anyone knows of such a program please let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It may take you a while to learn to work with it, but once you do, you can make music in a (very) effecient way. And that is good, especially on GBA because the better your music is defined, the less space and quite possibly processor time it will take up playing it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't know fruity loops but I imagine it's some "knob twist and button click" app like many. I'm not up to date with all the mod (-like) trackers, but I reckon MadTracker is a decent one for Windows. (Anyone, correct me if I'm wrong)
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd advice you to get into mod tracking. There are thousands (if not millions) of tunes and composers, so it's not that bad!:)
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I understand that hardcore trackers that have been doing it for a while would opt for the rows and columns approach. The response you gave is actually what i expected. But I think the easier a program is to use the more expressive you can be with your music. Fruity loops does have a lot of knobs and buttons you can play with but thats not what I'm talking about. All I want is a mod tracker that does everything the current ones do and nothing more. I just want it to be layed out different so that you compose your patterns in a left to right fasion. I guess it's kind of hard to explain if you haven't used a pattern sequencer like the ones found in Fruity loops or similar programs. I keep using Fruity loops as an example because that is what im familiar with :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the reply though, If I can't find what I'm looking for I'll just stick with the traditional tracker style, But I thought I might as well try...
