Seriously, though, that's some good work you've got going there.

You might also consider mentioning James Daniels' AAS in the modplayer list. To my knowledge it's the fastest player out there, and is available from his webpage: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.apex-designs.net" target="_blank">http://www.apex-designs.net</a>

It just struck me as odd that it wasn't there for completion's sake. You can always (in fact, it'd be a helpful idea to) mention the various stipulations in order to use the various players that are out there. For example, AAS may make you display a logo, but people may prefer that over Krawall, which isn't free even for non-commercial products.

I wouldn't think it unreasonable at all if a developer gives away a commercial product for non-commercial use asking only for a little bit of free publicity in return should the non-commercial product be distributed. Just think about what it would be like for the masses if every software publisher followed the exact same model. A lot of "casual" software piracy would stop almost completely if people could obtain commrecial products for free for private, non-commercial use with the stipulation that a logo of the software is displayed somewhere in finished products.

Actually, you *can* get the free SDK which has stopped development since November of 2002. It won't play XM modules, but it does play S3M and Amiga MOD AFAIK.<br/>_________________<br/>"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy."

My understanding from the website was that it was for "evaluation purposes only", implying that you were expected to pay if you want to use it (even in a non-commercial distribution).
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone shed any light on this matter?

this is the current release of the free krawall sdk. it is based on an old release of krawall and does especially not incooperate xm-playback.
<br/>
note that this sdk is only free for private, non-commercial use! for commercial use a license must be obtained.

there's an inexpensive (17 ?) non-commercial version available for purchase via paypal.

<br/>
the commercial license is either a binary license or a source-code license. the commercial binary license (including support) is currently priced at 350 ?.
