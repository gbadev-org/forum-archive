AAS's WAV importer is very simplistic so the files have to be very specifically formatted for it to be able to process them. If you run the file through SoX with the following options then the file should work correctly (other programs should work as well, but SoX is what I've used in the past to do the job and it's free):
<br/>
<br/>
sox [source_filename] -s -b -c 1 [destination_filename]
<br/>
<br/>
You'll get a warning about .wav files not supporting 8-bit signed format - don't worry about that. (The command above also works if you want to convert to .raw format.) You can get SoX here:

I did consider linking to the original post but in the end I decided a copy and paste was easier. :)

Would it be possible to email me X.wav?
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, are you sure you ran the file through SoX correctly? The previous poster reported the same thing, but when I converted his file myself it worked fine - i.e. have you tried..
<br/>
<br/>
sox X.wav -s -b -c 1 X2.wav
<br/>
<br/>
..then deleting X.wav and then renaming X2.wav to X.wav?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
