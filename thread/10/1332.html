This is a GBA demo rom. It is a very cool music ROM with very good music quality and synchronous lyric. The music samplerate is 44100Hz/s with one channel. The compression rate is 1:5.32 which is the half of the mp3 compression. The codec is developed by YiFei in China.

This rom can run in most GBA emulater (VisualBoyAdvance is recommoned) or on real GBA if you have a Flash Card for GBA.
