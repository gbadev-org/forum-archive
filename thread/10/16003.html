    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering how I'd be able to mix more than 2 channels at once when the volume is 127+. I know the GBA's BIOS synth can mix up to 12 channels, and it uses signed data. Since I've done a lot of experiments, it seems that the only way would be to use a halfword load (my temp. buffer uses halfwords), multiply by left, shift, store halfword, load halfword, multiply by right, shift, store halfword.
<br/>
<br/>
That's good and all but... isn't there a faster method of doing this? Doesn't AAS use signed samples as well? Cos from the speed it has, it can't make 3+ loads, multiplication and 2 stores per sample and keep ~1.0% CPU per channel.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
After lots of days of thinking and through trial and error, I finally found the way to do this right.
