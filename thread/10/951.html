<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to release syncAGB, a sound engine for AGB, but I'm afraid it's using too CPU raster time. I just wanted to catch an opinion about this here, I visited this web so much 2 years ago (btw, greetz to Joat, exoticorn, dovoto, Nokturn &amp; SimonB. Long time no see you guys! I'm still alive, hehe ^_^)
<br/>
<br/>
Here you got some data:
<br/>
<br/>
Configuration: 16257Hz, 8bit, Stereo, Dolby Surround encoding, 32 bit asynchronous mixing (MIDI-like, not Tracker-like) 
<br/>
<br/>
Basic CPU Usage (no sound): ~9,2%
<br/>
Per channel CPU Usage: ~3,1% (full pan/surround capabilities, number of channels limited by hardware)
<br/>
Reverb filter: ~4,4% 
<br/>
<br/>
I've got some bugs yet but I'll post a demo with source code (just the source of the demo, not the source of the engine, of course ;) ) within this week.
<br/>
<br/>
?What do you think about it? ?Maybe too higher? It really seems too much, but take in care it's not just a simple MODPlayer... Don't know... I'm not too familiar with other engines, if anyone knows sth about MusyX and/or GAX statistics... I've checked up their web, but I don't believe most of the numbers they're giving out ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi again,
<br/>
<br/>
I've uploaded the demo just in case someone want to check it. You can downlad it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.stratos-ad.com/utopia/sync/syncAGBDemo.zip" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">here</span></a>. I've included the GCC sources of the demo (not the engine) and also a VC project. You can take any part of the code for free, but I guess you won't find nothing interesting there ^_^')
<br/>
<br/>
You can also download the original music, it's the OST of a small game called Four Block Star, a theme I made for a simple coin-up machine and that was easy to port without changing it so much. You'll find it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.stratos-ad.com/utopia/sync/synchrnzr%20-%20Four%20Block%20Star.mp3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">here</span></a>
<br/>
<br/>
Any comments welcome. Greetz!
