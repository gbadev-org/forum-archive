Possibly a licensing issue. I've seen a lot of movie to game ports, especially on the 8-bit and 16-bit systems, that had to use different music because the soundtrack rights were too expensive to acquire in addition to the rights to the movie itself.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

In that case, part of the problem may have been that the Super NES sound chip's RAM was only 64 KB, and that had to hold the playback code, the music data, and the samples.

Could you do that one without the DPCM channel? Perhaps there wasn't enough ROM available to hold samples, or not enough address space to bankswitch the samples in.

Sure I can. It doesn't sound as good, of course, but it still sounds better (to my ears) than the original NES version: the arpeggiated chords, the simulated hi hat, the way the melody instrument changes timbre, etc. I don't know how long I'll keep the link up, but here it is with the DPCM channel removed and the white noise channel modified accordingly: <a href="http://www.furrykef.com/offsite/lems-tim2-no-dpcm.nsf" target="_blank">http://www.furrykef.com/offsite/lems-tim2-no-dpcm.nsf</a>

The bus between the Super NES's main CPU and the sound CPU is very slow. It can take three seconds to fill the RAM, and the sound is usually silenced and gameplay stopped while this is happening.

All those things take ROM space. A lot of NES publishers tried to save money by using minor variations on Nintendo's playback libraries. Such libraries were written by people unfamiliar with the C=64 demo scene, which is responsible for the widespread (ab)use of arpeggio and variable duty cycles. Notice that music from C=64 composers (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic">Silver Surfer</span> and most Codemasters games) sounds different from just about everything else on the NES.

Given that the owner of copyright in the Lemmings soundtrack makes disc-based consoles, it would be trivial for this company to get the sound right: just reencode it in ATRAC format. Otherwise, you'll have to compose new songs using new samples, but in the same style. Good luck doing this without getting sued.

Ah, but gameplay <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> stopped when the game changes tunes, which is between levels. Also, the game fades out and fades in between levels, so the actual increase in waiting time would probably be negligible.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I think even if the sample set had to be the same for each tune, they could have chosen better samples. The snare drum in particular sounds  more like some kind of toy than a snare drum. Kind of like a Mario Paint snare or something, heh :P

<br/>
True. It could be that they squeezed all they could out of that 256 KB cartridge, although it seems more likely to me that they just wanted to get a port out quickly and cheaply, since that seemed to be a common mentality for handling ports. Maybe I'm wrong. Most likely, the truth is somewhere in between, but what I do know for sure is that I find the NES Lemmings soundtrack pretty boring.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I know that one of the appealing aspects of Lemmings was its massive number of levels, but in a way I'd rather axe a few levels if it meant I'd be able to stand the music enough to actually <span style="font-style: italic">want</span> to play all the levels, if you know what I mean. 'Course, if I were actually working for them at the time, and I said that, they'd have called me crazy, and not entirely without justification (besides, I <span style="font-style: italic">am</span> crazy ;)).
<br/>
<br/>
I do understand that there are technical reasons why the games sound the way they do, and it's very well possible I'd have done no better if I were in exactly the same circumstances. That still doesn't change that I find almost all Lemmings ports to have unsatisfying music, though.

Isn't porting Lemmings a violation of copyright in the first place? I don't think the music would be the big point of contention unless it were the only element to really violate copyright.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, it's really a matter of what Sony will tolerate.

Well, different tools make them, of course. The practical differences are pretty minor and it really only matters to the composer and the person writing the sound code (or linking in a library). Me, I'm definitely a tracker person, but I'm going to be writing a MIDI player anyway (I'm hoping to make a crude implementation of DirectMusic -- not the API, just the basic idea), and from a technical standpoint I do find MIDI a bit more logical, for example, how it decouples the music sequence from the sounds used (making it easy and natural to use sounds from one song in another), how notes aren't rigidly separated into ticks the way they are in a tracker, and so on.

MIDI uses ticks too. In S3M, you can use the SDx effect to make a note start later in a row or the SCx effect to make a note end later in a row, and other formats probably have the same effect available.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<span style="font-style: italic">If</span> you redo all that. :) I suppose we probably would, although I haven't heard of any cases of publishers going after freeware homebrew authors even when a clone is very blatant.
<br/>
<br/>
Also fuzzy is the matter that many of the songs in Lemmings, like the can-can dance, are public domain. (Kind of ironic that the tune most associated with Lemmings isn't one of its original tunes!) So we could probably get away with using those same tunes as long as the new arrangement sounds suitably different.

Oh, I know, that's what I'd have done more or less. I just like how MIDI is actually designed to be used that way. Very minor point, I know, but when you talk technical specifics, you're mostly splitting hairs in preferring one to the other anyway...

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but I generally don't think in terms of ticks when I use a MIDI sequencer. In Noteworthy Composer, for example, I input notes on a musical staff, so I can have a score that uses mostly quarter notes to 16th notes, then introduce the occasional runs of 32nd notes without worrying about having to expand a pattern and increasing the tempo or reduce the ticks/row count to ensure it plays at the same speed. This always felt kind of fudgy to me, and although I still prefer trackers, it may make some prefer MIDI. I'm not too familiar yet with editing a piano roll, but I think you'd just temporarily change the size of the note grid or something. Or, even better, you use a musical keyboard and actually hit 32nd notes on the fly and not even worry about the question of quantization at all. I don't use a MIDI keyboard, myself, but other people do...

Ah, but then you couldn't use another effect at the same time. ;) I know, it's not that big a deal.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don't really think a discussion of the technical aspects of MIDI vs. module is going to be particularly enlightening. The most major difference would be the tools you use to make them. I'm making a MIDI engine because DirectMusic uses MIDI to represent music, not because I feel MIDI to be superior. I don't think I'd use DirectMusic for a Lemmings project, but I figure I may as well use my MIDI engine with it, because, since I'd be familiar with the code, I'd be able to manipulate it any way I want. (I'm not great at working with other people's code, heh.)

<br/>
<br/>
Also, don't you find the changing of music tracks between Lemmings levels to be a little jarring? Especially if you're playing the same level over and over and you have to listen to the same start of the song over and over because you mistime something the second Lemming is supposed to do. Lemmings 3 has Escape so that it restarts the level without restarting the music, come to think of it. (Lemmings 2 has Escape so that it restarts the level without the level briefing screen, but it restarts the music if I remember)<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.

I see it as analogous to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.abednarz.net/tetris.html" target="_blank">the situation between The Tetris Company and homebrew tetromino game developers</a>. Something was copied. Expression is protected by copyright; so are binaries and source code. But game play methods are not so protected (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102" target="_blank">17 USC 102(b)</a>). Companies send cease-and-desist letters to developers of clones; these letters often make arguably false claims as to what is an expression. Only a judge can reliably tell ideas from expression, and it costs a lot of money to get the opinion of a judge. So it depends on whether by "going after" furrykef meant sending a letter (which has happened) or filing a lawsuit (which has not).
