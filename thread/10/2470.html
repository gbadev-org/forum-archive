    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I've written my stereo mixer and it seems to work just fine, but I've noticed that the hardware doesn't quite live up to my expectations.
<br/>
<br/>
Particularly, I can hear a somewhat quieter version of the left channel in the right headphone, and vice-versa.
<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be entirely a hardware artifact to me. If I only write out the left or right channel then the instruments in those channels disappear (confirmed by looking at the FIFO contents in memory in VBA), but the "bleed" still occurs on the instruments that are playing.
<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to me that it might be my crappy headphones, so I tried my brother's. The problem wasn't quite as bad, but it was still there.
<br/>
<br/>
Have others encountered this problem? Is there something I could do in software to remedy it? I kind of feel cheated out of the full-panning 8-channel implementation I've done just to find that the stereo doesn't really work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Stereo bleeding is a useful part of sound perception; I can't remember where I saw it but I've seen it recommended that a channel be placed 25% away from the edge, so 100% in one ear, 25% in the other.  When I do that in my mixer I get very noticeably more full-bodied sound, at the expense of doubling the mixer cost.  So if it can be achieved for free, I'd consider that a bonus.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have no way of testing.  Do you have a demo of sorts that I can listen to?

I can explain what is happening.  The wires in your head phone are close together, right?  Well, it is a well-documented fact that an AC signal in a wire induces a current in a near-by wire.  Since these wires are too close together and since the GBA audio voltage in somewhere in the neighbor hood of 500-600 volts at 3 amps, it is easy to see how the sounds from the two channels can induce part of their signals onto each other.  (BTW, it usually will be the right channel messing up the left, just like right-handed people are stronger and smarter than left-handed redneck-types.)
<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do is separate the conductors (w-i-r-e-s) from each other.  Many headphones have wires that are side-by-side and can easily be pried apart.  Please be careful, though, as this will require a sharp instrument, something you may want your mom to help with, and also, there will be more wire for you to accidently hang yourself by (you seem to be the type).
<br/>

<br/>
I am aware of what causes the problem. I was just looking to find out if it was something unique to my GBA (if it was due to the plug's connection, which I think it is, as the wires in my headphones are already separated) or if others experienced it as well. I might be willing to do a full-panning mixer if I thought the problem was something only I was experiencing, wheras I just don't think it's worthwhile if it's a problem everyone's GBA suffers from.

Thanks, you've managed to thwart my suicide attempts until the next time I need to work with electronics. Do me a favour, though, and the next time you feel the need to spell something condescending out to me, don't put all of those hyphens between each letter as I'm not so good with word puzzles.

Come to think of it, I hooked my PC speakers up to my GBA a while back.  Why not hook your speakers up to your GBA and see if you still experience the same problem.

GBA Speaker:  Low Volume

In other words, both speakers always produced music.  The left side was just louder.

I was using an original GBA.  I'd like to point out that the SP, the GC GBP and any future units may not behave in the same way.
