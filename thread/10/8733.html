    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need help with converting my audio files to MP3 for Moonshell to play it.  Every file that I convert I get the following error
<br/>
<br/>
not support ext.MP3
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if I am converting them wrong. Is there a certain MP3 setting?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm able to get movies to work just not MP3, I am using a GBA Movie Player V2 with flashme.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank You</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which version of MoonShell are you using, and what are you using to convert media?
<br/>
<br/>
To convert PCM .wav files to MP3, use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.rarewares.org/mp3.html" target="_blank">LameDropXPd</a>; to convert them to Ogg Vorbis (recommended), use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.rarewares.org/ogg.html" target="_blank">OggDropXPd</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
And it's probably best to downsample audio to 22 kHz either before or during encoding, as today I learned that the higher frequencies of a 32 kHz or 44 kHz file tend to collapse into a mess of aliases when played through MoonShell.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It has to be something I'm doing wrong, because I hear people talk about how easy it is to play mp3's with moonshell.  I'm a newbee so I'm sure it's me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you run setup.exe first?
<br/>
<br/>
I had the same problem.  The English readme is old, and doesn't mention anything about runnng setup.exe.  The last version of Moonshell (.9 I think) came with a _BOOT_MP.nds ready for the GBAMP, but the latest doesn't have any of the plugins installed.
<br/>
<br/>
Run the setup.exe and select your cf drive as the target, uncheck the "build for supercard" option, and click "go" or "setup" I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WMA is a heck-hole of patents and digital restrictions management. It used to be possible to convert DRM-less WMA using old versions of VirtualDub, but Microsoft made the developers remove support for ASF (the container format of WMA) because ASF is patented in at least one major developed country. Try using <a class="postlink" href="http://www.download.com/3000-2194-10205771.html" target="_blank">Stoik Video Converter</a>; if that doesn't work, I'd suggest using the good old analog hole (line out, line in) to free the music from its WMA prison.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

 I told you I was a newbee, It worked after I ran the setup.  I do get a error message when the mp3's  play I tried it on a few the message is:
<br/>
<br/>
"ID3TAGv1 not found"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again
<br/>
<br/>
I did order a Super Card, so I'm assuming I can just rerun the setup and copy it to CF card with the super card option checked?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know ffmpeg and the others are cross-platform and that everything is open-source, but it is annoying to have to restart my computer, which runs Linux primarily, back into Windows XP to install MoonShell and convert the movies.[/rant]

That's not an error but just a warning. It means you haven't added a metadata tag (artist, album, title) to the file. In Winamp, stop the playback and use Alt+3 to edit the song's tag.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You can do it while the song is playing, it just pauses for a second while it writes.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, damn Microsoft for forcing them to remove all manner of .asf support, even when the file was created by another perfectly legal open-source app. &lt;_&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
