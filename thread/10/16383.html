<br/>
So.. I got rid of the old player, built a simple mixer for my "LibAGB" and am in the process of expanding it for a MIDI player.. named it 'Takai Sound Driver.'
<br/>
<br/>
I'm rebuilding the sound bank, as it didn't exactly turn out the way I wanted.. but here's a small demo of it:
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Could probably use a bit more tweaking of the samples, but.. what do you think so far?
<br/>
<br/>
PS: No, that's not using the actual player, lol.. :P
<br/>
PPS: According to my calculations, the total size of the sample data needed for this song is 98KB</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
TAKAI Sound Driver will no longer support the GBA, as I honestly see hardly any movement on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
All files from the old version for the GBA (including AGBMidi) will be released with all source code, and is available through me (It's an 8MB package complete with many backups).
<br/>
<br/>
So...
<br/>
<br/>
TAKAI Sound Driver.. now goes to the NDS!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
