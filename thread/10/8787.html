    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there, 
<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that krawall still work on DS, but does he uses all the new sound features of the DS ? I know very little about the sound system but I think in GBA there was 8 channels for instruments, and in DS 16. 
<br/>
<br/>
I would like also to know if if work on the arm 7 processor and if there exist another library who use all the sound features of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
can somebody help me ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA only had 2 digital sound channels, which meant lots of software processing. You could pull 8 digital channels out of the GBA, but it depends largely on how taxing the rest of the game is on the CPU, and how well written and optimized your code is, as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thank you tsssf . and how much sound channel has the DS ? if it is more I suppose that the libraries for gba can't use the additionnal channels and then I must find a DS specific library ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
