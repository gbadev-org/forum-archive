    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I understand that a lawyer would be the best to answer the following questions, but I'd like to hear what your attorneys have told you so that I can know the playing field before I spend hard-earned money on a consultation with mine.
<br/>
<br/>
Given:
<br/>
<br/>
Under copyright laws in effect in the United States of America, a person who 1. has had access to a copyrighted work 'Foo', 2.  creates an original work that is "substantially similar" to 'Foo', and 3. does not qualify under "fair use" exemptions, infringes the copyright in 'Foo' (Arnstein v. Porter).
<br/>
<br/>
Though establishing access requires similarity (Ferguson v. NBC), courts have ruled that hearing a song on the radio even once constitutes access.  Because of the ubiquity of radio in modern American society, the major music publishers use this as a tool to taint every hearing person with access to every published and performed song so that the music publishers have a better chance at using their libraries of copyrighted musical works as weapons in court.
<br/>
<br/>
There exist <a class="postlink" href="http://everything2.com/?node_id=1029506" target="_blank">only a finite number of distinct melodic hooks</a> of a given length.
<br/>
<br/>
Courts have ruled that use of a half-dozen or so notes of a melodic hook plus chord progression from another musical work constitutes substantial similarity.  It takes quite a bit more than that, plus testimony from an expert witness, to infer access by establishing circumstantial evidence of "striking similarity" that precludes any possibility of coincidence or derivation from a common source (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.musicanalyst.com/selle_v_gibb.htm" target="_blank">Selle v. Gibb</a>).
<br/>
<br/>
Courts have ruled that the fact that an author may have been unaware that he was copying an existing work is no defense to copyright infringement (Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music).
<br/>

<br/>
A successful defense in a civil lawsuit, especially against a multinational conglomerate corporation, costs more in attorney's fees than most individuals have in the bank.  This lets big companies SLAPP the little fellow around.
<br/>
<br/>
Statutory damages assessed against an infringer of copyright can reach as high as $150,000 even if actual damages are zero.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Easy.  Create a limited liability corporatin (LLC).  The limited liability part means your personal liability is limited!  That means that no one can sue you and take your possessions, but they can sue your company and take its possessions.

<br/>
<br/>
But in this case, I was also looking for techniques a composer could use to reduce the possibility of unconscious plagiarism.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I thought of another possibility:  Encode music theory into a PC program, feed a stream of pseudorandom numbers into it, and it spits out several lead sheets, from which the composer selects one to tweak into a finished tune.  Does anybody here have experience with algorithmic music composition?  Would playing around with it be worth my time?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

While the number of "melodic hooks" is finite, it is very high. Some things to consider:
<br/>
<br/>
1. You are not limited to the Western twelve-tone system
<br/>
2. Using different rhythm increases the number of variations  
<br/>
3. You don't have any copyright limitations using classical music, which is public domain</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples, 
<br/>
  You may find this hard to believe, but I, Maddox, write music.  I have always found it hard to write a tune without some little part of it reminding me of something else.  And that's ok.  Why?  Because people who do creative things like, songwriting or painting or sculpting or even problem solving in Com Sci 101 usually learn to do these things by IMITATION!  Yep.  When I first started writing music is was really just arranging bits and pieces of things that I had already heard and liked.  (Was this the same for you?)  Then, as neurons began to shoot off in the musical portion of my brain, I could hear original melodies in my head.  It is, somtimes, the composers own intimacy with their music that makes us think that it "sounds to much like something else."  It takes some experience to find your own style and make that style different than your faves.  WARNING:  Most people who write trite, imitative bullsh*t mostly because they didn't raise the bar for themselves and were satisfied with what is known as hacking.  Anyway and to close, this creative stuff is learned by imitation and doing.  You could take a measure from just about any piece of music and say that sounds like measure X from Y!

But judges are.  They may consider changing a melody into another tonal system to be a "colorable" change.

My analysis giving 36^(n-1) melodies of length n already takes into account rhythm.

Tetris for Game Boy illustrates this very clearly.  A-TYPE music is a Russian folk song called "Korobeyniki"; C-TYPE music is from Bach's French Suite no. 3.  Even "Technotris" from BPS Tetris is "Arabesque" by Friedrich Burgm?ller.  I just might go this route, looking for classical songs I can remix.  But I'll have to dig deeper and find more obscure pieces because use of extremely popular classical music such as the first movement of Beethoven's fifth symphony may sound cheap to players.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
