    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, very quick question, I'm playing around with the Apex Audio System, and I've gotten it working no problem, however the volume levels seem to be quite low. I've tried AAS_MOD_SetVolume(256), but even then, the volume is rather soft. On the PC it isn't a problem, you just crank the volume in the emulator up, but on hardware, it's quiet enough that you can barely hear it, even on full volume.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically what I'm getting at, is there any way to increase the maximum volume levels in Apex? Or is it likely I've just done something wrong? I've tried the demos that come with it and have had the same results, so I don't _think_ I've done anything wrong.<br/>_________________<br/>The Game is Nothing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AAS scales the samples so that they never overflow which means it doesn't need to clip the output, which speeds up the mixer and also prevents distortion. The downside of this approach is that the more channels there are, the quieter each channel gets, so I'm considering adding a volume boosted mode in the next release. Also, due to the way the GBAs sound hardware works, mono is louder than stereo. 8 channel mono is what I'm using in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.apex-designs.net/payback.html" target="_blank">Payback</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
