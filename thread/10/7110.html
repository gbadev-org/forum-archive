<br/>
With krawall, I'm using kramPlay() to play my sfx samples.  Unfortunately, there's about a 1/4 second delay between when I call kramPlay, and when the sample actually plays.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone experienced anything like this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was playing with it last night on hardware, and I think it's a combination of both issues mentioned by tepples and miked. 
<br/>
<br/>
On hardware, the delay is MUCH smaller, (small enough that it's usable).  Also, going back and looking at the sfx, there is a very slight delay on the attack, which I assume is causing the rest.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, guys! -- now if I can just get my volume levels fixed, I'll be set (the BGM keeps being WAY louder than the SFX, but I'm probably just doing something stupid with the volume settings.  I'll re-read the volume stuff in the  krawall documentation)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
