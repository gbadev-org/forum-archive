    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, I'm evaluating mod players for a game.  To speed things up, I wonder if any of you had any recommendations?
<br/>
<br/>
What I really want is a player that:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Can play .xm files (and preferably s3m as well, but not required)
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Can mix sound effects from a mod file along with a playing song
<br/>
<br/>
3.  Has a license I like.  LGPL or something like MIT/BSD would be perfect.  I'd rather work with something open source/free/etc than something like Krawall, but I'm not too picky.  GPL doesn't work well (I may open my source later, hopefully, but it might not happen).  Paying a small amount for a personal edition of some commercial product (like the approx $20 for Krawall) is reasonable.  I don't want to have to show a splash screen (like for AAS)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm leaning towards using Krawall right now, but maybe I'm missing something else out there that might do just as well?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would of course recommend Pimpmobile, although as you know the sound effect support hasn't been formalized in the API yet. It's still possible to do, but it currently requires using internal functions and headers that might change in the future. Here's how I'd do it: I'd add all my sound-fx samples to a dummy module, and using the getter-functions in the internal headers I'd get the sample data-positions. Then I'd make sure the player was compiled with more sound channels than my module has (If the module is 8 channel, I'd set up 16 channels), and manually set up the mixer state to include my samples on a given trigger-function.
<br/>
<br/>
This is something that I plan to add myself soon in a formalized way. The Breakpoint 2007 demo compo is in less than one week, after that I have time for other projects again ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought you might jump in and mention pimpmobile.  :)  If I can figure out how to do what you're recommending, or if it gets updated before I do, I'll probably go for it.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else?  Shameless self-promotion is a good thing ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
