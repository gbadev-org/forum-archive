<br/>
<br/>
I would like to have info on playing licensed tunes in a game. Is it affortable for low budget titles? Who do you have to contact to get the rights?
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know more about other alternatives also (ex: cost of hiring someone to do a high qualily 1 minute track).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most of the people I've deal with tend to take around 1000$ for a normal 3-minute track. For non-commercial projects, a lot of them do it for free.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
