    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most people use MODs for music, and unless you have a lot of unneeded EWRAM to decompress samples to, the samples are stored uncompressed in ROM.
<br/>
Writing a good sound mixer in a whole art in itself, but there's plenty of info to get you started just on this board. Basically the idea of a mixer is to add samples together, so first start off by just doing a for loop every frame where you load in samples and add them into a buffer, which is played by the DMA.
<br/>
Then either ask for help, or just go read the mixer-related posts on here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, most games use a tracked format such as MOD, S3M, or XM, but I have developed a proof of concept demo that plays an 18 kHz 4-bit ADPCM compressed version of "Hot Limit" by John Desire using 15% of CPU time. (A 4-bit ADPCM waveform sounds about as good as an 8-bit raw waveform.)  This can fit a half hour of audio into a 128 Mbit cartridge.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

"Inside the box" is entirely appropriate at times.  For software-only playback, all decoding must happen "inside the box".  I'd imagine that an MP3 decoder on cartridge would be more expensive both for the Nintendo license fee and for actually manufacturing such a cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if you decompress MP3 entirely to mono 18kHz 8-bit PCM before playing it and fill the entirety of EWRAM with cached decompressed audio, you're only going to fit about 14.4 seconds of MP3 in RAM. And aren't "loading" delays the main reason to stick with carts instead of discs?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say that if you want to use a recording of a live performance (as opposed to tracked music), you should try compressing it with ADPCM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
