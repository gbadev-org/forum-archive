I know it has been asked many times but there isn't any good answers. Just that the ARM processor in the gba isn't fast enough to decode mp3s.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if someone knew of a gba program that could play mp3s. Please, if you don't know any, don't reply. If none exist, then just say it.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought that this forum existed to help each other out, not just to tell others to look it up. Even if I used the search button for this question, it doesn't mean that an answer in a 1-2 year old post would still be valid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MP3 playback on the GBA might be possible at lower bitrates and it might be a neat tech demo.  But, in the bigger picture, it's really useless.  I would say that it falls in the same category that a demo I had on the Atari back in the 80s -- it played a 4-5 second sample of "Girl, You Really Got Me Now".  Trouble is, although the Atari was capable of playing the clip, it couldn't even maintain a static display while doing so.  All the CPU power was used to play the sound.  So, it was pretty much a one-trick pony.
<br/>
<br/>
And, there are plenty of other devices available to play MP3s back at much higher rates, with plenty of storage to go with it as well.  I always try to use the right tool for the job. :)

    <h4>#27283 - tepples - Fri Oct 08, 2004 3:33 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, 8-bit isn't too noisy. The GBA is a handheld, and handhelds are typically played in surroundings that aren't very quiet. An 8-bit PCM signal has a noise floor around -45 dBFS. A loud sound in the game will usually mask the quantization noise in practical situations. <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/thisis8bit.zip" target="_blank">Listen and ask yourself</a>: Will anybody really care?
<br/>
<br/>
If you're really serious about working around this, and you have a bit of background in digital signal processing and psychoacoustics, try dithering with noise shaping.
<br/>
<br/>
Stan64: Use GSM Player for mp3, and use the NSF player that comes with Pogoshell provided you have an F2A card. SPC we can't help you with just yet.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">of course 8bit is fine for game sounds and voice samples, but i was referring to the original idea of using the GBA as an mp3-player and listen to music through headphones.
<br/>
effect sounds and also certain music can be normalized and compressed to mask the noise, but music which was not explicitly composed and optimized for this purpose will usally sound not so good in 8bit - except for "noise-" and so-called "8-bit music" of course. as soon as there is a certain dynamics range, for example when a bass sound fades out slowly, the quantization noise becomes rather ugly. 
<br/>
dithering makes the noise smooth and less ugly but the overall noise floor is still quite strong, even with noise shaping.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually, I use my GBASP with my 256Mbit Flash2Advance Ultra flashcard daily for listening music through earphones with GSM Player.
<br/>
I can put as much as 45 - 60 songs in 32MB without a bootmenu and thats about enough for 1 week or something, then i will refresh the songs and put them on my flashcard again..
<br/>
<br/>
The only things i would like to see in GSM Player are: 
<br/>
 - Shuffle (maybe with A or B)
<br/>
 - Going from the first song to the last song with the left button
<br/>
 - Seeing how much time the song remains instead of how long it is playing
<br/>
 - Maybe that you can disable the start/boot message or that you can adjust it a little..

Good idea, given that your usage pattern matches that advertised by Apple for the iPod Shuffle player. I'd get the random seed from the exact scanline when the shuffle button is pressed, so there'd be only 229 possible orderings for a given number of tracks (inorder, and 228 different shuffles); is that enough?

How would you suggest that I include the required copyright notices? One possibility is to start playing the song immediately and then hide the notice after 6 seconds.

# Custom 16-color backgrounds. Suggested by a few people.

# Long file names, which would require either an extension to GBFS or a

<br/>
 - hmm, maybe you can put the Artist on the first line and the Song title on the 2nd (you'll have to include an "-" in the filename so that GSMPlayer can read it, and if they are too long just let them 'out of the screen'.
<br/>
# Shuffle playback.
<br/>
 - This would be the best feature, but it 'have' to be REALLY random and not Music Player Advance style..
<br/>
# View time remaining in track.
<br/>
 - Yes that is also another good feature that I was suggesting too, that would be really kewl..
<br/>
# Simple games.
<br/>
 - iPod style, maybe :P But then you must also release another version without the games, cause I use GSMPlayer to listen 'MP3's' in the classroom and games are useless inthere, it would only use memory.

I don't think GBA has the horsepower for it. DS, on the other hand, I think could handle it pretty easily. 
<br/>
Writing a DS vorbis decoder has been on my list of things I'd like to do for a while, but I read the whole <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html" target="_blank">format spec</a> a few months ago and there were a few fuzzy areas that I wasn't sure how to handle. I might still give it a go one of these days though, it's pretty straightforward and clearly written for the most part.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
