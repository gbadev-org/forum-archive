    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, that sounds really bad. I noticed that the MIDI file by default opend as an IT tracker file with pattern sized of 128 each. Upon converting to MOD, it reduces the pattern sized to 64. However, rather that splitting each pattern into 2 patterns like would make sense, it simply throws the last 64 of each pattern away.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">was following steps to get midi to mod (to play in game using Apex audio system) because I have a keyboard that outputs midi.

but got stuck on the bit where modplug conversion truncates after 64... tryed to download midmix and couldn't find it.
<br/>
<br/>
is there a decent program that converts midi -&gt; mod without doing crap trucation? or if not, can someone tell me where to download midmix.
<br/>
<br/>
has mod got a limit of 4 channels?
<br/>
<br/>
mod blows.

I think you're supposed to split long patterns into two.

<br/>
The Amiga hardware had four HW sample playback channels. Later modplayers extended the format for up to 32 channels or so.

<br/>
In practice, .mod blows mostly because of lack of support for doing a volume effect at the same time as another effect. The .s3m format, on the other hand, has a dedicated column for volume or panning effects.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It's my mistake. I should have written midimix, not midmix.

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.un4seen.com/" target="_blank">http://www.un4seen.com/</a> - This has a util called MIDI2XM. He claims it to be very accurate. I have not tired it yet, but it's another option to try....
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : I just realized - from the other thread titles it appears that the sound libraries for GBA are very particular about exactly which format the MOD is in - I am accoustomed of thinking that IT, XM, s3m, et. al. = MOD, but apparently not for GBA. Your mileage may vary with the above link....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
