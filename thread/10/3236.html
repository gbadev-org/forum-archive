    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont' know why, but I'm having trouble getting krawall to play my xm files properly. I haven't even tried sound effects yet. I searched through all the topics relating to krawall in this forum (only like 38 hits) but none of them are useful to me.
<br/>
<br/>
here's a stripped down version of my project:
<br/>
<a href="http://spockmeat.ath.cx/musictest.zip" target="_blank">http://spockmeat.ath.cx/musictest.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
just open the project in visual ham and it should all compile and run. You can hear that something is really screwed up... the music sorta plays but there's all sorts of skips, static, etc. I don't know what I have scred up but I've wasted a couple of days trying to get this to work. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try opening the s3m file in Modplug Tracker and see if it plays there, then save it again. Maybe that will work, if not, then check your code again too.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oh ya, the files are just fine. I actually can seem to get it to play when using the ham lib. <a href="http://spockmeat.ath.cx/musictest2.zip" target="_blank">http://spockmeat.ath.cx/musictest2.zip</a>

see, I actually can get krawall to play when using ham there, I just can't figure out how to do it without using ham. I've checked through all my code several times, changing things and trying to figure it out. I just don't know why it won't play properly with my code :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ya that's kinda what I was thinking.
<br/>
<br/>
I just played around with turning on and off a few things and it seems like having 
<br/>
// enable hblank status (bit 4)
<br/>
REG_DISPSTAT |= 0x10;
<br/>
<br/>
was causing the problems. After commenting out that line it seems to be working properly. I am still a bit confused as to why that would break it, but I'm just happy that it works :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
