    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I am still a major beginner at the GBA programming scene. I have my first pong demo up, and would like to implement some simple background music and possibly sound effects. However, I looked at the tutorials and such and was blown away by their complexity.
<br/>
<br/>
I do eventually want to code my own music routine, don't get me wrong. However, I would like something *simple* that I can use now. I need to be able to include samples and play them using some form of music file. 
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone help me out here?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
