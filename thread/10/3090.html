    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like to write a SID player for my game.  Does anybody know where I can find technical docs on the SID file format? 
<br/>
<br/>
Basically i want to be able to play files that are in the High Volatge SID Colelction that can be played by Sidplay2/w win32.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't find the complete file format specifications V.V I can only find the file header information.  Maybe I should look for the C64's sound chip technical document?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SID files contain 6502 programs that write to the registers of the Commodore 64 computer's SID synthesizer. In order to play them back, you'll have to 1. emulate a 6502 (see the PocketNES source code to learn how; you may need to negotiate alternate licensing if you want to use the core in proprietary programs) and 2. emulate the C=64's synthesizer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you :)
<br/>
<br/>
Another quick question:  Do you think that it would be too much of a slowdown?  I know that emulators really need some power :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the sources of a sid player which is free to use... Quality is not that good, but still it exists !
<br/>
You can have a look at what it does by grabbing my Tetris C64 Remix at <a href="http://rmstudiogames.free.fr" target="_blank">http://rmstudiogames.free.fr</a>
<br/>
There was only one sid I could not play, it was precisely the tetris one :O( Otherwise, all other sids I tried were emulated.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you are interested in using it !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the link and the info.  I will be sure to check it out tommorow.  Gotta get to bed :/
<br/>
<br/>
I am interested.  Knowing me, I would probably look at the source and try to make my own in an effort to acheive acomplishment (?).. I guess :P  
<br/>
<br/>
I've never done emulation code before and am a bit intimidated by it, but i will gladly try ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
