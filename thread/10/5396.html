    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I've pretty much got the regular GBA programming down. I wouldn't call myself an expert, and I don't know most of the in-depth stuff, so keep that in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
I have just started using BoyScout and have managed to pretty much clone the mario theme (triplets and all). Now what I need to do is figure out how to implement that into my game. This is where i'm stuck.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand how the functions work, what I don't understand is where you tell it which song to play. Can someone please brief me on this in plain english, and assume that I know nothing about GBA registers?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help here would be greatly appreciated, so thanks in advance.

PS: sorry, i really am new to this...<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While im at it, I have another issue. If you write this kind of sound file, and play it in a GBA game, is it even possible to add direct sound to it and keep it syncronized? If not, how would I write a direct sound capable music file?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
