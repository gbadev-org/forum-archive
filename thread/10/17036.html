<br/>
<br/>
Bear with me here as it will probably sound quite noob-ish, I'm new to the homebrew scene.  I've seen there are several programs that convert GSF files to Midi but I haven't seen any that do the opposite.  Does anyone here know of any programs that could do this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any assistance that can be given :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
