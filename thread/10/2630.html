    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, here's the deal.
<br/>
I will have to write a software mixer for MIDI playback, not exactly now, but I found it a good idea if I did some researching early so I could do it when the time comes.
<br/>
A lot of this games' music has been composed in MIDI format, and I really don't feel comfortable about converting them to MODs or other formats, I am willing to work to get this done (and I have time :]).
<br/>
However, I have few questions; I am fairly new to sound programming, and by no means I am not a composer, so I do not have that knowledge about i.e. MIDI format either (I've read a bit about the format though).
<br/>
<br/>
Well, here's the questions, I'd like to thank everyone for any possible help. :)
<br/>
<br/>
1) Since GBA uses raw PCX for music playback (I will use one Direct Sound channel for music, and this will not use tone generators at all, other DS channel will be for sound effects), how am I actually going to get MIDIs play the right sounds? Do I have to have somekind of sound bank or what (my friend was working on GBA soundbank for MIDI playback, hence I am asking this)?
<br/>
<br/>
2) Since the channels what the MIDIs uses are resampled into one channel, what is accetpable amount of channels in the MIDI, so the quality would still be somewhat decent for the GBA (the composer said he'd like at least 8, and I said that <span style="font-weight: bold">maybe</span> 6-8 would be possible)?
<br/>
<br/>
3) Can someone shortly describe the steps how to get this done (I will research every topic more myself then, I just need basically a framework so I can get started; as I stated before I am rather new when it comes to sound programming :]).
<br/>
<br/>
4) What is the best way to attach the MIDIs to the binary? I will have a struct (this is C/C++ mostly, ASM used a bit) for chunks, so should I have an array of these in a header for the MIDIs?
<br/>
<br/>
5) Are there any premade software mixers, free to download and look at code, which could also be a nice guide to this (well commented is always better :])?
<br/>
<br/>
Well, these are the questions that firstly pop up to my head, any help is highly appreciated. Thank you everyone. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you write a mixer you will quickly see that this is not an effective use of the two sound channels. You are better off using only one channel and mixing everything into that unless you want to support stereo sound, in which case you should mix the left side into one channel and the right side into the other channel.

<br/>
Yes. You will need to have samples stored on the GBA for every instrument that you want to use. You will then have to digitally resample the frequency to match the different notes that you want to play.

I think 8 is fine for a video game, but some people get more ambitious and support 16, or even more. It starts to take a lot of processor time to support more channels, though.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think any SNES game ever used more than 8 channels (although I could be wrong; I'm sure someone will correct me if I am). Also, traditionally sound effects are handled by having them bump out the instruments in the upper channels. This way you just tell your composer to put the heavy instrumentation in the lower channels and you're fine.

Step 0: come up with some basic data structures for storing samples and the necessary pulse-code modulation data. Now would be a good time to make sure you are doing everything compliant with the format you are using (MIDI, in your case). You will need to write an application that converts samples into the format you use on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 1: write a program that can play a sampled sound to the FIFO.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 2: write a program that resamples to let you adjust the frequency of the sound up or down. This is when you should make sure you can take a "note" in your preferred format (MIDI in your case) and have the instrument play that note correctly on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 3: write a mixer that combines different samples into a single channel. This is potentially the most challenging step and where most different sound systems diverge in terms of capabilities and processor consumption.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 4: write a music player that tells the samples when to play.
<br/>
<br/>
These are the steps I followed when writing my MOD player, and I think they're the most natural progressions for writing a music player.

<br/>
<br/>
Any data you attach should be in a C file or an ASM file; not in a header file. Header files should only contain statements that say that the data exists somewhere, not the actual data itself.
<br/>
<br/>
You can create an array of all of your MIDI files if you want; I just give each one a separate variable name (in my case, they are all prefixed with the tag "mod" and postfixed with "Info", eg. "struct ModInfo modMySongInfo") and then I can refer to it in my code as necessary.

There probably are, but I will have to let someone else answer this one. You might take a look around yourself (perhaps check the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devrs.com/gba/" target="_blank">devrs site</a> and the tutorials/demos on gbadev) and see what you can find. Because writing a music-player is a multi-tiered project, though (as I described above) and there are a lot of design decisions to be made along the way, it can be very difficult to read/adapt someone else's code. You may as well give it a shot, though.

8 channels would probably give the best performance/quality compromise, but more than that is certainly possible. (I'd guess maybe as many as 128 channels would be theoretically possible with an efficient mixer, but that would be complete overkill and would leave no CPU time for anything else.)

Probably the easiest way would be to make a converter that writes the data out to a .s file with a corresponding .h file that you include in your project. (.s files are much faster to assemble than .c files.)

If you'll forgive the blatant plug, you could use my mixer:

The source code isn't included but you can access the mixer directly - although I'd recommend using the SFX playing commands instead as they're a lot easier to use. Doing things this way also automatically sets up the GBA's sound hardware for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I still want to write my own mixer, for two reasons: I am really interested about sound programming, so I am looking for experience and I am hoping that we can get this project commercially published when it's done.
<br/>
<br/>
However, about this soundbank which will hold the samples of instruments, I am not quite sure how this must be done as I don't know how raw PCX data actually works, can anyone help a bit here?
<br/>
<br/>
It seems like making a MOD player is somewhat easier than MIDI (everyone seems to have made one :x). Is there a good tool that can convert MIDIs into MODs without (big) loss of quality? And when using MODs, do I need to have a soundbank holding the samples of different instruments?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to hear where you guys mostly learnt this stuff, do you have any tutorials about this stuff? I have so much questions that it'd take a lot time to ask them. x.x

<br/>
The Super NES's hardware mixer had 8 hardware channels. The Super NES's sample compression and slow CPU speed ruled out software mixing. See if you can't make kick+hat or chord samples so that you can get more instruments playing on the same number of voices.

You can parallelize the work load a bit by having one programmer do step 4 on the tone generators until another programmer has finished doing steps 1-3 on the PCM channels. This may also give your composers four more channels to work with to create richly textured music.

For one thing, "PCX" is an image format. You want "PCM" which is stored in WAVE files.

S3M doesn't really take any more power than MOD, except for the tendency of S3M files to have been written later and thus on newer hardware and thus with more channels than the typical 4-channel Amiga MOD.

Well, that's about it.

I have few more questions, as you could expect. :)

<br/>
1) Since the channels has to be resampled into one channel, how am I supposed to do this?
<br/>
<br/>
2) Can't I generate the raw 8-bit signed samples beforehand when I load the music/sound effect, and then just feed the direct sound channel with the generated samples? Or does this take too much memory?
<br/>
EDIT: But of course freeing it when music changes.
<br/>
<br/>
3) When you do realtime mixing, and you have a DMA set to automatically feed the FIFO when it needs new data, how am I supposed to do this if I do the mixing in realtime?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Not resampled; mixed. You mix two waveforms by adding them together.
<br/>
<br/>
You have to watch for overflow, however: if you add two values and it comes up to greater than +/-128 then it no longer fits into 8 bits. Two ways of dealing with this are clipping and scaling: clipping is where you check to see if your value is out-of-bounds and if so just replace it with either + or - 128. Scaling is where you divide your samples (scale them down) by a constant before adding in order to make sure they can't overflow.
<br/>
<br/>
Clipping typically takes more processing than scaling, but prevents volume loss that comes with scaling.

Not entirely sure what you're asking. Buffering is a good idea. But you can only buffer so far ahead, or you will run into problems if the music changes before your buffer is emptied. Most mixers that use buffers tend to buffer between 200-400 bytes.

If you're mixing in realtime, then you may as well ditch the DMA and write to the FIFO yourself. I can tell you from experience, though, that realtime mixing seems like a much better idea than it works out in practice for most mixers. There may be some exceptions for very advanced/creative mixers (nod towards AAS), but generally a simple double-buffered system running alongside DMA works best.

True, most mixers do mix about 10-30ms of music at a time (some are synchronized to 60hz, that is, 16.7ms), but there do exist exceptions. I've seen demos that buffer several seconds of music before running a particularly complicated scene. Of course, the viewer doesn't notice this while viewing a relatively subdued lead-in scene, designed as a sort of calm before the storm.

The mixer should be pretty much the same regardless of the music format. It's the music player that will be significantly different. Usually the music player doesn't consume the greatest number of resources, though. I'm not aware how brutal the MIDI format is.
<br/>
<br/>
You will have a tough time getting down to less than 10% with conventional algorithms. My MOD player is 10-13%, and that's limited to 8 channels, fixed panning, scaling instead of clipping, and pretty much the entire thing in hand-optimized assembly. The only "indulgence" it takes in processor consumption is that the music player runs at 128 Hz (many run only at 60 Hz).

Hey tepples, you say an entire MIDI soundbank is about 1 MB? Do you know where I can download one? Is there a "standard" one for software playback? I've searched google with no luck. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I should write a MIDI instead of a MOD player, since that's what my composer is using. 1 MB is an order of magnitude larger than the space consumed by most MOD samples, I think, but it's still not a wholly unreasonable amount.
<br/>
<br/>
When you say MIDI is straightforward to interpret, how comparable is it to MOD in terms of complexity?
<br/>
<br/>
For example, in MOD my mixer only needs to worry about either looping a sample or cutting it off when it's done. But I know some other formats support things like ping-pong loops and whatnot, which I would rather do without.
<br/>
<br/>

Basically what I need is a soundbank maybe with 16-32 instruments? (I thought that 1-2MB would be acceptable size for it).

Then a mixer and the player would take 10-15% (or 20% at most) of the CPU.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually if you only use a few of the MIDI instruments, it shouldn't take any more space for the sample data than MOD, I would think. I was under the impression the 1MB would be for all 120 or however many instruments MIDI has. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for mixers, 10% is a fairly low usage for 8 channels. Mine takes more like 13-15%, but it supports full panning and clipping instead of scaling, so that's to be expected. 25% for 16 channels, but that's ok for me since my game is an RPG, and has CPU cycles to burn. But if you don't mind mono or hard stereo, 10-15% isn't too much to ask for 8 channels. PM me or something for my ICQ# if you ever get into mixer writing, I've done a lot of studying on them so I'd be happy to give some optimization tips once you're ready for them. Actualy I may write an article on the subject sometime, if enough people would like to read it.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there would be any problem with using a regular tracker-style mixer for MIDI, as long as you can deal with some limits. 
<br/>
I was trying to decide between doing a MOD or IT player, and then it occurred to me that I may as well do IT, and just cut the features that aren't really necessary, and would make it slower (i.e. ping-pong loops and resonance filters). If you look at it that way, trying to cnovert a MIDI to a MOD is forcing a lot worse problems on you than playing it in its original form from a not-quite-complete player. Besides, I've heard more stories about people wanting to play MIDIs on GBA than I can remember, so even if it's a partial player, I'm sure a lot of people will appreciate it.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

The samples data ended up at about 64k bytes. It achieved this by mapping the instruments onto a smaller representative set of instruments. I didn't think it was terribly complicated; in fact when I went on to look at mods was when it seemed to get difficult (I gave up in favour of other activities).
<br/>
I must say I've always wondered why people considered it was better to include the samples in with every tune (mods), as opposed to a one-off inclusion in the player. As an outside observer it seems to me that the advantage of mods is the potential of a different 'sound' (with more complex synthesised instruments).

How fast you can make it go is entirely up to you. If you are awesome at assembly and clever coding, you might get it as low as 15% or so. I think unoptimized mixers usually hover around 20-30%.
<br/>
<br/>
Fixed-panning stereo (half the channels in the left side, half in the right side) is not very expensive computationally if you make some basic optimizations, so you might want to consider it. There are tricks you can do if you decide to go full-panning as well.

You've got the right idea, except remember that you need to use fixed-point math instead of floating-point, so 1 will actually probably be something more like 64.

If you've got a sample at 22050 Hz, and you want to play it one octave higher, then you play it back at 44100 Hz.  One octave lower would be 11025 Hz. 12 notes to an octave, evenly spaced apart. Figure the notes out based on that.
<br/>
<br/>
Use fixed point to track what point in the sample you're at, and just chop it down to integer to actually reference the data.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pitch altering is done by using a fixed-point position as well. To go up one octave, multiply the pitch by 2, to go down one, divide by 2. Therefore, to play a sound one octave below normal, you'd need to advance .5 samples at a time, so you need fixed-point. The exact note frequencies are best precalculated because they involve the exponential function, which uses floating point numbers, which are very slow on GBA. 
<br/>
But really, it is an easy concept, just load sample, multiply by vol, add to mix, add increment to pos, and repeat. Of course, you have to check if the sample is ending this run through the loop, and if it is, then either disable it or subtract the loop length from the pos, which is a good place for optimization, since you can check if a sample is going to end this frame and if not, use a loop that doesn't do any checking.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You may need to think about the following:
<br/>
<br/>
To play a realistic sounding note you need to shape the envelope of the sample. Mainly that means when the note starts it gets louder and quieter at different rates depending on the instrument. Also when the midi file says 'release the note' you don't just turn it off. You leave it playing for a while, while you reduce its volume. And until that note has reached 0 in volume, you can't re-use that channel (or voice). 
<br/>
<br/>
My approach to  channels was to look for an unused channel when I had a new note to start. If there wasn't one, then I killed the oldest note playing, and used its channel.
<br/>
<br/>
For the envelope I cheated and had a single volume multiplier for each channel. This was decayed by a value specified by the instrument, and at a different rate when the note was released, and gave a realistic sounding note. When the volume reached zero, the channel was marked as free again. Handling the decay was a separate and not very time-consuming operation after each mixing session, because I chose the numbers to only change the envelope size once per frame. (There is also an attack phase along similar lines.)
<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting feature was that each sample was stored with its own frequency parameter, which was the base of the sample increment calculation. This meant that the samples didn't have to be at the same frequency, which proved quite useful in keeping their size down.
<br/>
<br/>
One of my sound channels looked like this:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">gb_feedback, there's nothing wrong with your struct member order. You have 8 u8's which translates to 2 32-bit aligned memory locs, a 32-bit pointer to an array of u8's, 6 u32's which are 32-bit anyway, trailed by 3 u8's which fit in one 32-bit location, for a total of 10 32-bit memory locations. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only inefficiency in this struct is that you could fit one more 8-bit member at the tail end and still use only 10 32-bit memory locations, but the ordering / alignment of your members is fine, which is what the community dickhead who posted before me decided to criticize.<br/>_________________<br/>"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy."

<br/>
The struct in itself was unimportant of course, it just represents the data structure at a point halfway through the midi decoder processor. One side is a midi format decoder which drives an array of these structures; the other side is a mixer which uses them to create the output sound wave. In my experience data structure is the most defining thing about a software algorithm, so this is what I presented to give the OP an idea how I achieved the midi player functionality.

<br/>
I would just say that if a poster can't be constructive, the least they could do is to shut up.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ModPlug Tracker converts from MIDI to IT with no loss in quality.  It supports MOD although I've never tried it.  It should work fine if you pick some nice samples.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
