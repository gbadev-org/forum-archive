<br/>
<br/>
I've just been told that OpenMPT can export gba sound (which has to be converted by a makefile) and now I'm confused about the type of file it accepts. 
<br/>
<br/>
any help?
<br/>
<br/>
what format should I export it in?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maxmod accepts MOD/S3M/XM/IT files in its conversion tool.  There is no special export command in modplug tracker or anything like that.
<br/>
<br/>
For an example, see "C:\devkitpro\examples\gba\audio\maxmod\basic_sound".
<br/>
<br/>
Note that samples are converted to 8-bit on the GBA (and remain 16-bit on the NDS).<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
and also looking at the folder it seems as if the "wave" format is supported? and well as the "flatoutlies" listed (which I dont know how to use OPEN MT to covert my music to it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Think of a MOD file as kind of a MIDI file with built-in instrument samples.  Music is composed inside the tracker tool.  If the file wasn't originally designed as a MIDI or MOD/S3M/XM/IT file, converting it to a mod won't help much.
<br/>
If all you have is a wave file or MP3, you can use the <a class="postlink" href="http://pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GBA GSM Player by Tepples</a> if you want compressed audio.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
