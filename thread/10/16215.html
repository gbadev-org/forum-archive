    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to the mod thing and I have some problems when I convert a MIDI file to an XM. The samples won't loop that long, so I can't have long notes, which I need to have. I haven't changed any settings or anything. Does anyone know how to fix that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I remember correctly, when you convert from a midi Modplug Tracker for some reason adds a note-off command just after some of the long notes, which makes the note end abruptly and before it should actually end. That's what it was doing with me anyway. I just removed the note-off commands and the long notes carried on as they were supposed to.

Conversion from midi to XM seems to be not an exact science, so you can usually expect to have fix and clean up most of the songs you convert.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
