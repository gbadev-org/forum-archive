    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I discovered GB Development along time ago, prolly before the GBA. Now that I have a GBA I am more interested in programing for it. I've had experiance in VB and a few other minor languages. I've already read through many tutorials. But none of them talked about sound. Are there any? How do I do sound? And what file types does GBA support and do i need to convert them?<br/>_________________<br/>Projects: Learning all this jazz...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Near as I can tell....  (I am something of a GBA newbie myself)  The GBA is quite easy to do stuff with.  A few header files, and you can make it do all kinds of flashing lights and loud bleeps and bloops.
<br/>
<br/>
It's getting it to do cool stuff that's difficult.  There are a few tools here on GBADev that will convert PCM wave files into a C header file for you...
<br/>
<br/>
And there are two very good audio tutorials available as well.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Of course, wavs are just for learning purposes though.  If you actually want to make a game, you are going to have to go through the gates of hell, and steal the code from Satan himself, then pee in his cereal.  Or you can just code your own tools.  Whichever is easier.
<br/>
<br/>
All my coding on GBA is done in C++.  I would think that VB doesn't do you much good on GBA, but it would be quite handy in coding tools that you might need.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
