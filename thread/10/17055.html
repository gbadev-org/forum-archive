Looks like it's not around anymore, or at least not by that name. here <a class="postlink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070307131222/http://www.sseyo.com/" target="_blank">http://web.archive.org/web/20070307131222/http://www.sseyo.com/</a> is a link to the wayback machine archive of it. It was this handy little tool that generated some nice music with small description files. I mostly remember it as the browser plug-in for web pages.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i was wondering if something like it exists for the DS, or if anyone has thought about making it or already has. That would be pretty cool. It's definitely out of my league, but it's something i would love to use at some point. Mostly just curious at this point.

edit: i guess it goes by Noatikl these days. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.intermorphic.com/tools/noatikl/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.intermorphic.com/tools/noatikl/index.html</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
