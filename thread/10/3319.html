And the player is ... jaw-droppingly good. And I am SERIOUS. Just like how it sounds on my PC too.
<br/>
<br/>
And the sheer number of songs you can fit on the thing... wow.

Out of six posts that's 4 times you said this! I'm assuming that this is just a problem with using english and not a spam-like attack on me :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it sounds very nice though - no problems with that. It should sound nice as it's about 80 times bigger! This gives the chance to include much higher quality samples.
<br/>
<br/>
When I wrote the Pogoshell plug-in I didn't think that Pogoshell users would appreciate a plug-in of 14.3 Mbits! 
<br/>
<br/>
Please carry on plugging your player, but I'd appreciate an end to the unnecessary comparison to a Pogoshell plug-in.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The program is still in progress.
<br/>
And a lot of functions are not open yet.
<br/>
This is just a midi player at time ,and it may be a multip-media software someday.

If you understand Chinese,you'll know why it is so big.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
