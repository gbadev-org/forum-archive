    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to get sound into my gba stuff and it just isn't working.  Either one of two things happen.  A) no sound and freezes or B) sound and nothing else.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a game I'm working on putting sound in, but I couldn't even get that to get past A so I took the krawall demo and tried adding my stuff to that and then I get B.  So <a class="postlink" href="http://www.themikausprojects.com/misc/GBADev/SoundHelp.zip" target="_blank">http://www.themikausprojects.com/misc/GBADev/SoundHelp.zip</a> is where the zip is that has my code.  Help!!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Updated the zip.  I had the wrong modules.lib and the wrong Makefile included.  Fixed now.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also it's just the modules from the krawall example.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  I also tried it with AAS and when I can get AAS sound to work I can't get even a DMA copy to work but the aas splash screen works fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
