    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are two kinds of audio player for Game Boy: those that decode MP3 in dedicated hardware on the cartridge (such as SongPro) and those that recompress the MP3s into a different format that the GBA's CPU can actually decode in real time. Because you mention a flash cart, it looks like you're looking for the latter. Try hacking something up with my <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#8ad" target="_blank">8ad codec</a>. I'm sorry that it's not more automated for the point-and-drool types.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
