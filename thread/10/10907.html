    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using AAS for a while, and it worked good, but I needed a little more, so I'm trying to get going with Krawall. I got it to compile (although I get warnings of "'packed' attribute ignored"), and certain samples being redefined (warnings also, but that must be because I have samples named the same in the music, easy fix there), and I have music playing, but the music is going incredibly fast.

<br/>
I have the "kradInterrupt" function in my timer1 interrupt table list, the "kramWorker" function in my VBlank interrupt function (which is called every VBlank from my BIOS function "BIOS_VSync", and then just call "kragInit" and "krapPlay" in my main testing function.

<br/>
Need anymore info?

EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I found the problem. I was using the wrong lib. Was using "krawall30.lib" instead of "krawall.lib". Now, to check how well my mods work (which were converted to s3m so they could be converted).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
