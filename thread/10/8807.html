<br/>
<br/>
I am the programmer of an amator team and I know nothing about music.  Can anyone say if there is a way with mods to share the instruments between differents mods ? Our musician will always use less or more the same instruments between all his mods. Does krawall or another library allow instrument sharing ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a _few_ tracking formats let you specifiy the path to the wav files instead of embedding them directly into the file itself, though that's almost counter intuitive to why they're self contained in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>
however... i am not sure that i know of a format that's already supported by tracker players for the DS. The formats I believe I've seen supported are .s3m, .xm, and .mod... and none of those formats can do this...iirc. 
<br/>
<br/>
it might be a good idea to look into one of the playback engines currently out there and experiment with mod'ing it for this type of usage (blip tracker is a good example).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've tried this before, but I've run into the OrdNum limit. OrdNum is the length of the order table, and at least in S3M, it is an 8-bit value. At an average tempo of 480 rows per minute (120 quarter notes per minute, row == 16th note), a pattern lasts eight seconds, and a 200-pattern song finishes in under a half hour. A lot of games have a soundtrack longer than that, especially starting in the 16-bit era.
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of formats, such as S3M, have two name fields: "sample name" and "sample filename". A converter from stock S3M to shared-sample S3M might put each sample's CRC32 into the "sample filename" so that the loader can load it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you use kusma's pimpmobile, it will automatically detect if multiple mod files uses the same instruments, and only include them once in your compiled program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
