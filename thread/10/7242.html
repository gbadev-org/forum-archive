    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having very serious issues here. I'm more familiar with visual studio and not really keen on the whole command prompt thing unless I know the program. Where do I need to put stuff and how do I need to write a .bat file that will actually let me compile the Krawall example? I am using DevKitAdv. I'm mainly unsure of how to link thinks from within a batch file. Help here would be greatly appreciated. I figure if I can get the example to compile it won't be that difficult to start working with my own code. Thanks a bunch in advance!
<br/>
<br/>
PS: the best response to this question would include where i need to put the krawall include files and such and the text contents of a batch file. Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you headspin. I finally got the silly thing to compile. Now I'm having more issues. I tried to substitute my own .s3m file replacing the one you included just to see exactly how I would have to do this, and although it compiled fine, the resulting file played nothing. The sfx worked fine, there was just no music. Whats the deal?
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect I have to change some names and things in the Main.c (actually I think it's "tutor.c") to get krawall to look at my file and not yours. Can you give me a list of the things I have to put in myself that are file specific?
<br/>
<br/>
There's also the slight possibility that my Mod Tracker is not converting properly from MIDI to s3m. It plays fine in the tracker, even after closing and reopening, and it plays your file fine as well, so I'm not so sure this is the problem. (Yes, I must use MIDI, because I can compose actual notes in my MIDI composer rather than using rows, which get really confusing. I'm perfectly willing to accept any conversion differences at this point.)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help so far. I think I'm getting a fair grasp on this, I just need to figure out how to implement my own files and I'll have it down.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Whats with the blue line in the demo? Is that just a demonstration of sorts?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After you do the conversion of your s3m to krawall's format, make sure that you have a new "modules.h" with the name of your s3m in it.  Make sure you include that, and refer to the song by that name.
<br/>
<br/>
If modules.h doesn't have the name of your song, then the conversion didn't work properly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another possibility is that your converter isn't creating 8-bit mono samples when it generates your s3m. If I remember right, Krawall will simply ignore samples that aren't of that format. So if you're dumping out stereo or 16-bit samples, that could be the trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
Your SFX might be the correct format, which would explain why they're working but not the music.

Generally, yes, although I've run into problems with that before also.   Krawall barfed once when my sample name included some non-alphanumeric characters.   (although I had other problems with my samples at the time, so it's possible that really something else was causing the issue)
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, if you are having trouble, I'd recommend keeping the names simple.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">YAY!!!!!! I have sound! More importantly, it's my song! (like, seriously I was dancing about the room when i got it to work.) 16-bit samples turned out to be the culprit. ModPlug Tracker uses them in the MIDI library when it imports. I converted every single one of the samples BY HAND to 8bit in sound recorder. Sadly, I couldn't figure out how to keep the original frequency at the same time, so they ended up sounding good at 44100 Hz. I'll sort that out later. And for some wierd reason, even though the samples were stereo, they still worked fine. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since Krawall mixes at a certain rate, it makes sense not to have any samples with a higher rate, right?
<br/>
<br/>
Um, that ModPlug trick that can do all of that converting for me, where is it? I searched for about an hour for that function (cause it would really help for my more sample heavy files) and finally gave up. That is the last thing I need from this thread. Thank you guys sooo much!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I implemented krawall into my bejeweled demo, and after figuring out an easy kramWorker() call by altering my WaitForVsync function, I discovered that (OMG) my code isn't really as fast as I thought it was. I ended up having to throw Vsyncs in at wierd places to keep the audio smooth. I suppose I'll figure out how to use interupts later and do it from there to solve the issue.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

Didn't need to. You can right-click the waveform itself in MPT's sample editor and choose "Convert to 8-bit".

<br/>
Are you sure what rate your samples are playing back at? Remember that a sample at C-6 is playing back twice as fast as the same sample at middle C-5.

I generally do profiling on hardware by changing the blend mode or palette color 0 before and after a function that runs during draw time so that I can see how long it takes.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
