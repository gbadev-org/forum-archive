<br/>
<br/>
I am fiddling around with soundsystems in these days, and I got FRAS running some days ago. I just hear lots of ugly clicking from the MOD file that I'm playing, so, I wonder, how can that be? what could cause that?
<br/>
<br/>
Have anybody got some similar problem?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am using the precompiled fras.lib
<br/>
<br/>
- edit: added question -
<br/>
<br/>
I am also trying out codewaves. I am just wondering if there is an example for DevkitARM, because my current test does not work.
<br/>
<br/>
solved: Codewaves needs a handler that supports multiple intr's (gimme one! :P)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
