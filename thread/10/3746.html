    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can play pretty much everything if you write a mixer for it. The gba just has 2 FIFO Registers for the sound and no hardware mixer. So you need to write your own. I don't know what YM is but if its a tracker format it's possible for sure. But the hardware isn't cappable of playing mp3s and such, or just with inaccaptable limitations.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank for your answer. YM Format is the XM anchestor used by Yamaha chip found on CPC, ATARI ST and Amiga to play old musics.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My "Thrust" game has my YM player in it.  It plays the Rob Hubbard theme from the original Atari ST game.
<br/>
<br/>
The player is included in the source code I released last year.
