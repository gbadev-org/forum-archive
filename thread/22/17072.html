    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Having recently tried to use my motion card in my DSi, I noticed it doesn't work. When I remove my flash card and insert the motion card it isn't detected. I assume the new firmware has a part to play in this, does anyone have a solution for this? or have we lost motion sensing forever?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
