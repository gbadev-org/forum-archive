    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have never used the motion stuff in palib, but I do use palib and the normal motion code. As far as I know, the palib motion codes are compatible with all of the motion cards.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
