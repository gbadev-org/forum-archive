    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you guys heard about this? Its sounds somewhat similar but, I still don't fully understand their description, at first I thought (and hoped) that "KeithE" had found a commercial developer for the DS Motion Pak, but this sounds different, almost awkward in comparison.

"The slide controller plugs into the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot and, laying beneath the system, looks somewhat like a stand. As you slide the DS around on a table, the controller picks up your movements. This is how you move the main character about the overhead fields of play."

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds like the DS is used like a mouse... But why use it as a mouse when you've got a touchscreen? And sliding the whole system around? Now there is a bad idea...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The picture I got in my mind was a sort of joystick poking out the bottom of the DS.... Not going to work. Why would you want to slide a handheld system about on a table? not going to be any fun on a bus/train/car/walking etc.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got this game for Christmas from <span style="font-weight: bold">[Retailer removed by MOD]</span> for about $20. It its just like an optical mouse, and it has built-in rumble, too. You move the character around by physically moving the DS with the Slide Controller plugged in, and it works just like a mouse.

I've got a video of it (and the Face Training game) here:
