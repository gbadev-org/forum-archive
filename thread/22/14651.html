    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What he means is that you get one motion pak with 3 shells, the one you see in all the pictures is an extender to make it fis a 'phat' ds, you also get the black and white shells (they are only plastic covers that clip on and off). From what I understand, you get all three covers with the product.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

Mine only came with a white shell, which is somewhat disappointing seeing as I have a black DS Lite &gt;_&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on taking the PCB and putting it in a spare DS Lite filler pak so that it will look good and the connectors won't be exposed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got mine and it was shipped in a small box including a white ds lite case.
<br/>
I have two DSes : one gold and a silver, so i didn't care for color.
<br/>
The box is strong enough for your sensor to be protected if you put it in.
<br/>
<br/>
Now i have to figure out how to remove the fat-case without breaking anything =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I used a 1.4mm (+) screwdriver to unscrew the DS Phat case. From there you just pull it off easily and snap the DS Lite shell on.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. -- Nice analogy. xD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
