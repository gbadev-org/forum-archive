    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if anyone here has enough knowledge/skill to patch mario64 to use the motion card/pak instead of the stylus. I think this would add an excellent dimension to the game, I'm only suggesting to replace the directional controls, not the jumping, that would be silly. But it would make the game both easier and more fun.

Can anyone do it?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
