    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I added DS Motion Card support to DiggerDS.  Not the best game for analog control since it has digital movement but I just added it for fun.
<br/>
<br/>
You can connect a DS Motion Card at anytime and use tilt to move instead of d-pad.  It makes a hard game even harder but it was fun to mess around with.  Perhaps in a future version,  I could use the motion sensor to tilt money bags or move the enemies, instead of moving Digger.

I may eventually fix it myself but I have no idea what i'm doing most of the time.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

2007-06-23 - DiggerDS v0.11
<br/>
Just minor change.  Recompiled with newer motion code/libnds, so it should now support MK-6 and DS Motion Pak but I don't own those devices, so it has not been tested.  Let me know if it works on those devices.
<br/>
<br/>
2007-06-26 - DiggerDS v0.2
<br/>
Fixed a memory leak in sdl_vid.c, vgawrite function. It should no longer crash after 10 minutes
<br/>
<br/>
Now it needs sound.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I got 0.2 from your site... but it doesn't work with my Slot2 Pak.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I had to remove the Slot2 and re-insert it once the game was started. :)
<br/>
Sorry about that... now to get used to the controls lol.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the very very quick reply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">KeithE, what do I have to change to make it so Motion Pak users can have their device connected at startup?  It tries to detect a libfat device first for saving high scores, would that be causing problems with the Motion Pak plugged in?
<br/>
<br/>
Ploes, what slot-1 device are you using?  Can you patch diggerds.nds with the DLDI driver for that device and then test again?  (that way it will skip trying to use libfat on a slot-2 device).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DiggerDS works fine for me with DS Motion Pak using my MK5 slot-1 card.  I insert the DS Motion Pak at the beginning, and it is detected right away.
<br/>
<br/>
I've never had a problem keeping the DS Motion Pak connected at startup, so I don't think there is anything you need to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
