    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking for an excuse to get motion pack support into Q2 yet I can't think of anything decent to do with it. The fact that the game has been written (ie by id ten years ago, and I can't really change it) makes it harder to come up with cool mechanics.
<br/>
Anyone got any ideas of how DS motion could be used in a first-person shooter?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Besides using the ds motion as a way to control the view (left/right using X axis, up/down using Y axis if you manage to "remove" gravity), i don't see any. But that would be nice, standing in the middle of your living-room, whirling around, bending up and down to shoot at things. Or not. But i guess it'd be cool nonetheless.

At least i'm sure it'll contribute to the whealth of ostheopaths.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I first got my Motion Card, the first thing I tried to do with it was get it working in DS DOOM, though I never got very far because other things distracted me.
<br/>
<br/>
But Z-axis acceleration for moving forward and back and X-axis acceleration for turning and/or strafing sounds to me like it would be totally cool.  Though you'd need a big huge open space for that sort of thing, of course.  With Quake, you might be able to use the Y-axis, too, though I don't know.  Be extra nice if aiming and shooting were then controlled by the touchscreen.
<br/>
<br/>
I was going to call the release Follow Me To Your DOOM because of course this would be totally dangerous and no doubt some kid would end up walking off the roof of his house or getting hit by a car or something while playing with it, but that's half the fun right there.

That's not snow; it's probably just crumpled paper. It appears to be on a plain white background. Notice how some of the crumple marks go straight into the blue "SEGA" logo. Besides, if it were a sk<span style="font-weight: bold">ii</span> device, wouldn't it have a cable for connecting it to the bottom of a Nintendo controller? ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh yeah, it IS paper, isn't it?! I was using my laptop screen to look at the picture and it's got a crap viewing angle so it looks pretty bloomed-out when at the wrong angle. Definately paper. I'll try and get a photo of the screen later, since it looks far more impressive with the bloom look.
