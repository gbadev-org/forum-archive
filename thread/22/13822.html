    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone else noticed that most of the games that were created for the Slot 1 motion card (ndsmotion.com) do not detect the Slot 2 Motion Paks? I keep getting messages along the lines of "DS Motion not found!"... 
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a problem with my motion pak, or will certain games not work with the Slot 2 devices? If so, is there anything that can be done to make them work? Sorry if this is in the wrong place or if this was already posted, but I couldn't find it.... 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks &lt;3</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably because the game was made before the slot 2 came out?  I bet my Motion Maze demo doesn't work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's what I figured, considering how much newer the Slot-2 motion paks are than the Slot-1 versions..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ndsmotion site says:
<br/>
<br/>
By using the latest ndsmotion functions in libnds (new functions are in devkitpro CVS), developers can create software that is compatible with both the DS Motion Card and the DS Motion Pak, as well as the Neoflash MK6 Motion.
<br/>
<br/>
For instructions on updating your programs from the old (before May 22, 2007) ndsmotion functions to the new ndsmotion functions, download the readme (txt). 
<br/>
<br/>
So does that mean that mean that there is a way to make all of those games work on the Slot-2 devices? I'd really like to be able to use the Motion Pak with more than just a few games :-).... Thanks again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like I said, I have no idea how to set up/use devkitpro or anything... Is this a difficult thing to do, or could I learn to do this myself? I don't want to have to track down a dozen different people who developed each game found on ndsmotion... Is there a way that I could learn to set up devkitpro / how to recomple the source code?

Sorry if I am asking stupid questions - I'm just trying to avoid begging others do to everything for me :-/

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think Motion Pak support is still only in CVS, which means it's not in the release version of libnds.  Unfortunately the CVS version of libnds won't support sound if you use it with the release version of devkitarm (in my testing).  I don't know when the next version will be released, Wintermute is always working on it.
<br/>
<br/>
You will get a few errors when recompiling with a newer libnds, if it has old motion code, you need to change motion_enable() to motion_init().<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Once you have everything installed, updating most motion homebrew should be as simple as changing a few lines and recompiling (there will be exceptions).

The only ones that were compatible were:
<br/>
<br/>
Pixel Bounce
<br/>
DSaber
<br/>
DSaSketch
<br/>
WaterDrops Tilt
<br/>
<br/>
DiggerDS kinda picks up on the pak, but it doesn't really work at all..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rest of them will not even detect the Slot-2 device..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DLAI - yikes - that would be scary.  Unless somebody is working on another DS accelerometer that I'm not aware of, the current DS motion sensors (DS Motion Card, DS Motion Pak, MK6-Motion, R6-Gold) are the only ones that will ever be made.  There is also the DSerial tilt sensor, but it is not supported by the libnds motion functions.
<br/>
<br/>
I have stated on ndsmotion.com which games are compatible with the DS Motion Pak - read the description of each game to see it.  It looks like I missed DiggerDS though - I'll update the description when I get a chance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The R6 does have all the motion stuff that the other motion devices have, also 2Mbit of flash and type-3 save eeprom (2Mbit). The loader is in early stages I can't tell you what the end menu will be like, but currently it loads a lot of homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

This is tempting as it means for my motion maze I could have this and a rumble pack in that triggers when the ball hits a wall.  Man, i'll have too many motion sensors.  But then that means I can my my stuff work with all of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That question may have already been asked, but i didn't find it, so here i go :
<br/>
I learnt that slot2 linker eat up more energy than slot1s. As i'm about to order a motion pak, i just wondered if it "reduced" the autonomy of the DS (and if so, get an estimation of the reduction). I have an idea for some "long duration" application (i can *play* on the ds for about 8 hours, i have no clue how long it could run with a "lightweight" app running. I'd really appreciate any insight on its power behaviour, while i wait for it to come in my mailbox.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Shame on the retailers. The only french one sells only slot1, i have to buy my slot2 from Canada ;) Mooooooooose power.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I remember using Honeywell HMC1001/HMC1002 combo + 3x Analog device ADXL105 for a some student work about calibration procedures, attitude determination systems and dead-reckoning. As far as i remember, the honeywell worked nicely, and you needed an amplifier stage (standard output is +/- 50mV).
<br/>
<br/>
Only "problems" i has were that :
<br/>
- i had to reset it between read sequences, as the heavy mechanical shocks of my experimental device did "unalign" the sensitive magnetic domains (cf page 8 of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/siefast/nest/nest_webpage/datasheet/Honeywell%20-%20Magnetometer%20-%20HMC1002.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet</a>)
<br/>
- it happened that the output are quite sensitive to temperature. (i had to apply temperature conpensation methods and study some temperature calibration scheme)
<br/>
<br/>
These were really good devices. But after giving the honeywell's site a quick look, i'd say that you're better off with a HMC1043 (3-axis MR sensor in a 3x3x1.4mm LCC package. Field range is ?6 gauss, resolution is 120 microgauss, and sensitivity is 1mV/Vgauss. Sold as pre-production engineering units. 25$)
<br/>
<br/>
Using 3-axis mag/acc i'd get a full attitude determination system. Mmmmh... Porting my student's work to the DS, what a way to dive into the past !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
DS Motion Pak uses approximately 10-15 milliamps.

<br/>
The DS Motion Pak uses more than the DS Motion Card because it has a microprocessor to handle communications between the sensors and the DS.  The sensors in the DS Motion Card can communicate directly with the DS without needing a microprocessor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
