    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'd like to add DS Motion support to my game, but unfortunately, I don't own one.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there somewhere a doc or faq which respond to this questions:
<br/>
<br/>
- how are scaled the motion_read_x/y/z and motion_acceleration function? (what is their value range)
<br/>
<br/>
- how are mapped the motion axis? (is the Y axis up/down or is it the Z one)?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks a lot!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'll need a DS and a Motion Card/Pak for testing, even if you just want to make sure that the motions you are programming are actually doable. Once you've bought one, the following are educated extrapolations based on what I've read about the Wii Remote accelerometers:

<br/>
Hold the DS still, such as by placing it on a table. The read value corresponds to 9.8 m/s^2.

Up/down is whichever one is large when the DS sits still on a table.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
