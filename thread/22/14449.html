    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to build the sample app using the slot 2 DSMotion Pack 
<br/>
<br/>
(I can't use the slot 1, as I'll need access to the storage on the cartridge)
<br/>
<br/>
I currently have version 19 of Devkit ARM.  Does it require version 20 or 21?  Or some other library file?
<br/>
<br/>
Or is it simply not fully supported yet (time constraints on the developer and all that)
<br/>
<br/>
The reference code does not run out of the box with the slot 2 Motion Pack either.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, update to DevkitARM 21, change the reference slightly, and its all happy...
<br/>
<br/>
Two questions:  Is there no longer a way to check for pack presence?  Or does the return value of the new init function say something useful?
<br/>
<br/>
The accelerometers seem a little noisy.  How long a sample length do people normally do to flatten out the noise?
<br/>
<br/>
Much thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">motion_init() returns 1 if it detects a motion sensor, and it returns 0 if it does not detect a motion sensor.
<br/>
<br/>
Averaging 3-5 samples should be good for most applications.  Average any more and you start to get some noticeable delay.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the noise comes from the sensor itself, but most if it is actually environmental vibration that the sensor is picking up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For the gyro, actually, I seem to need to average a couple of seconds worth at 50ms sampling to get something that will hold reasonably straight, and I still see a fair amount of drift.
<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I'm doing stuff that isn't simple "am I moving" but some more sophisticated inertial reference stuff, so that a low cost solid state gyro is a bit noisy is not a suprise.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
