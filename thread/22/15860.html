    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there, I'm deciding what slot 2 to purchase for my DS and I was just wondering, have you guys considered adding RAM and GBA to the slot 2 (Black &amp; Lite, to be specific) pack?
<br/>
<br/>
I was going to get the EZ 3in1, but I really find rumble pointless. So I would like to see a Motion + RAM + GBA slot 2 pack, and if Rumble is also in it, that would be even sweeter.
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering why there isn't at least Motion + RAM + GBA, since the Motion chip probably doesn't take up too much space? I've seen it combined with a slot 1 card that also runs homebrews, and the slot 2 probably has more space than the slot 1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WOW, a 3-in-1 with accelerometers! If DSMotion had some GBA-compatible memory on-board (Norflash+Cache), I'd be buying one right now. With 'ExpLoader', shouldn't even really need any slot-1 flash or SRAM, right? Is DSMotion with browser cache on the horizon?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think KeithE has changed companies.  I'm not sure anyone else kept tabs on this board.

I think KeithE was the company.
<br/>
<br/>
NeoFlash seems to have bought or licensed or at least used-with-permission the DS Motion Card design, though, so maybe try directing the request at them.

He worked for the maker of the accelerometer.  There are a whole bunch of other people at that company.  I don't know if anyone else was working the GBA/DS accelerometer unit though.
