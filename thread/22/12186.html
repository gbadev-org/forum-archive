    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Being the owner of a slot-1 cart for homebrew I'm unable to use the slot-1 ds motion.  I wanted to start a thread covering all the questions about the possibility of a slot 2 version of the DS Motion.  Hopefully KeithE will answer :D
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, will there be one?  (I want one :)  The website indicates there's a prototype slot-2 version, so I'd guess that it's probable.
<br/>
<br/>
When will a slot 2 version be available?  Not really after a date, just want an idea if it's weeks or months.
<br/>
<br/>
What can I do to accelerate the development of a slot-2 version?  Would buying a slot-1 version help?
<br/>
<br/>
Do you need to guage the interest in a slot-2 version, or are you already convinced to create one?
<br/>
<br/>
Will the slot 2 version be an adaptor for the slot 1 version, or a dedicated slot 2 device?
<br/>
<br/>
Will the API for the slot-2 version be the same as the slot-1 version?  Will software developed now for the slot-1 version work seamlessly with the slot-2?
<br/>
<br/>
As slot-2 is oriented differently to slot-1 will that cause any problems?  I've read that you need to 'teach' the card what level is, so maybe it's not even a problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Does the extra physical space available to a slot-2 version tempt you into adding any extra features?
<br/>
<br/>
Plz add more slot-2 related questions!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As a temporary solution, that might be fine, but if your homebrew uses libfat to load files on demand then it will require that the slot-1 memory cart stay in slot-1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm glad to hear there is interest in a slot-2 version.  It will be useful for slot-1 card owners, and commercial developers as well.  I certainly am planning on making them.  I will call it the DS Motion Pak.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I've made a prototype slot-2 version.  Actually, the prototype is just a DS Motion Card cut and soldered into a GBA cartridge PCB, connecting the appropriate pins.  Since the GBA slot only has a parallel port, not a serial port, the code to communicate with it is a series of reads from specific SRAM addresses (this essentially creates a serial port).  It works, but I'm going to make a better version with a microcontroller to handle the communication translation.  With the method I used for the prototype, it doesn't work if any interrupts occur during the reading of the motion card - the delays caused by the interrupt interfere with the communication.
<br/>
<br/>
It will be months before the slot-2 version is done - the earliest it will be done is May - probably not until June.  There's really nothing you can do to accelerate the development.  Some of the time is waiting for components, some of it is design, testing, debugging, and some of it is manufacturing time.
<br/>
<br/>
The slot-2 version will not be an adapter, it will be a separate cartridge.  I don't have the resources to do any custom plastic molding, so I need to work with cartridge shells that are already existing.
<br/>
<br/>
The low-level code to communicate with the slot-2 version will be different than the slot-1 version, but there will be high-level functions that accomplish exactly the same tasks as the DS Motion Card functions.  Software developed for the slot-1 version will not work with the slot-2 version, but it could very easily be adapted to the slot-2 version (about 5 minutes of changing the source code).
<br/>
<br/>
I will make the slot-2 version orientation the same as the slot-1 version.
<br/>
<br/>
Extra features - I was thinking it would be cool to add rumble.  I've heard that the rumble in the supercard is terrible - not worth having.  Anyone have any comments on that?  If it is no good, then I'd need to be able to buy the same rumble "force reactor" that is in the official cartridges.  It would probably be expensive in low quantities though, so I'll most likely just keep the same features as the slot-1 version.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the Yoshi Topsy-Turvy Game Pak will work for some things, but the sensor in it is not nearly as good as the sensors I'm using.  It is only dual axis, not as precise or accurate, and has more cross-axis sensitivity and noise.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the sensors will pick up the rumble, but actually that can be a good thing.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I hacked an accelerometer into a gamecube controller to replace the left analog joystick, and I left the rumble motors connected.  When playing super monkey ball, when you hit an obstacle, the rumble motors vibrate, and the accelerometer picks that up, which makes the character shake on the screen.  In my opinion, that is actually a better reaction to hitting an obstacle than just vibrating - the "feedback" goes both ways - from the console to the player, and back again to to the console via the accelerometer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Being an owner of a slot2 homebrew device (EZFlashIV) I'm naturally a fan of the DS Motion Card (not so much the Pak, but I like that it will be available to people who have a slot1 homebrew device.)
<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned, however, that releasing a slot2 motion sensing device will "kill" the DS Motion Card.  Are you concerned about this at all, Keith?  I see more and more people opting to buy slot1 flash storage devices because they're cheaper and easier than slot2 + a passcard.  However, I don't feel that slot1 homebrew kits are "better" when viewed from a hardware perspective - they support less features than their slot2 counterparts.
<br/>
<br/>
I anticipate that because of the popularity of slot1 flash carts, most games will be developed for the slot2 version of the motion sensor.  How difficult will it be to port code from the slot2 version to the slot1 version?  I'm a bit worried that slot2 flash cartridges will die - not because they're inferior by any means, but simply because they seem to be losing popularity.
<br/>
<br/>
Are my fears unfounded?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think that is the case.  Both slots have pros and cons.  From your point of view slot 2 has more pros.  From most developers they do.  From an end user point of view the slot 1 is very tempting, no patching, more compatibility, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
There's still many people with slot 2 devices so I don;t think there is anything to worry about.
<br/>
<br/>
I plan on getting both for development purposes.  I want to make sure my stuff works on either.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons slot 1 is gaining popularity is they are a DS cart and they are less hassle.  I like my dsx because it fits in a normal ds cart case.
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately I would like a slot 1 and 2 device combo.  The slot 2 will be a rumble pak with extra storage capabilities.  The only thing you'd really be missing then is sram.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You lost me.. So, what is the total cost for a GPS module that can interface with the DS, be in a commercial package, and also have software available for it to work?  Keep in mind that it'll probably cost more than the combination of all the parts.
<br/>
<br/>
But, if you can build and sell them for the ~$60 price range (as you can purchase a handheld GPS for $80) I'll buy one for sure!

From what I've heard, it doesn't matter what driver you use. DS-X will patch the homebrew (as it loads, not the file itself). I heard someone saying they removed the MK2/3 driver and it still worked on their DS-X, it was just 'detected' as some other device.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, it is definately not perfect, and I wish they would release some code/specs like they have promised in the past.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I was wondering if you couldn't make the slot 2 version an even more diverse sensor package, if you could put an infared light sensor like boktai and an electromagnetic sensor like the game in the article, I could only imagine the homebrew potential.

If you want that kind of funtionatlity, it's going to shoot the price of this card way too high. Then noone will buy it, and subsequently, it will die leaving only you and Keith able to play any games you may make :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS &amp; Dominos :: <a class="postlink" href="http://dsdominos.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">DS Dominos</a></span>

<br/>
<br/>
A merchant doesn't want $33 tied up in something that only sells for $35, unless that item moves very fast.  If they are only going to make $2 either way, they want something with a wholesale price of $2 or $3.

<br/>
However.....
<br/>
<br/>
It will have the capability to add any 2 analog sensors that can operate on 3.3V.  I'll make sure there are some easy places to solder to Vdd, GND, and the 2 extra analog input pins to the microcontroller (Yes, it has a microcontroller).
<br/>
<br/>
I'll also leave the microcontroller programming pins accessible so you can change the firmware if you have the knowledge and desire to do so.  I will not, however, be supporting custom firmware like Natrium42 is doing with DSerial.

There is no scheduled release date yet - spring/summer 2007 is the best estimate I can give.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
