    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm Sinkhead from the reviewing team of <span style="font-weight: bold">[Removed by MOD]</span> (one of the largest DS and Wii forums in the world). I've just received my Motion Pak and I'll be starting the review soon. Unlike the other reviews at <span style="font-weight: bold">[removed]</span> I won't be focusing solely on the hardware, I will be including mini-reviews of lots of homebrew.
<br/>
If you want your homebrew to be featured please make sure it is compatible with the Motion Pak. I have looked around these forums, but some of the stuff I've found isn't compatible with the Pak, only the Card, so I'm running low on things to include and I want to give a good impression of the kit!
<br/>
<br/>
So far I'm including:
<br/>
<ul>DiggerDS
<br/>
DSaSketch
<br/>
Whee! DS 2</ul>
<br/>
And I want to include:
<br/>
<ul>Circular Defense Motion (Not compatible with Motion Pak, only Card)
<br/>
SpoutEx (Same as above)
<br/>
Physics Demo (Ball is transparent)
<br/>
Eclipse (Controls break after first few seconds)
<br/>
MotionDraw2 (Doesn't detect Pak)</ul>
<br/>
If you're the developer of any of the above games and you want them included in my review, please fix them and let me know. Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to suggest things to include please post it and I'll take a look!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot!

You can get it from <a class="postlink" href="http://spinal.dizidesigns.co.uk/diagnose.php" target="_blank">my website</a>. Its not really a game though.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check the official site.  As Kieth mentioned, it has links to all (or maybe just about all, though I don't know of any that are missing) the Motion supporting homebrews.
<br/>
<br/>
Codename: Hacker is one of my favorites.  It's a great game to begin with and the mtoion controls are very well done.  Motion control doesn't entirely fit the theme of the game as it is (the character sprite should have been changed when using motion controls, at least).  Still fun, though.

It's not about hosting pirated content. It's about hosting open discussion of piracy methods. There are one site starting with a P, one site starting with a G, and one site starting with an M, which are considered off-limits here. If I were an administrator, I'd use a phpBB word censor to block them the way animalxing.com's forums did with YouTube. But as a moderator, I don't have such powers.

Sticky topics are at the top of DS development, DS homebrew announcements, DS Flash Equipment, and DS Misc. All point to the official rules. I'll add one in DS Motion Sensor.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
