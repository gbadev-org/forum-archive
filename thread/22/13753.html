    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is an application to turn your DS into a motion sensing USB gamepad.  You'll need a DS Motion Card or MK6-motion or R6 gold for the motion sensing, and an MK5 (or clone) GBA slot USB linker.  Plug all the cards in, plug the USB cable into your computer, and run the application.  Presto - a motion sensing game controller.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no GUI, and no customization/calibration.  Calibration can be done with your OS joystick calibration utility.  No drivers for the computer are needed.

I made this several months ago, and was procrastinating releasing it.  Darkfader <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13475&amp;start=16" target="_blank">asked for it</a>, so I quickly updated it with the new DS Motion functions, and you can download it <a class="postlink" href="http://gggddfdgju.googlepages.com/dspad-tilt.nds" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like a fun thing to have. Would be fun to try and play some N64 games by tilting.... If only someone could wright a patch for Mario64DS, ho well.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

I've got a bluetooth adapter that I use with my wiimote, and thanks to some useful programs I can play mariokart64 with it. B-)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

A steering wheel or the like gives a stream of instantaneous rotations distributed near-continuously in [-1, 1], and you have to map this into the discrete {-1, 0, 1} instantaneous rotation values that SMK, MKSC, and MKDS accept. Because you know that the rotations are going into an integrator (that is, the longer you hold left, the farther to the left your vehicle turns), you can use <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation" target="_blank">delta-sigma</a> pulse density modulation. For example, if the player is turning the wheel one-fourth to the left, press Left one out of every four frames.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Ah, good point. Is something like this possible in Nitrohax? (probably not?) It would be cool to see this work, even steering with the touch screen.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
