    <h4>#124511 - KeithE - Fri Apr 06, 2007 1:52 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am pleased to announce a new motion sensing product that I have developed with Neo Team: the MK6-Motion.
<br/>
<br/>
The MK6-Motion is a slot-1 flash cartridge with the same motion sensing capabilities as the DS Motion Card (tri-axis accelerometer + gyroscope).
<br/>
<br/>
The specifications can be found at neoflash.com.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some details:
<br/>
<br/>
Contains 16 Megabits of flash, so you can load a small homebrew game or passthrough rom onto it
<br/>
Has motion sensors just like DS Motion Card
<br/>
Has EEPROM for saving
<br/>
<br/>
It is not 100% compatible with the existing DS Motion Card functions, but I have written new functions that allow developers to make their software compatible with the DS Motion Card, the DS Motion Pak (slot-2), and the MK6 Motion.  1 set of functions, and the game is compatible with all three types of DS motion sensors.  This new function library will be released before the DS Motion Pak and MK6 Motion are available for sale.
<br/>
<br/>
Software is loaded onto the MK6 motion from a slot-2 flash cartridge using an app that will be released by Neo Team soon.
<br/>
<br/>
It works as a game cartridge with motion sensing on any DS - you don't need a flashed DS for it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure that Neo Team will release full DLDI drivers for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a topic about this product on the neoflash forums:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,4081.0.html" target="_blank">http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,4081.0.html</a>
<br/>
Unfortunately, you'll have to register for the forum if you want to read it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use it to boot a slot-2 device, you burn a passme rom to the card.  To use it as a slot-1 flash card, you burn a game rom to it.  In both cases, you burn the rom from a slot-2 cartridge using a yet to be released app.
<br/>
<br/>
The major advantage of the MK6 over the DS Motion Card is that you can use it as a passthrough (by burning the passme rom to the card), so you can run motion sensing games from slot-2 without a flashed DS or a separate passthrough card.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want, you can put your motion sensing game right on the card, so you'll have the game and motion sensor all in one card, and it will work on any DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It also has EEPROM memory for saving games states.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What's that for?  I don't know of any homebrew that makes use of EEPROM, and maybe I'm behind the times, but I dont' know of any commercial games (that will be illegally downloaded and run on this device) that will use the motion chips..
<br/>
<br/>
Soo.. what's the point?  Or is it just a part of the flash chips they use?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You mean like REIN and its progeny? Often, EEPROM is the only thing that can be accessed after the user has pak-swapped to a Game Card and back, as fatInitDefault() just fails. This makes save backup utilities harder to get working on cards such as R4. Some people have suggested copying the Game Card's EEPROM to the R4's EEPROM, rebooting, and copying the R4's EEPROM to the microSD card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lynx, I don't know of any homebrew games that use EEPROM for saving either.
<br/>
<br/>
This card makes that option available to people who want to use it - the EEPROM and the sensors share the SPI bus on the card, and there is a special command you can send to switch between the two.  The source code for doing the switch will be released by the time the device is ready for sale.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, this card WILL NOT RUN COMMERCIAL GAMES.  It only has 16 megabits of flash - just enough for a small homebrew game or passme rom.
<br/>
<br/>
One more thing - Neoflash is giving some MK6 devices away to interested developers - see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,4092.msg28249" target="_blank">http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,4092.msg28249</a>
<br/>
<br/>
One last thing - I don't see this as a replacement for the DS Motion Card.  I see it as a complimentary product - it is more expensive, but offers an advantage to people who don't feel comfortable flashing their DS.  I think expanding the number of ways for people to create and play motion sensing games is a good thing - it will result in more and better motion sensing games for all of us to enjoy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So this device would prove to be more compatible than my current setup?
<br/>
<br/>
Im currently using a flashme'd ds lite with a motion card and a GBA movie player updated with Chishms firmware update.
<br/>
<br/>
my setup seems to have problems running certain ds motion software
<br/>
can anyone reccomend anything that would increase my compatibility?
<br/>
im looking for a slot 2 device, I think the problem is with running certain
<br/>
PALIB games, 
<br/>
<br/>
Im mainly thinking for using this as my DS Motion setup but I would consider purchasing this new device for improved  compatibility, However I would still be interested in knowing what device  I could use for best homebrew support.

Thanks

I know of at least one commercial game ROM that would fit in that amount of space.  No big deal though, the card is still obviously aimed at homebrew which is nice to see from a company like NeoFlash.
<br/>
<br/>
I actually wish the flash space was a little larger.  Even just 4MB would be a lot better.  It's only a matter of time before someone releases a motion supporting game that's larger than 2MB.  I guess the onboard flash is really for a nopass ROM, but the idea of putting a game on there and having a nice professional package for your motion game is tempting.  I guess at $50 it would be too expensive to really do anything with besides showing your one copy off to people anyway, though.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if NeoFlash would be able to put out 4 or 8MB cards (without the Motion stuff) at a low enough price to make them viable for homebrewers to try to sell their games on.
