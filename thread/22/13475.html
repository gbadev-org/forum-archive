<br/>
The current version is playable with the DSMotion via an external plugin (requires wifi connection). 
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got it working - it is so much easier and more fun to play using the DS Motion Card than using the mouse.
<br/>
<br/>
Great work!
<br/>
<br/>
On my windows XP machine, the first time I tried, it couldn't connect.  When I closed Balance, there was a message from windows asking me if I wanted to allow a connection through windows firewall.  After I clicked "allow", when I started Balance again, my DS was able to connect.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, great work - I think there is a huge opportunity for PC games that interact with the DS, not just as a controller, but as an external display as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well there's your problem.  The game and .dll are for Windows.  I got it working, nice job.  Can you make it so it continues to work when I close the DS LID?  Right now it goes into sleep but the DS is more comfortable to use as a wireless motion control when the LID is closed.  Sometimes it just stops accepting input but after a small delay, I gain control again.  It gets challenging when there's multiple balls and with that small delay it's near impossible.  I had to use the mouse (not actually easier but there is no delay) to do the last two levels.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Sat Jun 23, 2007 9:26 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, that makes more sense.  Do other wi-fi homebrew programs work?  Did you copy the .dll to the balance folder on PC and enable the external control in the options?  What is the error message?  Are you sure you entered the right IP on DS?  It would be good if we could save that IP.
