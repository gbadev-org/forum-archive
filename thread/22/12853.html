    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im running the demo included in the quickstart guide
<br/>
and I was wondering should my device display 0's for a while after calibration
<br/>
on a flat surface
<br/>
because I get large numbers which constantly change
<br/>
thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The X and Y axis should be close to zero (between -100 and +100 mg).
<br/>
<br/>
The Z axis should be close to 1000 (between 900 and 1100 mg)
<br/>
<br/>
The Z rotation should be close to zero (between -50 and +50 deg/sec)
<br/>
<br/>
The values will be constantly changing for a couple reasons:
<br/>
<br/>
1) The sensors are very sensitive, and they pick up any slight vibrations in the environment - people walking, fans blowing, etc.)  Even when sitting flat on a table, they will pick up these vibrations.
<br/>
<br/>
2) The sensors do have a little bit of inherent noise, so the values will change slighly even in a perfect vibration free environment.
<br/>
<br/>
A solution to get rid of (or reduce) the amount of change is to keep a running average of outputs from the DS Motion Card over the past 5 frames or so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is what I get when its set down on a completely flat surface
<br/>
should be no interference
<br/>
X: raw 2045   miliG -4
<br/>
Y: raw 2020   miliG 7
<br/>
Z: raw 2841   miliG 996
<br/>
R: raw 1672   deg/sec 2
<br/>
<br/>
does that look right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
