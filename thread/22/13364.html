    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A very interesting fact to consider about the importance of DS Motion is thinking about how interesting it is as a development and innovation platform for things that will become pretty important pretty soon.
<br/>
I am talking about the touchscreen/accelerometer combination which has been done in very few products before (none come to my mind) but which will be in a large number of products in the near future. Which products am I talking about?
<br/>
-The legendary iPhone. If it needs one thing, it's games.
<br/>
-The open source phone Neo1973. Amazing little device, could use some FOSS as well as commercial games.
<br/>
-Probably many more future touchscreen phones and PDAs.
<br/>
<br/>
So, no matter if you are developing games in your free time or at a commercial company, it would probably be a good idea to start prototyping new ideas now rather than later using the available comfortable development platform.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree 100%.

<br/>
Actually, I made the GBAccelerometer initially so I could use the GBA for prototyping motion sensing applications on a handheld platform without having to spend a bundle for microprocessor, display, buttons, battery, etc.  Then over time I expanded to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
More and more of our consumer electronic devices will have motion sensors now that the price has come down to an acceptable level.  Programmers who have experience developing for motion sensors will certainly have an advantage over those who don't when it comes to applying for jobs in game development and otherwise.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like the PSP, the iPhone is specifically designed not to run FOSS.

Does "price" include patent royalties, especially given the business model of taking a random device or process from the prior art, adding a motion sensor, and patenting the combination?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Do you mean "closed source commercial developers", or do you mean "<span style="font-style: italic">large</span> closed source commercial developers"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I have doubts about the strength of most of those patents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
