    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a few question that I can't find on the ndsmotion site.
<br/>
<br/>
Do I need to have both the ds card and the gba card to use it?
<br/>
<br/>
How do I get the games on the ds or gba card?
<br/>
<br/>
Can I use a regular DS or do I need DS Lite (I have regular.)?
<br/>
<br/>
And do I need Passme?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to whoever answers I am starting to get into the DS homebrew scene, I got DS-X last week and I am going to save up money for this.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Combined with your DS-X, you just need the DS Motion Pak (GBA slot version).  It works on the fat and lite DS.  You can't store files on the DS Motion Card or DS Motion Pak, they have to be stored and run from another device (like DS-X, R4 etc).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
One more question, will the Motion pak fit into my Ds gba slot. It looks like its to big to fit in the slot when I look at the pictures?
<br/>
<br/>
And sorry I am asking so many questions whats up with the black and white cards? Does it come with those too?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS Motion Pak will fit in the GBA slot of the DS.  It also comes with an extra case that is sized to fit flush in the GBA slot of the DS lite.
<br/>
<br/>
There are two case colors for the DS Motion Pak - white and black.  Most of the lite cases are white, and all of the large size cases are black.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, it will only fit in the DS Lite? Nvm, it fits in the regular ds.
<br/>
<br/>
So where is a good place to buy from? <span style="font-weight: bold">[Retailer URL removed by MOD]</span> I live in america.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
