You could have an FPS where the direction pad controls foot movement and the DS itself controls head and gun movement.  That would make for  more realistic (almost virtual reality style) gaming.
<br/>
<br/>
You could have a jet game where tilting the DS controls the steering-stick.
<br/>
<br/>
You could have Super Tilt Pac-Man, a 3D Pac-Man game where Pac-man is a ball rolling around in a glass maze with ramps and holes and stuff TOTALLY CONTROLED BY MOVEMENT OF THE DS!

What about Excite Truck DS?  Turning the DS turns the truck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But wouldn't the DS with a motion sensor handle more like a SIXAXIS controller than like the remote, especially given the lack of rumble?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Sorry to be a bummer but thats not as feasible as it sounds, aiming with just tilt is really difficult, and the actual motion is definitely not sensed fine enough to do any aiming.
<br/>
<br/>
I just got a bluetooth usb adapter to use with my wii-mote, there are scripts to use tilt for moving the mouse, and feels really quite frustrating.
<br/>
<br/>
Buuut... excite truck sounds like tons of fun on DS!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

An Excite Truck clone is something I've considered, seems feasible. Or how about getting a computer with wifi and a Bluetooth adapter, and using the DS as a Wiimote? The DS talks to the PC via wifi and it relays that to the Wii via Bluetooth. Taking it even further, put a TV tuner card in there... ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's because yaw (pointing left and right) doesn't change the gravity vector, but roll does.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
