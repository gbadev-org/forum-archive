    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had an idea, but I don't think I know enough trigonometry to do it myself. Since the sensor can tell which way is down at all times, it should be possible to write a program that will tell you the angle the DS is held at. Then you could simply look along the top of the DS at a far-away object and determine your angle of observation; from there, if you know how far you are from the object horizontally, calculating its approximate height is trivial.
<br/>
<br/>
If you attached a camera, or even just stuck a laser pointer on the DS, you'd be able to pinpoint the object more accurately, but just holding it up to your face would work in a pinch. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
Can't say how useful this would be, but I can see using it show off. "Just by pointing it at that tower I can tell how tall it is. Oooooh." ;-) And it'd be a decent demo of how to use the motion sensor and do simple trig on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
