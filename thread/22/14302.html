    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It should work fine, as long as you use the DS Motion Card (slot 1).  The DS Motion Pak (slot 2) will not fit into the DS at the same time as the 3in1.

Actually, motion and rumble go very well together.  I made a simple rolling ball demo for the GBA that used the Wario Twisted rumble and the GBAccelerometer, and it had a great feel.

I was initially hoping to be able to add rumble to the DS Motion Pak, but I couldn't find a small enough, inexpensive enough vibration device.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking at the EZ Flash 3-in-1 Exp. Pack, it's got a fairly small rumble device (but it looks like it's very fragile). It packs a nice punch, too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
