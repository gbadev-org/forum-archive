    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got my DS Motion Pak from <span style="font-weight: bold">[Retailer removed by MOD]</span> (attached the Lite shell, if it matters). When I play any motion-compatible homebrew, the "center" of gravity is to the right. For example, in Whee!DS my car will steer to the right, or in Water Drop Tilt, the drops will move to the right of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a problem, and how can I fix it? If it's defective what should I do? (To be honest I'd rather not pay $35 for a new one)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It could just be calibrated differently to the particular motion device the author of the homebrew was using.  A custom X/Y offset really should be added to all motion homebrew but I'm guilty of not adding it myself.  I think all you can do is  ask the authors to add a calibration option or if you can code and they released source, add it yourself.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Mon Jan 21, 2008 3:45 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, that's sort of what I thought. It seems to be a big problem, as the Motion Pak must be a lesser device to developers. (Although I appreciate those who adapted their games to work with the Motion Pak)

Would a Motion Card work with a Slot-1 flashcard?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
They won't fit in the same slot. Would it work with some older SLOT-1 cards that combine a PassMe and an SD card slot? (I'm thinking Magic Key + flashed DS)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I meant was, could you load the homebrew, take out the Slot-1 card, and insert the Motion Card?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can do that, as long as the software waits for the user to press a button to initialize the DS Motion Card.
<br/>
<br/>
The sensors in the DS Motion Pak and the DS Motion Card both have a little bit of tolerance on their outputs.  This means that you might have to hold the DS tilted a little (up to around 10 degrees, but most are within 5 degrees) in order for it to register as flat.
<br/>
<br/>
As Sektor said, it is best if the homebrew developer put a calibration routine into their game, but some games (including mine) don't have the capability to calibrate for an imperfect sensor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, yeah, I figured you could insert the Motion Card after loading the homebrew. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
