    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a thought (didn't know if I should put it here or somewhere else), How difficult would it be to mod the motion pak to use an analog stick instead of the motion sensors? Now that Keith has AR codes working to use the motion pak in commercial games, I think using an analog stick for 3D games at least would be far better than most of the control schemes currently implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
Does this sound like something thats even remotely possible?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, it is definitely possible.
<br/>
<br/>
The motion pak actually has 2 extra analog inputs.  They are labeled AIN1 and AIN2 on the PCB, and they are meant for just this sort of thing - adding custom sensors.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to make 4 solder connections:
<br/>
VDD on PCB to VDD of joystick potentiometer
<br/>
GND on PCB to GND of joystick potentiometer
<br/>
AIN1 on PCB to X output of joystick potentiometer
<br/>
AIN2 on PCB to Y output of joystick potentiometer
<br/>
<br/>
Then the AR codes would need to be modified to turn on the extra analog channels on the ds motion pak, and read them instead of X and Y.  See the ndsmotion.h in libnds for how to do these, and you can write a homebrew program to test your hardware before implementing it in AR codes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is this something you already know how to do, or is it something I would have to figure out myself (I know aboslutly nothing about AR, never owned one, nevermind trying to figure out codes).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
Learning AR codes is not terribly difficult.  Start out by reading how the AR codes work in the forums at kodewerx.net.  You can even write a program in asm, then convert it to codes using a downloadable tool that kenobi wrote.
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to do this, I would suggest first making the hardware and writing a simple homebrew program to test your hardware.  Once you have that working, move on to writing AR/nitro hax codes to make it work with a commercial game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, too bad.  I was hoping for a tutorial from you as well since I'd like to adapt the same method to the ArkanoiDS spinner.  It'd be great in racing games (not that there's any really good ones on the DS, though).  I'll have to look into it myself, though, and maybe if I figure it out, I'll put together a little tutorial.
<br/>
<br/>
I assume this same method could be rather easily be used for remapping actions to other face buttons and/or the dpad as well, right?
