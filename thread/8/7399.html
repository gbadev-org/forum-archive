    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone could post where I could find a newer version of the Goldroad compiler. The Goldroad site isn't working for me and Im just starting to work with GBA ASM development and I have a really old version. Thanks in advance. I have an older version right now and I don't know if it's my code or the compiler thats not working. Here is my code:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
@include screen.h 
<br/>
@textarea 
<br/>
ldr r1,=REG_DISPCNT 
<br/>
ldr r2,=(BG2_ENABLE|MODE_3) 
<br/>
str r2,[r1] 
<br/>
ldr r1,=0x0FF 
<br/>
ldr r2,=vram+2410 
<br/>
str r1,[r2] 
<br/>
label1 
<br/>
B label1 
<br/>
@pool 
<br/>
@endarea
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
And I get the errors:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
ldr r2,=(BG2_ENABLE|MODE_3)
<br/>

<br/>
ldr r2,=vram+
<br/>
<br/>
assembled with 3 errors
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why don't you try "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/tools.php" target="_blank">Gba Dev. Tools Page</a>" or "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=com&amp;filename=goldroad1_7.zip" target="_blank">This link</a>" ?
<br/>
<br/>
And I think your problem isn't the compiler. I think you forgot to download the <a class="postlink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021221205744/http://snow.prohosting.com/gbaguy/screen.h" target="_blank">Screen.h file</a> (and remember to put it in the same folder of the goldroad assembler.).
<br/>
<br/>
Have that worked? helped?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should consider switching over to GCC (via <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">DevkitARM</a>) instead of Goldroad. Goldroad is abandonware as far as anyone knows, and hasn't received an update in years. Most people in the forums use GAS (GCC's assembler) instead.
<br/>
<br/>
The directives and symbols are a bit different but once you learn them you can do all of the same exercises from the Goldroad tutorial, and you'll have access to a much larger codebase and wealth of knowledge to draw upon than you would with Goldroad, as well as all of the extra features of GCC (such as access to its preprocessor).
