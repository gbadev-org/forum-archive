<br/>
<br/>
I am having a problem with a set of ARM assembler fucntions I have written. One VGBA, they have worked fine. but now that I have the MBV2 cable I have tried them on it with my C main code (in a sperate file) and the functions don't work correctly. For example, my pixel plot function will plot a pxiel anywhere on the screen in one call but when I try to use it in a loop it stop ploting a like 20 lines down the screen. Now on the VGBA this has never been a problem so I wanted to know if I have to do anything special to use my ASM functions with my main C code when working with the MVB cable. I have define the "volatile const U8 __gba_multiboot" parameter and the .mb file is only 6k and works on the VGBA as well as the .gba file. So anyone have any ideas what I am doing wrong, I complie the code as stated below where my ASM funcions are in the "mylib.s" file.

Also I download the program as follows

And yes, use VisualBoyAdvance instead.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
