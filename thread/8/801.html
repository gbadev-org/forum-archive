    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You shoud use devkitadv, as it brings Gnu ASsembler (gas), which has little difference with goldroad.
<br/>
And you will be able to easily mix C and ASM four your larger projects.

You will find all you need to get started on gbadev.org.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
