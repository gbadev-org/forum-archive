    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have translated Cearn's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/dma.htm#sec-demo" target="_blank">dma demo</a> to arm asm (for the challenge). But have hit a snag. It runs fine in No$ but on hardware there are two black stripes. I have spent alot of time going over the code but can't for the life of me figure out what is going wrong. It could be a signing problem perhaps but it is definately some issue in the code creating the window table. I'm really at a hazard to guess its to do with the inRange or clamp functions.

I would normally post code but I think it may be easier to understand with the full source. The project is available for download at the following link and should compile with the latest devkitARM.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">didn't look at the asm source, but black stripes and dma usually point to not flushing the cache before dma. as dma does not access the cache.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
