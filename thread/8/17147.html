<br/>
 I'm a good x86 and MIPS Assembly developer, but beginning with GBA Assembly development. Then I want to know what documents and books that everyone needs.

Best Regards,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just dove straight into modifying existing ARM code.  I already knew Z80 at the time.  My first ARM asm stuff was to add some features to PocketNES.  Looking at surrounding code, and occasionally looking up stuff from reference material was enough to get me to get good at ARM in three days.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe take another program written in ASM and hack around with it for a while until you understand ARM well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can download for free most of the specs from Arm itself.  If you already know mips and x86, you will have no problem with ARM/Thumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
