    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking about how great it would be to see a ASM assembler and a editor working directly on real hardware (A ROM based app). Have you guys ever seen something likr that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Of course... It would make it possible to do something useful during booring lectures at school...
<br/>
<br/>
It would also be the first useful application for my GBA keyboard :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 If you did that you would totally rock.  Post pictures and schematics up here when it's done.<br/>_________________<br/>You probably suck.  I hope you're is not a game programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've had a look at ampz's website ... this GBA keyboard jusk looks great to me ! :)
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine yourself coding stuff on your GBA while in the train, next to a very-expensive-laptop-equipped-buisnessman, writing stupid reports ...  ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
I even would be interested in helping developing a real embedded GBA development kit. 
<br/>
I guess assembler would be the easiest language to port to the gba, but languages such as a basic interpreter (chipmunk basic, maybe) would be portable too, I guess ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
