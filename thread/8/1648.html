<br/>
<br/>
Problemo 1.) Day 11., Variables. The code

<br/>
@textarea 0x3000000
<br/>
num2 @DCD 0x9
<br/>
@endarea
<br/>
<br/>
does not work as written down. It seems that the GoldRoad assembler is unable to set a value into the RAM. I had to predefine variables into the 0x08000000 cartrigde ROM space, and move them onto the RAM area. 
<br/>
<br/>
Problemo 2.) Day 2., Arm assembly. 
<br/>
<br/>
SUBS r0,r1,0x0FF  
<br/>
ldrZ r0,=0x0FFFF   
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, there is no Z conditional label in the ARM CPU, and even the GoldRoad assembler doest recognise it. 
<br/>
<br/>
That is all I can remember now.<br/>_________________<br/>.hzx</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
