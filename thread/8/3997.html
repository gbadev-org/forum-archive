    <h4>#25855 - poslundc - Sun Aug 29, 2004 8:37 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to debug a large piece of assembly code (3000 lines) that uses lots and lots of macros (using the GAS tags .macro and .endm).
<br/>
<br/>
Problem is that when GAS reports its errors, it gives me a line number with the macros expanded into the actual code, so I can't track down what line the error is occurring on.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of a way to get GAS to preprocess the code without actually attempting to assemble it, so I can find out what lines these errors are actually on? I couldn't find anything in the GAS man pages.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And before it's suggested, I can't seem to run GASP on its own from the CLI... I get an error message when I try ("./gasp undefined reference to _errors expected to be defined in /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib; Trace/BPT trap").

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I solved the problem by saving a copy of the file, then doing a global find/replace to comment out all of the .macro and .endm directives, then another find/replace to comment out all of the macro-calls (fortunately they are all prefixed with the same string).
<br/>
<br/>
Then I was able to run the assembler on my commented code, and look up the line numbers it found errors on in the real code.
<br/>
<br/>
So, problem solved!
