    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just implemented an ArcTan2 function by using an algorithm i found on an webpage. I wonder if my implementation is really faster than the bios swi call...
<br/>
<br/>
Well, how can i count the cycles of my code and how can i find out how many cycles get occupied by the bios instruction? I want to compare my code with Nintendos code :P
<br/>

For everyone who is interested, you can find the code here:

I swapped the parameters because for speed... you could also save some speed by removing the "div by 0"-check but i am not sure what the gba will do on a div by 0. (removing this check would also save the last movs operation)
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about it? Do you have any other fast math routines to share? :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A divide by zero is valid - it means your going straight horizontal/vertical depending on left/right hand system.  Just pass'em in the the SWI and let it handle it for you - or create a table lookup and go that route if you need speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
