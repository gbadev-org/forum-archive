Grab some well commented asm code for a gba demo, and study it.  The important thing to remember is that each opcode only does one thing, but it does exactly what it says, so you need to get used to looking at several opcodes for a coherent thought, so to speak.  and when writing, thinking in terms of constructs and not individual opcodes (i.e. I want a loop here, not I want a label, then some opcodes, then a conditional branch).  Dunno how to explain it, exactly.
<br/>
<br/>
How you'll learn best is really a personal matter, but no matter what, you should have those reference documents available, to look up exactly what any opcode does.
<br/>
<br/>
I think someone also made a tutorial for doing the GBA in asm, but I'm not certain.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Compile with -S and you can get the assembly GCC generates for C code. It's not always the 'best' possible, but at least you can learn the basics.  Don't forget to explicitly mention an output name, though.
<br/>
GBATek has a really concise reference guide for both instruction sets, which is great if you have to look up something fast. Also take a look at the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.arm.com/miscPDFs/8031.pdf" target="_blank">AAPCS</a>, which telly you how you're supposed to deal with function calls and their arguments.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In some ways, assembly is easier to code than a higher level function.   The ARM instruction set is especially easy to work with.  It's almost like going back to BASIC programing.  You get a set number of variables and a set number of commands.  Branching is done via "gotos" and the resulting code is fairly easy to trace with the right tools.  Of course, I've coded as much assembler as C so I may be a bit biased :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
