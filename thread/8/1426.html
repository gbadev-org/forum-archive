    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ye i was thinking of spending my summer doing sumthin other than drinking and smoking. ok the first question is can you still get the arm compiler on trial". will i have to pay some supid amount for it as well. With the arm will i have to learn anything other than c or such like it. i know of course the Dev Kit advance is meant to be good but it doesnt come with an installer so i cant install/get it to work on my pc but if there is any other good compilers someone tell me and so one ok i think i missed something so i will probaly add an edit ye wat ever</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by spankmonkey1987 on Wed Jun 11, 2003 2:49 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Huh?  Did you forget a "doesn't" somewhere?
<br/>
<br/>
And why can't you install DevKit Advance by unzipping it and running the cmd-rc?  Do you not have write permission to your entire HD, such as on a work computer?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ye i probaly did miss the word doesnt but i ediyed up when i saw that so i dont care really i am dyslexic so i trip over words occasionally. but no i am using my own pc and as far as i know i dont have a compiler as far as i know that is pre compiled anyway i followed the guide to installing devkit advance to the mark and they didnt work its probaqly just me i have trouble with shit like that anyway is there another option that is simple to install what about the gcc compiler i got told that that is good by someone they also told me that college students get free licences for the arm compiler i think that was one of the things i missed. ok still got more stuff so i will edit later</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can find DevKit in an "install version", you just run the exe and everything copy into the right place (and it works). Don't remember the links but try <a href="http://www.thepernproject.com" target="_blank">www.thepernproject.com</a>
<br/>
Otherwise pick each DevKit archive independently from sourceforge and unzip them in the order it is said on their web site (all instructions are clear and easy to follow).
<br/>
ARM provide a free version of their compiler on their site, but you must fill a big form (to proove you are a student), and by the way you can only compile ARM opcodes(not Thumb, so no interworking).
<br/>
Still, you can download HAM, the most easy to install (one exe file) and to use.
<br/>
<br/>
For ASM, use Goldroad v1.7, it's free and works fine (don't know where I read it was buggy, but I really don't agree...).
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ye ok thanks for the advice funkeejeffou but do yuo have a link apart from thepernproject.com as for some strange reason when i go on that site i click on the link for gba and it comes up with an internet explorer error/ close box saying the explorer has had an unexpected error. ye so if anyone has got or can get me the link i would appreciate it alot as i am close to the point of throwing this pc against a wall or HAM or Goldroad v1.7 a link to the sight for either of those would be nice thanks to ho ever helps anyway
<br/>
ye ok i just realised to check in the tols section of this site and is gold road any good as it is only 49kb is it very basic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Goldroad is a very nice assembler. Looks like it has been discontinued, though. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's very simple to set up (just decompress), you assemble with a single command and the output is a binary that runs on any GBA emulator. 
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like it uses its own syntax (not that different from the official ARM), but I haven't found any problems with it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I really dig it. It's perfect to get started. Goldroad and GBAguy's tutorials are the way to go!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is expected for command-line applications.

<br/>
Nowadays, it's most common to compile a command-line program as a Win32 binary. Don't run it after rebooting into MS-DOS; instead, run it from a command prompt in Windows.

You may be able to configure HAM's IDE to work with GCC built other than for GBA, such as MinGW. But if you're still learning C, I'd suggest <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html" target="_blank">Dev-C++</a>, a free IDE packaged with MinGW 3.2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
