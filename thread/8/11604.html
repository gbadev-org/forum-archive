    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not sure if anyone is interested in gba stuff since most of the focus seems to be on NDS, but I've been working on a gba rom loader for ida pro 5.0 I figured it might be of use/interest to people. Source is included. It attempts to name all the memory mapped registers so the disassembly is easier to read. Let me know what you think or if anyone has any suggestions.
