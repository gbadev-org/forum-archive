Ooo, very nice, thanks for the heads-up!  I got AMD's x64 five-volume reference set a couple of years ago; it'll be nice to have Intel's books now too.  But it's been quite a while since I replaced my Intel x86 programming books; the last one I have is for the 80486 ^_^<br/>_________________<br/>Do you suppose if I put a signature here, anyone would read it?  No?  I didn't think so either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Got my books today!  Geez, that was fast...  four business days (six real days) from when I ordered them to when they arrived.  If you're located outside the continental US, I suppose it could be slower for you; but I'm in the US, and they got here impressively fast.<br/>_________________<br/>Do you suppose if I put a signature here, anyone would read it?
