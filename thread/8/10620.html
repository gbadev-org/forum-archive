    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's the best way to create a sequence of long jump instructions in THUMB mode without destroying any registers?  The jumps are too long for the b instruction, and THUMB doesn't have ldr pc,=xxxx.
<br/>
Pretty much I want constant size for each jump, so I can later do something like:
<br/>
<br/>
function_1 = base + 0*N
<br/>
function_2 = base + 1*N
<br/>
function_3 = base + 2*N
<br/>
function_4 = base + 3*N
<br/>
function_5 = base + 4*N
<br/>
...
<br/>
In fact, I don't really care if the code that does the jumps is in thumb or not, I just want to call a jump FROM thumb, TO thumb code.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are on the arm9, there are a few options.  ldr pc, =blah, will do the thumb/arm switch for you, so you can hop over to arm mode with a bx pc placed on a 4 byte boundry.  ie.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
.align 4
<br/>
bx pc ; jumps to the ldr
<br/>
.arm
<br/>
ldr pc, =0xbadf00d
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
If you are on an arm7 things get a bit more tricky.  You could use a variant of the above and just store r0 on the stack, then bx r0.  But if you can't modify the stack or any registers, you might be in trouble :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
