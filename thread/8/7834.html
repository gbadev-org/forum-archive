    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I want to make my tile strip copying routine fast..
<br/>
<br/>
Which is my best option?:
<br/>
 - Straight C Code looping in a function
<br/>
 - Somesort of fast memory copying/ DMA
<br/>
 - ASM Code.
<br/>
<br/>
All I need to do is basically copy data from one array into another.
<br/>
<br/>
Also....this questions should probably go in another post but, Are the registers r0 to r14 used by my c code? or are they used only when coding in ASM?
<br/>

My post in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5501" target="_blank">this thread</a> lists off the various data-copying techniques in order of efficiency.
<br/>
<br/>
The general rule is don't optimize until you have to, and until you're sure everything already works. memcopy() is probably your best bet until then.

C code is converted to ASM code by your compiler, and yes, it uses the registers... the C code has to run on the same processor your ASM code does, after all.
<br/>
<br/>
You can see the intermediate assembly output generated by your compiler by passing the -S flag to it.
<br/>
<br/>
(And yes, the question really does belong in another post.)
