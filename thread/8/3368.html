    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a z80 emulator written in asm.
<br/>
I have one which works but which is in C, but it's too slow (compiled with gcc).
<br/>
<br/>
Do someone have pointers ?
<br/>
(the only emulator with source code based on z80 I found so far is foon-0.22, I'm working on it, but other links might be helpful)
<br/>
<br/>
Any help will be much appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you're just looking for a different emulator I guess. The fact that a program is written in assembler doesn't mean it runs faster. I've seen some crap assembler code during the years to which good C code would be superior...
<br/>
<br/>
But your right about gcc. It has the worst optimizing properties I've ever seen in a C compiler. But hey, it's free...!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry I can't help you with your search for another emulator though... Good luck!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When using the C code try compiling the base 256 opcodes into ARM asm and put them in to IWRAM. Run the extended codes from ROM. Speed will be okish. Out of interest, what are you trying to emulate?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll try to optimize the emulator written in C in that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The 6502 CPU core and the PPU core of nesticle are likely in 486 assembly language.

<br/>
Nessie also emulates the NES PPU much more accurately. If <a class="postlink" href="http://everything2.com/?node=Nesticle" target="_blank">four lines of 6502 code can detect a Nesticle PPU</a>, then something must be up.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
