Of course it's possible. Whether or not it's feasible depends on you.
<br/>
<br/>
Back in the day most console games were written in assembly, and IMO harder to work with assembly languages like 6502 and z80. ARM is actually pretty nice to write code in.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there are lots of GCC ARM builds/toolchains available for Linux. devkitPro comes with it for instance.
<br/>
<br/>
You say you want to do everything yourself, but you have to draw the line somewhere. Even using an assembler is something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't torture yourself needlessly.  Use devkitpro or something similiar.  Coding a game in assembler as opposed to C/C++ would be like trying to cut a board with an exacto knife as opposed to a powe saw.  The cut might look better when done - if done right, but it will sure take a lot longer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think I'll draw the line on using just an assembler. It's fun to be a minimalist! Should I only have an ordinary ARM assembler, and then I run the file I got in a GBA emulator? I think it can be more steps there between.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: But where do I find an ARM assembler for Linux? Or a C compiler? I have searched for a while now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
