    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I'm looking for a tutorial or some help on ARM assembly under linux.
<br/>
I'v tried compiling some source using devkitadv's "as" but I have no idea how to 
<br/>
compose the comand line arguments. I'd like to be able to assemble a working program
<br/>
before I really start coding.
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just call GCC on your input files. If the file's extension is .s it will run it through the assembler. If it is .S it will run it through the C/C++ pre-processor first so you can do things like C-style comments, pre-processor instructions, etc.

Personally I'd recommend the offical Arm STD for assembler programming since as (or gas) syntax is strange and was mainly intended for generated code (from C).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The best tutorial i know is:

- It supported linking

- It wasn't so damn buggy (for instance, some opcodes, like STRH rx,[rx],#c compiles incorrectly).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

These steps are no different from linking a C program, though, which is why I didn't bother with them.

I have never had any problems whatsoever with GAS syntax. People use it for assembly programming all the time.

That sounds like it would cost money. (and the trial version only lets you compile up to 4k )
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'v checked all the source code here and it looks like very few people are using gas.
<br/>
Are there some demos out there someone could point me to?

(you just know I'll find somthing the second I hit submit :D )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
