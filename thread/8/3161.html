    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Uhm, i took a look at your website and i noticed that you have a link to arm sdt 2.5, isn't that pirating? Or were the older versions of the arm compiler free?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ARM SDT 2.5 is free, but I don't see anything implying that it's distributable (i.e. you shouldn't be hosting it, only downloading it directly from ARM). The same applies to the ARM7 data sheet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">uhm, well, i was curious and checked out the download on flubbas website, it's just a evaluation version... If it's an eval version it won't be free... I already took a look at arm.com but there was no free compiler download.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SDT 2.5 is no longer being distributed by ARM. Also, hosting copies of evaluation versions is still dubious unless some terms explicitly allow this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
