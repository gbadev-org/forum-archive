    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check the ARM documentation in the docs section at the main site for info on the instruction set. I think the ARM7TDMI data sheet is what you need, it shows all the instructions in binary format. 
<br/>
Can't help you with much else, as I've never written an emulator before. It does sound fun though, good luck!<br/>_________________<br/>___________
