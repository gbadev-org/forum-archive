<br/>
i know ASM for Windows is different from ASM for GBA, so to develop for GBA what ASM mus i use?
<br/>
Why must i use assembly instead C or C++??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you don't need to use asm you can use C or C++ however I geratly advise you to chose C if you chose some of them...
<br/>
<br/>
The asm for GBA is either thumb or arm based... I prefer thumb.
<br/>
you can find rferences and spec or <a href="http://www.arm.com" target="_blank">www.arm.com</a><br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

Areta is an organization of coders codeing mostly open source project, but there is alot of sections like GBA dev, Language learning communities, RPG communities, etc...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The main reason you would use ASM is for speed-critical things like some 3d-graphics things, or software audio mixing.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hand-coded assembler is usually faster than compiled C/C++. Generally, the best approach is to write most of the code in C/C++ (there's no difference in performance between them if you're careful with C++'s extra features) and just write the performance critical code in assembler. For my current project, only ~5% of the code is in assembler, but ~95% of the CPU time is spent there.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it generally isn't worth writing something in assembler on the GBA unless you're also putting it in IWRAM, in which case you should use ARM rather than thumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
