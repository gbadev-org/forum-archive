Is it possible to acess only one byte?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Neko: I love meow-tain climbing!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can read bytes, halfwords (2 bytes), and words (4 bytes). All registers are 32-bit though, so bytes and halfwords are zero or sign extended when loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
There is one catch though, that VRAM can't do byte access. You can actually read bytes because the CPU handles fetching only 8 bits from the bus, but if you try to write a byte to VRAM it will write 2 bytes instead.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I got sent this article at work and it had me wondering:

One thing to note about ARM processors is that you can only read from an address aligned to the size you're reading. Like, halfword access must be on 2 byte boundaries. If you read from an odd address, the upper and lower bytes get swapped.
<br/>
<br/>
I have worked on a system before that ONLY had 2 byte access though. Quite fun actually, but ARM is much nicer :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________

Would that not make it a 16-bit byte for that system, since 16 bits is the smallest data size it can work with?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

It is true if he can only address 16bit aligned. But if it would be possible to read 16 bits from an only 8 bit aligned address, a byte would still be 8 bits.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
