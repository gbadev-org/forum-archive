    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm studying C/C++ to become a programmer. I want to learn some assembly to stop myself from "borrowing" classes that other people have written. (i.e. I want to personally speak to mr arm processor and tell him he better display my sprite!)  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, My question is :  Do I need to practice Hex to fully understand assembly?
<br/>

Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
