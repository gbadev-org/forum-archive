    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have some questions:
<br/>
<br/>
where is the difference between .code 16 or .code 32?
<br/>
<br/>
where is the difference between thumb and arm? I compiled an function wich is meant to be thumb code to arm code, without changing anything (expect the function propertys).
<br/>
<br/>
What is the advantage/disadvantage of thmb/arm? 
<br/>
And what does .align	1/2/4 mean?
<br/>
<br/>
perhaps you could enlighten me ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
