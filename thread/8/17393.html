<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a piece of software similar to <a class="postlink" href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" target="_blank">this 6502 project</a>, but for ARM. What I really want is a way to quickly test small snippets of code and see how the registers are affected and such, without having to worry about other hardware. I think it would be a really fun way to learn ARM assembly. Other tips on how to learn this as painlessly as possible are also very welcome.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
