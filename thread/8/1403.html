    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.  I am fairly experienced with C/C++, but I no absolutely ZERO assembly at the moment.  I have been meaning to learn ASM for quite some time, but I have just never gotten around to it, although I am taking a course in it in the fall.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I was just curious about whether some of you more experienced people thought that the GBA would be a good place to learn ASM or not?  I have become reasonably comfortable with the GBA hardware in C++, and I am interested in some optimizations using ASM.
<br/>
<br/>
If not, I can wait until after my ASM course this fall.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

but bear in mind there will be differences when you go to learn x86 assembly.<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that GBA is a good place to start because of the beaty of the RISC instruction set; as opposed to the really ugly instructionset of the pentium, for instance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
