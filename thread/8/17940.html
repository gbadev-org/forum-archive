        <h2>ASM > Use R15 as an opperand</h2>
<div id="posts">

    <h4>#177898 - Bregalad - Sun Apr 21, 2013 5:25 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried to find info on datahseets, especially on ARM's own website, but it is quite vague in all cases.
<br/>
<br/>
It's possible to use R15 as an operand from any instructions, that's a fact, but sometimes this is legal, and sometimes this is "illegal", i.e. the behaviour is undefined.
<br/>
<br/>
Apparently when this is legal the returned value is the adress of the executed instruction + 8 because of pipeline exposure.
<br/>
<br/>
However, when the instruction BL is used, and when an interruption occurs, the value stored in R14 is obviously not "PC + 8" but "PC + 4", as the LR have to point to the next instruction (and not the second next !).
<br/>
<br/>
So how comes that when PC is used as an operand of any instruction it would read "PC + 8", but when it is used for BL or interrupt, it would read "PC + 4" ? Or are the interrupt / BL instruction handled one pipeline stage before all others instructions ?
<br/>
<br/>
My other question is : When is it legal to use PC as an opperand. ARM's official docs are quite unclear about this. They say very clearly it's illegal for some cases (like mulitply instruction) but they are unclear for regular instructions.
<br/>
For example it seems crazy to use PC as a shifter like in :
<br/>
MOV R0, R1, lsl PC
<br/>
<br/>
but theoretically it's possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not asking this because of GBA development, but because I am developing an ARM CPU for my studies. I'd like to handle the instructions as "correctly" as possible.
<br/>
I don't know if any of you guys know more than I do, but if that would happen to be the case, please share ^^
<br/>
Otherwise I'll just allow reading the PC when it arrages me and return PC + 4 in all cases (since reading it like this, and relying on this behavious, is very likely to be crazy).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
PS : Apparently returning PC + 8 is important because of how branches are encoded. Something like
<br/>
B 0
<br/>
would actually skip 2 instructions, and
<br/>
B -2
<br/>
would be the instruction that jumps in place.
<br/>
<br/>
This can however be done by using PC + 4 and forcing the carry in of the ALU to '1'. This way, only PC+4 have to be used at all times.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At least from my experience writing "bASMic's" ASM portion, the PC is always +8 in the GBA's ARM7TDMI when accessed as an operand.  The ARM CPU's different modes are implemented to make it generally easy to make an operating system.  
<br/>
<br/>
A B/BL of -2 loops in place, as the "#offset" is stored with an "LSR #2".  A Branch with #-2 is actually #-8.  I've used "ADD PC, PC, R6, LSR #2" for a jump table based on R6, and always have to put one NOP after the ADD for table alignment.  (PC + 0 = two instructions skipped.)  
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Of course you can always use PC as an operand...if you don't mind undefined behavior :-).  
<br/>
The following instructions don't support PC as an argument: BX, MSR/MRS, MUL/MLA/(s/u)MLAL/(s/u)MULL, writeback or offset on LDR/STR, base register on LDM/STM, or anything on SWP.
<br/>
According to the ARM datasheet I have, PC can't be used as a shift operand, either:

I guess I'll allow using the PC all the time, because I don't see any optimisations that can be done by disalowwing the PC for i.e. MUL and the others instructions that disallow the usage of PC.
<br/>
<br/>
Making it PC + 8 instead of PC will be quite simple, however, I'll also have to handle PC+4 for BL and interruptions. A bit annoying I don't know what ARM were thinking (why did they not use PC+4 everywhere since they needed it for the BL in the first place ?), but this is the price to pay for full ARM compliance.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then, how is it supposed to behave when you push the stack pointer to the stack - in other words - if the base register is in the register list of a STM instruction ?
<br/>
<br/>
If I do it like I'm planning to implement it (and that is what will happen naturally) - what will happen will depend if writeback is enabled to the base register.
<br/>
If it's not the case, then the value of the register is perfectly defined (since it's unaffected by the instruction).
<br/>
<br/>
Else, I'd change the value of the register either at the begining or at the end of the instruction (in order to do the write opperation only once), and then either the old or new value would be used. In no case any value inbetween would be used.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be a bigger issue though when the base register is in the list of LDM.
<br/>
If writeback is disabled, then the instruction itself would affect the register during it's oppration, changing the value of the adresses for all the subsequent loads.
<br/>
<br/>
If writeback is enabled, then either the value of the register is changed before the instruction , or after it.
<br/>
If it is changed before, then the same thing happens as if writeback was disabled.
<br/>
If it is changed after, the same register would change twice, first the adress would be "mangled" by the load instruction, then, an offset (equal to 4 times the number of "1" bits in the LDM instruction) would be added to the "mangled" value.
<br/>
<br/>
Very likely not behaviour that is very "usable" for common programs.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure I've read in datasheets that the base register should not be in the register list, though (and they also said the register list should not be void), so I can stll be ARM compatible while implementing a different behaviour on those weird cases.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

@dwedit : This is insane. I mean, I would understand they'd do it on the first or last cycle, but on the second one ? Come on, what did they smoke when designing the processor ?
<br/>
<br/>
And you're telling that GCC actually relies that the register is stored at the second cycle, which in itself produces some insane logic ? OMG...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, compilance to compiled C code is completely optional for this project, just a basic working ARM (programmed in assembly, therefore I'm free to choose which instructions to implement) will do fine. My supervisor told me I don't have to implement LDM ans STM which makes me want me even more to implement them, because they're very challenging to do in N cycles. I'll see in due time - implementing MOV, ADD, BR/BL, LDM and STM are the only opcodes actually required for a fully working processor.
<br/>
(ok a fully working one can be done with less opcodes, but it gets insane from this point).

My processor will definitely allow to MUL and rotate using the PC. It will make it supperior to actual ARMs in some way... ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorta. Mind, exceptions all have their own PC offsets. For example, SWI sets LR = <span style="font-style: italic">next_pc</span>; an interrupt sets LR = <span style="font-style: italic">next_pc</span>+4. Thus, to return from an IRQ, you have to say SUBS PC, LR, #4. Notice that I said <span style="font-style: italic">next_pc</span>+4, not PC+8 - the difference arises in THUMB mode.

<br/>
The ARM7 has a classic three-stage pipeline. This means at any given time, it's doing up to three things at once:
<br/>
1) Executing the current instruction
<br/>
2) Decoding the next instruction (insn+4)
<br/>
3) Fetching the instruction after that (PC = insn+8)
<br/>
<br/>
With the exception of longer-running operations, such as B, MUL and LDR, instructions advance once stage per cycle. And by the time one gets to the execute stage, PC has already incremented twice, giving the +8 value.
<br/>
<br/>
You might be tempted to surmise, from the above, that BL reads PC near the end of the decode stage - but then again, who's to say they don't subtract 4 instead? The possibility of interrupting THUMB code all but forces newer CPUs to do a manual adjustment. So, until we get a "Visual ARM" simulation, try not to overanalyze these things, because they're just how the chip was designed. If you were dealing with MIPS, you'd see even more of these pipeline effects - look up "branch delay slots."

Well, "undefined" implies there <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> no correct way. ARM kinda handwaves around this, implying that it shouldn't grant any privileged access from user mode... regardless, keep in mind that such behavior can and does change between CPU models. If that matters, you might wish to pick one and test it yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, keep an eye out for the older reference material. Sometimes they specify behavior which became undefined later on. For example, STR PC or MOV Rd, Rn, PC, LSL Rs. I believe that both these cases will use PC+12 on an ARM7 (due to reading PC during their extra cycle), but don't quote me on that!

If memory serves, that code calls a function with the address of a variable (actually a large return value) which happens to be on top of the stack. So it's quite legitimate to use STMDB SP!, {SP}, and that instruction needs to write the old stack pointer. Note however that STMDB SP!, {r3,SP}, isn't kosher.

<br/>
Aside from the various branch instructions, PC can be used for:
<br/>
- Rd, Rn or Rm in a data-processing instruction
<br/>
- Rd or Rn in a word-sized load/store (as Rd, the value stored may vary)
<br/>
- Rd in MRC; updates flags only
<br/>
- Switching to ARM mode: BX PC
<br/>
- Returns: LDM SP!, {..,PC}
<br/>
<br/>
These uses aren't guaranteed to work (at least not the way you'd expect):
<br/>
- In special-purpose instructions: CLZ, multiplies, DSP arithmetic..
<br/>
- In a shift-by-register, even as Rd, Rn or Rm
<br/>
- In a branch to an unaligned target instruction
<br/>
- As Rd in LDRT and the like
<br/>
- As Rd in non-word load/store: STRB, LDRD..
<br/>
- As Rd in MRS, MCR, or similar
<br/>
- As Rn in LDM/STM
<br/>
- As Rn in a load/store with writeback
<br/>
- As Rm in a load/store

In fact I think it does LR = nextPC. The thing is that, when an interrupt occured, you actually WANT to execute the instruction that was going to be executed before the interrupt happened (the instruction has been "replaced" by a BL in runtime), so this is why you use SUB, #4.
<br/>
<br/>
In a software interrupt or undefined instruction you do NOT want to execute it again, else it'll lead to an infinite loop. Therefore you just use MOV to return.
<br/>

I can't comment about Thumb mode since I know almost nothing about it and my processor isn't going to support Thumb at all.

Because the ALU is already taken to calculating the destination of the branch ?

BL is insane to implement because you need PC+8 for the calculation of the next PC, and PC+4 to put into the link register.

<br/>
Right, I abbreviated too much. It should be "next instruction to be executed", not the next PC itself.

<br/>
Depends on your definition of a cycle. A memory cycle could take more than one clock to finish. This doesn't necessarily change the internal behavior.
<br/>
<br/>
For multi-cycle ops, I think ARM does their fetching in the first cycle - that way they can simultaneously do addressing for a load/store, etc. And this means you'll normally still get PC+8, whilst the pipeline stalls to wait for the LDR/MUL.

<br/>
A fair point, although that's really up to the implementation (some modern CPUs have dedicated addressing hardware, separate from the ALU(s), that's way beyond relevant to simple ARM chips though).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if you're designing a software or hardware core... I'm going to guess the latter, since a normal emulator has little to no trouble here.
<br/>

<br/>
While this is true, each CPU mode (save USR, which is just unprivileged SYS) has its own unique SP/LR registers, so you're restricted to using them in your OS kernel, if you don't want to trash user-mode state inside an exception.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't use interrupts, exceptions, or THUMB - and your OS/user environment doesn't require a valid SP - then of course you can use whatever register you want. And there's FIQ, which banks in its own r8-r12, too, so you could still use those.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pehaps, but in my implementation a multicycle is none at it's decoding stage, which will lock the fetch in some state, preventing it to increment.
<br/>
However I added latches and this supposedly fixes the problem. I now read PC and PC+4 of the instruction which is currently at the decode stage (no matter what the fetch stage is doing), which turns out it will always be PC+4 and PC+8 of the instruction which is executed. The +4 is done by reading directly the incremented value from within the fetch stage (no matter if it is actually used or not) and latching it -&gt; no extra additioner required.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see the point that using R13 allows to have different stacks for main, IRQ, FIQ, ... threads, but it can also be desirable to have a single stack for all of them isn't it ? In this case, R13 should actually not be used.
<br/>
<br/>
A funny thing would be to use R14 (LR) as a stack pointer. At every function call you would have to reserve N words, where N is the number of stack words needed.
<br/>
This has the adventage of not using any BSS RAM, at the expense of wasting program RAM, and being less secure ("stack overflows" could easily happen if one is not very careful all the time).
<br/>
<br/>
Something like this :

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
   stmia LR!, {R0-R5}  @use the "stack" where the caller did it
<br/>
   blah blah 
<br/>
   ldmdb LR, {R0-R5} @restore regs (note that this time LR is NOT written back)
<br/>
   mov PC, LR  @go after the "stack" space

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I have another small problem. I didn't find that info in the docs.
<br/>
<br/>
When you execute a conditional load/store instruction with writeback enabled, is the writeback skipped as well when the condition is false ?
<br/>
Normally it should, because the entire instruction is conditional. At least that's my understanding on the matter.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you want a conditional array load/store, but unconditional increment of the index you're forced to do both operations with 2 separate instructions.
<br/>
<br/>
Second problem :
<br/>
Apparently you can't LSR and ASR #0, the range is 1-31.
<br/>
<br/>
But if you LSR or ASR from a register which is 0x00, is there the same result ?
<br/>
If so, then it would be quite annoying to code something like :
<br/>
<br/>
var1 &gt;&gt; var2;
<br/>
<br/>
where var2 can be 0.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't see why a restriction on an immediate value would be the same as a restriction placed on a value read from a register.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Because the barrelshift "component" just see a 32 bit operand and 5-bit shift amount signals, along with several control signals.
<br/>
<br/>
The multiplexers which select between a register (5 LSBs) and a literal value before the barrelshift are "invisible" to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course if it's not like it's done I can change it, but that's the way which make the most sense on a hardware point of view.
<br/>
<br/>
The other solution would be to have a, say, 32 bit sihft amount operand (handling all the overflows/underflows correctly), and if a literal value is used instead, it is padded correctly to this 32-bit amount before being sent to the multiplexer. Having the way the value is padded should depend on the barrel-shift mode.
<br/>
You can immediately see this is going to be more complex hardware side.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT :
<br/>
Oh okay I looked at the documentation, apparently the 8 LSB from the register are used. What a headache. ARM are really crazy in their design choices.
<br/>
However this can be optimized into 6 bits by OR-ing the 3 MSBs together, since, if bit 6, 7 or 8 is set, you know an overflow is going to happen.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to think hard to get a nice and fast barrelshifter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a new question related to my project.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to tell GCC to NOT use the BX instruction ?
<br/>
I used -mcpu=ARM2, -mcpu=ARM3, in all cases it would still use BX LR to return from subroutine instead of mov r15, r14, and complain about it's own code being incorrect if I tried to assemble it.
<br/>
<br/>
I could solve this easily with a small script replacing BX by MOV PC, but I just wanted to know if this is a bug in GCC, or if it is I who am stupid, or if nobody cares anymore about older ARMS which does not support thumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
