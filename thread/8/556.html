    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the following questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1. What does "!" do? According to a ARM Quick Reference Card here it stands for Updates base register after data transfer. But what does that mean?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Why do I have to use "=" in instructions like that: LDR r1,=REG_DISPCNT? I think It has something to do with the addressing mode because according to QRC the syntax for LDR is LDR{cond} Rd, &lt;a_mode2&gt;. If I look at the addressing mode 2, there are some examples for pre/post indexing with immediate offset and so on. So I think that beacuse REG_DISPCNT is just a value and not a register (which are used in addressing mode 2) I have to use the "=" sign. But what does it exactly do? 
<br/>
<br/>
3. For what is a Soft Preload (Memory system hint) PLD &lt;a_mode2&gt; usefull?
<br/>
<br/>
4. About assembler instruction description. The registers in documents are often called Rd, Rm, Rs, Rn. Do the "d" "m" "s" and "n" have a special meaning or are they just variables for any register? I ask because the naming scheme is a bit odd.
<br/>

Thanks :)<br/>_________________<br/>To this day, many C programmers believe that "strong typing" just means pounding extra hard on the keyboard.
