<br/>
I want to display a background image with some overlayed text, (in ASM) and I don't know what to do at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I forgot. gcc -S will not work, my whole Cygwin env got screwed up somehow.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

<br/>
you could use visual ham, its a legacy windows IDE that can display text.
<br/>
or you could use tonc's tutorial on how to display text:

<br/>
this is also a good place to start alltogether if you want to learn gba.
<br/>
also the complete gba/ds reference (also includes all the arm/thumb instructions and timings): <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm</a>
<br/>
Here is what i find a good arm reference at times

First display a background image in mode 0 by cutting it up into tiles. This will involve setting up DISPCNT, BG0CNT, BG0HOFS, BG0VOFS, and the palette, loading the tile data into VRAM, and loading a map into one of the 32 map spaces (31 is probably free).
<br/>
<br/>
Then try displaying one of <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/nes/8x8s.png" target="_blank">these images</a>, and draw the tiles that correspond to "HELLO WORLD".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

How do I do any of that? I'm very newbish with ASM. Are  there any examples that you could give me? Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have done things like this in C, and simply would like to experement with ASM. If you think, for some reason, that I am unable to do it, then just don't help. 
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it may be hard, but that's my own problem, right?

So, you understand the exact steps your code needs to take (which registers to set, where to put graphics in VRAM, etc.), but just aren't familiar enough with the instruction set to do it? If that's the case, then I might suggest that your first goal be to write a very simple function that you can call from C code. Once you have that going, you can gradually do more and more complicated things, until you don't need any C at all to get graphics displaying.
<br/>
<br/>
Reading through some of the posts on this forum would be a good starting point. I've given a few examples of how to write basic functions myself, and there are plenty of other useful discussions to learn from too.

I think that was precisely Mike's point, that you're asking for help on how to do something the hard way when it wasn't clear that you could do it the easy way either.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

While you're at it, install devkitPro instead (www.devkitpro.org), devkitAdv is outdated...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
