    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently learning ARM &amp; thumb assembly. I'm starting to understand how both works but there is a little thing which is bugging me. 
<br/>
<br/>
Many example code I see in thumb have the .align 4 directive at the start of the file, but from what I understand, isn't it suppose to be .align 2 ? Is there an advantage for using .align 4 ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,
<br/>
Ben.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I remember correct ".align x" alignes the data to a (1 &lt;&lt; x) boundary. So its a no idea to have 4 instead of 2. If rember wrong though its important to have 4 to not make data misaligned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
