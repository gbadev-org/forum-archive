    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.I have received today the dscamera which cames with face training.
<br/>
I was searching info but it seems nobody has used it on a homebrew proyect.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like propouse some ideas for trying learning how it works.
<br/>
One would be tried discover how camera works on some emu,the emu would said :no camera insert,but it could be a begining for discovering what address it tried to use,Look for load/store instructions to the GBA cart space,...
<br/>
<br/>
The other options,and it is why  i post here,is make an asm code which could be executed with action replay codes.(kenobi's program)
<br/>
maybe scan the ram and save it to cart.And after post here
<br/>
<br/>
Other option i was said is Set up a protection region on the GBA cart space to cause an exception  and have the exception handler inspect the code and register values around where it was executing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
more ideas??
<br/>
<br/>
i would test all codes people write and will put the result here.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,i would add some info i found today while i was making some test.
<br/>
One is how the nds rom is structured.
<br/>
<br/>
NDS:
<br/>
<br/>
-data
<br/>
-overlay
<br/>
the common arm9 and arm7 binary.y7 and y9.bin
<br/>
<br/>
the curious is the data directory
<br/>
DATA/
<br/>
<br/>
------------scripts for any "level"/"training"??
<br/>
/common
<br/>
<br/>
/face/F0
<br/>
F1
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
/training
<br/>
<br/>
-------------
<br/>
<br/>
/Game ..&gt; here is interesting because are 4 files ,and according its same it is when camera not detected
<br/>
(CG_error.nccarc_c ; CGErrorCamera ;CGErrorDelete ; CGErrorPowerOff
<br/>
/contest
<br/>
/menu :same kind of data as game but for menus
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
/JP the voices on mp3 also
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
/useredit
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
/data/ only font.data
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
/dsface.dat it is 6,32 Mg.
<br/>
/dummy
<br/>
<br/>
/*.mp3 ,the sounds
<br/>
(the music and sound are mp3 )
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The files seems a kind of scripts where defined the patters (maybe similar to other programs as worms3d,..)
<br/>
<br/>
And dsface.dat seem also very interesting,it is too big ,maybe it is the script program.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also have some test with the game in no$gba and hasteds.( i have saved the ram when game is init and before it give error for not insert camera.
<br/>
I think it would be interesting make the same on real ds with the camera inserted and saved into the dscard.But i am not know many asm and i am unable to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
Other interesting thing would be a program for discover when "cg_ErrorCamera.nccarc_c " is showed (the msg showed when camera is unavailable)
<br/>
<br/>
Also i have the save data of my ttds,where it saved the photo and info of user.I will try search if it they are a common graphics file format on it.(maybe some info what kind of formats dscamera works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
