    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using Goldroad, but there doesn't seems to have any documentation about it around. I've alredy tried:
<br/>
<br/>
@incbin file.bin
<br/>
@includebinary file.bin
<br/>
@incbin "file.bin"
<br/>
<br/>
But none of these instructions seems to be recognized by Goldroad.
<br/>
<br/>
I know it's discontinued, but it's the easiest to use ARM7 Assembler I found. The others, altough with documentation, are much more harder to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 I use Goldroad, it can be a bit picky about syntax but it is quick and easy to use so I swear by it.
<br/>
<br/>
 @incbin file.bin
<br/>
<br/>
 The above is the correct syntax for the incbin directive. Goldroad may be having a problem assembling it because of the .bin suffix. Try changing the .bin to something else, e.g. .raw or .dat. I use .gfx for graphics, .sfx for audio etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
