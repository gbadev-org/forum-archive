    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, this is a question of curiosity more than anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly, the speed at which code execute from ROM is 3,1 correct? 3 from the start and 1 for subsequent code. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, would the 1 cycle still be applicable for a b(branch) call going to within the same file or would that already take 3 cycles? an example would be a loop like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
.L6
<br/>
add r2,r3
<br/>
mov r0,r2
<br/>
cmp r0,r1
<br/>
blt .L6
<br/>
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive me if the above code doesn't make sense, I really haven't programmed in thumb/arm assembly(The above is supposed to be a loop). Now, would the blt .L6 use 3 cycles or would it consume only 1 cycle?<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In addition to all waitstates from the memory type your code is in, it is 3 cycles for a branch which is taken, and 1 cycle for a branch which is not taken.
<br/>
<br/>
To get no additional penalty from waitstates, your code must be in IWRAM on the GBA, or in Cache or ITCM on the NDS.  Maybe 16-bit thumb code in VRAM during HBLANK or VBLANK also gives no waitstates.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
