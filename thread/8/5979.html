    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
first off, I'm very sorry to ask something that's probably been answered a million times already... I tried searching but couldn't find much useful info.
<br/>
<br/>
My problem is, I've coded a little shoot-em-up demo with goldroad for GBA (download <a class="postlink" href="http://home.tiscali.nl/~antipasta/fly6.gba" target="_blank">here</a> ), I've used VBA all along for debugging, but now somebody informed me that it does nothing when run on real hardware. I'd hate to ask other people to do my homework, so I wonder if there are specific things to look out for in this case? I don't use sound, the entry point is at 0x8000000, I copy my code to IWRAM, and I use Mode 0 with BG0 &amp; BG2 enabled. From the looks of it, the IWRAM code isn't even executed.
<br/>
If anybody wants, I can also post the source, but I dont have it here right now (using a public PC).
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Those are there errors I got from VBA's logging tool.  Check out the addresses in the disassembler and see what's wrong with the code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, thanks guys. What's the importance of using a BIOS? And does anyone know if Goldroad produces a valid header automatically?
<br/>
<br/>
And by the way, I tried using VBAs logging tool but nothing showed up in the window so I figured it was alright :O</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
