    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you clarify what you mean a bit? The GBA BIOS will start you at 0x8000000 if running from a cart, or 0x2000000 for multiboot. The first instruction in Crt0.s is a branch past the header, but then you're free to do what you want, such as branching to a specific address. I think 0x1000000 is just a mirror of the BIOS though, which is protected, so you probably don't want to be branching there.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
