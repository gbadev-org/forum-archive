    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The new DS system from what I can tell is actually the GBA with a DS module added on...or the other way around, hence the ARM7 in addition to the ARM 9. I'm working on a small project that will let wireless routers pick up DS packets by pushing them on a network stack. This can be done through the GBA module because the wireless device in the DS is also controlled by the ARM 7.
<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it, I need to write code that will detect the DMA interrupts sent to the DS wireless device, intercept the DMA and prevent the DS wireless from seeing it until I altered the packet contained in the DMA to a proper format so that it is detectable by normal wireless routers.
<br/>
<br/>
There is however a few small problems. 
<br/>
<br/>
1. The last time I did ARM programming was 2 years ago, on an ARMulator for a class, and then it was simple square root algorithms and other calculator type functions.
<br/>
<br/>
2. I have almost no clue how to get started.
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I'm looking for is anything or relevance to DMA handling, from straight up descriptions to actual code. As well as any thoughts in general about how hard this may be or if it is at all possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
