    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have had issues with Vsyncing for the past few days. The function for doing so simply consisted of waiting for the VDraw to end, and right afterwards waiting for a VBlank to finish. Now, I do have a little bug in the small program I have been coding, and I am pretty sure the bug is causes by the VSync function not working properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Without getting into too much detail, maybe someone can answer this for me. When programming in ARM, is it better to program a VSync the way I just described, or is it better to simply use an interrupt? SWI 0x05 ?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://people.umass.edu/ozahid" target="_blank">http://people.umass.edu/ozahid</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is better to use the VBlank interrupt since it does essentially the same thing, but also saves power!
