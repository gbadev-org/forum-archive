<br/>
I HAVE looked at that thread; I noticed that the "solutions" posted weren't solutions at all (at least for me).
<br/>
<br/>
If it's any help, I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium (32 Bit).  I don't know if Bimbo works on Windows 7; I have tried the compatibility thing built into Windows 7, but that didn't work.  I've been able to use Bimbo with DevKitARM together successfully on Windows 7 before, so I was surprised when I discovered that it didn't work any more for some reason.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried other bmp conversion programs, but they didn't work, either.  I suspect the current DevkitARM doesn't work correctly on Windows 7.  If someone could point me in the right direction to getting this to work, I'd be appreciative.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
