    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I was writing the first version of the manual, I needed a nice memorable 64x64 sprite that I could use to teach Nintendo DS programming with. I asked various people, many from IRC Blitzed.org #dsdev (Efnet at the time), and few personal friends to submit their creations. All creations submitted are included with the manual, including the streamlined alien spaceship.

The alien spaceship looks funny because it is the optimal shape for space travel. As time goes on, you'll see space vehicle designs become more and more similar to the alien spaceship in design. The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/ares/index.html" target="_blank">NASA Ares launch vehicles</a> are one step closer to this optimal design.

As an exercise, see if you can pilot the alien spaceship in the Orange Spaceship demo. This will involve writing a grit file to convert the alien spaceship into the sprite format the Nintendo DS needs and changing the demo source code to display the alien spaceship.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
