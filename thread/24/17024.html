If you still get this error after re-installing let us know and I'm sure someone will be able to assist you in fixing the issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You may have figured this out by now.  Or forgotten about this post.  Or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
I was having the same problem.  In my case (and i'm guessing yours as well), the problem was that I never actually put grit on my computer!
<br/>
<br/>
Thats one of the more blatant shortcomings of this tutorial - it never actually tells you that you have to obtain grit before anything will work, leaving you to assume that it is built into the makefiles or something.  The more aggravating problems are hidden in the form of obscure code typos provided on the online tutorial.  I've found the best approach is to go ahead and READ everything in the tutorial, but when it comes time to type up your code you should just copy it from the already finished code provided in the download, because that code is actually correct.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as for your problem
<br/>
<br/>
Go to this page - 
<br/>
<a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/grit/" target="_blank">http://www.coranac.com/projects/grit/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
download the latest binary - the link will say:
<br/>
grit-0.8.3.zip
<br/>
<br/>
unzip into your devkitpro directory.  
<br/>
<br/>
Grit comes with it's own FreeImage.dll file, which is part of the reason that if you tried to download FreeImage.dll on its own you still had problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am going through the manual and have come across a few problems. The first probelm is in chapter 5. After completing it, the game compiles, and viewing it in an emulator the planet doesn't show up. 
<br/>
I thought I'd just ignore it for now and moved on to chapter 6.
