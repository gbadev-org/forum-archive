    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello there!
<br/>
<br/>
I want to put multiple .nds files onto my GBA flashcart (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.dannychoo.com/blogimg/ezfa_1.jpg" target="_blank">EZF Advance</a> *hug*), and it seems that I need a multi-nds loader to this. I have searched, but I'd like to get folks' experiences of the currently available apps.
<br/>
<br/>
Darkain (I think... :/) has a Multi-NDS loader as part of his 'present day... present time!' shell. (The name of which escapes me. :( )
<br/>
And I believe I read there was one in DSorganise.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit - The DSOrganize one only seems to work if it's run from flash media with a file system. I'll give Darkain's one another shot.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It should work again if you're using flashme v5, because in this version this bug has been fixed. (or was it 6, I'm not sure ...)<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yup, that fixed my problems with Darkain's loader. Groovy!

That would be DarkStar, although you're better off hunting down the 'stand alone' version of the loader as it's more compatible.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
