<br/>
wouldnt it be so cool of we can use the passme like a gameshark device that can be connected to pc so we can do the following:
<br/>
<br/>
-dump certain areas of vram to take screen captures (0x60....)
<br/>
-dump work ram for cheat finding(do multiple dumps then compare via hex editor on the pc)
<br/>
-edit ram on the fly via pc ( for cheats created by previous)
<br/>
-debugging
<br/>
-video capture even!
<br/>
<br/>
since the passme is a programmble cpld that has proven its ability at controlling the ds i wonder if it can acess these ram areas and do these functions?
<br/>
<br/>
the pc link can be done through its serial interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea from a noob, it would be interesting if this devlops into a discussion or reality
<br/>
<br/>
I know dipstar is a good mem editor but it uses haste ds to read the ram of emulated games and sadly emulation of commercial games isnt good enough quality to do any serious hacking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
