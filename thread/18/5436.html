Anyway, I've been doing some testing of the IDEAS DS emulator, and run into a few problems.
<br/>
<br/>
1. The touchscreen doesn't work - the readme says it does work - it works with Dualis.
<br/>
<br/>
2. The readme says something about loading arm9 then arm7 then the demo, well this doesn't do anything useful, I've obviously mis-understood the instruction. Can someone explain?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lino (the author) doesn't speak very good English, so his instructions aren't the best. A few developers (including myself) are working with him to improve it, and its coming along nicely. Anyway, onto your questions..
<br/>
<br/>
1) I also have never been able to use the touchscreen. If it did work once, it doesn't any more.
<br/>
<br/>
2) I'm not sure about the instructions from the readme, but I used to load just the arm9.bin and it worked OK. Nowadays I rename my *.nds file to *.pme, and loading and running that in iDeaS seems to work well - it simulates both processes so you can develop code for the bootloader, arm7 and arm9. I've been doing large amounts of this recently, and it seems pretty solid :)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope thats helpful for you :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
