    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a header file for the arm7 that indicates support for serial communication although I haven't been able to find any additional info.  I can't figure out what this would refer to unless it's one of the buses (cards?).  Is this something left over from the gba or just derived from arm7 specs?  If anyone has anything further I would greatly appreciate it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think it means serial communication with the touchscreen controller. or maybe serial communication with the ds cart.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I got that by looking at pictures and specifications.  Perhaps I should be a little clearer as to my intent.  I'd like to develop an external uart perhaps integrated with a gba cart or something and I'm wondering if I can leverage the serial functions.  If anyone has anything beyond hypotheses, I'd be greatful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
