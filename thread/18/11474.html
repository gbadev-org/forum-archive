    <h4>#106400 - stan - Wed Oct 18, 2006 6:22 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I work in a small games company that makes DS games and we'd like to be able to run our games on the SuperCard and/or M3.
<br/>
<br/>
I have recompiled and integrated lib_gba_nds_fat; everything builds fine with the official SDK. I have prepended NDSmall.bin to the SRL, and the resulting .nds runs on the SuperCard (on a flashed DS.)
<br/>
<br/>
However, it freezes very early... Apparently during a simple variable affectation (the variable is a global "volatile u16" located in a BSS section.)
<br/>
<br/>
From what I have read in these forums, using NDSmall.bin and not using the official Nintendo filesystem *should* work for flash-based homebrew equipment, however maybe the SuperCard is different...
<br/>
<br/>
I have also tried with DSBuild.exe from devkitARM, but the result is the same as with NDSmall.bin.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone has any idea about what might be happening here, I'd be more than happy to hear that :). Maybe in private if it concerns the internals of the NitroSDK...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by stan on Thu Oct 19, 2006 1:15 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suspect it might be related to something in the NitroSDK not playing with the lib_gba_nds_fat library you're using...
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know whether you'll be able to get much help, though. I'd imagine that most people on this forum don't have access to the official SDK...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gee.. as great at it sounds that you work for a software company, the question you are asking directly involves the methods used to play illegal pirated roms as josath stated.
<br/>
<br/>
This thread should be deleted.  If nothing else, Josath, please remove your "help" to get illegal roms to work on a SuperCard.. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not all small companies can afford the official hardware SDK, so cheaper alternatives are sometimes the only option.
<br/>
<br/>
Compile for ROM, then rename the .SRL to .NDS.
<br/>
No need to use other filesystems either - the official Nitro filesystem will work just fine on the Supercard.
<br/>
<br/>
Use the Supercard Patcher to patch this NDS (I turn off all options except patch for file-access I think).
<br/>
I have sucessfully got my own SRL's working this way.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't get it to work then you can PM me by all means, and I'll walk you through it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, it's working!
<br/>
<br/>
I had tried using the SuperCard patcher, but it failed... because I hadn't renamed the file to .nds ... ***sigh***
<br/>
<br/>
All those hours wasted adapting lib fat, trying all the different loaders and patchers, and searching the web just because the SuperCard patcher doesn't even try to patch a file that doesn't end in .nds... ARGH!
<br/>
<br/>
Now we'll be able to test our builds faster (flashing a rom takes a long time), test wireless games with more DSes, game designers/testers won't need expensive hardware and complicated software to try their changes, amongst other things...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So the instructions to use SuperCard for piracy are exactly the same instructions to use SuperCard for legit NitroSDK development. But also, the instructions to use NoPass for piracy are exactly the same instructions to use NoPass for legit development.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, boo-hoo Lynx...
<br/>
<br/>
Now everyone nows how to run pirated commercial roms...
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the horror...
<br/>
<br/>
A pre-schooler could figure out how to run pirated commercial roms. I don't think Josath can be blamed for causing the armageddon or anything...
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know, it's part of the forum guidelines. As Josath said, however, stan's angle seems fairly legit. In fact, I'm not quite sure exactly why someone with an official SDK would want to learn how to run pirated roms, unless they're trying to encourage people to pirate their software. Or something...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice.. so I guess you are saying Stan has less brains than a pre-schooler? As he seemed to have a problem getting this romz to work..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My point.. Don't refer to them as backups anymore.. Call them official .SRL and your ok..
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't we put a sticky up, and from now on when people ask me how to get their illegal downloaded romz to work, I can just direct them to this thread..
<br/>
<br/>
And don't have rules if you don't want to inforce them.  I don't give a shit if you all pirate your asses of and not a single game is ever sold again.. But this site isn't the place to teach you how to do it, or hell, maybe I'm wrong and it is?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: You'll be amazed at how many (I guess pre-pre-schoolers) people have purchased these devices for pirating and posted on here or ndshb.com forums asking for help..  Why can't they make it easier, so all these "pre-schoolers" would stop bothering us.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as I can tell, it's OK to talk about the official devkit as long as you don't disclose anything in violation of applicable non-disclosure agreements.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well it is the exact same thing, isn't it? Running commercial ROMs on a backup device. The only difference is you own the copyright to the game and can change its code to work around compatibility issues.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
