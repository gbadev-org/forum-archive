    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anybody got sprite scaling working in Dualis? I think it's not in there properly yet... although I'd like to be sure it's not just my crappy code ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Got sprites scaling and rotating properly in Ideas, but running the same code in Dualis I just get a mis-shaped box with sort of a quarter of the original sprite showing...
<br/>
<br/>
Take a look...

I know it's still an early emu, so it might need a bit of fiddling. Anybody got scaling to work?
<br/>
