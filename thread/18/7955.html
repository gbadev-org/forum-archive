    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have no experience in coding for the DS, so I just wanted to ask some of the people who do have experience the following question.  Is it possible to configure the DS to be able to run computer software?  The main purpose behind this question is I wanted to know if I could ever be able to load Poker software onto the DS and play online using the Wi-fi.  Anyone have any ideas as to how to implement this idea?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The best you could probably get is either a 286 PC emulator or a Java bytecode emulator. There are already a couple topics about PC emulators on the DS (<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=6875" target="_blank">here</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7652" target="_blank">here</a>) but no projects have yet got underway.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
