    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been trying to gain read/write access to the ds eeprom via homebrew via the libnds library without any success. I've looked at the devkitpro doxygen documentation, various ds coding forums and IRC channels without much success. 
<br/>
<br/>
Revision 1.2 of card.h from the libnds was meant to fix the cardReadEeprom() function, but I haven't had any luck getting it to work on my various flashcarts or emulators.
<br/>
<br/>
For example
<br/>
<br/>
---------
<br/>
uint8 c, d;
<br/>
d = 1;
<br/>
WAIT_CR &amp;= ~ARM9_OWNS_CARD;
<br/>
<br/>
cardWriteEeprom(0, &amp;d, 1, 1);
<br/>
cardReadEeprom(0, &amp;c, 1, 1);
<br/>
printf("%d, %d", c, d);
<br/>
---------
<br/>
<br/>
will display 0, 1 when it should display 1, 1. 
<br/>
<br/>
Could anyone point me in the right direction on how to set up the DS to allow reading and writing to the EEPROM.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
