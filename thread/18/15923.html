    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since FATSORT doesn't work with FAT32 drives, you can use "FolderSort v1.1" by 'Damien Burke', but with a ton of files it can take a long time since it's actually creating/renaming files and directories...also, sometimes I've seen it take like 5 'sorts' before things were completely sorted.  No idea what causes that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just allocated a meg of RAM, stored the filenames in there, then did a merge sort.  You can sort a set of filenames without moving any strings around in memory, just use a table.
<br/>
Reading the list of filenames off the disk takes longer than the sort.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want a DS-side FATSORT, look into MCTool v0.16.  However, I do not know if it will work correctly on a FAT32 filesystem, and I've heard one case of it corrupting the card entirely, so be warned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you can put the data into a temp folder on your memory card and then put it back. In Windows, it'll be (FAT) sorted.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
