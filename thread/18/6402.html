Do we have a tile-based mode similar with the GBA on the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
If so, how many tiles can we use on a screen? how many color can we use in total on a screen?
<br/>
<br/>
I used to work on a GBA project and I would like to move it on the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your replies!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Text modes are possible.  So are rotation modes and bitmapped modes.  These are be combined into different modes, allowing you to (for example) have a text map, a rotation map, an 8-bit bitmap, and a 16-bit bitmap.  3D maps can be combined with 2D maps and objects, and all effects (blend, etc) are allowed as well, leading to some rather interresting effects (hmm... mode 7 + 3D? &gt;:-) ).
<br/>
<br/>
Pallettes can contain up to 256 colors, which may be divided into 16 16-color mini-palettes.  Extended palettes are possible, allowing for 16 256-color palettes for extended certain modes (allowing for 4096 color palettes, plus the origional 256).  I believe that extended palettes can only be used on one core (screen, in this case).  Both cores have seporate palettes.
<br/>
<br/>
Objects may use palettes of 16 and 256 colors, and might be able to support extended palettes (not sure about this).  I'm not sure, but 16-bit bitmaps may also be displayed on objects (the bitmap is written line-by-line in memory, instead of the startard tile-by-tile used in the GameBoy and GameBoy Advance).

If you need any more reference, look at mic's graphics notes or in the libnds documentation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
