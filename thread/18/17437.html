    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I was wondering if there's any way to send an exact copy of the current ROM to another DS, just like other commercial games do it. Being sent via the DS download thing, because I only have one passme. I looked into the wifi examples, but all they seem to do is get/send data from an AP. I need the host DS to <span style="font-style: italic">act</span> like an AP for a secondary one, simply put, a computer not involved once the ROM is built. If it's any requirement, I'm trying to make a sort of walkie talkie game.
<br/>
<br/>
Help a bro out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~moongies/nds_en.html" target="_blank">Eric made a Walkie Talkie app</a> that didn't require an AP but the source code is really old/hacky and will never compile with the current devkit.
<br/>
<br/>
Play with the binary (preferably in a Faraday cage since it's non standard and could mess with other wi-fi devices) but I'd advise not using the source code. Best to wait for libnds to get proper adhoc support or add it yourself.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
