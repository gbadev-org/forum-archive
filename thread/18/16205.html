<a href="http://theli.ho.ua/temp/playmidi_sf2_no$gba.rar" target="_blank">http://theli.ho.ua/temp/playmidi_sf2_no$gba.rar</a>  - for testing in no$gba (fscr image appended)

<br/>
<br/>
and it hurts (yeah, sounds i have to listen to too) my  head already sooo much....
<br/>
any help is desperately needed!
<br/>
anyone wants to work on this?
<br/>
<br/>
i want this for such projects as openttd, wolf3d, scummvm, doom and others (ports of old games which utilized midi hardware for music)
<br/>
source removed up until the new devkitARM+libnds released

ps: midi/mus parsers are not perfect for now (most midis won't play correctly) as main idea was to write a synth</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by theli on Wed Jan 14, 2009 11:51 am; edited 8 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've updated builds...  i've added simple MUS parser just to hear how doom's mus files would sound ..  though i haven't progressed on synth ( as i have a close to zero knowledge of sound/music/synth :) )
<br/>
btw, in binary builds there is a possibility to return to tune select by pressing B</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've updated binary preview builds .. i slightly reduced cpu and memory usage.. finally tested on hardware and fixed some bugs which prevented this to work on hw... 
<br/>
now it sounds better.. but still far from "good"
<br/>
also i've tested this with some bigger (4M - 10M) soundfonts .. should work (unless you press "yes" when asked if you want to preload all samples :) )
<br/>
<br/>
also, i removed sourcecode up until the new devkitARM+libnds are released
<br/>
<br/>
also, take into account that without preloading samples you'll get missing notes when playing tune for first time</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>

<br/>
so i've uploaded source back and put a link in first post...
<br/>
