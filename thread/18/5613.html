    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Forgive my ignorance on this subject, but since one can boot Mario DS from a GBA cart using FlashMe which works as long as there is a real Mario DS cart inserted as well, dosn't that proove that it's just a matter of re-mapping the memory locations to the GBA ROM? Is encryption the only thing stopping this now? Is there any progress on cracking the encryption, or is it possible that this will never be done and commercial ROMs will never be playable on GBA flash carts. Not that I'm really interested, just curious so no flames please.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
