    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having problems getting homebrew to launch other homebrew on my card... this is an R4 in an unflashed DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
DSOrganise doesn't work, even with the special-made R4 exec_stub... httpexec doesn't work... the version of Moonshell that comes with the R4 doesn't work...
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12906" target="_blank">Chishm's loader</a> just hangs, like Diddl reports in that thread... <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10390" target="_blank">Mighty Max's loader</a> doesn't even seem to use DLDI, so that's not going to work...
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I've found that works for me is DSChannels beta5b, which isn't particularly useful as I don't think the source to that has been released... I found <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=124236#124236" target="_blank">this</a> (via httpexec), but that appears to be the source to beta4, which didn't work for me. Using the exec() loader from beta4 with the exec_stub files from beta5b doesn't work... I guess something's changed in the loader in that version too.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated... either some ideas about what I'm doing wrong at my end to get these various launchers working, or a link to some code that does work, so I can put it in my own project...<br/>_________________<br/>&lt;link rel="signature" type="text/hilarious" href="/funnysig.txt" /&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
