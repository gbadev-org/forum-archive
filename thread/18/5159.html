<br/>
The green an red led turn on for a small instance when pressing power button right after charging cable was inserted.
<br/>
For this small instance, the voltages measured seem about correct.
<br/>
We should find a solution for this because it might have happened simply by shorting the power.
<br/>
I think the Mitsumi chip (3152A) is responsible for the power checks and perhaps we can override it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by darkfader on Fri Mar 11, 2005 11:14 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

If you live outside the US and need a nickel, the exchange rate is about 50 euros = 1 nickel. So, send me 50 euros, and I'll mail you one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So um... a nickel now pays for half of a European DS now? Amazing. And I have $40 in my wallet right now. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I know. It sucks for Americans who travel abroad, but it totally rules if you sell products to non-USians, as it makes exported US goods look cheaper compared to EU goods. So, buy some of our inferior American cars, you unwashed European slime!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually dude, where I live (France), they are selling Chevys that are rebranded Korean cars (I think it's Daewoo). Super Duder Cheap US Cars. Please don't look at <a href="http://www.chevrolet.fr/" target="_blank">http://www.chevrolet.fr/</a> or you'll have an heart attack seeing how they look like.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, good luck Darkfader for your DS. I'm going to get one of the blue japanese ones as soon as they hit the market (I think that's the end of april).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's what happens when you mess around with it too much. It's really only meant to play normal video games and when you start rigging up random electronic circuitry stuff to it, stuff happens.

I think hardware modding is cool but it has consequences so you have to be careful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
