    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay here it is I set up dev C++ as I found a tutorial basied on a GBA devkitpro thing, How the hell do I take my code and make it into a .nds file. And what the hell does 'make'. Why does dev-c++ create a 'makefile.win'. I need a detailed explaination as I am new to the world of compling nintendo DS code. I do java but I do it in windows, and some times in Linux(when I have lab) but I am more or less a beginner and need to know the basics!! What is a *.O file. Basicly I need to know a lot that I cant find on the interent so please dont refer me to a damned tutorial that I will get nothing out of because they are long and dont contain any of th information that I need. Unless it is about what I need in that case it is okay!!

GNU Make does <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" target="_blank">this</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
A .c (C source code) file is compiled into a .o (object code) file. A .o file contains machine code that must be "relocated" by mapping it to a specific set of physical memory addresses before it is used. Turning .o into .elf performs this relocation based on a set of machine specifications (the -specs= part), and turning .elf into .bin strips away the special headers used for relocation.
<br/>
<br/>
Before trying to compile Nintendo DS code, have you tried compiling Game Boy Advance code such as the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">GBFS demo</a>?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still have no Idea how to compile c++ code. I use makefiles supplied by thier authors and run 'make' and I get an error 
<br/>
undefined reference to 'main'
<br/>
error 1
<br/>
make: *** [build] Error 2
<br/>
This is driving me nuts!!!.
<br/>
I program in java for my CS160 class and its no where near this hard. You click run, and it saves, compiles, and runs the program. I have tried to set up Dev-c++ and when i compile it I get out a windows app. Is there somthing tha makes this how arm-elf-stupidshit.crap g++ gcc dun dun dun a little easier, I am loosing my mind try to figure out what the hell do do.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: What is a make file, is there a program that makes them can I get a tutorial, every tutorial I have read is super basic. *mockingly* Download devkitpro, setup variables, and boom it works. Bull.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by shadowghost21 on Thu Sep 28, 2006 2:57 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It was funny I was editing as you were posting it was not in reference to you, thanks for the help, like I said I am a very frustrated NDS noob programmer. And to think I am a computer technician, just got certified last week. Jesus I wish that setting up this damn this was as easy as building a computer. At least I understand programming :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay I am using the template from devkitpro more specifically the arm9 make file, and I am trying to compile and I get tons of errors. Whats going on how do I fix it do i need to put the folder any place special. I am stumped the make file code is a little weird. I am not quite sure if I have all the things I need if any in the source folder.
<br/>
Every thing I do generates errors, I copied in header files into the source directory and where the makefile is. Nothing just errors. Please I really need some help or I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight (I know that sounds stupid but if I get stuck on a problem I can go to sleep unless I solve it)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Luckly I got everything working, and have made a hello world program. I then started using patater's beginner guide, and let me tell you I have a whole new set of problems, I had to cast type somthing in one of his examples because it would not compile. It took my an hour to figure out what the hell to do, but I did learn one thing if I get an error cant conververt blah blah then try a cast. I didn't even know how to perform a cast in c++, that too was a learning experience. Moreover, all the code from that tutorial gives me nothing but headaches, none of it compiles without heay modification everything of which I dont know how to do. Looking though the code some variables aren't defined. ANYWAY are they any other tutorials that are geared toward people who dont read into (infer) the crap that patater is talking about in his tut. I did manage however to load my own  picture, and I was happy!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd hear that. Just wish the functions and calls and all that jazz had a bit more noobie documention, I'm not quite sure of the syntax of these things more over its nice to finaly find out that some things like u16* is a variable refering to a location in memory (to my understanding) or somthing like that. I though they though that in their to make it hard to understand what the hell is going on, and if they did their doing a good job. 
<br/>
<br/>
On another note is the PAlib any good for a complete beginner to start, purhaps documention (besides the blastied WIKI)
