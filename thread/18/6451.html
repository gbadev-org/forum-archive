I am trying to add somefiles that I want building to my makefile but they don't seem to be adding, can someone please explain, examples woud be a bonus, how to add another file to the makefile to be compiled.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you do not understand make files in general there are lots of tutorials on the net that explain their workings in excrutiating detail (google knows all).  
<br/>
<br/>
If you just want you code to compile I recomend grabing one of the generic makefiles from the examples and sticking this in your project.  They automaticaly compile every common file extension as long as you have them in the  correct directory (ie source code in the 'source' directory and include files in the 'include' directory).
<br/>
<br/>
Make is worth taking the time to learn but you can put it off for a bit and use the generic ones if getting demos up is your primary concern.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I understand the vast majority of the makefiles, what I don't understand is why I this one is not accepting my files, I have:

<br/>
<br/>
calculator.o: calculator.c

	arm-elf-g++ -g -Wall -O2 -mcpu=arm9tdmi -mtune=arm9tdmi -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -mthumb-interwork -I$(NDSLIBINC) -DARM9 -c calculator.c -ocalculator.o

arm9.elf: arm9_main.o calculator.o

the make command kicks out saying:
<br/>
<br/>
make: *** No rule to make target `calculator.c', needed by `calculator.o'. Stop.

What rule am I missing? Any help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree with dovoto, using one of the ds 'template' makefiles that automatically compiles all your files for you is real handy if you don't want to muck around with the makefiles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which template works with the latest version of devkitPro, I have downloaded about 3 different templates and none of them seemed to compile, any links please? A template that works with VC++ would me most useful</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
