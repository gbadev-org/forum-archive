    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to the DS homebrew scene.  I've got a few questions.  Not sure if this is the right forum or not.  For my first project, I'm going to be designing a simple fantasy card game (ala Magic).  
<br/>
<br/>
My question is this:  Whats the best way to store a database of card data? (Type, Cost, Color, etc.)  Since I'm fairly new to C++ programming, I think I'd probably do better using PA_Lib initially.  Is there some type of database format thats readable by/on the DS?  Or how would you have to store a big list of card data in a txt (or custom made) type file for example?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you haven't built the database yet, you can start by mapping it out in a spreadsheet program and exporting it as comma- or tab-separated values. Then make a parser that runs on the DS. But this won't work that well if the database is bigger than about 2 MiB (half the size of DS EWRAM).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
