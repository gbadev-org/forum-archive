    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having some trouble getting a simple dswifi-enabled console utility off the ground.  Namely, the dswifi bit.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like it to just auto-associate on startup, but in an hour+ of googling, looking at existing projects, and cutting and pasting code, I'm not really sure how to set it up properly.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure I'm missing <span style="font-style: italic">something</span>... but I don't know what.  Ideally, since I'm just starting off, a minimum "set up and associate" app template, a la the nds-examples templates would be great to have for modern dswifi.
<br/>
<br/>
Apologies if this is a FAQ... I tried to find the answer on my own, I really did. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there are some samples at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/" target="_blank">http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/</a> they are for an older version but I think that is what I initially used as a reference.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, I got the vibe those old samples were outdated and didn't work with modern dswifi in my searching.  But I will try giving them a shot.  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's a small project that uses dswifi to download new versions of itself, and the setup required to get the wifi working is made rather easy, I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
