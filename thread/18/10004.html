    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
is there a demo / tutorial / homebrew game out there that has OpenGL 3D (or even PA_3D) on one screen, and some simple text, even in console form, on the other ?
<br/>
<br/>
I want to do some 3D tests on one screen and have the other screen available to debug what's going on so I can get an OpenGL toolbox up and running.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is greatly appreciated !
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i can't help you more but say that there are 3d demos that use the second screen for console output. check out some post on dunken coders and maybe you'll find someone who's done it. talk to that person.
<br/>
<br/>
good luck!
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i hope someone on the dorum can help you more than me ;) there's been some talk about that topic, so maybe you look through the forum, too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Be it using just console-printing, or using sprites to form words. Your choice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
