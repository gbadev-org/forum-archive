    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First I must say hi, and thanks to all those who help me out here. Anyways I'm looking into developing some games for the DS, this is going to be a project for a computer tech course I am taking and I have no idea where to start. I read about all kinda of different programs and people saying there the best but I am completly lost. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have devkitpro and PAlib downloaded now but I can't find any decent tutorials, I've tried useing the PAlib wiki but it's kinda confusing I can get text on the screen but thats about it, I can use the examples for spirtes and get that working but it dosn't really tell you how to do your own. Is there any tutorials that go step by step on how to do different things like what folders to put everything like sperits and stuff in and not just say this is how you do this(like the wiki does)?
<br/>
<br/>
Also is PAlib the best thing to use for developing, I'm thinking of makeing a side scroling plateform game and maybe a fighting game.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone please point me in the right direction.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just wondering, what is wrong with PA_lib? I'm just starting developing DS stuff too, and I've been using PA_lib. Are PA_lib users limited somehow? I want to know before I get far into it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am using PA_lib, and I like it.  You can start pretty quickly using it.  The older version does produce some bloated codes, and you have less control over where and how your data are loaded in VRAM for example.  There are some issues if you switch between C and CPP.  It's also a little difficult to integrate something like wifi lib into your project since PA_Lib has its own way of doing makefile/arm7 codes (PALib folks are working on the wifilib integration now).  But since you get the source, I think it's a good place to start and learn.  When you outgrow it, you can always replace/modify it with your own code.  Mollusk is also very responsive to people's request/comments.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can vouch for that. At first, I wondered why my simplistic AXE program was so big, and then I looked at the map generated by 'nm' and found a whole bunch of stuff relating to I/O and response to uncaught exceptions. I remembered that turning off support for type reflection (RTTI) and exceptions can save a lot of space, but I didn't want to (CENSORED) around with that at the moment. So I just switched the files from the C++ language to the C99 language.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've been finding lately that optimization level -O2 is a better time-space tradeoff than -O3. My port of Toast (used in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GSM Player</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">Luminesweeper</a> for GBA) compiled with -O2 on GCC 4.x is about as fast as the same code compiled with -O3 on GCC 3.x, and -O3 on GCC 4.x makes code a lot bigger.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
