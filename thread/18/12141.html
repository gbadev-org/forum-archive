    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post for DS. I would like to port/adapt my mode 0 GBA game to DS. What major improvment does DS offers about sprites and background that would improve the quality of my game? I read that it's also limited to 128 sprites, is there at least more memory for those sprites? There is also 4 background layers, do we have possibility to have more tiles data?
<br/>
<br/>
If someone can point me to detailed info about DS video memory it would be appreciated. If it compares GBA specs with DS, it would be even better!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The first game I worked on was a port from GBA.  Going from 64k to 128k of BG VRAM, we figured that's perfect for increasing the color depth from 4 bit to 8 bit without much trouble on the art side.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that bit us is that the screen is larger, so you can see more tiles.  Since tile data was dynamically loaded, it actually required the artists to <span style="font-style: italic">decrease</span> the detail on some areas.  :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're scrolling, you'll either need to use 512-pixel-wide maps (like most Super NES games) or use a 256-pixel-wide map with a 248-pixel-wide window (like <span style="font-style: italic">Kirby Super Star</span>). Yes, addressing a 512-pixel-wide map is slightly more complicated than addressing a 256-pixel-wide map, but if you're already doing infinite scrolling, it shouldn't be too tough to adapt your code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks guys! That's what I needed to know for backgrounds. 
<br/>
<br/>
What about sprites?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have a lot of sprites on one of the screens, you can draw them as quads. You also get more flexible rotation and scaling that way.
<br/>
<br/>
DS mode also gives you sprites instead of a white screen for people who own only a SLOT-1 card, and it lets you keep more stuff in memory at once for people who own a GBA Movie Player v2 or other card with only multiboot support in GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably because the DS has two screens, each with their own independent 2D video hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe what he means by "one of the screens" because drawing a quad is referencing to the 3D capabilities of the DS, which can only be done on one screen at 60 FPS or on two screens at 30 FPS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
