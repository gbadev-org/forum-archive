Excuse my ignorance here: Will DoomDS also run Hexen and Heretic? (They were built on a modified Doom engine).
<br/>
<br/>
What happens when I have multiple Wad files? With Doom.wad and Doom2.wad on the root of my card at the same time, it seems to just load Doom.wad. Is there a way for it to give me a menu to choose between them?
<br/>
<br/>
I tried setting up a server, but DoomDS just repeated the following message forever (actually, I don't remember it precisely; something like it):</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Sending packet
<br/>
Done</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
I had server set to 192.168.1.1:5030 my router was set to forward the port being used by DoomDS to 192.168.1.100, and prboom_server was running.
<br/>
When DSDoom was doing that, the server outputted the following message:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Player status [   ]</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is on a GBAMP and Flashme 6.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Okay, saving does work after all. (Pressing Y will type numbers)
<br/>
<br/>
Cool! I turned on the map display by changing the key bindings so that the AutoMap button is Select.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

One bug so far: 
<br/>
<br/>
go into the Options menu and try to increase the sound f/x volume level - DSDoom will give the error:
<br/>
<br/>
leftvol out of bounds
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
then it will crash the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when in Network mode - if a server cannot be found then it just keeps looking for the server - will there be a way to exit from this and go back into the game (short of power cycling the DS)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My only real gripe is that you can't store it in a subfolder, or somehow specify which .wad file the program should load, so that you could run different iwads off the same SD/CF card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We used the framebuffer screen mode for DSDoom. Unfortunately, the prboom sources this was based off of do not support Heretic or Hexen. Now let me try to help everyone out here... *takes a deep breath*
<br/>
<br/>
To fix the nightmare problem, I am going to map the A button to 'y' and then 'y' to fire in Doom. So it will still fire, but it will also function as a 'y' key. Or I could try messing with the menu code. I will put this in SVN soon.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I could have a menu like in StellaDS for choosing the IWAD and possibly the PWAD to load. Keep checking SVN for updates. As for the "Sending packet Done" infinite loop, that means there is no connection between the server and the client. Check your firewall/router settings and maybe capture some packets to see what's going on.
<br/>
<br/>
I will try to have the automap and status bar on the bottom screen. I will still need to have a way to switch to "debug console mode" though (possibly if you touch a certain corner it will switch to the debug console). This will be tough. I just don't want to have to run at half framerate because of this.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason all files must be in the root directory is that we were initially using libfat. Libfat does not support directory listing. We moved to fatlib, but kept the root directory constraint. We plan to switch back to the newer libfat once it is stable and more capable than fatlib. A directory listing implementation will be necessary, though.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're hanging at "Start the music man!" or the tranmap build, that means that it's not reading the WAD file properly. The reason for that is that fatlib does not support the newer M3/DSLite devices. There's not much I can do to help without the hardware to test it with. Does other fatlib homebrew software work for you? The guru meditation error is a known issue, but you're using an experimental device (i.e. not supported by fatlib) with our software so experimental results ensue. I'm sorry if it formatted your card.
<br/>
<br/>
If net play freezes, but you can still bring up the menu, that means that you lost your connection somehow. It is correct behavior for Prboom to do this. If you can't connect to the server, you're going to have to power cycle.
<br/>
<br/>
The volume out of bounds is caused by me scaling the volume to be in the 0-127 range for DS. If you mess around with the volume in the options, it throws off the scale. It's at maximum volume right now. Use the DS hardware volume slider. I will look into constraining the volume more to prevent this error.
<br/>
<br/>
The V_DrawmemPatch: Patch error is caused by DSDoom not reading the FAT card correctly. Oddly enough, I fixed this by formatting my card as FAT instead of FAT32. jamiewa, what device are you using? M3 Mini SD? It seems like everyone on here with M3 Mini SD can't get it to work. And xlargebuddha, which M3 Perfect card type are you using? CF? SD? Mini SD?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's at maximum volume right now. Use the DS hardware volume slider. I will look into constraining the volume more to prevent this error.

<br/>
<br/>
As seems to be the case with the DS Lite, the volume from the built-in speakers seems quieter than on the DS Phat, so would it be possible, once you've fixed it in DSDoom, to allow the volume to actually be increased via this control please? It should be possible - I know that Moonshell, for example, allows volume levels to be increased via software.

Sorry, but that really isn't up to us. Once Chishm adds support to libfat, we will update our builds accordingly. We can expedite the process if we actually own said hardware device. In that case, you can feel free to discuss arrangements to send one to us.

Does this mean my brand new G6Flash Lite (that isn't even here yet) won't work with DSDoom? ;_; Or does it just mean that no one knows yet? If DSDoom won't work with the G6Flash Lite, is there any chance of it happening in the future, short of someone sending you the hardware (for instance, someone else using the source code to write a G6 compatible version)?

Doom is one of my favorite games of all time, and I pray to any listening omnipotent being that it is or will be compatible with my G6.

You can't expect every homebrew app to move their files out of the root and into a Data directory.
<br/>
It would just become more complicated, because some would and some wouldn't.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, move YOUR files out of the root.
<br/>
What I do is I organize NDS files and various other files of mine into a folder called Main on the root of my card.
<br/>
Then I just set Moonshell to start with MPCF/Main open, and it works perfectly :)
<br/>
All we need is other multiboot loaders and file browsers to have that same option and it will be better than having everything in a data folder.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <h4>#98295 - OOPMan - Mon Aug 14, 2006 2:48 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, here we go, a carefully worded problem report...
<br/>
<br/>
DS: Black UK DS Lite
<br/>
Firmware: Flashme v7
<br/>
Media Adapter: SuperCard MiniSD with 1.63b firmware
<br/>
Media: SanDisk 2gb MiniSD card formatted using FAT32
<br/>
<br/>
Problem:
<br/>
DS Doom does not function with the Ultimate Doom WAD. It hangs on the start-up screen, either when attempting to "start the music" or when attempting to load the demo. However, the game runs fine using the original Doom WAD (Other than the memory leak crashes now and then...). I will be testing the Doom2, Plutonia and TNT wads later today and will update this post with status on whether they work...
<br/>
<br/>
Update:
<br/>
<br/>
I did some extensive testing last night and have the following to conclude. All tests were performed using the above listed hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Shareware Doom WAD: Fails. EOF error when loading the WAD. Maybe DS Doom thinks it's a commercial wad?
<br/>
<br/>
Original Doom WAD: Works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimate Doom WAD: Fails. Doom hangs about 1-3 secs after hitting the title screen
<br/>
<br/>
Doom II WAD: Works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
TNT Evilution WAD: Works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
The Plutionia Experiment WAD: Works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
The WAD being used must be named DOOM.WAD. Case is not sensitive (It's running on a FAT based FS...)
<br/>
<br/>
Summary: DS Doom works fine on the SuperCard MiniSD. However, the Ultimate Doom WAD has issues. This is probably the problem everyone has been reporting with the SC: mSD. 
<br/>
<br/>
I do not think the problem has anything to do with the actual size of the WAD, as the Doom2, TNT and Plutonia WADs are all larger. However, a sneak suspicion. The shareware WAD seems to fail because DS Doom thinks it's larger than it is. Could the Ultimate Doom WAD be failing because it's about 1mb larger than the orginal Doom WAD? Could it be that, for some bizarre reason, DS Doom is not corrcetly detecting that the Ultimate Doom WAD is what it is (Even though it reports that it is running in Ultimate Doom compatibility mode...) and is thus looking for data in the wrong parts of the file? Something to look into, maybe...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, my thoughts for the next release:
<br/>
<br/>
1: Hehehe, fix the Ultimate Doom WAD issue, if possible...
<br/>
<br/>
2: I think translucency should be disable by default. It actually causes graphical artifacts (In the form of vertical black lines) fairly regularly on my system. Also, the game seems to run a bit better with it disabled :-)
<br/>
<br/>
3: I think a proper thumb/stylus control scheme would be nice. Playing with the D-Pad puts Ultraviolence out of reach :-(
<br/>
<br/>
4: See if you can bump the sound channels up to 16. At the moment I often get missed sounds due to the low channel count...
<br/>
<br/>
5: Automap and HUD on the lower screen would be a great space saver :-)

Also, some further thoughts on DS Doom.
<br/>
<br/>
Some optimisations need to be done. I've noticed slowdowns in two particular cases.
<br/>
<br/>
1: Textures with transparencies. You know, grilles and the like. A quick pan-and-scan reveals that the game slows down a lot rendering these.
<br/>
<br/>
2: Wide open areas. Looking through a door into a wide open area also gave a performance hit, although not as much as the grille textures...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

What you're seeing is overdraw. Overdraw reduces fill rate. The <span style="font-style: italic">Doom</span> engine has zero overdraw with no transparent textures, but it has to do a back-to-front pass if walls have transparent textures.
<br/>

Additionally, I'm quite certain that at some point a source port implemented client/server deathmatch, allowing joining after the server started.

Tepples, I still think the slowdown is not cool. I have distinct memories of Doom running perfectly on a 486 DX/33 back in the day.

Technically a DS is beefier than a 486 DX/33, even without the 3d unit coming into play.

Oh, for sure, the DS's HW obviously can't handle Wolf 3D. All those mountains of huge textures. Hell, Metroid Prime: Hunters is all a trick , just a really clever rolling demo. That's right. All of it. Including the textures.

Your forgetting a few things here, the main point being that a software renderer is not subjected to video hardware limitations.
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter if video cards didn't have lots of vram back then, all they needed to provide was a 320x200x8 framebuffer.
<br/>
Wolf3d would load graphics from a swap file and write it to the framebuffer, to add hardware 2D acceleration would be quite complicated and I'd be better off re-writing the entire engine.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wolf3D style ray casting is the special case of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_rendering" target="_blank">portal rendering</a>, with sectors that form a regular square grid.
<br/>
<br/>
Wolf3D uses depth-first casting, where each ray is stepped into one region at a time until it hits something, and then the "something" is drawn to the screen. The alternative used by later portal engines is breadth-first casting, in which all rays are extended by some amount at the same time. They may be extended by one row or one column. Rays that hit something opaque are terminated. The key optimization that this enables is that of run-length processing, where rays that are not terminated at a given depth are grouped into extents with a left and right bound. Then if one ray of an extent hits a wall, the polygon can be drawn at once, and the rays that the wall intersects can be removed from the extent.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I've found something pretty interesting...

Firstly, I think either DS Organize's renaming or DS Doom itself managed to truncate my Doom2.wad by about 3mb, which is why it no longer works. I'm still not sure which application caused this...

However, considering I've renamed the other WADs using DS Organize with no problems, I think it may be that DS Doom is to blame...

It seems all but the latest versions of DSOrganize don't actually rename files, but create a copy of the file with the new name, then delete the old one.  So if you didn't have enough space free on your media for the copy of the WAD file, it may have truncated it.
<br/>
<br/>
Just tried out DSDoom last night on my flashed DSLite with an SCLite card.
<br/>
<br/>
I used ratx's altered version that runs from /doom/ directory and patched it with the Moonshell patcher and it works great.  I have yet to run into any crashes, lock-ups or any other major failures.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a lot of the other suggestions for future improvements, I think a touch-screen keyboard would alleviate a lot of the minor control issues related to having a limited set of buttons to map to various keys.  It should probably be toggleable off and on so as not to affect performance when not in use.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't know how much of a pain it would be to include this, but it would certainly make it a lot easier to:
<br/>
<br/>
-Enter cheat codes.
<br/>
-Type in names for save files.
<br/>
-toggle between regular and double-barrel shotgun
<br/>
-toggle automap
<br/>
-look up/down/center (at least until a touchscreen freelook feature is implemented)
<br/>
-Answer Y/N prompts
<br/>
-Anything else that I forgot that can't be done easily with the current control scheme<br/>_________________<br/>-=The Jesster: Gatchaba Goose=-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The WAD files need to be placed in the root folder. The WAD you use has to be named DOOM.WAD.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, my root contains...
<br/>
<br/>
DOOM.D1
<br/>
DOOM.D2
<br/>
DOOM.PLT
<br/>
DOOM.TNT
<br/>
DOOM.TUD &lt;- My faulty Ultimate Doom WAD
<br/>
<br/>
When I want to play I use the latest version of DS Organize and rename one of the DOOM. files to DOOM.WAD
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the SD corruption issues. Hehehe, well, all I can say is that I never actually save my game of Doom :-) I'll wait until things are stable, thanks :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Look, I'm sorry about this, but Wintermute and I did this in our spare time for no reparations whatsoever. It's beta software, and you know from other DS homebrew software that the FAT lib is not stable for writing to SD cards. People who bricked their DSes with FlashMe understood the risk involved. This is the same deal.
<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing I can do about this, and if you would have read the whole topic, you would have known in advance that it can erase cards if you're using an unsupported device. The dangers of using an unsupported device are addressed in multiple places.
<br/>
<br/>
I get emails from people with M3 SDs or G6s almost every day that say they can't use DS Doom, but if one would take the time to read things on the website, the FAQ, the forums, and the Read Me in advance, my inbox would be empty.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, this is completely free software, and a lot of people here appreciate that. If you're going to gripe about it, then simply don't use it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
