    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, does anyone have a *.nds version of the TI calculator?
<br/>
<br/>
seems like the ds.gba wont work on a G6 3gen cart.
<br/>
I renamed it to .nds but nothing.
<br/>
It crashes where it says "booting calc. please wait"
<br/>
<br/>
Any help I totally appreciate :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Removing the header wont work (or I was doing it wrong), and the tool only builds a .ds.gba.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
