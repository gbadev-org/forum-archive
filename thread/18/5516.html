    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm under the impression (having tried a "pressure" demo on my DS w/ PassMe) that the pressure aspect doesn't work worth crap, that's just my opinion.  With the stylus, the pressure remained pretty much constant.  With my finger, it said high pressure when I barely touched, and low pressure when I pushed hard.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I will also admit that the demo could have just been poorly written.  Or that I am a retarded monkey on acid, and I think I'm people.

<br/>
In other words, don't get your hopes up <span style="font-weight: bold">too</span> high for writing an awesome demo featuring pressure sensing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In practice, the pressure sensing is useful mostly for determining when you have a solid fix on the position of the touch. This is necessary because the lightest of touches will provide very noisy position data.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is not pressure...it is area of contact...no matter how HARD you press you will get the same reading.  It only varies with area touched.  If you have a very soft stylus I suppose you could corelate area to pressure in some manner.

As for reading the touch pad in general it can only be done via the arm7 whcih the wike ( <a href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds" target="_blank">www.bottledlight.com/ds</a> ) explains or you can let the default arm7 bin in ndslib do it for you and just read the raw x and y value from the IPC struct.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know it's area based, and it you think about it (in the case of using your finger), it DOES matter how hard you press.  The harder you press, the more of your finger will make contact and press on the screen.  This, however, is just a technicality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
not completely true... its a combination of both pressure AND area.  if you check the raw values, if you press lightly, the numbers are different then pressing harder, which is differnt from using your fingers, which is different from using 2 touch points at once.  there is all sorts of stuff that seem to effect the two Z values.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-
