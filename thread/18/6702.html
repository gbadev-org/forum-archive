Have you tried Josath's PME2NDS?  That might make a vaild file for you...only way to know is to try it and see if it loads properly.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like this might work.  Have never tried it myself, but sounds like it's worth a try.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I doubt this will work. It looks like an old binary without an appended loader.
<br/>
It might be possible to do with some disassembling and hex editing. Of course, this will only work if it runs entirely from memory and if checksum isn't verified on the whole binary.
<br/>
<br/>
You should rather ask loopy to generate a nds file...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am interested in an .nds version of noflashme.ds.gba as well, but for a much more paranoid reason.  I'm worried that Nintendo will ban a DS with hacked firmware on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  I also only have the GBAMP to run DS homebrew, so I could flash my DS, but I couldn't go back without an .nds version.  I PM'd loopy (he goes by olimar on this board, right?) a long time ago, but never got a response.  I would try again, but I don't want to bug the man.  He does so much for the homebrew community, I'd hate to badger the guy with requests.  Anyway, I was hoping this thread would catch his attention.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I appreciate the NDS version as well, in the out and out chance I need to reflash my NDS back to the original firmware again. :)  A bit quicker since I don't have to reflash my flash cart to do it, and more convenient at that.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
