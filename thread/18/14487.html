    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently built a computer for a friend of mine; they asked me to install the software for DS programming for them onto the computer.  The computer is running: Windows 2000 SP4
<br/>
<br/>
Installation went fine, but when I went compile a test it gave me this error:
<br/>
<br/>
C:\devkitPro\examples\nds\Graphics\2D\hello_world&gt;make
<br/>
linking hello_world.elf
<br/>
c:/devkitpro/devkitarm/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-eabi/4.1.2/../../../../arm-eabi/lib/th
<br/>
umb/ds_arm9_crt0.o: In function `CIDLoop':
<br/>
ds_arm9_crt0.s:(.init+0x2ac): undefined reference to `initSystem'
<br/>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
<br/>
make[1]: *** [/c/devkitPro/examples/nds/Graphics/2D/hello_world/hello_world.elf]
<br/>
 Error 1
<br/>
make: *** [build] Error 2
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I've successfully installed devkitARM on Vista, and 2000 previously and never encountered this problem. (For vista I had to add a couple environment variables, but that's beside the point)
<br/>
<br/>
If it makes a difference, I tried compiling a GBA rom from the examples/gba folder, and that worked fine
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone, have any idea why devkitARM isn't running on the computer I built?  The only other additional software I have installed on the computer so far is: Photoshop 7, Firefox 2, Opera 9.24, and Trillian
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time,
