    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo is gearing up for it's online DS gaming network which will allow matchmaking (MarioKartDS NOT Metroid Hunters) and interaction (Animal Crossing DS). I would just like to know what developers think about it's impact on the homebrew community. Will it be hacked like Tim Schuerewegen's WifiMe? Rumor has it Nintendo will provide a USB adapter to make home computers a hub for the DS wireless play. Will there be firmware updates(Sony - PSP)? Or will there be some kind of banning system for flashed DS firmware(M$ and XBOX LIVE)? Or will Nintendo take no action at all to ruin the homebrew communties digital recreation center. Thoughts anybody?<br/>_________________<br/>Bill

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Considering you need to physically bridge that jump in order to flash the firmware (ala FlashMe) I don't think they can lock us out with a software game. Whether or not they decide (and I don't know if it's technically possible) to inspect the bootROM and restrict playing a particular game based on its changes (much like the later generation PS1/PS2 games with anti-modchip code) remains to be seen.<br/>_________________<br/>-Unrequited</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it has always been a possibility that flashing the firmware will screw you out of playing something that checks for it one day.
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, the following points show you why this isn't important:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>You can revert your firmware to the original.
<br/>
</li><li>The DS is cheap so you could get another one.
<br/>
</li><li>They may only check what address the game is running from to stop piracy, hence it doesn't affect actual coders.
<br/>
</li><li>Nintendo and the other DS development companies probably will not bother to worry about it anyway, seeing as (the way I understand it) the firmware modifications do not allow piracy or cheating in any profound way (compared to say, a NeoFlash and a GameShark).

<br/>
It may be possible for nintendo to release a new firmware(probably using wifi to send it to the DS) without requiring the user to short the SL pad connections, since that pad protects the failsafe recovery code. I'm not sure about my info though, I just read it somewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The failsafe recovery code is an element of flashme, not the native firmware, as I understand it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Assuming this adapter will be using standard Windows ICS (and whatever it is called in Mac OS), then yes, it could be used with dial-up.
<br/>
<br/>
But Nintendo would probably end up packaging it with their own software to make it easier to setup and use for the average person, so they may block anything below a certain kbps through that software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
