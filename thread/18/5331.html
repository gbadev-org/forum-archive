    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a few people still working on DS wireless.
<br/>
<br/>
However, we have reason to believe that the transferred multiboot image contains a (possibly RSA encrypted) signature to make sure the image was not tamperred with.
<br/>
<br/>
This means that you cannot send a homebrew DS executable without the proper signature, which is bad.
<br/>
<br/>
We have extracted a possible signature from the Mario DS image, and are not really sure if it really is the signature.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, in order to aid our research, we need a few people that are able to make a packet capture dump of the multiboot process from games other than Mario DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Such games are Mr. Driller, Ridge Racer, and maybe some others.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have 2 DS'es, and a wireless PC card that can make packet captures, please let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've uploaded some more captures.

Also, for the curious, while I haven't made any more progress than other people wrt wireless I would be curious if there are any other Mac OS X users that also have an Intersil Prism2 USB wireless adaptor.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. downloaded files are not gzipped although the extension is .cap.gz
<br/>
2. the two large beacon captures do not contain any game info beacons
<br/>
3. there is a considerable amount of packet loss</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like your browser un-gzipped them for you. I just verified, they are in fact gzipped. My guess is you are using IE and you just clicked on the files instead of right clicking and choosing "Save link as".

Hrm, I'll look at them again, those two games don't support multiboot and I haven't looked at them.

Can you point to a specific place? I only see packet loss at the start of the captures which would make sense until I turn off channel hopping. I don't know which channel the DS will use in advance so I have to have some way to find it. I haven't double checked them all but in the SMB64 - a-b.cap file if you check the sequence numbers from the host DS from when the client first connected, the capture doesn't skip a packet for at least the next few hundred packets.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I live in a college town, there are 5 wlans detectable from within my house. Unfortunately I'm not going to be able eliminate any interference they may cause, unless I drive out of town into the woods somewhere where there won't be anything else using the 2.4Ghz spectrum. Regardless, the DS will have to function with the same interference that my sniffer gets.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know which captures have so much packet loss they are unusable and I'll check it out and/or recreate it when I get a chance. Until then, you get what you pay for.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
