What are your criteria for something being labeled a virus? The lines between malware, virus, worms, and trojans these days seems quite blurry. Either way, if dm's site is trying to install stuff on your pc, sounds like he didn't really clean everything off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">he even says on his main page that its been hacked. malware!=virus 
<br/>
<br/>
Malware is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system without the owner's informed consent.
<br/>
<br/>
A computer virus is a computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without permission or knowledge of the user.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#156129 - HyperHacker - Wed May 07, 2008 2:03 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the technical terms are:
<br/>
Malware: Does undesired but not destructive actions (slow down the system, abuse your Internet connection, etc).
<br/>
Virus: Breaks things.
<br/>
Worm: Spreads from one infected machine to another.
<br/>
Trojan: Malware/virus/worm disguised as a legit program.
<br/>
Spyware: Legit program, but sends personal information to someone.
<br/>
Adware: Legit, but has ads (sometimes even popping up when it's not running).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course the lines are quite blurry - most worms and a lot of adware is also malware, trojans are often viruses, etc. Few people actually know/care about the specifics. I mostly just call it all viruses or malware. I don't care precisely what it intends to do to my machine, all that matters is it's something I don't want. :P The only real important distinction is between malware and bugs, as a buggy program may do seemingly malicious things by accident.

I deleted all files in the root and the entire DSOrganize folder on my microSD card when I've gone back and forth between the two versions.

Perhaps trying a freshly formatted and configured card will affect a change.

<br/>
You might also have created a hybrid of 3.2's nds file and 3.1129 config files that allowed it to work.
