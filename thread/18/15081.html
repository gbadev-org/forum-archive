    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, there's two main ways to use wifi AFAIK.
<br/>
<br/>
First there's dswifi, which is easily gotten with the dkPro updater. With this one you connect to an access point, either to other hosts online or to another DS on the same AP. Both TCP and UDP are supported.
<br/>
<br/>
To use this, there is a little setup involved (explained in dswifi7.h/dswifi9.h). You'll need to have ARM9 and ARM7 code--and some method of cooperation--to get it going on both sides. Then you just need to be comfortable with Berkley-style sockets. Eg., send(), recv(), select() calls. If that's not familiar, and you do PC dev, it might be easier to look for socket tutorials, and learn on the PC first; dswifi is very similar to basic sockets on Linux or Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
Then there's <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14198&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=liblobby&amp;start=285" target="_blank">liblobby</a>, which I know next to nothing about. It looks to be aimed at local "ad hoc" networking... that is, DS-to-DS, without an AP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
