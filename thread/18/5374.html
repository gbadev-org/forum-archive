The top screen is sprites, the bottom screen is 3D. I'll believe it can do 3D on both screens when I see it on my DS OR if someone creates a demo and videos their devDS. Remember, there ARE two dedicated 2D vector engines, one for each screen. For most 3d-ish purposes, these will do nicely.
<br/>
<br/>
Those "3D on two screens" in Mario have been discussed here and are generally thought to be 3D looking sprites (as in Donkey Kong on the SNES) since you only see them from a specific angle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

there's a couple of pieces of evidence:

1: the shadow of the tree doesn't seem to be as long as it should be suggesting a slope and the shadow appears two have had some transformations applied that suggest a 3D engine

I'd say that the top screen in that shot is 3D just because the bottom one is 2D. :) While there may be a dual 3D mode, I would imagine that you couldn't make a playable game with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a minigame I'm looking at right now which involves Mario jumping on shyguys. This is obvious 3D on both screens. It's very aparant that mario and the shyguys are polygonal models and not sprites, as they suffer from 3D rendering artifacts (aliasing, jittery animation, low vector precision) and feature a low polycount and an extravagant amount of animation 'frames'.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the trampoline minigame, it's also very noticeable that the trampolines are 3D.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except some of the minigames really -do- have actual 3d transformations being applied, namely 'Bounce and Pounce', 'Bounce and Trounce', 'Trampoline time' and 'Trampoline Terror'.
<br/>
<br/>
Each of these games has entirely too many viewing angles for the characters that move between the top and bottom screens for it to be pre-rendered. In particular, things like the positioning of the visor on Mario's cap occludes different portions of the 'm' logo and his face as he gets higher/lower on the screen. The shyguys show clear differences in appearance depending on their horizontal position on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, pre-rendering all those angles would have taken up way too much space, and likely wouldn't have fit within the available ram.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I guess I was looking at a cached copy or something, didn't see the followups made with similar points. :p But I'm not referring to artifacts, but instead the viewing angles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS has a mechanism for rendering 3D to both screens by means of capturing the framebuffer to memory were it is used as a direct color bitmap on the sub display, swapping LCDs (effectivly freezing the 3D output on the sub display)  then rendering a new image to the other LCD.  This effectivly cuts render frame rate in half.  There is also a bit of memory transfering required which further slows things down (although it should be possible to maintain 30fps on both screens).  
<br/>
<br/>
This is secondhand information, but from a trusted source.  The mechanizm for this I do not know but I believe there are specific registers for capturing display output and transfering it to main memory.

Is the question here if the DS can display 3D on both screens? The answer is yes. This means displaying on both screens, one at a time; and on both screens at the same time.

Actually, that would be the WORST example in that, since there's no shading, the same thing could be done with the VERY capable 2D vector units. People with connections have already answered the technical question of "is it possible," so I'm satisfied with that.
<br/>
<br/>
I just wonder what the real limitations are. If there's a huge hit to gameplay to display more than a few tiny characters (and those alternating between screens) then that would explain why there's a good chance that you'd never see, say, a 3D rendered race on one screen and a 3D rendered top view of the race on the other.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Appearance? It is 3D on both screens. You can see the pixelation of the pac man in the bottom screen and as well as the angular outter shell of pacman in first screen. The top screen is obcviously 3D. I don't care what programmers are doing to get 3D on both screens, but more and more games are revealed on DS, more we are seeing 3D on both screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd argue that dual 3D hasn't been done because they haven't figured out how to do it in such a way that it doesn't seriously subtract from gameplay. :) For example, having the lower screen in MarioDS showing your position in 3D would have been great, but it would probably kill the upper screen framerate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
An official developer told me to say you guys are giving him a seriously good laugh. The DS is more than capable of rendering 3D on both LCD's. The 3D GPU is not locked to either display but can render to only one LCD in a given VSync. There is a very simple and well documented method for rendering to one LCD followed by rendering to the second LCD the next frame.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not black magic, voodoo, or work of deranged DS coders gone loose. It's just the way things are done. So discussion over this, companies using software rendering to get 3D on both screens, or that it's just not possible to do 3D on both is completely incorrect and pointless.

Correct. I'm under the impression that involves sampling the pixel output of the 3D core and storing it in a frame buffer for the other screen to use. But then you lose 96 KB of texture VRAM to the frame buffer and have to divide the rest of texture VRAM between the two screens.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Ever play Mario Vs. Donkey Kong?

Come one man, that'd be like building an electromagnetic pulserifle to shoot at tin cans. They'd just do the entire minigame 2D if 3D wasn't possible on both screens, instead of writing a software renderer (while having all this cool 3D hardware stupidly locked-out) or pre-rendering crappy low-poly models with horrible aliasing and vertex rounding errors, then matching it exactly to the 3D model's position and animation when it enters the second screen.
<br/>
<br/>
If this whole myth about the DS not being able to render 3D on both screens at the same time had never being conceived (prolly by sony fanboys) people would just have looked at the 4 fully 3D minigames in MarioDS and known without a doubt the DS was doing 3D on both screens.
<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the minigames in question again right now, and they're obviously 3D to me. I would bet my entire belongings (a rubber band and half a pack of cigarets) that the following items in MarioDS are fully 3D using both screens:
<br/>
<br/>
Intro Screen:
<br/>
- The dancing star. At one point, there are two stars, and they grow to a huge size (and gain detail btw) and fall from the top screen onto Yoshi's head. The stars even have nice specular lighting if you look closely.
<br/>
<br/>
First FlyGuy MiniGame:
<br/>
-The 3 ShyGuys are 3D
<br/>
- Mario is 3D
<br/>
<br/>
First Trampoline MiniGame:
<br/>
- The trampolines are 3D
<br/>
- Mario is 3D
<br/>
<br/>
Second FlyGuy MiniGame:
<br/>
- All shyguys are 3D (very obviously as they even rotate and are nicely vertex lit)
<br/>
- Mario is 3D
<br/>
<br/>
Second Trampoline Game:
<br/>
- All rainbow rings are 3D
<br/>
- Mario is 3D
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Al this disregarding the plain fact that it would be very *weird* if the DS didn't allow for 3D on both screens at the same time. I'd even go as far as saying that there aren't even two seperate framebuffers internally.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It only has 1 Arm 7 though. And if the Arm 9 was capable of running GBA code then I don't think the Arm 7 would even be in there.

BTW, so far the 2d done on the 2nd screen in 3d DS games doesn't seem to match what the GBA was capable of.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Correct. I'm under the impression that involves sampling the pixel output of the 3D core and storing it in a frame buffer for the other screen to use.

For the same reason that wireless communication isn't fully supported in ndslib: it involves features of the hardware that aren't cracked yet. Specifically, sampling the 3D core's output into a frame buffer probably involves DMA from a hardware register whose address we don't know. We'll have to wait until a commercial game that uses 3D on both screens is dumped and traced.

I assume that by "touch screen" you mean "sub-screen", given that the Nintendo DS's power management circuitry can send the main- and sub-screen video outputs to either physical screen. Anyway, a frame buffer of some sort has been available on the 2D screen since the original Game Boy. Cases in point: Qix and Game Boy Camera.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Mipmapping can be implemented per-poly in software, simply by switching textures. It'd expect it would have a noticable performance hit compared to a raw display list, but it's easy enough to do
<br/>
<br/>
Unless they've ported their software renderer to the DS.... a really good software renderer might come fairly close to the performance of the DS 3D hardware, and could be more flexible?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyways, as tepples said... 3d is possible on 2 screens.  Just need a scanline tall buffer (DMA'd).
<br/>
<br/>
If you use 2 screens, your total texture size is 256kb, you can divide that up as you will between the two screens (or even share textures).  The rest (bank C+D) will be used as a sub screen buffer (I believe in mode 5 with bitmaps).
<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing that both the top and bottom pacman (above) share the same texture.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://ethos.oddigytitanium.com" target="_blank">Ethos' Homepage (Demos/NDS 3D Tutorial)</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah! I hadn't put together what has been said about texture limitations in relation to the Pac 'n Roll game, but if texture memory becomes limited, it would make sense.

Also, note that 3D on 2 screens does not have to be approx 30/30fps.
<br/>
<br/>
But theoretically can be any combination adding up to 60fps.
<br/>
<br/>
So you can run a top screen at 50fps, and a slow update 3d status screen at 10fps :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://ethos.oddigytitanium.com" target="_blank">Ethos' Homepage (Demos/NDS 3D Tutorial)</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Incorrect, 24fps is the minimum framerate needed for the human eye to perceive something as in motion, rather than a sequence of still images. For long range shots (say, an approaching army in a distant value) or fast motion, it's actually a bit low. In addition, any fps above 24fps essentially acts as a form of temporal anti-aliasing, making the motion appear smoother, similar to how taking more pixel samples with normal anti-aliasing makes each individual image 'smoother'.
<br/>
Play a game at 30fps sometime and then play it at 60fps, the difference should be fairly apparent, and the higher framerate one is less likely to cause motion sickness in people because the motion is smoother. People who have trouble playing 3d games often have that trouble because of the jerky motion, I know quite a few people who would get sick to their stomach playing the original goldeneye but can play modern games just fine. This is also why 60fps is generally considered almost a requirement for first person shooters, the fast motion needs more 'samples' in order to appear smooth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
TV use 50Hz (PAL) or 60Hz (NTSC) interlaced that means 25 or 30FPS.

<br/>
So I would say 30FPS is a smooth motion, but of cause you can see the difference between 30 and 60FPS. Even with fast motions, because there is no blending between the frames.

When you use motionblur or something, 30FPS looks very smooth, but also blurry ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
