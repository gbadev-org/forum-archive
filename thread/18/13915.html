    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need to be able to create independent memory pools to keep specific kinds of data grouped together for easy unloading/reloading without risking memory fragmentation. Like pools for character models, level geometry, sounds, etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking of using the <a class="postlink" href="http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html" target="_blank">Lea Allocator</a> on my project. I've read good things about it, but I'm not sure if it'd be suitable for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also found this example of a block-based allocator intendend for the GBA:

Can someone make a recommendation? Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For fixed-size blocks, it's hard to beat a pool with a free-element bitmap. How many of each type do you plan to allocate, and how big is each object? And are you using C or C++?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using C++. This is my initial idea for each pool:
<br/>
<br/>
- Runtime objects allocated using new() (player class, object class, scenegraph entries, etc).
<br/>
- level's display lists
<br/>
- characters' display lists
<br/>
- static objects' display lists
<br/>
- character animations
<br/>
- sound samples
<br/>
- text
<br/>
<br/>
Textures are going directly to VRAM (but maybe I could treat that as another memory pool?)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking of pre-allocating each pool with a pre-determined size when the game loads to limit how much RAM each type of resource can use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
