wow that' a pretty badass CPU for such a handheld.
<br/>
too bad that the screen is crap
<br/>
<br/>
anyways......thanx to Liraluna(isn't that the dude who ported WinDS to DS?) whe now have a Gameking emulator which is indeed VERY special.
<br/>
I like that.
<br/>
but I don't think that there are any games dumped(yet?)...maybe beside the 3 that are build in.<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A "16-bit 65C02" is a 65C802, which in turn is a 65C816 without the A16-A23 address lines. The 65C802 might even be pin compatible with 65C02. Or a "16-bit 65C02" could be another customized 6502 derivative such as the SPC700, which has instructions that treat X and Y as a 16-bit number, except without the SPC's "just different enough to avoid a lawsuit" instruction encoding.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
