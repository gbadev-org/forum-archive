    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for technical documents on the ARM946E-S processor (ARMv5tE Architecture) especially a complete and detailed instruction set with the opcode map.
<br/>
ARM7TDMI was fairly well documented in comparison...
<br/>
<br/>
I can already emulate the ARM7 binary of you-know-what in <span style="font-weight: bold">BoycottDS</span> but I need to implement the second processor before going further.
<br/>
<br/>
Happy reverse-engineering guys!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by boycottadvance on Tue Jan 04, 2005 6:15 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

You can request a free cd from Arm, that has all the information you would need.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">maybe I am blind but I cannot find any document with a detailed opcode map or instruction set.
<br/>
there are quick reference instruction sets, very tiny opcode maps but nothing like a big opcode map and instruction by instruction list with flags and timings...
<br/>
<br/>
I need accurate documentation if I want to decode opcodes and start to emulate things...
<br/>
<br/>
what documents are you using guys?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the introduction in the tech manual for the ARM946E-S (the CPU in the DS, AFAIR) states the following:
<br/>
<br/>
"The ARM946E-S is a synthesizable processor combining an ARM9E-S processor core with a configurable memory system.  It is a member of the ARM9E family of high-performance, 32-bit system-on-chip processor solutions."
<br/>
<br/>
So, based on that, you should be able to use the technical manual for the ARM9E-S.  And, sure enough, the ARM9E-S technical manual contains a full instruction set listing with cycle times, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think he is looking for the ARMv5TE reference material combined with the info you pointed him at. I do not think I had come across the ARMv5TE opcode breakdown on the internet, but it might be in the "ARM Architecture Reference" book on amazon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, it seems the architecture manual is not on arm's site. however, there is a copy available online if you search for it. Specifically, <a href="http://dsl.ee.unsw.edu.au/dsl-cdrom/reference/arm-architecture-reference.pdf" target="_blank">http://dsl.ee.unsw.edu.au/dsl-cdrom/reference/arm-architecture-reference.pdf</a> is probably what you are looking for, boycottadvance. =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the ARM Architecture Reference is not available from the ARM site and was the document I actually needed.
<br/>
Thanks to all for your replies.
<br/>
<br/>
I can start working on ARM9 emulation now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A great book for the different types of architecture that ARM offers is:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201675196/qid=1106054525/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/202-2502548-8720626" target="_blank">ARM System-on-chip Architecture</a> by Steve Furber
<br/>
<br/>
This covers the architectures you mention (v5TE) (.. as a side note its also a great book for learning assembler too I found very clear and concise).
<br/>
<br/>
The book makes mention that the 5TE is used mainly for systems which use signal processing and has signal processing instruction set extentions (The 'Q' flag added to bit 27 of the CPSR for example) and the extra SMLAxy / SMLAWy / SMULWy / SMLALxy / SMULxy / QADD / QSUB / QDADD / QDSUB instructions. The book also has format diagrams and example usage if that PDF above is a little dry :)
<br/>
<br/>
So in theory this chip set will also have the handy CLZ instruction. 
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is some use :)
