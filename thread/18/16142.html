    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The suggestion is simply an internet radio client for streaming audio.  I think you can do this on DSlinux, but as far as I know there is no standalone nds utility.
<br/>
<br/>
Some fellow students and I are already working on something for the DS as our senior project or this would probably be our project (It will be released to the community when done, of course).  
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?  Seen something that has this functionality already?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
