I just tried it on my GBAMP with an old build of DSLinux and it worked okay. Make sure you are using the DS-X DLDI from my site, or some other one that doesn't have the unaligned read bug.

Lick:

Well I started this a few weeks ago, so I guess we independently came up with the idea. However my code doesn't have to search main memory for the source DLDI patch.

It looks like an MPL/LGPL style weak copyleft. I'm trying to evaluate clause c) for compatibility with other popular licenses (such as GNU GPL).

Works fine for me with my DS-X, except it has issues with anything that uses a version of libfat pre-DLDI, and anything using libdswifi (they will boot, but the libs mentioned do not work correctly in the program that is loaded). There may be more issues that I haven't noticed, but aside from those two, I haven't come across anything else yet. As I'll be using this to develop from now on, I'm sure I'll see it gets a bunch of testing over the next while.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-weight: bold">Don't you see the beauty of this?</span> And from the looks of it, patching is pertty fast! It's all the other stuff that takes most of the time, but those are also in MightMax's exec_stub.

So DLDI copying doesn't affect the speed.

Diddl:

Do those failed cards just give white screens, or does it say "failed" on screen? If it's the later, I suspect that they are using the IO identifier of 'DLDI' for the DLDI patches.

Removed clause c from the license. The license now given in the above post is the current license.
<br/>
<br/>
HyperHacker:
<br/>
The DLDI patching is very quick. Any speed issues that you notice are due to the hardware IO. My GBAMP CF loads files quite fast from my 50x CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Fling:
<br/>
It <span style="font-weight: bold">needs</span> DLDI to function, as that that is what the exec stub uses to read the file. It can't use any of the built in libfat IO drivers, as they aren't easily copied into loaded code.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the next step would be for the exec stub to try DLDI patching the loaded file, and to fix the inline ASM.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

do I guess correct - the maximum size for the loaded .nds file is nearly 4MB? .nds files with appended filesystem which exceeds 4MB wouldn't work cause slot 1 card cannot access the file with "normal" SPI commands?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That's mostly correct. If the NDS file is loaded from a non-media based GBA flash cart, using the FCSR IO driver, then the FCSR file system is considered an appended file system. The simple answer is only NDS files that would be  bootable from the GBAMP will be usable.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear.

I have just 'googled' that and it seems REG_EXEMEMCNT has sins been renamed in libnds to REG_EXMEMCNT. I am going to change that, see if it makes a difference.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] palib does not add _bin to the filename, so I renamed load.bin to load_bin.bin and dropped it into the data folder. I also renamed REG_EXEMEMCNT to REG_EXMEMCNT in nds_loader_arm9.c added #include "nds_loader_arm9.c" in my main.c and runNdsFile("/runme.nds"); to load the file.
<br/>
<br/>
in the arm7 (c:\devkitpro\palib\lib\arm7\main.c) I did -
<br/>
#include "nds_loader_arm7.h"
<br/>
and added runNdsLoaderCheck(); to the main loop
<br/>
I think the rest of the stuff is already in the palib arm7 code.
<br/>
I then rebuild palib (c:\devkitpro\palib\fastbuild.bat)
<br/>
<br/>
the aprogram then compiled without a problem, but it will not load runme.nds
<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

Though, if I knew how to search for a DLDI in an NDS like you mentioned, it'd be possible to make an on-DS DLDI patcher, wouldn't it, maybe I'll download the source to the command line patcher and see how it would translate to libfat, though not exactly what I was looking for.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the .zip.  Now I'm trying to put this into my PAlib library so I can use it in DSFile.
<br/>
<br/>
First, I copied the files "nds_loader_arm7.c" and "nds_loader_arm7.h" from "arm7/source" in the zip to C:\devkitPro\PAlib\lib\arm7.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I opened main.c (already there, not from the Zip) and added:
<br/>
<br/>
#include "nds_loader_arm7.h"
<br/>
<br/>
under the rest of the includes.  Then I added:
<br/>
<br/>
runNdsLoaderCheck();
<br/>
<br/>
to main(), after the lines:
<br/>
<br/>
u32 fifo_temp;
<br/>
while(1) { // wait for magic number
<br/>
<br/>
Then I recompiled it, didn't give me any errors (fastbuild.bat) on compiling it, but I haven't tried compiling an app with it yet.  How do I go about putting the ARM9 code in, and do I need to put #include "nds_loader_arm7.c" in as well?<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

when you but load.bin in your data directory, palib doesnt add _bin to it, so all the functions will be named wrong. To get around this i renamed it to load_bin.bin.

Does anyone have any idea how you might use this to load a file from a different card than it's DLDI patch (load DSFile (patched GnM) from GnM and boot files off of GBAMP)?  I want to know how to boot it (as in, how to use the runNds() command or whatever you'd need) and how to include the GBAMP DLDI patch in the .nds itself.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
try patching a new DLDI to it when you load the homebrew, idk otherwise.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Development Blog:</span> <a class="postlink" href="http://teendev.org" target="_blank">http://teendev.org</a>

EDIT: Try porting CHishm's DLDI patcher to DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Development Blog:</span> <a class="postlink" href="http://teendev.org" target="_blank">http://teendev.org</a>
