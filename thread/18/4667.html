it is too a race.  ive seen it at such ever since day one.  why do i consider it a race?  it pushes both ends of the spectrum to work that much harder, while also sharing information back and forth to help each other out.

Let's see... 256x480 pixels times 15 frames per second is 1843200 pixels per second. Nintendo DS ARM9 CPU runs at 67.1 MHz (I'm assuming the ARM7 IOP isn't involved in video decoding other than just displaying it in the equivalent of mode 3). This leaves 36 cycles per pixel, roughly the same decoding rate as Majesco's GBA Video (16.8 MHz / 240x160 / 12). Quality difference may be due to a higher bitrate (Metroid FMVs are much shorter than the 45 minutes of a GBA Video), a higher IPC in the ARM9 vs. the ARM7, or the educated guess that the DS decompresses audio without the main CPU's help, given that the leaked spec mentions some form of ADPCM (probably IMA, SNES BRR, or PS1 VAG variant).
<br/>
<br/>
And no, Nintendo wouldn't get in trouble for using DivX if Nintendo were to license DivX code from DivX Networks (which in turn licenses technology from the MPEG-4 licensing authority).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The DivX? for Games Software Development Kit (SDK) brings the power of DivX video to Video Game Developers, providing the opportunity to integrate the world's most advanced and widely used video compression technology within games for most current and upcoming console platforms.

since factor5 might have even worked hand-in-hand developing the SDK for the DS, whats to say they didn't take advantage of their licenses?

Am I the only one who notices the Actimagine splash screen at the beginning of the demo? The videos are encoded with actimagine's codec, go take a peek at mobiclip, it's the same format, it's a special codec they wrote that's optimized to playback on ARM CPU's, it was originally designed for the GBA (look at their spec info, it's minimum system specs listing is for GBA video carts) but playable on other ARM devices, the demo they have will let you encode clips and play them back on an N-Gage. It's not Divx at all though I'm sure it's not too dissimliar.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">btw, an .avi file format means very little. AVI is a container format, it does not specify any particular video codec. People tend to associate it with DivX / xvid / MPEG-4 video in general these days, because most of the .avi files around are DivX (etc) and most DivX files are .avi, but there's nothing necessary about the relationship. You can put video compressed with just about any codec into a .avi file, including some kinda proprietary format if you wanted.
<br/>
<br/>
btw - Nintendo would only get in trouble were they to use GPL-licensed (or a similar license) code and not make the source code available on request. If they used BSD-style licensed code, there's no problem at all. Only GPL-type licenses stipulate that derviations must also be licensed freely, the BSD license allows you to take the code and do virtually anything with it, including use it in proprietary software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So if you built a DS-port cart containing no code and no files, just hardwired entry addresses sending both CPUs to the GBA port addresses, you'd have full control of the system?
<br/>
<br/>
Presumably such a cart would be a lot easier to build than a full-on flash cart too, since it'd only need to send a short, fixed sequence of bytes to the DS at bootup time - you could pre-encrypt this data too to avoid doing it at runtime.

Actually, this would work if you were to add a kernel handler for PE executables, so that Linux knows to use the Wine application layer when a process calls execve() on a Windows program. Windows programs are PE executables that use the Win32 API, and Wine can load and run many different Windows programs. In fact, Codeweavers sells a customized version of Wine, called Crossover Office, designed specifically for running Microsoft Word and other Windows programs that are common in office computing environments.
<br/>
<br/>
GBA and Nintendo DS games, on the other hand, don't use an API; instead they make direct writes to memory-mapped hardware registers. To run them on another ARM7 or ARM9 based machine, you need to virtualize the hardware (like vmware does). Given what is known about the DS's ARM7 IOP, that Nintendo doesn't let licensees run their own code on the IOP because it might interfere with federally regulated wireless communication, it may be best to high-level emulate the IOP because every game might have almost the same program running on the IOP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't think it's been leaked. I mean, I REALLY doubt it's been leaked. It's not on google. Good enough evidence? It's not there on any variations. Good enough? Probably not, but it's not in google suggest, meaning it hasn't been searched for much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However I am a bit lost, how do you obtain the .nds file? Is that a straight dump from the catridge? I thought it was encrypted? I can't find where it is decrypted. It must be somewhere in dumpds.cpp, but I can't pinpoint where it is being decrypted. Is it done in ReadBlock() or ReadXor() ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's simple people ,  if a rom doesn't work with Darkfader's  NDSTOOL.exe , then it is mostlikely missing at least the header.  Since the program was coded using leaked information that has proven to be true, then it should work on other roms.  So , the fact that you can see the header of metroid , extract all files , and even see some graphics using mike260 metroid model viewer, definitely proves the integrity of the rom.  Now , since we can't even see a valid header in mario , and that header is needed to find out FAT info , to then extract the files ,  it makes the mario rom , either INCOMPLETE , or just plain old FAKE.

Stop asking about it ,  it will come out eventually.

<br/>
<br/>
Is there any type of "limitation" (of course capability of flash card) if we want to use only a GBA flash card ?? in terms of emulation, DS homebrew, or runing original DS games??

I really don?t understand anything in terms of hardware, but  I think it will be very difficult to dump full DS games, and also run  DS  homebrew games, only using a GBA flash card.

This is how he managed to get code to run from the GBA slot in DS mode.  This is, of course, not possible for most people.
<br/>
<br/>
However, assuming this is correct, this brings to light an interesting possibility for those considering how to build a homebrewing system:  it might be possible to design a very simple DS cart which understands the DS command syntax, but only responds with the basic messages necessary to keep the DS happy, along with a header which tells the DS to start executing the code from the GBA slot.  Then, all you need is a standard GBA flash cart, and voila!, you have a simple homebrewing system.  The advantage, here, is that the DS cart is just a cheap, simple masked ROM, rather than requiring flash RAM, encryption logic, etc, etc, and people can continue to use the flash carts they already own.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's the plan. However, until we get the crypto completely figured out, it seems we may have to plug a Metroid cart or two into the back of the device.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Incidentally, one other thing I didn't mention about this technique:  it's totally useless for playing pirated DS games, something I consider a serious advantage:  it helps to legitimize the DS homebrew community, and makes it less likely that Nintendo will attempt to stomp on such a device.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Until some smart fellow figures out how to patch calls to the DS card reader to go to the GBA Game Pak instead. It'd probably turn out to be as easy as patching a GBA game that uses EEPROM save to use SRAM, and anybody who has hung out on Pocket Heaven for any length of time knows how easy that is; some of the flash card writing programs even do it automatically now.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Nobody is saying that.  As far as I've read, we're all saying that people who have a copy of it aren't allowed to post it on the internet for everyone to download, and that includes people who don't own it, which is a big no-no.  And even though you may have a copy (we're not saying you do, we're not saying you don't) it's still not smart to distribute copyrighten material.

The backup/archival copy exception is a very narrow limitation relating to a copy being made by the rightful owner of an authentic game to ensure he or she has one in the event of damage or destruction of the authentic. Therefore, whether you have an authentic game or not, or whether you have possession of a Nintendo ROM for a limited amount of time, i.e. 24 hours, it is illegal to download and play a Nintendo ROM from the Internet. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It has its origins in obscure provisions of laws applying to nonprofit libraries.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's lawful under <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bitlaw.com/source/17usc/117.html" target="_blank">17 USC 117(a)</a> to have a copy of a ROM on your hard disk for purposes of emulation, but you have to have made the copy yourself with your own dumper. For example, the only way to lawfully use EFA or any other GBA flash kit that doesn't allow dumping Game Paks is with homebrews or with another flash kit that does allow dumping Game Paks.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

According to 17 USC ? 904 (http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/ch9.html), semiconductor mask work monopolies last only ten years and are not subject to any fair use rights including the typical backup exemptions that 17 USC ? 117 provides for computer software.

Specifically, the Supreme Court ruled in <span style="font-style: italic">Eldred v. Ashcroft</span> that fair use is the only thing keeping copyright law from violating the first article of amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, there's another conjectured interpretation of the application of 17 USC chapter 9 to mask ROMs claiming that it applies only to reproductions made <span style="font-style: italic">in another mask ROM</span>, that reproductions made in flash or magnetic memory are within the scope of the rest of 17 USC (which includes statutory recognition of fair use) rather than chapter 9. This interpretation would hurt home users much less than it hurts, say, the commercial pirates who make consoles with 100 built-in games sold for 50 USD at the mall.

If I'm interpreting this right, it's illegal to transfer our 'copies' (ROMs) without authorization of Nintendo. The only way we could legally transfer ROMs to each other would be if Nintendo said we could transfer a specific ROM or transfer ROMs in general, which of course will never happen.

True.  It would be interesting to see.  You want to take it to court AFTER they sue someone's ass? :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Looks like a background from a bad punster's Zoop clone.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Getting back to the original topic, a thought occurred to me.  Darkfader has gotten the ROM from the First Hunt cart, and has tricked the DS into loading code from the GBA slot.  Is it possible to make a DS cart using different chips (since I doubt anyone can get their hands on the chips Nintendo gets) and load them up with a ROM and get the DS to load it without needing a GBA cart?  It seems possible to me if DF can load code from the DS slot already.  I dunno, like I said -- just a thought.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I think it uses Matrix Semiconductor Flash Rom compatable masks (?), try one of their flash chips on your demo (Desolder the original rom and use a chip holder ;) (Then you can replace the chip if you want))</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Got bored and ripped this out of the BGMDATA.bin.  It's a bit tinny and has some hiss, but you get the idea.  Used 4bit VOX ADPCM, mono @ 16000hz.  The audio starts out at the right speed at first, then speeds up and then reverts back. 
<br/>
<br/>
 I'll leave this up for a day or two so grab it fast.
