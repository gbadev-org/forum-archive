<br/>
<br/>
On the GBA I have a quite large project that I'm trying to convert to NDS.  Most things work however all my data is stored as const arrays.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm starting to get errors such as:  section .bss is not within region iwram.
<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean that const array data doesnt go in to ROM?
<br/>
<br/>
How can I point an array to live in ROM?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS has no concept of loading something "in ROM", as it's more like a traditional computer. DS programs load into the system's 4 MB EWRAM, and anything else needs to be read from the file system into RAM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
