    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all.  I was wondering if there was information anywhere about what the different options the M3 software manager does to the .nds or .gba from it's options like Software Reset, Trim-Rom, Fast Boot 4x or any of those, if they do a fixed operation to the file?  The reason for asking is I'm developing an application for OS X that I would like to integrate that functionality into.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any info it'd be appreciated!  Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
