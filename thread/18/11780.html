    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After formatting my Pc I couldn't get the devkitarm/pro working :(
<br/>
<br/>
the compiler tells me /cygdrive/c/... no such file or directory and I don't know how to fix this error because I never used mingw (or whatever) before
<br/>
<br/>
Before formatting my Pc i just copied some files into my system32, changed path settings and it worked... :(
<br/>
<br/>
I think I have to mount cygdrive to a directory but I dont know how to use the mount command</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I have version 1.4.1 ,just downloaded this afternoon, but I installed a previous version of devkitPro from one of my backup dvds
<br/>
<br/>
I needed some executables to build the projects (e.g. "arm-g++.exe") and I think I downloaded cgy-based compileres
<br/>
<br/>
does anyone know a link to the "normal" compilers???</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
