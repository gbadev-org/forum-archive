Well,i don't know what those other projects are,but it can't be bigger than tunneling the DS,unless it's a emulator for genesis/SNES.I would like to ask what are these other projects and why can't you be working in tunneling instead.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by mariods on Mon May 30, 2005 5:02 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Well, working on a GUI at the moment, and am using the Ralink driver code to communicate with the DS. Still wondering how to package DS packets within routable ones.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bg.spheredev.net/tv/" target="_blank">TunnelVision Website</a> - Bringing DS multiplayer to the masses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you have a strategy for "sufficiently" emulating a DS on the PC side to send confirmation and keep-alive packets while waiting for "real" packets to arrive?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If there were a wishlist "killer app" that I'd suggest though, it would be libraries for DS-to-DS wireless communication. I'd rather see this task figured out before tunneling, which I really don't care about.

You can't expect people who have already released such great homebrew tools to spend ALL their time doing so... Even they need to stretch out and work on projects that are a little bit more fun or rewarding. Darkain, for instance, has his Dark Star app that has a lot going on with a generic boot loader.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Well, first I need to get dumps of the confirmation/keep-alive packets and then get the program to tell the client program to produce the packets. Thus it is done on the client side rather than server-side.

Well...if you really want wireless, what you could do is use the arm7 from one of the commercial demos and communicate with it. the arm7 is a standard library written by nintendo, commercial devrs don't write their own code for the arm7. so it's almost the same on all of the demos. they should all have the wifi functions, whether or not the game uses it. Then, instead of having to reverse engineer the wifi functions, you just need to reverse the arm7's IPC commands.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Er, I don't know if you missed the memo, but there was recently a interview with Chad where he talked about DemaSked and revealed it isn't even DS-specific. They just thought the DS would be a good system to start on.
<br/>
<br/>
It is a player matching/community system that will work on any system or game, if the developer wants to implement it (apparently no developer they have met with has wanted to, however) it has nothing to do with the DS hardware, or the DS itself, at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
