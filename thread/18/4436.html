    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any place on the web to look for official GBA or DS development kits ? Does anyone know URL or something how to get in contact with Nintendo and talk with them about that stuff. I looked at their official sites, and all I saw was infos on their new titles and news for the Nintendo products. I didn't found anything related to official development kits, tools.

<br/>
<br/>
&gt;So you've written a PC game using DirectX or OpenGL, and you want official support to get it published on Nintendo GameCube or Nintendo DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Not quite. My team is, at the moment, in development process of few titles directly for GBA. We are now working on game design documents for the games which would be really great to see and play on NDS platform.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Which licensed publishers have you pitched your title to?
<br/>
<br/>
After we have something finished to offer, we will try to get these titles published. Not still decided which publisher(s) we would target. 
<br/>
Any suggestions ? :)
