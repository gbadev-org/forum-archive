I agree. I like the Idea of a 3D online multi player environment, but I would like to see it be a tank or plane game. First person shooters don't turn out good on the ds so keep it to planes or tanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
And yes, a little 3D AirPlane Would be good (onlnie that is). Going to publish this to NeoFlash, lets see what they have to say.<br/>_________________<br/>AtomSoftwares, your Sastisfaction our Goal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
