    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If most of you haven't noticed, if you play Wario Ware Inc.  on the Nintendo DS, the color of the Power LED will change (red &amp; green)  in sync with the current song that is being played throughout the entire game. BTW, i was running the Wario Ware Inc.  game using my Flash2Advance 256Mb card.
<br/>
<br/>
So, this answers one question that many of you are still asking, which is that the DS hardware (at least part of it) is accessible via software from the GBA port, and this also brings up a few new ( and old ) questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) What other Nintendo's GBA games have these little easter eggs that works only with the DS?
<br/>
2) Is it possible to run DS games running on a GBA Flash Cart without any additional hardware modification?
<br/>
3) What other hardware features are accessible via the GBA slot?
<br/>
4) I thought I read somewhere that Nintendo said that the GBA slot cannot access any of the DS features?
<br/>
<br/>
I might be wrong about what I'm saying here, but it's quite an interesting easter egg for those of you who haven't noticed it yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Some flash carts consume alot of power. Perhaps it is on the edge of what the DS can deliver, so the voltage varies slightly with the music.
<br/>
Try running your original Wario Ware cart (which draws alot less power) and tell us the results.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The green light represents the light of heaven and the lord Jesus Christ our savior, who are struggling to save your soul from the temptation of rom pirating.  The red light represents the ill will of the Dark Lord Lucifier, whose graps grows stronger on your soul with each new rom you download.

<br/>
So please realize that as the light becomes more red, you yourself get closer to the gaping mouth of Hell.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't remember noticing it on my copy of Wario Ware either.. I'll have to check again when I get my Wario cart back from a friend.  I somehow doubt it though, considering that Wario Ware was released back in May 2003.  One and a half years before the DS was released.  That was well before the DS's feature set and hardware design were even finalized.
<br/>
<br/>
You'd think if there WERE a way to access the DS hardware directly via the GBA cart slot, someone in the homebrew community would have figured it out by now.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Wario Ware: Touched for the DS is rather fun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I checked with an original copy of Wario Ware Inc. and found that the LED flickering does not happen with the original catridge..so it seems that my flash cart must be really draining the machine's power or something?

Actually, I have found that (at least some) flash carts draw about as much current when idle as when playing a game from it. So this might not necessarily be true.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To distinguish this, try yanking the cart during multiboot gameplay. (Aside: This lets you load one multiboot onto multiple kids' GBAs at a family party, without messing around with wires.) And on systems where you can't yank the cart at all (currently just the Game Boy Player), power consumption doesn't matter.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
