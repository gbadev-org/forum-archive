Details inside.
<br/>
<br/>
Sources from the Italian developer Jadrule have confirmed exclusively to DSGaming that they are nearing an alpha release of their DS tunneling software. The software as been in development since December 2004 and currently goes under the name of 'DS Linkup', which will be released on April 11th.
<br/>
<br/>
DS Linkup promises to connect DS users from all over the globe and currently has been tested across Europe with several successful connection and from Europe to America with one successful connection.
<br/>
<br/>
The games tested so far are Super Mario 64 DS and PictoChat.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason for the delayed release of April 11th is that the software is being tested for compatibility in further regions first.
<br/>
<br/>
The official website can be found here:
<br/>
Jadrule DS Linkup page
<br/>
<br/>
With the recent news about a possible DS Linux release soon in addition to this news, it seems like the DS might finally be gaining some ground on the PSP in terms of homebrew software and the like.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much to Frozin for reporting this exclusively to DSGaming.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That's all I saw about requirements.  No mention of needing a computer, yet obviously you do.  No wireless NIC required?  Does the PC simply talk to the wireless router and tell it what to do?

Usually, I like to sit on the fence and lean one way, but this time I have to say that although I would love this to be true, it is complete BS.  And I hope that I am proven wrong and have to eat those words, but I'm not setting the placemat just yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I bet if you'd start discussing the details of the TCP/IP protocol, or maybe even the 'C' programming language, this kid would stare and blush with ignorace.

Also, PictoChat AFAIK doesn't send text in ASCII, it sends bitmaps. So unless they're using sophisticated Optical Character Recognition software, the screenshots are obviously fake. And even if I'm mistaken and text does gets sent seperately, why wouldn't they put in image support if they were such master hackers?

If you have a wireless router, you may not need a wireless card in your PC.  Because other programs in the past have functioned as a pass thru with a wireless router and your PC.

The screens for Pictochat that you see aren't the chats within pictochat, they are PC to PC chats.

Same with the other games. PC to PC chats.

second, have a look at the DS Linkup logo at the top of each window.  its quite smoothed while everything else is sharp.  when you import an image into VB, Delphi or any other similar object-oriented, event driven application builder the images come out sharp.  that definantly looks photoshopped (esp since from my experience jpgs and such which can b smoothed down like that can't be loaded in VB, Borland Delphi etc)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I mentioned the hand-drawn hourglass in their forums too.
<br/>
Something else that springs to mind would be the hovering text next to that hourglass.
<br/>
No coder in their right mind would do something like that, for obvious legibility reasons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not to argue your point (which I actually agree with) I do have to dispute the assertion that coders have to be, at any point, in their 'right mind'.

Yeah, the guy who did this hoax is retarded. It's not even funny. All he was doing was either enjoying his fifteen minutes of fame, or putting up one of those ads where he gets payed for every view, thus making lots of money because all the people checking to see details and if it's a hoax and blah blah blah...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
