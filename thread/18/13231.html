    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I understand that Wii homebrew hasn't even happened yet, but is there a 'gbadev' kind of board for Wii homebrew?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm assuming it won't be long before people are able to compile wii homebrew.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">at least i can run gamecube hb in gc mode. ;^) gc hb-ing was a pain in the back and i still wonder if there was more than the dolphin demo and tetris (and linux) done for the gc. mostly because of it's constant turning speed mini-dvd derivate special magic gamecube drive.
<br/>
well, at least we have a "normal" dvd drive in the wii, so it shouldn't take long and afaik, the wii's cpu is also a powerPC derivate (like the gc cpu), so we already have the devkitppc, that would need some adjustments for the wii.
<br/>
share whatever you may find with us! :^)

On a side note... I just saw an article describing Datel's new Gamecube/Wii homebrew package. It uses the GC memory card to SD card interface, and it has a media launcher disk. Sadly, it only does GC homebrew...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't been following the scene too closely, but it appears that the modchips currently available only allow for official encrypted binaries to run, so you can run GC homebrew but only Wii backups, making it useless for your purposes.  It appears to be much the same way an unflashed DS is with the Wireless Multiboot application - you can only use official binaries.  Then again, I could be wrong, as like I said, I haven't been looking at it too much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
