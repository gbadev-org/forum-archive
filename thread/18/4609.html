Right now, the only thing remotely remarkable in terms of communicating with the DS using a PC is make the DS think that there is a wireless game available. And even then, it's not like we can do it with all cards either.

IMO, rreze13 is only wasting time of people who read every post in every topic.  It's your decision whether to read it or not, so it's your decision to waste your time.  I could see SimonB being upset if rreze13 was posting hundreds of images, or large text posts, or cursing &amp; swearing etc, but he/she (I'll assume he) it's doing any of that.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think it's good to keep up enthusiasm.  For those of us not smart enough (or rich enough) to help with the cracking effort, we need to keep busy, and a good way to do it is to keep busy thinking of new ideas.  Also, posts like these (IMO) also help the diligent crackers (not white folk, the people cracking the DS) see who they're helping, and it keeps them motivated to continue because they know people will appreciate it.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I'm the only one that feels this way, but in any case I think this forum has a very warm, inviting atmosphere to it and put-downs like that cheapen it.

If you need to keep busy, try practicing being patient.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not so much that it's a waste of time, but the endless number of purely speculative threads are annoying in both their quantity and their inanity.
<br/>
<br/>
HEY IF WE GET FLASH CARTS WORKING MAYBE WE CAN EQUIP THE DS WITH AN AUTOFELLATIO DEVICE AND WOMEN WILL BE MADE OBSOLETE!!  AND DO YOU THINK THAT IF TIME MACHINES EVER GET INVENTED THAT THEY WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE DS?  WELL, DO YOU?!?!
<br/>
<br/>
The forum is called "DS Development", not "share your conjecture about the 1,000,000 things you wish you could do with your DS even though there's no basis for any of it to date".  The "inviting atmosphere", as you call it, should not override the work that needs to be done, and progress isn't going to come about with "I could like totally make this into an Ipod...IN MY MIND" posts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe we were a bit hard on you. But if you had read the other posts in this forum, you would have known that we are no where near having the public use the information we know about the DS for anything useful.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i will agree you guys where a bit hard on the poster, however, i also agree that this is a *development* forum.  see, all of us who are working on cracking the DS's wireless and cart interface already realize we can throw a bajillion and one apps on it.  this isnt news at all.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess for now (until DSDev.org takes over this section of the forum), the best thing would be to keep <span style="font-weight: bold">speculation</span> posts not related to the <span style="font-weight: bold">cracking</span> of the DS and its cart &amp; wireless abilities in the "Off Topic" section, and the <span style="font-weight: bold">speculation</span> posts <span style="font-style: italic">related</span> to the <span style="font-weight: bold">cracking</span> of the DS et al. here.
<br/>
<br/>
Really, guys, who is actually <span style="font-style: italic">developing</span> for the DS here?  Almost nobody -- the majority of people actually working on the DS are still trying to figure it out.
<br/>
<br/>
So with that in mind, try to take it easy.  I still agree, however, that the amount of pure speculation could be kept down, and/or moved to a more suited section like "Off Topic".

<br/>
there is a reason why it is called "Research and Development".  we are still in the research stage, and trying to migrate forward into the development stage.
<br/>
<br/>
and agreed, "off topic" is a great place to post stuff like "OMFG!!!  i i r0x0d and g0ts teh DSssss!!!"  :)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

That being said, there is nothing wrong with people comming up with new ideas on what to do, just that there is a time and place for everything.
