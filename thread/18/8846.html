I wouldn't be surprised if some sort of capture device could be made from this, if it's possible to get colour.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, try it with a GBA game. You only have one image that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I took that photo myself.  Nintendo was using it to demo Mario Kart DS, and they had it connected to two plasma displays *drool*.  If only I had the courage to grab it and run :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it can't - video output is an option, not standard feature of IS-NITRO-EMULATOR<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
