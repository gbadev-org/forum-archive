    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone here every had an issue where sprites (and tiles too actually) change colours during movement on hardware, but not on emulator? By change colour I mean that certain pixels seem to blend together and they usually look noticeably darker.
<br/>
<br/>
My first thought would that since its not double buffered it might be a drawing artifact, but I'm not really drawing enough for that to be an issue.

The code I'm using is pretty standard stuff from a bunch of NDS tutorials. I'll post it though if no one knows what I'm talking about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's because of the LCD screens, nothing software related at all.You will notice it mostly on left/right movement. I'm not sure of the technical reason, but I assume its something to do with how quick or slow the individual pixels light up and fade out.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
