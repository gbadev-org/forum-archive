    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, as stupid as that would be to buy, it's an interesting idea from a business standpoint.  There's guaranteed to be people who would be willing (and able) to shell out for something like that, and it's a nice kick-start towards recouping R&amp;D costs.

Although, I have difficulty beleiving this particular case is legit (But, hey, maybe it is).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I'd have a little trouble believing this "deal".  Sure, you're paying a lot for it, but if you're going to charge shipping, wouldn't that cost a little more than $8 (or $8.50, whatever it was, I can't remember exactly but it was more than 7.99 and less than 9.00)?  I mean, at that point, shipping should be free, or cost more than that because the DS alone would cost that much to ship, and they're offering 3 games and "exclusive DS merchandise" with it, which probably means a T-Shirt and a pen that glows in the dark, or a T-Shirt that's been signed BY a pen that glows in the dark...
<br/>
<br/>
In either case, it doesn't actually mention WHEN you'd get the DS...  I can wait another month... I hope...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
