    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I tracked down some awkwardness.
<br/>
When I print out '?' to screen as value, I get 201 when I expected 144. The character printed out when printing out ? was actually the one associated with 201 at asciitable.com (read: not ?). Fun stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I looked up what had ? as 201, and that was web characters (amongst others?) <a class="postlink" href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/cseg/projects/ariadne/ihe/web/chars.html" target="_blank">long url</a>
<br/>
<br/>
So, inconsistency between what the default console prints, and what is stored internally. Not sure whether the console printing needs adjusting, or the internal used ascii table by devkitPro, or something? I'm no expert on these matters. I just know this is terribly awkward.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ascii is 7 bits width. Ascii #201 does not really exist.
<br/>
There is no unique setup of the chars &gt;127
<br/>
<br/>
These were added to the original ascii table in form of several different (mostly language/country dependend) codepages. It is therefor very natural that the code's meanings are different between platforms maintained in different codepage-zones.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, I see. I guess I'll be working with codes rather than their symbols when handling my (textfile) maps with values beyond 127, and not assume what the symbols will end up when writing them to a file. Thanks for the explanation.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
For what it's worth, Programmer's Notepad (the default text editing app that comes with devkitPro) doesn't seem to have such a code page (yet).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well the value will keep the same, it is just the symbal that is used to display it.

This is in most cases not application dependend but an OS Setting. 
<br/>
For windows this is the "Region and language settings" (manually tranbslated from german version, so the actual name might differ)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://nintendods.desperate-programmers.com/doku.php?id=wireless_io_map" target="_blank">Trying  to bring more detail into understanding the wireless hardware</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
