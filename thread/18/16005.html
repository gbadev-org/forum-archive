    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there. This time it's not a question... well, not a question about programming the DS at least ;)
<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that: it's since a couple of days I've been in struggle to find why -sometimes- sound samples weren't reproduced as they were expected. The problem in the beginning appeared randomly then I found a pattern: the problem appeared when playing some samples AFTER some others. Then I noticed the problem appeared only when playing a SOUND_ONE_SHOT sample after a SOUND_REPEAT one.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, so I added
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">SCHANNEL_REPEAT_POINT(channel) = 0;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
to reset the repeat point, even if I thought that SCHANNEL_REPEAT_POINT was ignored in SOUND_ONE_SHOT mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Now it works (!!!). So, should I think that SCHANNEL_REPEAT_POINT(chn) value isn't ignored? And if it's not, does anybody of you knows the usage of this in the SOUND_ONE_SHOT case?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
In repeat mode, the 'PNT' part is played once, and the 'LEN' is looped forever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That's what I was thinking too. But... what for? Since we don't have any loop, isn't it easyer to have just LEN and ignore PNT?
<br/>
<br/>
By the way I believe a lot of people just started from that piece of code <a class="postlink" href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop6.html" target="_blank">here</a>, that forgot to set PNT to 0, and went forth with loops...
<br/>
<br/>
ok, I just fallen in a common mistake... I see :|</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
