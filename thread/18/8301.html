How can i be sure tnah it comes from GBA ROMS ? what surprised me is that the SuperPass loader load all my roms in memory before starting......I think that using GBFS can allow me to streaming data but actually i already got this limitation in size..........</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here, "GBA ROM" refers to the 32 MB portion of address space from 0x08000000 to 0x09FFFFFF. It's likely that the DS audio DMA can't read from this area, just as GBA DMA0 can't.
