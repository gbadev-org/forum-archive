    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DS game card music/sfx player. (all official games use the same nintendo sound library.)  That would be nice for listening to music without playing the game.
<br/>
<br/>
This of course means someone is going to have to completely reverse engineer the nintendo sound library.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things that should actually sit inside the first 64KBs of the firmware. (shorting SL1 is required to change this area.)
<br/>
<br/>
1. Boot DS game card.
<br/>
2. Boot GBA ROM in DS mode. (flashme equivelent)
<br/>
3. Boot GBA ROM in GBA mode, on user selected screen.
<br/>
4. Wireless Multiboot (both signed and homebrew)
<br/>
5. Change important DS settings.
<br/>
    a. Manual/Automatic mode
<br/>
    b. Language settings. (Don't need to have all 6 language translations of the interface present, just more so that the game that supports multiple languages run correctly.)
<br/>
    c. GBA mode screen
<br/>
    d. Date/Time settings
<br/>
    e. User color/Birthday/Nickname/Message
<br/>
    f. Touch screen calibration 
<br/>
    g. Nintendo WFC settings/testing. (if enough room to implement this.)
<br/>
<br/>
More or less,  all critical functions, so that is some malicious bricker is run on the DS, you can still use the DS without reflashing the firmware using the built in failsafe recovery code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK now that's pretty damn cool. Doesn't want to boot my MKDS cart when run over WMB though. (Just the firmware.nds, that is.)
<br/>
<br/>
Feature-wise, cool things to include would be:
<br/>
-Calculator
<br/>
-CF/SD card file browser, with simple abilities like renaming and deleting
<br/>
-Notepad (using text files from CF/SD)
<br/>
-Maybe a JPEG viewer and MP3 player to play files from CF/SD
<br/>
-Ability to download and run .nds files from any wireless card
<br/>
-Alarm clock (like the existing one)
<br/>
-Unlike FlashMe, make it an option whether you want to automatically boot homebrew from the GBA cart or not.
<br/>
-Transfer GBA/NDS saves to and from PC
<br/>
-Ability to edit settings and such without having to shut down all the time
<br/>
-Temperature display
<br/>
-A few built-in borders to choose from for GBA games (save space by compressing them and just making the middle blank)
<br/>
-Startup password
<br/>
-Very first thing shown at bootup should be the name and icon of the currently-inserted NDS game, and the name and Nintendo logo from the GBA game. (This way if your cartridge is dusty, you can tell right away... it's a pain having to keep starting up and going to GBA mode to see if your GBA cart is clean yet.)
<br/>
-If possible, keep the ARM9 on in GBA mode and/or hook into the ARM7 code, and do various cool things like having the option to toggle the backlight and switch screens during the game, maybe remap buttons, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
If there's enough space left (and I doubt there would be &lt;_&lt;):
<br/>
-Emulators for old consoles (again using CF/SD)
<br/>
-Simple web browser (maybe text-only)
<br/>
-Day planner of some sort
<br/>
<br/>
Note that the things that require a CF/SD card could be stored on the card itself to save space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can't boot DS games when starting the "firmware" via Wifime, too, but maybe that's because it's started via Wifime?

<br/>
All the ideas for software implemented in the firmware are good, but chism is right - they should be loaded from GBA slot. For example that you flash the extended firmware image on a flash cart, the firmware recognizes it when it's inserted and offers more programs.<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#68113 - JaJa - Sun Jan 22, 2006 4:48 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How about a modular firmware?
<br/>
All critical functions (GBA loading, DS loading, homebrew loading) in the first 64kb, and an application that write firmware modules into the remaining space.
<br/>
You could have media modules, web modules, etc.
<br/>
That way people configure what ever they want.
<br/>
Then people could write new bits for the firmware with less risk than if they have to write all or expand the firmware.
<br/>
This also means new modules could be easily added/removed without shorting SL1.
<br/>
There's no way we can have everything people want in the firmware (everything from GDB stubs to save transfers to emulators).
<br/>
<br/>
If it was modular Dev's could have SRAM viewers, GDB stubs, RAM viewers, Register viewers in firmware, whilst others could have web browsers and emulators.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually emulators and stuff are a dumb idea. You'd still need something in the GBA slot to store the ROMS's. Hmmm.
<br/>
But address books and calculators are a good idea.
<br/>
How about some WinDS features?
<br/>
<br/>
Features i'd like to see
<br/>
- Easily Skinnable Firmware
<br/>
- PDA style organiser/address book</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then, before it loads the interface, it looks in the other 192KB for another menu. It loads this if it is available, otherwise it falls back on the simplistic menu.
<br/>
The ARM7 binary could also be kept in the first 64KB, since it is unlikely to change once it is complete. That way, to customise the firmware, all that is needed is to change the ARM9 binary, which is little more than an interface anyway.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Talked about this stuff on IRC already, but a couple of other suggestions / comments (and yah, I'll throw my hat in eventually as well)
<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about the lack of space yet, make your firmware run in the high space for now, and by the time you're running out space, hopefully the wifi lib will be in substantially finished state, so a common arm7 bin can be committed to low firmware.  Until then, putting a (frequently) changing arm7 bin in low firmware will require several sl1 flashes as updates are made, which risks the chance of someone bricking their DS each time.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to respect the required firmware settings spaces (www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Main/Firmware), basically 0x03FA00 and up, and the wifi settings, etc... in low rom (not an issue if you don't mess with the first 64 KB for now).
<br/>
<br/>
I also propose a common format for extended settings, so people can try out different firmwares without having to back up / restore the extra data.
<br/>
<br/>
Say, an extra 1 or 4 KB of data below 0x03FA00 in a chunked format, something like:
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;author-type&gt; &lt;length&gt; &lt;length bytes of data&gt; &lt;crc-16 over rest of data&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
That only wastes 4 bytes above and beyond the data contained (assuming length is a byte), and if we somehow magically get more than 255 people writing unique firmware projects, can just reserve 255 as an extended tag, with the real author inside the data payload, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
This would let say, a common plugin used in different people's firmwares share the same config data, e.g. an ip address to grab UDP data from.
<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think, and since it was my idea, I reserve author-id 42 and 0x42 :)<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the author byte or another type field is very much necessary (if it's not outside of the &lt;length&gt; bytes of data, it has to be inside of it, so that a particular plugin or firmware can find the config setting it's looking for).  If you instead put stuff at a known hardcoded location depending on the data (like the color settings are done in the existing firmware), you lose any benefit of having tagged data (it's not tagged).
<br/>
<br/>
Re: length field.  Was just trying to minimize the perceived impact of wasted space.  You've got a lot of options for the fields, such as DWARF-type numbers (7 bits in 1 byte, 15 bits in 2, etc... for arbitrary length), or just burn 2 bytes off the bat for author / length (no need for 3 or 4, the entire firmware is only 4x64 KB)
<br/>
<br/>
If we standardize on plugins (probably too early for this, but the main issue with plugins will be a menu-display name, a arm9 load address, and a length), we could just use the entire 192 KB-end settings worth of firmware to store chunks, where one author/type field would indicate a menu plugin, another the settings for that plugin, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Would be good for auto-discovery, the 'firmware-builder' would just pick and choose plugins until they'd used up the free space, and write them to firmware (could even have a CF aware program that lets anyone choose which parts they want in firmware, and loads the plugins from files).  No need for a seperate table or anything, scanning 192 KB is nigh-on-instant.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, going back to that, hmm:
<br/>
<br/>
c/d bit, 15 bits of author/type tag, 8 or 16 bits for data sections to denote byte length, 16 bits for code sections to denote word length, then data, then crc of some sort over rest of chunk.
<br/>
<br/>
I (weakly) advocate a crc-32 for code, since crc-16 is so weak, but crc-16 doesn't cost any space, while a slow crc32 costs a tiny bit of code, and a fast crc32 costs more than a KB of table, plus code (minor concern compared to what newlib eats, I know, but still).
<br/>
<br/>
And if we're doing 15/16 bits of author/type, I call 0xC0DE for the plugin type format.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

In reality, the only essential features are the ones that Nintendo already includes, plus a few homebrewn-dependant things like maybe Internet, and maybe some form of integration with flashcards and/or compact flash/SD cards.

A feature I'd like to see is a built-in CF reader, so I don't have to worry about _Boot_MP.NDS all the time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would be kind of a neat idea, actually. Applying IPS patches to Nintendo DS games before the game started..would make the cheaters much happier.
<br/>
<br/>
But what I'd really like to see is a firmware that has a sleek, 3D-based interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a Gamecube-like firmware for the DS? That'd be cool. Maybe integrate Nintendo WFC configuration right into it, as well. Pop in CF/SD drivers, and make them automatically load say, "Firmware-enhanced.nds" or "ds.gba" for other cards, and voila, instant enhanced-extended firmware. Maybe have a boot loader, or a whole suite of tools all in one package..make all the programs rebootable to the firmware (a soft-reset maybe?), etc.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I noticed in the GBATek document that VREF used for the touch screen drops from 3.33V to 3.1V as the battery gets weaker, perhaps this could have some measurable effect on input.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, while the firmware should be minimal, it could act as a simple shell, listing any .nds (and maybe .mb.gba) files it finds on the CF card (even just in the root or \firmware or some such) in addition to the built-in things. This would give the illusion that these things are built in, and the ability to start them right away without loading another shell first.
<br/>
<br/>
Also GBATek states that most newer DSes have 512K. Anyone know a way to see which you have? (It also mentions work on a customized firmware, but it requires a cable to be soldered to your DS and doesn't have WMB. It uses 8 of the buttons for data input, very clever.)
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] Forgot to mention 2 features that oughta be in it:
<br/>
1) Ability to change "no GBA cart inserted" text. Useful for identifying a lost or stolen DS; just put your name in it. (Or if we're not trying to look like Nintendo's firmware, just a user-specified string displayed somewhere.)
<br/>
2) Simple calculator. It already has a calendar and notepad (write in Pictochat and put to sleep until you get to a PC/pen and paper; the battery lasts for ages in sleep mode), so why not?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by HyperHacker on Sun Feb 05, 2006 4:31 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
After reading that, I no longer believe that incredibly accurate battery readings are practical on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking a percent-rating would be possible, but it's most likely not.  I do think that, if we could tap into some internal voltmeter on the DS (which it certainly has, since the DS knows when the battery is getting low), we could do some data gathering and maybe add a somewhat more accurate block-style rating to the battery indicator (like what you see on most cell phones).
<br/>
<br/>
If I get bored later, maybe I'll look into what it'd take to get a very simple program to spit out a voltage reading.  I'm an IE, though, so hardware and programming isn't really my cup of tea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A couple of things:
<br/>
<br/>
<ol type="1">
<br/>
<li>hbfirmware isn't a single project.  Loopy released an example of how to make a homebrew firmware, and coders are running with it from there.
<br/>
</li><li>hbfirmware is *not* a hack of the existing firmware, it's a rewrite from the ground up (so asking for changing text, etc... of the original firmware isn't really on topic, see the monster thread on customizing the firmware or somesuch).
<br/>
</li><li>If you do want to add more hacks to the existing firmware, you'll need to cut some features (total pain in the ass, and dramatically reduces the benefits of keeping the old firmware as a basis) or use better compression on parts 3-5 (and hack the loading code), there is almost no free space left in the original firmware.
<br/>
</li><li>For whatever reason (probably because mere voltage level isn't a very good indicator, and possibly because they're crackheads), Nintendo didn't wire up the battery level input on the TSC.  Instead, the firmware polls a single high/low level bit in on the PM, which is why there isn't a better level indicator in the stock firmware (there isn't anything better to measure).  Could play about with trying to measure the external Vref they used, and callibrating it over a discharge, but again, voltage is not a particularly reliable indicator of remaining charge (and the callibration will change as your battery ages, etc...)
<br/>
</li><li>Also, not really on topic, but the FCC pictures of the DS lite showed a ST 256 KB spi flash, so the DS lite firmware isn't any bigger either (granted, there are zero guarantees that it wouldn't ship with a 512 KB flash, since the pinout and comms protocol are identical).  Looks like the battery indicator in the manual is the same as it used to be too, so no new bits in the PM or an alternative method of measuring, meh.
<br/>
</li><li>Haven't messed with it near the boundary, but since the LED light flickers as power rises / drops near the boundary, the PM battery level bit might also toggle on and off, so you could do a sample N times in a period T, so you get 3 levels instead of 2 :D (high/regular/medium, very narrow band of not-quite-low, and low).  Really not worth the effort, but I'm throwing it out there.
<br/>
</li></ol>
<br/>
<br/>
zz0, what do you mean by TERMINAL?
<br/>
<br/>
LiraNuna, the DS itself doesn't have a table of interrupts, just the one irq exception vector per CPU (which the bioses then redirect to the user handler address stored in ITCM or 0x03000000 RAM).  The table is an added construct of libnds (or pretty much any other gba/ds library that does more than define registers, though where they store it will be different).  So, you will need to patch the startup binaries of a commercial game (which will also involve decompression/recompression for many of them).  It's doable, but it is nowhere near as easy as just sticking a bit of code somewhere in fairly unused memory and writing to an interrupt table before branching to the real binaries (also, gimme your gfxer ^_^).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

1, 2 and 3 I pretty much had down, but I didn't realize that the DS was made that way (although the lack of a more accurate readout absolutely makes more sense that way).  If it was that simple, they'd have already done it, huh?
<br/>
<br/>
In my mind, I had already made the assumption that a voltage could be easily read and was already looking forward to setting up a statistical analysis to find a more accurate measure of charge (taking other factors such as temperature and maybe even age into account).
<br/>
<br/>
Adding anything like that directly to the firmware was pretty far outside of what I had planned for the near future, but I thought it might be a neat little homebrew app to have a somewhat more accurate readout.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll find something else to go all statistics crazy about (or get back to this simulation project)!  =)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ghazi on Tue Feb 14, 2006 9:03 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Do you need to add Wifi code to the firmware to make games with WFC work correctly?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That's built into the games on a per game basis...that's why some support it and others don't.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I will call it FWNITRO firmware. There are all the plans so far:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Based on firmware code in this topic (very good! Now I know how to make firmware on DS!)
<br/>
</li><li>On a menu, move cursor up/down by pressing UP/DOWN arrows, then press SELECT to select it. Press START to exit a menu, or on main menu, pressing START auto-detects a DS game or GBA game and start it automatically.
<br/>
</li><li>Support most important features
<br/>
</li><li>Date/time will be displayed on one display, menu on other display.
<br/>
</li><li>Programming mode, lets you enter simple programs and store them on GBA cartridges.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It will be cool a desktop style where the firmware let you to add direct access icons to homebrew apps in the CF/SD/Flashcarts. The info of each icons will be stored on the flashcart/cf/sd. Is a cool idea for instant access to aps/games/etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Something like that ...
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
On the top Screen some info about the selected app/game/etc.. and the actions that user can do.
<br/>
<br/>
The icons on the touch screen to use stylus to run quickly the aps.
<br/>
<br/>
If the user adds so many icons mayby L / R shoulders can be use to scroll desktop to add more icons or show the hiddens icons
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, there may be many different firmware to choose from, FWNITRO (mine, based on the firmware at the start of this topic, which could be called FW-Minimal) is just one of them. You could choose firmware depending on what you want, for example, a text-only screen with advanced options, a desktop-style screen with icons, or the default Nintendo firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The best I could think of would be:
<br/>
<br/>
The normla Firmware with:
<br/>
<br/>
All Flashme can do (boot NDScode from Gbaslot, Failsafefeature...)
<br/>
<br/>
A Integratet Webbrowser (like the PSP one) This would be good because it would take nearly no space up in the 4 MB Internall Ram
<br/>
<br/>
And a Option to edit the Nintendo Wifi Connections Settings in the DS.
