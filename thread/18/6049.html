EDIT: Confirmed fake. The ad is edited onto Japanese Text from the Golden Sun DS fake. Notice the cut and paste job.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by IxthusTiger on Tue Jun 14, 2005 9:59 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The date isn't in Japanese format, but this would hardly be the first time "Engrish" as it were, was put on an ad. The majority of advertisements in Japan contain at least some bastardization of Western language or customs, so it would not surprise me to see a US formatted date on a Japanese sign.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it seems very unlikely to me that a person would go through all the trouble of having correct Japanese text, and then simply forget Japan uses a different date format then the US.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
