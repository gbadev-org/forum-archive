<br/>
The  "Assertion "Test assert" failed at line 556 in test_lwip.c" is fine as it is just some test code testing the assert printing (I have added a note to the website to avoid confusion).
<br/>
To get to the IP and MAC address printing shows that you are correctly connected to your AP (the wireless side is fine) suggesting your problem maybe with routing the IP packets.
<br/>
The IP address you configure for the DS must be a valid IP on your wireless network. The gateway must be the address of the router (this maybe the AP) on your network. Something on the network maybe blocking the packet (the firewall function of the router/AP). If the PC you are using is on a different network then you may need to tell it how to get to the wireless network.
<br/>
Can you give some information on your network setup such as IP addresses, number of stations and which PC you are using to try to connect to the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you know why he abandoned it? The stack did do strange things if the memory alignment was not set to 4 bytes (appearing to reverse addresses). I am going to investigate if this is a bug in the stack source, the behaviour of the Nintendo DS's memory or something strange about the ARM code being produced by the compiler.
<br/>
<br/>
People with problems:
<br/>
Forgot to metion this: pressing the X button when running the htmlserver program will put the program in a loop that stops the stack from being run - allows you a have a look at debug messages before they scroll off the screen. Pressing X again brings it out of the loop. But there is no indication on screen of the mode you are in.
<br/>
So be careful with the X button. I will add this to the website.

<br/>
Is the PC you are pinging from also on the wireless network?
<br/>
If not then the gateway setting on the DS may not be correct (this will normally be the IP address of the AP).
<br/>
If it is then run "ipconfig" on the windows machine and it will display the settings it is using. Use the same subnet mask and default gateway settings on the DS.
<br/>

Here is my layout and settings. I have not shown the DNS setting as it is not used and therefore does not matter.

Yep, the laptop and DS were configured with same subnet/gateway.  The same DS config works getting the DS online (Tetris/MarioKart), and also for the bafio's wifi transfer program.  Just tried it again, still can't ping (not pressing any keys).  I tried both the version you have on your page, and a version I built.

Yep, I printed out the src and dest address in the ping handling block, the incoming packet source is the gateway, and the dest is the DS.  So, when the address is swapped, the outgoing packet src is the DS, and dest is the gateway/router.  But I was reading the icmp/ping spec, I think that is ok?

<br/>
I too think the socket interface in the lwIP source will a lot of hassle to port (unless anybody ports/implements some sort of OS over to the DS then it would by ideal). I was thinking of doing a different socket interface that operates in the single thread environment.
<br/>
What I like about the lwIP stack (apart from the fact that it is already written) is that it is very configurable for features and buffer memory use. Therefore people can adapt it for their needs. Also the callback interface it uses as its raw api fits in nicely with an event driven design style, which I like.
<br/>
<br/>
waruwaru:
<br/>
From that debug output the lwIP stack has received the ping, processed it, formed the reply, routed this and sent it out. So, assuming that the wireless side is working, it has got out onto the air. This suggests that the reply is getting lost somewhere. To confirm the wireless transmission of the reply you could capture the wireless frames on the channel the 11B AP is using (although I do not believe this is very easy to acheive using Windows) but I think this will be working.
<br/>
<br/>
Having looked at your network layout I think you may have its IP addressing misconfigured which could cause the reply to get dropped on the way back.
<br/>
At the moment you have all three physical networks (Ethernet and the two wireless - physical in a sort of non physical way) configured as a single IP network - 192.168.1.0 subnet mask 255.255.255.0 (I am assuming that you have not divided this network up by uses a different subnet mask). This would only work if the two APs are configured to bridge their Ethernet and wireless interfaces which I am assuming you have not as the 11G AP is performing network address translation (NAT) on the ping packet (which is why it appears to be coming from 192.168.1.1 when it gets to the DS).
<br/>
<br/>
If I were configuring you network I would configure a seperate IP network to each of the physical networks. Below shows an example of this. The IP address given to the laptop and DS are just examples and, in the laptops case, could be assigned by a DHCP server on the 11G AP.

For this to work configure the 11B AP not to do NAT and not to bridge its ethernet and wireless interfaces. You will have to tell the 11G AP how to get to the 192.168.3.0 IP network. This is done by adding a route to its IP routing table (how you do this is very router dependent - you may have to do it through the routers command line interface). The information for this route is IP 192.168.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.2. You will not have to add a route to the 11B AP unless you want to access servers running on PC on the 11G wireless network.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmmm, I will take a look at what you suggested when I get some time.  But pinging the DS from the same laptop works fine when I run Tetris Online, and I can use Bafio's wifi transfer program properly suggests the routing works.  Looking at the user manuals for the WAP+router configs, everything should be on the same subnet without NAT getting in the way.  Thank you for putting together the network graph, I will play with the routing a bit.  I am leaning towards the packet getting lost/not transmitted though.  Last night, I tried the ping options that bypass router (direct from a BSD box to the DS), the src/dest address shows BSD/DS properly, but the BSD didn't get any packet back either.  I was thinking maybe a Ping client on the DS side would help trouble shoot the issue?  Let me see if I can capture the wifi packets, that will definitely narrow down the problem.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was glossing over that fact :).
<br/>
A quick check you could do is connect your laptop to the 11B AP (i.e. the one the DS connects to) and then see if the ping works from there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
