    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to unflash my european DS Lite, but I can't using current NoFlashMe, because it is reported that pictochat stops working in european lites.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to understand and modify <a class="postlink" href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/Nitro2/FWNITRO/fwnitro_v1_6c.zip" target="_blank">FWNITRO</a> installer to write my original firmware, changing the main writing loop to write the data backwards, but I'm confused: I don't know where to put the original firmware. It seems it's appended to arm9 binary or something like that. Any hint?
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I want to write it backwards is that the last overwritten part is the failsafe code. I don't know if current NoFlashMe does this.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be greatly appreciated for me and for other european people if someone writes/adapts a deflasher.
<br/>
<br/>
Here 2 european dumps of firmware:

Both dumps seems to be the same except for MAC address and personal data (which I edited out). Both were bought around July.

I think it would be pretty difficult to detect if it was flashed and unflashed, don't you think? The only marks it may left are scratches in SL1, but I used aluminium foil. I don't have any device for slot-1 other than a passme2, and I don't plan to buy any other card/pass device, maybe a DSerial (which isn't a pass device). So the reason for unflashing is not a nopass.<br/>_________________<br/>DiThi

While Nintendo has yet to care about firmware hacks, I think it is important that someone make a proper uninstaller for the Lites, as otherwise there's no way to remove FlashMe without breaking things.

<br/>
Well, not as bad as the alternative to not having FlashMe and running unauthorized code.
<br/>
<br/>
And if Nintendo did start banning hacked firmwares, I'm sure you would see FlashMe support revived and work arounds released.  I think the lack of a decent uninstaller is because it doesn't really matter right now.  And nobody wants to waste time working on something that isn't really needed.  If Nintendo creates a need for it, I'm sure you will see a solution.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

so what does flashme offer this solution doesn't? i mean, for me - i don't need it, as i won't buy other dev hw any time soon.

I did that before flashing just in case, but the problem that I can see is that there doesn't appear to be a way to rewrite that firmware back to the DS aside from the use of a DS-LINK device.  DSLinux will let you read the firmware, but not write to it, probably to prevent people from bricking their DSs unintentionally.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One way of bypassing it is to press select and then you can use your ninjads.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also interesting in seeing a way of undoing flashme and restoring it to original firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
More and more ppl will be buying cards using slot-1 such as the NinjaDS so the use of flashme will be less and less useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Btw, I repaired my DS myself, so I no longer need this desesperately. But I still want to be able to restore any firmware, for several reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be a great idea to include write support in dslinux to /dev/firmware, but after unlocking it in some way (such at compiling time or after writing "I want to risk my ds" to /dev/fwunlock) to prevent accidental bricks.<br/>_________________<br/>DiThi

The problem is that the write protection is hardware-based, not just DSLinux's code. This is why you need to short SL1.

Perhaps if they just enabled writing to the firmware and left users to figure it out. *Laughs evilly*<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I know, but I can write a bash script which uses DD to verify if it's written or not.<br/>_________________<br/>DiThi
