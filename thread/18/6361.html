Thanks again to mike260 for doing all the initial Metroid model investigation. If there's anybody out there who's done optimized quaternions for fixed point math give me a shout.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, multiple colors would be the multiplayer models.
<br/>
<br/>
But I wonder what the low detail model is for then? It has been awhile since I played it, but I don't remember any time you can see all of Samus other than multiplayer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't you see the samus model for a short time when you change into a morph ball(like in Metroid Prime1+2)?
<br/>
<br/>
another guess would be a canceled online support?
<br/>
Maybe the low-poly samus modell for online still remains in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
one more: How about encountering a "dark" samus like in Metroid Prime echoes?<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The differently detailed models are for the multiplayer. When the other player is far away, the lower poly model is used. When the other player is very close to you, the higher poly model is used. You can actually see it happen if you play multiplayer and walk closer to each other very slowly. You will noticed at a certain point the other player's model suddenly swithches to higher detail.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, how the heck did you extract that model, and WHAT did you extract it from. I wanna try that. Could someone upload the model for download?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ecurtz: can you explain what you used to make the program and where your reference is? I am planning on writing a 3D Studio Max exporter for the DS 3d format and I need a point in the right direction. Once we have a proper modelling tool, I think DS 3D game development will be fairly simple. Also, there is a wealth of 3D assets on the internet that 3dsMax can open, so with a proper exporter we can see some real cool stuff on the DS. Please let me know, thanks.
