    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if this question has already been asked, can you point me to where it was asked?
<br/>
<br/>
i would like a quick tutorial on start to finish, what I would have to do to develop ont he DS, using linux, yes <span style="font-weight: bold">linux</span>
<br/>
<br/>
from what i gather, i need to get a passme (thats straightforward) and a gba flashcart (where could i get one that i can use with linux?)
<br/>
<br/>
then i need to get ndslib, and then it gets hazy...
<br/>
<br/>
i assume i need some sort of a cross compiler, to build arm binaries, but how can i make the binaries, convert them to a format that can go on a flashcart, and how do i actually transfer them....
<br/>
<br/>
thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the only gba flash cart i know of that has linux support and you can still find in places is the  F2A (Flash 2 Advance) 128 Mbit, 256 Mbit. the linux tool for flashing is called 'if2a'
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest reading some of the tutorials and things, most of it applies. but basically, you need:
<br/>
<br/>
1. devkitarm - there's a linux version
<br/>
2. ndslib - works on any platform, just compile it yourself
<br/>
3. joat's template - helps you set up your makefiles and things to get you up and running quickly
<br/>
<br/>
all of these can be found by searching around, i'm too lazy to find links right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check <a href="http://dsdev.ieatcrayons.net/e107" target="_blank">http://dsdev.ieatcrayons.net/e107</a> for a tutorial on setting up the development enviroment. Hopefully I'll be able to write a tutorial for using passme/gba cart once mine arrive.
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I'm still working on the site, it will probably go down alot in ther next bit, and eventually moved to dsdev.ieatcrayons.net once its ready to go "public".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is HIGHLY preproduction!

All of my development is done under Linux.

I am not aware of any flashcart that works with linux.

The starting portion of the tutorial will cover this information.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that when I say preproduction, I am still working on the Programmers Guide, demos, and other things.  It does cover setting up a development environment in Linux however.  This page gets updated periodically.  I haven't published it before because it only covers tiles at this point, and there are a lot of todo items.  I've coded simple demos using sprites, but I haven't incorporated them into the tutorial yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that I am primarily a C++ programmer, and the code reflects such...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks to all, ill work on it...
<br/>
<br/>
pretty much i want to do a lot of coding via emulators, in order to justify buying a DS... because i dont really play games, so i would be using it primarily for home brew things...
<br/>
<br/>
but i want to do a lot of coding first, like i said...
<br/>
<br/>
i think what ill try to do is write a shell-like thing.. kind of...
