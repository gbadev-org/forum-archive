    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Content creation is a different step than rendering.  Artists typically use programs like Maya, 3D Studio Max, and Blender to create models and animations.
<br/>
<br/>
After that, either the art is saved in a generic format, or it is exported (via a custom exporter) to a special format.
<br/>
<br/>
If a generic format is used, the resulting file is then typically processed into something well-suited for use on the DS, using a custom-made tool.
<br/>
<br/>
If a special format is used, it can be something that's meant to be directly used on the DS, but sometimes it's an intermediate format that goes through one more processing step before being used in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
There doesn't seem to be a mature toolset for DS content creation in the homebrew community yet.  There's a thread about a Maya exporter around somewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there are also plenty of 3DS format readers (that is, they build opengl vertices and surfaces out of .3ds files) open-source here and there on the web, and virtually any 3D modeller is capable of 3DS exports. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since (iirc), you have openGL-like functions in libnds, that might be the shortest path for showing 3D-models-created-with-whatever-tool-you-prefer on your DS ...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK...thanks.  Yeah, I know you generally create 3d content using these 3d packages (I use 3ds max) -- just wasnt sure about the DS and didnt want to try anything just to find out it doesnt work.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there,
<br/>
<br/>
I've written an exporter for Maya, along with a sample program to help you get started in 3D on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy !
