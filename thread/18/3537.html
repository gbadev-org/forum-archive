    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">These questions are directed to anyone who attended E3 and had 
<br/>
hands-on time with the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Was the stylus plastic or metal?
<br/>
<br/>
What type of technology is used by the touch screen
<br/>
    XY resistive?	
<br/>
    surface acoustic?
<br/>
    open gap?
<br/>
    other?
<br/>
<br/>
Is the following scenario possible?
<br/>
I display an image of an airplane on the vertical screen. On the horizontal 
<br/>
touch screen, I place a golf ball. I tilt  the DS up. The golf ball rolls
<br/>
backwards. The airplane climbs. When I tilt the DS forward, the golf 
<br/>
ball rolls to the top of the touch screen, and the plane dives. Tilting
<br/>
right and left make the plane bank.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting idea, those types of ideas are what Nintendo wanted to give to developers with the new system. However the system may not have that in it. You could put it in the card, but those are pretty thin. Perhaps a small extention like GBC games that used the rumble feature.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing, like you said, you could fly a plane with tilting the DS. You could probably imagine flying your DS around like an airplane. It would be quite the sight.
<br/>

I wasn't at E3 but I just thought I'd share my thoughts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seriously, I believe there is some old GBC game that had a sensor like that in it. I forget what it was. I think a marble rolling game or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well the stylus was quite heavy and had a metal feeling to it...so if the choice was between plastic and metal, Id go with metal ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Was there a wire from the stylus to the machine? Perhaps the stylus of each unit shown at E3 was made differently to deter theft.
<br/>
<br/>
Next, I wonder if the stylus is a passive element (as on Newton, Palm, and Pocket PC PDAs) or an active element (like Wacom charged with a capacitor while the system is in storage).
<br/>
<br/>
And is the tilt sensor digital or analog?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I remember reading that you could use the screen with your finger so it's not likely that the stylus would be an active type.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They were all the same, and none of them were wired to the DS. They didnt have any logo's on them or anything...very plain. Im sure a few of them were stolen...I know I could have taken at least 5 and no one would have noticed. They were also giving out styluses shaped as larger pens with a flashing blue light...but I guess that was more of a novelty item...
