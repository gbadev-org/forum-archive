    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on a personal NDS project that involves loading quite a few textures and other binaries.
<br/>
<br/>
The method of loading textures in the devkitpro examples is to link the binaries into the project.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for suggestions on the best way to handle lots of textures.  Is it best to link them all into the final binary and just load them?  I'm a little fuzzy on where the linked textures live.  If the linked textures live in the active code memory, that would obviously be bad for large scale storage.
<br/>
If the data that lives in the NDS just live off in some other mapped memory section, I'm very fuzzy on how to access that.  
<br/>
<br/>
I intend to test my development on an SCSD equipped system, so I can always just store the textures in a binary file on the FAT filesystem.  I don't know how "portable" that technique would be though to the emulators and to other flash card solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be wonderful.

If you have dealt with the GBA before, then consider linking everything into the .nds as analogous with making a multiboot.

In commercial Nintendo DS games, the .nds file stored on the DS Game Card has an appended Nitro-FAT file system that is accessed through a library that reads and writes the Card I/O registers. In homebrew, Chishm's MS-FAT compatible file system code is the closest equivalent.

SuperCard CF, M3 CF, and GBAMP CF can use Chishm's MS-FAT code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I haven't dealt with GBA before, so I don't know what you mean.

Thanks.  I'll dig through the devkitpro filesystem examples.  That looks like what I need, more or less.
