    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a program that reads a 4 MB text file (the Bible), and reads small chunks of it at a time (books of the Bible). I can load as many books as many times as I want without any problems. But after I try a search (which goes through the whole file line by line with 1 verse on each line), and then try loading a book, the DS makes a loud, low sound and doesn't do anything. I've noticed very small sounds before that have to do with reading/writing to the memory card, but this is very loud. Anyone know what this means?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
