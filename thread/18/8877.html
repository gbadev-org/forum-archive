    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I have a supercard SD and I want to start testing my programs there.
<br/>
I build a project, and then take de .nds file. 
<br/>
I patch it with the official supercard patcher software, and it hangs when I try to run it in a real system. doesn't this software it suppose to add the loader code (to switch to DS mode)??
<br/>
<br/>
(I can load it appending the ROM to ndsloader.bin)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Normally you don't have to convert it using the SuperCard Code
<br/>
Just copy the .NDS files into the SD and it should work
<br/>
<br/>
However , if you're using Flashme V6 , rename the .ds.gba into a .nds and run it from you're sd card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a v1 DS that I used the latest version of Flashme on, and it does run .nds homebrew fine.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the Graphics\3D\Misc\Textured_Cube demo, and if I run it through WiFiMe, everything works great.  If I copy it to the SD card and run it from there, the texture isn't displayed correctly.  I did not run the supercard adapting software on the .nds file beforehand.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea of what could cause that?
<br/>
<br/>
** edit **
<br/>
<br/>
I read some more articles and found out that it's necessary to rename the .gba.ds to .nds and then everything works just great off the SCSD.  
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to bother..
