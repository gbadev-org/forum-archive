    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone had looked into the lighting type (AMBIENT, DIFFUSE, SPECULAR) for the 3D GPU?
<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that in GFX_LIGHT_COLOR (0x040004CC):
<br/>
bits 0-15 are for color
<br/>
bits 30-31 are for light number
<br/>
...
<br/>
so that leaves 16-29...has anyone seen if lighting type is in these? (Just to save my time, if anyone has)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
