    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
<br/>
i was surfing in this forum, and an idea came to me:
<br/>
<br/>
- what about a HB that sends to DS what the computer listens (wave) and send to computer what DS microphone's record?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a good idea?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure I understand the idea... Is the idea to use something like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.speex.org/" target="_blank">Speex</a> to compress audio back and forth from the DS to a PC host, acting something like a wireless headset?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, that's it, a wireless headphone, i thought on this HB to replace my teamspeak 2 DS idea, because it's much harder to do.

<br/>
thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought of it more as a covert listening device, as you could set a DS pretty much anywhere without much notice (in a home envirnment).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it'd be impossible to make such a program without an obvious <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_listening_device" target="_blank">bug</a> in it, right? Between this and <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing</span> insect hunting, you can figure out why I tend to call software bugs "defects" instead of "bugs" nowadays.
<br/>
<br/>
And you wouldn't really need a codec such as Speex. Speex has limitations when a non-speech audio such as background music or television sound is playing, and more CPU time means more current drawn from the battery. Given the following engineering constraints: <ul><li>Telephone quality audio (8000 Hz mono) </li><li>Full-duplex audio (simultaneous send and receive), even on a half-duplex packet-switched medium </li><li>Forward error correction to cope with nominal amounts of packet loss </li></ul> you can squeeze everything into 100 kbit/s, well short of the DS Wi-Fi chipset's 2000 kbit/s maximum. That's two 32 kbit/s IMA ADPCM streams plus packet overhead plus forward error correction.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
