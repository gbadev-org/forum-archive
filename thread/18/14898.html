    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im only really starting to get the hang of PAlib, but for my current project i want to change the brightness of both screens, this according to Lick is done using Arm7 code, i have no idea how i do this (no idea about arm7), but i do have the code, but dont know how to use it.
<br/>
can i use PAlib (would be easiest, for me) or if like Lick said, i have to use libnds? can someone also help me with using 2 librarys at the same time, i.e. PAlib and libnds. Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's more than one way to do a fade. To change the brightness of the image on a Nintendo DS (NTR-001) screen, you can use the brightness registers on the ARM9 (MASTER_BRIGHT), use the alpha blending registers on the ARM9 (BLDCNT/BLDY), or rewrite the palette on the ARM9 (BG_PALETTE/SPRITE_PALETTE). I don't see how the ARM7 comes into it unless you're trying to make a utility specifically for the Nintendo DS Lite (USG-001).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Lick has a program which allows you to change the brightness of the backlight, you could look at its code.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
