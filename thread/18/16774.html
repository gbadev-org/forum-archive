    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I am having a problem getting nitroFS to work. My program works fine in no$gba, but doesn't work with my Acekard 2i on a DSi. The files arent being found on hardware, but are there in the emulator. The read function worked fine with fat, so I don't think theres a problem with that.
<br/>
<br/>
A simplified version of my code:
<br/>
<br/>
nitroFSInit();
<br/>
char filename[64] = "myfile.bin";
<br/>
FILE* file = fopen(filename,"rb");
<br/>
if(file == NULL) printf("\n%s file not found",filename);
<br/>
<br/>
Im getting a lot of "deprecated conversion from string..." but I don't suspect that's an issue. I tried to get my code to work with EFS but had the same problem. Changing filename to "nitrofiles:/myfile.bin" had no effect.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you're right, because the example for nitroFS in devkitARM fails to init. I don't know how to use svn, I found

and downloaded the source manually, but it wouldn't compile (load_bin.h wasnt found), is there a way to get a precompiled binary of the launcher?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
