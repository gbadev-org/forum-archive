SpriteForge is essentialy a tool for creating large numbers of 2D sprites from 3D models. You can 'photoraph' your model's animation frames (or simply it's static profile) from several different camera angles in just a few easy steps. Primarily designed for creating game sprites, spriteForge is also great for making 3D website graphics (ie spinning 3D logos), taking photos of a 3D model for sale, avatars for chatrooms, testing a model's animation, spriteForge has a multitude of uses, think of it as an advanced photo studio for your 3D models!
<br/>
<br/>
With SpriteForge you can even create sequences of many models at once, then simply choose the orbit positions and elevation you require. This makes SpriteForge perfect for creating for example; 2D 45'orthographic characters for an RPG style game, animated in all 8 directions!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
