    <h4>#59172 - Joat - Sun Oct 30, 2005 12:11 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've figured how to use and detect the Rumble Pak that comes with Metroid Prime pinball.
<br/>
<br/>
The device is dead simple: <a href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Hardware/OptionPaks" target="_blank">http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Hardware/OptionPaks</a>
<br/>
<br/>
However, it's also not compatible with the firmware alarm clock.  Yep, the rumble option seen with misconfigured flash carts does NOT show up when the rumble pack is inserted, although the firmware show it as an option pak.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it's crazy noisy at high speeds, and at low speeds, it doesn't rumble so much as tick.  I've got a little demo that lets me adjust the rumble speed, maybe I'll alter it to play some music :D
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy.  Also, I've added the wifi information (with SgStair's permission) to the Wiki.  It's pretty much a straight copy right now, with links to related registers on the wiki, but either Sgstair or I will be cleaning it up and more logically organizing it as time permits.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

Note: This is *not* a good way to use it, this is just my testing app cleaned up.  It would be much better to setup a timer interrupt that writes to it, and just vary the latch value and enable/disable it.

it uses low voltage and allows for a tap feel more that a vibration,,, I will look more into it, tough to see the inerts, it is enclosed.

    <h4>#59248 - Joat - Sun Oct 30, 2005 6:49 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on the cartridge and the running code, there are two issues:  If the thing glitches as it gets pulled out, it'll turn off no matter what is on the cart (like an EZFA flash cart, I suspect it's shorting).
<br/>
<br/>
If the game has a cart-removal irq installed (many commercial games), then it'll fire when the cart gets removed, and the game will lock itself up in internal ram to prevent damaging it's save games.
<br/>
<br/>
If the game has neither of these issues (and the GBA MP and rumble pak are *both* in this category), then you can 'happily' swap them (it's still probably not a great idea to do it really often with something like the MP, which can be glitchy all on its own, from a clean reboot, but honestly, there is nothing in the rumble pak to damage).

Kinda funny when you hook a PC speaker to the wires ;)

kinda funny, but I checked the continuity of both red and black wires and they lead back to pin 1, both of them, no conncetion to any other pins.

I tested over and over again to be sure. It may look one way but it test another.
<br/>
<br/>
Im not saying that is how it is traced on the board, but I am saying there is continuity between both red and black, and both to pin 1.
<br/>
<br/>
base on what the board says red= + and black is FR1 not negative.
<br/>
<br/>
to me FR1 would be the frequency. but I could be wrong ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I havent look into it too much yet, just glanced inside, and tested som spots, but not much more. I could tell from the begining that it wasnt a motor, just wasnt the same feel as other rumble paks. 
<br/>
Its funny cause the day I got it I told the guy at gamestop that I thought they might have had a speaker like component in the pak.<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, when checking resistance on the board, I got 27 ohms on

pin 1 ---&gt; fr1, and 3.15 M ohms from pin 31 ---&gt; (+) red wire.
<br/>
<br/>
27 ohms across the Forcereactor. 
<br/>
While running the Rumble demo I was checking voltage at the Forcereactor and the slower it goes the higher the voltage, 3.2V when rate was set to 1024 and 1.2v when it was set to zero.
<br/>
<br/>
AR duo come in handy when checking GBA carts when active in the DS, allows access to atleased the top side of the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Metroid pinball voltage is at 2.2v.

one other thing I noticed was, when playing Metroid pinball, the rumble pak hits harder that using the rumble demo.
<br/>

I just wonder if this will end up being a metroid pinball option pak, or will it ever be used in future games??????

I would say dont even bother :(<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#60557 - Phaethon - Fri Nov 11, 2005 7:18 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats right. The XG Card was shown as an Option Pak, but M3 is shown as a GBA-Game. But, theoretically it is possible? Maybe when the Rumble-Pak Board is combined with the M3, maybe about parallel-soldering the pins? I?m a Hardware-Newbee, so don?t laugh...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#60559 - Joat - Fri Nov 11, 2005 7:38 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not really feasible, for a couple of reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
First is the only way to detect the rumble pak is to have *nothing else* on the bus, which means a way of totally unmapping ROM / RAM (a supercard / m3 *might* be able to do this, since they can map in RAM instead of ROM or CF registers, and possibly are able to totally unmap everything).
<br/>
<br/>
Second is you need the power reg circuit and latch, plus an additional enable if using a cart with RAM/CF, not just the actuator soldered to AD1 and Vcc.  The enable is required above and beyond the rest to prevent the rumble pak from going bezerk when you're writing to the RAM/CF.
<br/>
<br/>
Thus, you could pull off a homebrew rumble pak using the circuit (but why you'd want to is beyond me, cart swapping is much easier), and write software that supports it, since you can control how it's accessed, but rom lamers are out of luck (which, not to be rude, is how I interpret the original poster's intentions) without some extensive hacking of both hardware (add the circuit) and software (un-mapping the cart won't work, doh, that removes the way the patcher streams the game, so you'd have to tie the rumble to an extra pin somewhere and patch both the cart detection code and rumble writing code).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

I did a short rumble demo, using timer3

<br/>
It shows 4 different intensitys..so the demo just steps thru these modes

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a litle update on the SC Rumble:
<br/>
<br/>
If the rumble mode is selected (8, for setting the mose see the DLDI/IO sources) you can enable rumbling (continously by a motor) by setting bit1 (0x0002) at 0x0800000E, and disable rumbling again by unsetting that bit.
<br/>
<br/>
The bit is write only, if read, it allways returns 0.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, i wonder if you could do the active rumbling (where you need to switch between two states like on the m3 to rumble) can be done by DMAing from a volatile address to remove make make it rumble without further CPU interaction.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">possible yes, but without the actual cart, it would be hard to code.  One thing you could do though, is take pictures of both sides of the circuit board, and we can work from there<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

a128 was right. Some official rumble paks don't get detected properly.
<br/>
One test result showed the following values with official rumble inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
four[0] = GBA_BUS[0] &amp; 0xFF;  // reads 252  ==  b11111100
<br/>
four[1] = GBA_BUS[1] &amp; 0xFF;  // reads 253  ==  b11111101
<br/>
four[2] = GBA_BUS[2] &amp; 0xFF;  // reads 248  ==  b11111000
<br/>
four[3] = GBA_BUS[3] &amp; 0xFF;  // reads 249  ==  b11111001
<br/>
<br/>
Meaning that at most the last two bits are common for official rumble paks. Perhaps three bits in the case of four[2] and four[3]. Of course, considering this is a test with just one "different" official rumble pak, I can't guarantee cutting it off at the 2 lower bits works in all situations.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got an M3 rumble/memory thing yesterday and played around with it a bit.
<br/>
In order for it to do anything the cart had to be removed/re inserted and setting the rumble to 1 would keep it going continuously until it was set to 0.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also very, very loud and causes the battery led to turn red and the screens to dim while it's rumbling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
