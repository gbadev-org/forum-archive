    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible for someone to make a simple program that will use the DS's internal hardware to run a normal GBA game from Slot 2 but let you use the X and Y buttons as turbo buttons? I can't believe Nintendo didn't do that. But I guess nintendo doesn't want you cheating :)<br/>_________________<br/>Use your talents for God's glory!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If we could do this, we could also do a flawless GBA emulator. Which obviously isn't happening. Erm... just got thinking about that, I might be a little confused here... The Supercard slot-2 devices (rumble excluded) do commercial GBA ROMs, they use the 32MB RAM in the cart to do this... You can also patch the GBA ROMs for real time saves, does the Supercard run all this in DS mode?

<br/>
Also, would it be possible to use something like nitrohax to make turbo buttons for DS games?<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

That's a video of a modchip which accomplishes this, but it only fits in the DS Phat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Erm...
<br/>
<br/>
This has come up before...
<br/>
<br/>
Only a GBA "emulator" running on the DS in DS-mode would allow access to those buttons. Which would require you're GBA emulator to be a kind of virtualising one if you wanted to actually get decent speed. Which would be very painful to program on the DS (Something to do with there only being an MPU, rather than an MMU if I recall...)
<br/>
<br/>
This has come up before. It wasn't exactly feasible then.
<br/>

SuperCard patched for binaries does not run in DS mode. A GBA binary runs on the DS in GBA mode, patches or no. Device-specific patching usually just inserts extra code into the binary and ties it to a button press check during an interrupt like VBlank, I think...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">but surely a gba emulator on ds is basically impossible because of the read speed - horrific slowdowns all the time</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
