Nearly 5,000 units are returned to Sony for buggy button; Kutaragi unapologetic about the handheld's design.
<br/>
TOKYO--About 4,800 Japanese PSPs have been returned to Sony due to problems with the handheld's square button, according to a recent interview with Sony Computer Entertainment president Ken Kutaragi in Nikkei Business magazine. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Kutaragi acknowledged that the button is less responsive than the others</span></span></span>, in part because it's so close to the PSP's 480x272 screen. Because there isn't enough room to put the square button's detection switch directly underneath, it's off to the right, making it less responsive--and sometimes causing it to stick. 
<br/>
<br/>
Nikkei Business reported that, to date, .6 percent of the 800,000 shipped units have been returned to Sony for repair. Kutaragi was unapologetic about the issue: "<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration: underline">This is the design that we came up with. There may be people that complain about its usability, but that's something which users and game software developers will have to adapt to.</span></span></span> I didn't want the PSP's LCD screen to become any smaller than this, nor did I want its machine body to become any larger. 
<br/>
<br/>
"The button's location is [architectured] on purpose," Kutaragi added. "It's according to specifications. This is something that we've created, and this is our specification. There was a clear purpose to it, and it wasn't a mistake." 
<br/>
<br/>
Offering additional testimony praising the handheld, Kutaragi said, "<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">I believe we made the most beautiful thing in the world.</span></span><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"> <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">Nobody would criticize a renowned architect's blueprint that the position of a gate is wrong. It's the same as that." </span></span></span></span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
What if the architect put a gate between a group of trees leading off a fucking cliff?! Well gee it was a thing of beauty. But....why would a renown architect do that? They wouldn't. The fact that this ASSHOLE is defending a design fault proves not only his arrogance but his complete lack of common sence. I do not know much about this guy, I have not looked him up and honestly do not have the time or desire to. Regardless of what credentials he may have I do not care.
<br/>
<br/>
Has april fools come a month early this year or is this guy really this much of a dipshit? Of course this guy does represent a company with more monopolistic characteristics than Microsoft with their support for custom flash memory, processors, media formats and optical drives.
<br/>
<br/>
If the unit has a faulty button fine... no big deal, but when you not only acknowledge it but defend it, that's a little too much. Sorry but $250 is a little too much to spend on a unit which will break down in a matter of months. PS2 anyone? This has nothing to do with the PSP's capabilities or game lineup, this has to do with faulty design.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to rant all this off in a GBA hacking forum, but with a good portion of the users being experienced in programming and electrical engineering I felt it was an appropriate place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But to tell you the truth I'd probably still buy one if they weren't so darn expensive.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
