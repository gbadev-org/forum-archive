    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not the most original idea, but I love the functionality found in XBMC for sharing pictures direct from the PC. I know video is pretty much out right now because of codec issues, but with the currently available tools etc, would it be possible for someone to make a simple little app that'd share a directory on a PC drive with the DS purely to view picture files on the DS screen(s) with basic zoom functions and that kind of thing? A wireless picture viewer sounds kind of handy to have around the house.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you could stay in bed with your girlfriend and stream new positions from "kamasutrafree" to your DS.

I was quite tempted to make a Solid Snake 'sneaking mission' joke here, but I think I'll pass on this one.  :P<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just thought it'd be a fun "starter" to a future app for someone perhaps. Don't know about anyone else but I for one would love a dedicated server/app combo that worked something like XBMC and CCX_GUI someday. Obviously later in the life people will get more and more streaming media going which this could be a base for... no reason not to start now with an app that'll keep it all in one place and with one interface as well as XBMC does it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
