I guess another way of asking is...
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any good DS emulators out? or is that illegal now?

Cause I remember hearing about Nintendo rounding up patents for emulation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The patent everyone talks about covers automatically enabling speed hacks based on a CRC or other hash of a ROM in an emulator targeting a handheld game system. But it won't affect you for two reasons: <ul><li>Generally, the emulators with speed hacks target users of (ahem) "backups", not developers. </li><li>Most of the claims of the patent are likely to be found invalid given that Game Boy emulators with such speed hacks existed before Nintendo applied for the patent. </li></ul> Ask your attorney for the full details.

Yes, if you're developing a program for a given computing device, it is best to own hardware on which to test your program. In fact, purists such as Michel Iwaniec of the nesdev.com forum have <a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.parodius.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=nesdev&amp;Number=2236&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;mode=threaded&amp;sb=5#Post2236" target="_blank">threatened assault and battery against those who release programs that have been tested exclusively on emulators</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
