<br/>
<br/>
I know there is the WMB_host project and the DS to DS comms project that are getting closer and closer to reliable download and play multiplayer. But is this info being put into devkitpro? There is a wifi lib but no nifi that I can find. The work being done is awesome and I am very keen to start using multiplayer in my little homebrews... but the networking code is beyond me :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But if I recall correctly, liblobby doesn't use the DS Download Play protocol supported by the "FlashMe" custom firmware. It still works on the principle of booting players 2-4 and ejecting the card while each DS is still on, and then booting player 1.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmmm yep different protocol......
<br/>
<br/>
I have got my game using the wmb_host type code and can download to other DS great.
<br/>
<br/>
Now the problem is trying to run a multiplayer game from there.... liblobby want to do different things with the arm7 wifi  :(
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know much about wifi, nifi and networking  :(
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone working on this? Multiplayer is the best thing about handheld gaming......</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try this:
<br/>
Send a liblobby program. Save the MAC address of the client/downloading DS on the host, to a file. Boot into a liblobby program, read the MAC from the file. Send a packet to that MAC, sync and recognize each other, then start.
<br/>
<br/>
Mighty Max hasn't been around in while. So, as of right now, it seems nobody has been working on this right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is the source for the liblobby hanging around to see what it does with the arm7?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or could the WMB_Host code be modified to communicate in game?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The liblobby source is the liblobby SVN. You need to be able to browse it to download the binarys anyway. In the SVN, you download/checkout Makefile, common, arm7, and am9.(Makefile is a file, while the rest is directories.)
<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to mod WMB_host to communicate with a liblobby program, but as Juglak stated, it's very slow. And you would have to figure out the protocol liblobby uses too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
