Someone posted a fake video of a HL mod there, and someone thought it was real and posted this.
<br/>
Smart idea, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is sort of possible, if you modify the Quake engine enough you could get something similar in gameplay and use the same assets.
<br/>
I played with this idea a while ago, here are the problems I ran into (this is from memory, may have errors):
<br/>
<br/>
BSP Format:
<br/>
Very similar, if I remember correctly Quake will load a Half-Life map if you change the BSPVERSION to 30.
<br/>
However, since the textures in half-life are not paletted you can expect the maps to look like bloody vomit.
<br/>
<br/>
MDL Format:
<br/>
I never bothered with this one, maybe someone has some code somewhere to load/animate these.
<br/>
<br/>
Quake Virtual Machine:
<br/>
Simply not powerful enough, you would be better off removing it entirely and linking your mod with the server.
<br/>
<br/>
Lighting:
<br/>
I'm fairly sure it's different, too long ago to remember though.
<br/>
<br/>
Accuracy:
<br/>
The real killer, I used DarkPlaces to fix #1 and #4 but this one was too much.
<br/>
You must re-create all of the entities by hand using nothing but a list of ripped entities from the BSP, mapping guides and lots of testing.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know you can't even look at the HLSDK if you plan on doing this. 
<br/>
Though there may be ways around this if you are looking for specific values such as health levels, ect.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you could easily do Half-Life: Deathmatch though if you modified the DS quake engine just enough...
<br/>
<br/>
1) Modify the quake engine to load Half-Life's texture format
<br/>
2) Allow loading of Half-Life BSPs
<br/>
3) Allow loading of Half-Life sprites (the format is fairly simple, sit down with a hex editor and it's easy enough to figure out)
<br/>
4) Write a tool to convert Half-Life models to Quake models
<br/>
5) Implement ducking
<br/>
6) Implement mod code (weapons, ect...)
<br/>
<br/>
I somehow don't think there is enough vram for all of those textures though, you might need to pre-convert them for DS use just like the models.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have converted plenty of CS models to the DS, so it's pretty possible to convert HL models too, since they're working on the same engine.
