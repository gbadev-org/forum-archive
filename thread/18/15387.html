    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alphanoob here, and I was just wondering:
<br/>
Is there some sort of text editor program for the NDS? I have dsorganize, but all that it really does is allow you to make notes to yourself. I was thinking about something that I could put the text from a program's source code onto, edit it, and then put it back onto my computer to be compiled. Anyone know of something like that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

sorry, i didn't even try it out myself or read anything in the thread... ;^)
<br/>
he was just asking for an editor and i remembered you were promoting yours. i take no responsibility for someone else's actions.
<br/>
after all, you have posted it's limitations, so i don't see the point in your post.
<br/>
<br/>
btw: good luck with your project. it could come in handy at some point. :^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

well, i case i got it right: no offense, but your previous statement would be appropriate if someone actually *did* complain and pressure you. not just because you "imagine" things. that's sometimes the cause of real trouble in the forum.

<br/>
this is just friendly advise, nothing personal. ;^)

happy coding! :^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
