    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been thinking about this for the last few days, and I'm ready to tackle the project of creating a web broswer for the DS, and I mean a proper web broswer, not a text only one that can only be accessed by installing DSLinux. The biggest problem is creating a web broswer that will work within the confines of the DS resources, and rendering engine. I believe we could port the rendering engine from an existing web broswer, and I listed a few one them, for opinions. While I'm willing to work on this project, I don't want to do it alone, so I'm looking for help.
<br/>
<br/>
Existing Engines:
<br/>
Gecko - Basis of Firefox and Mozilla. I don't think its really usable because its massive (7MB alone compiled before you add any code ontop)
<br/>
<br/>
KHTML/Webcore - Basis of Konqueror/Safari. It's a lot smaller, but I'm still not sure 
<br/>
<br/>
Dillo - Ultrasmall rendering engine and broswer. ~300kb in size, and its older rendering engine (Gzilla) is also available.
<br/>
<br/>
Or we could just write our own, but I'm interested in any ideas.<br/>_________________<br/>Was I susposed to put something here?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I think you'd need something which is very tight and efficient, CPU wise. Opera DS does not render very fast at all with images enabled, making this aspect of it kinda useless...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

     i think that because i love mozzila and i think it would be cool to have on the ds. i dont think that the memory is a big issue because most people have storage of 512mb- 2gb. and if it was 100mb then it would be worth it to me. mabe an idea is to use a shell to put all of your programs in. so then you can load the 7 mb and then use the shell as the extra apps. but i dont know how much more room it takes to compile in ARM prosseser. also, a tip is to compile using linux using the gcc from ds linux to use the 8 bit writes. That would boost up the ram like 9x what it usually is.Why dont eveyone that dosent have a supercard or m3 go out and buy one. that way you gbamp owner's get a chance to see what the extra use of ram is made of. I thnk that 
<br/>
is worth it to me!

There's a large difference between memory and storage. Storage depends on your SD/CF card, while there's only 4 MB of memory on the DS(36 with Supercard/M3 extension).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Can't say I agree with what I can follow, though...
<br/>
A shell is actually an interface going on top of a multi-tasking XIPing chunk of software (which I believe you are suggesting) and does not do anything alone.
<br/>
<br/>
That, actually, is why DSLinux is so wonderful.
<br/>
<br/>
Getting the DS to run individual chunks of a giant web browser (Mozilla is not 100 MB, by the way) would be wonderful, but very slow and probably not fun.
<br/>
Besides, it still needs to get running, which takes even more than a bit of magical XIP and external RAM use.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think Dillo sounds good... if you really feel up to it.
<br/>
Gecko and Webcore sound a bit crazy. I, for one, think that efficiency is more important than getting a DS trying to run software intended for more powerful platforms.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the idea of running a local proxy server you can configure and streaming the pages to the DS is a great idea.
<br/>
<br/>
DSLinux I've still never got working with my wifi. All other homebrew works just fine. DSLinux doesn't even try to connect to the router according to the logs, so obviously DSLinux has a major problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy just to text browse on my DS. The only other way right now is using the DS VNC program, which is far from ideal.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to anyone who tries to create a free browser. It's the one thing thing that irks me in the DS vs PSP nonsense. "Well our web browser is free" they can say... GRRR!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure (I realize you're going for the simple description that doesn't waste time), but have you configured wifi for DSLinux?
<br/>
It is different from other programs; no automatic connection. (Though it is theoretically possible now that you can change the configuration to use WFC settings).
<br/>
<br/>
There are a few options for configuring it, including the wonderful and soon to be included by default Wifi config dialog.
<br/>
It can be a bit picky at times, but I find it works pretty well lately.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Put simply:
<br/>
1: Open router in web browser, note settings
<br/>
2: Run DSLinux
<br/>
3: Copy example settings file and edit copy
<br/>
4: Restart the network

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I have done everything that's mentioned. And I very VERY sick of people saying it's easy. It's just doesn't play nice with my D-Link router. And I'm not alone either. I've come across other folk with the same router with the exact same problem. So Oopman, excuse me for being rude, but you can shove your attitude. I've taken enough crap and abuse from people who just assume it's a stupid user problem, when it is QUITE CLEARLY something to do with this particular D-Link router model because DUH! It IS easy to setup, which if you stopped to think for a second before serving giant heaping fistfuls of scorn, means it must be some strange conflict. 
<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, I've tried everything. Not tried for a couple of months though... Mainly because I got absolutely sick to death of people giving me attitude when they don't understand the issue saying "It's easy". I've done EVERYTHING the wiki says. I've run user created scripts. Edited files manually etc... Everything. This is not a setting issue. DSLinux wifi simply doesn't even TRY to talk to the router. There is not even a connection attempt in the log. Doesn't matter if WEP is on or off, SSID broadcasting on or off. You name it, It's been tried, and after fighting with it for god knows how long, I gave up. I may try again, but to be quite honest, people with your attitude are why I've not bothered again, because your attitude stinks and you're about as useful as a chocolate fireguard.
<br/>
<br/>
The only solution I was offered by the folk responsible for DSLinux was doing a packet capture so they could see what was going on, but I have no facility to do that, so I'm screwed basically, and left to deal with asinine remarks like yours.

All the configuration and all that is easy.

Unfortunately my peculiar Marconi-Telkom router only works with the DS if I play around with it in some very strange ways. And then stops working as soon as I save the settings that work and reboot the router :-)
