    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As some people may have noticed (from the leaked filesystem documents or just by experimenting), .nds files have a section for files and header details relating to those files. You can use the -d option in ndstool to include a directory when you build your .nds files.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the details on the header format is well known and using this functionality of the .nds format appeals to me and would be very simple to do. The problem lies in the different ways of running .nds files. If they were always placed in the same location I could know where to read the header and this data from, but I am not sure where to start.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, basically, is there any way to always know where the actual .nds file can be read in memory, regardless of how it is loaded into the DS (wifime, passme as a .nds.gba, Darkain's multi-nds loader etc...).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
