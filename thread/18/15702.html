I didn't notice anything about libfat in the English changelog or readme. Then I went and looked at the sources: <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/moonshell171_oldfat.png" target="_blank">7-Zip screenshot</a><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It should now. There was a DNS problem, which is being worked around. The pic is a screenshot of MoonShell's source code directory, showing gba_nds_fat files.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Only the main FAT. There's still the argument for allowing easier recovery from corruption (although much less likely now), plus it's faster. The only reason to write to the backup FAT (that I can think of) is to stop Windows thinking that the disc is corrupt.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
