    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried following the tutorial on these forums for using it with devkitadvance, which I'm guessing is the old name of devkitARM. But, alas, it didn't work. Anybody here use Dev-C++ for their DS development? And if so, how? (I for one am not really a big fan of Visual C++, and anyway, I'd need the admin priveliges... I'm trying to do some DS development on my school's computers :D)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DevKitAdvance is a totally different package. As far as I know, you must use DevKitARM (the newer of the two). As far as I know, adv. doesn't compile for ARM9, whereas the latter does.
<br/>
<br/>
And nope, I'm using Visual C++. Sorry! :) You can just run the thing straight from the command line though... you don't <span style="font-weight: bold">need</span> an environment.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, okay. Makes sense.
<br/>
<br/>
So, then, as for compiling it from the command line... Well, how? If I have the MSys stuff in my PATH environment variable, can I just do <span style="font-style: italic">make.exe</span> in the command line for it to compile? *has flashback to Linux dependency hell before Gentoo*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure, just use make.exe with the makefile. I think that's all there is to it! :/

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got Dev-c++ to compile the template.
<br/>
Ain?t sure all names on menualternatives is right as I use dev-c++ in swedish but anyway:
<br/>
<br/>
Add a new compiler (Tools -&gt; compiler alternatives) then press + and write nintendo ds in the popup window.
<br/>
<br/>
Then press catalogue and remove the search path for binary files and add c:\ndsdev\devkitarm\bin instead
<br/>
Add c:\ndsdev\ndslib\lib as Library path
<br/>
Add c:\ndsdev\ndslib\include as C-include path
<br/>
and Add c:\ndsdev\ndslib\include as C++-include path
<br/>
and press OK
<br/>
<br/>
To compile a project then rightclick the projectfolder and choose project alternatives.
<br/>
Change compilator from default compiler to nintendo ds.
<br/>
And choose "use custom makefile" and choose the Makefile in the your projectfolder.
<br/>
<br/>
Now compiling should work.<br/>_________________<br/>/As meningful to you as words written in water.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
