    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys im learned c++ within a month now.
<br/>
I read a lot of tutorials and books.
<br/>
<br/>
After that i read some tutorials and documents about how cpu's work.
<br/>
<br/>
So i would like to start with porting games, maybe after that some emulators for very simple cpu's.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that i can't find any information or tutorials how i start to porting a game from pc to a console or something?
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone has tutorials or documents for me how i can port a game or something?
<br/>
<br/>
If there's no information about it than anyone has doc/tuts about starting with writing emulators for ds?
<br/>
<br/>
hope you guys can help me, because i realy want to learn this.
<br/>
<br/>
thanx!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Porting is pretty easy, if the project is well written. The general process is:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Get source code
<br/>
2. Remove and stub out platform specific stuff
<br/>
3. Fix broken code
<br/>
4. Repeat 2 and 3 until it compiles
<br/>
5. Replace what you removed with DS stuff
<br/>
6. ???
<br/>
7. PROFIT!
<br/>
<br/>
For an emulator, I recommend that you begin with a Chip8 emulator for PC. That's pretty much as simple as it gets, and you'll learn a lot about cpus and emulating.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
