I have not been working on it for a while so no news. The new version dswifi library may help with the host problem I was having but no promises it will help or get done in the near future (off doing other things at the mo).
<br/>
The fact that the dswifi cannot act as a access point is not a problem for the WMB host as it builds and send raw wireless frames and only uses the library to send/receive them. If somebody wanted to setup something like ftp to do the transfer between to DSs running homebrew then AP functionality would be required.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DS Download Play cannot be sent through a router, and it reaches only 30 feet. If you are within DS Download Play range, then you are within GBAMP sneakernet range.

You are asking for Nintendo's private key. Otherwise, you won't be able to WMB your "simple games" to a DS that doesn't have FlashMe installed.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It seems it is also capable of adding RSA code to non-official games :).
<br/>
However according to this page, FlashMe doesn't work yet :(.
<br/>
Since I'm using masscat's version of the rt25X0 driver and wmb app I was also wondering if there has been any progress with it (if I can/need to switch to a new version).
<br/>
The one I'm using is coming from over here:

<br/>
If RSA code can be added to for example Mighty Max's bootloader for the GBAMP, then we could run HB with WMB/wifime without flashing the DS's.
<br/>
Making it possible to also work with the DS lite (and making me able to boot flashme for the DS lite).

libnifi is the original WMB for Linux (have a read through the WMB for Linux? topic on the DS Flash Equipment forum for more information). Its author appears not to be developing it further (the web page has not been updated since last year) and in its current state does not support wifime. It cannot produce a RSA signature for homebrew code. I believe the list of successful transfers are transfers to a flashme'd DS therefore the lack of a correct RSA does not matter.
<br/>
<br/>
As for my wmbhost, no progress on the DSLinux port (off doing other things) but yesterday I posted an update for the desktop linux version that allows Trauma Centre and some other demos to be transferred with the correct NDS header and therefore work. See <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=86325#86325" target="_blank">here</a> for the test code. If somebody confirms that the fix works for non flashme'd DSs (my DS is flashme'd so I cannot test it myself) then I will release a new version.

Then my DS lite will arrive (or well, the rease dat is then anyway).

I was wondering if MightMax's bootloader could be booted via wifi (by adding the RSA signature)?
<br/>
So it really is a question if it can be done, if someone wants to do it.
<br/>
I can understand people not wanting to do this "in the open" but if someone has done this (or is willing to do this) could you PM me?

It would greatly help me (and I am sure many others) flash my DS lite (I don't have a passme2 or a nopass).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
