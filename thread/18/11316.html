    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, I know what you're talking about. I think it would be easiest to just examine how the loader works and then bypass it with default settings. A lot of the stuff the WinROTT loader does isn't necessary/applicable on the DS. Once you've bypassed it you'll probably need to comment out the loader code in order to allow compiliation to proceed...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
