Unfortunately I don't have a DS to listen to the music and effects and everything else in the actual game. Would anyone be willing to record some sound clips of the game for me. Music would be good as well as sound effects. Just using a microphon on their computer and holding the DS close would probally work for me.

<br/>
Or if someone already knows what format the sound is in that would help too.

Yes I do hear the sound. There's a couple different files.  One for background music, one for sound effects some other one. The sound effects file is all the sound effects appended one after another. Because it's some sort of raw format I think, there's no header or anything like that. I can open it up at certain bitrates and hear music but I would like something as a reference to try to determine, what sample rate it might be at and if it's compressed and things like that.
<br/>
<br/>
So is anyone willing to provide me some sound clips?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also it seems a pretty low sample rate.   I wouldnt be surprised if they are even 8bit samples rather than 16bit, though id expect you have figured that by now if you opened the files.  I doubt the sample rate is higher than 22Khz and possibly lower as the sound in Metroid is rather low quality.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

<br/>
btw -- where are the sounds located at in the metroid dump?  are they in one of the files in the filesystem portion of the cart?  or are they stored someplace else?<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lets hope someone manages to dump Mario as it seems to have much better sound quality than Metroid so might give us some clues to what the DS can do audio wise.  I think Mario might even have better sound than the N64 version, but thats just a wild guess as I only ever heard Mario 64 under emulation.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

Though it's some really quite nice 8-bit sound. Stereo speakers have never sounded better.

Pretty sure it could support 16-bit sound, although whether or not it actually used them for samples (to save on cartridge space) is debatable.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Super NES, PlayStation, N64, and PS2 games use 4-bit sound to save memory, except 4-bit doesn't sound as bad as you'd think given that the hardware does ADPCM decoding (dynamic range expansion followed by a low-pass filter) on the samples to cover up the extra noise that 4-bit quantization introduces. See a similar technique at work in the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#8ad" target="_blank">8ad codec</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Why do they find it so hard to do good 8 bit sound?  
<br/>
The Amiga used 800k floppies and had some of the best 8 bit sound EVER!
<br/>
<br/>
Surely as carts are much bigger than that they could include a perfectly good game and good sound on it?  Are the modern systems SO badly designed?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using 4 bit ADPCM samples is not the same as 4 bit sound!
<br/>
<br/>
The 4 bits are used to determine the rate of change from the previous sample in 16-bit space, using a dynamic scale table based on the previous samples. Look up ADPCM for more details. It's quite easy to implement in hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By my definition of "4-bit sound", MP3 at 128 kbps encoded from CDDA is roughly 1.45-bit.

<br/>
No, the modern <span style="font-style: italic">players</span> are badly designed. Back in Amiga days, games could get away with using a chiptune in .mid or .mod format. Today, players consider music using tightly looped samples to sound "outdated", instead expecting a major-studio-quality recording of a performance by live human beings, such as the soundtrack of any Tony Hawk or Dance Dance Revolution game for any PlayStation game console.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
