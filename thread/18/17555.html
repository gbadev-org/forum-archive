    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to the community.  I have over 20+ years doing all kinds of software arch/dev.  Mainly backend server stuff (i.e. java, .net, COM, C++), but no embedded or game development.  
<br/>
<br/>
My son is now very interested in creating his own maps/courses for Mario Kart DS [and possibly the Wii].
<br/>
<br/>
First off - is it possible to create your own maps/course for Mario Kart DS?  If so, how do we start?  What are the tools and platform for this stuff (i.e. Ubuntu or Windows), and do they include an emulator for trying out the mods before downloading to the DS? 
<br/>
<br/>
On the Wii side of things - I guess I have the same questions.  If this isn't a good place to post this question, if you can direct me to the best Wii dev forums, that'd be great.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI.  It's probably possible -- there are whole communities based on ROM hacking, where you take a game ROM, and modify it using hex editors and other tools, then play the modified version.
<br/>
<br/>
But because this is generally done with illegally acquired ROMs, it's beyond the scope of this forum, and something that we'd encourage you to look/ask elsewhere about.  Googling for Rom hacking will get you started.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's been a Mario Kart DS course editor released recently. I'll come back here when I've found the link...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : it's a course MODIFIER. I'm not sure if you can create a level from scratch.

Anyway, creating a map would be quite hard. It would involve different skills, starting with 3D modeling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
