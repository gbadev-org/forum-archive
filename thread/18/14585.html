    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as i have been learning visual basic at college, and have recently started to learn C++ to "try" and make some of my own programs for the DS. i was wondering if i could use VB instead of C++ for homebrew (would make things much easier and less confusing for me). can this be done? and if so,do i need any additional programs?
<br/>
ive been using devkitpro and PAlib.

thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by jay001 on Wed Nov 28, 2007 5:57 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

That should be enough to get you started. Do not use Lua or Python for any full-on game development as those projects have a small, if any, developer following when it comes to the DS. If you want to get the most out of any help, learning C/C++ will help you a lot. Also, do not be tempted by PAlib as you will soon find that it will hurt more than help your learning experience.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't agree with you, PALib is really great for beginners, when you comes to do programming on the DS, at start you don't want to bother with the whole set up and low level function. There's already plenty to learn before on the way to adapt games on such hardware, like working with bg/sprites and limited memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you got the basics, you can take a look further and start getting your hands right in the hardware, but doing so first it may be disappointing and frustrating.
<br/>
<br/>
For my own experience I started with PALib, and I did Warcraft Tower Defense with it, then I moved to libnds and did the EFSLib, and now I'm making a full 3D game and a sound library which will be released soon ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your c/c++ learning!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't used HAMlib, was it really as badly designed &amp; coded as PALib?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
