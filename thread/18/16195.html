    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if flashme loads homebrew and official games the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
1) does it look at the header to know if it runs homebrew code ? and if so, what information is used to find that it is homebrew code ?
<br/>
<br/>
2) if so, could someone explain me (shortly) what changes during the start of both types of games ?
<br/>
<br/>
thank you !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Flashme does not load official games. It only loads homebrew. If there is no cart with homebrew in slot-2, it then just passes control to the normal firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically if the space in slot-2 normally reserved for a GBA game's maker code is equal to PASS, then it will boot it as homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
As a completely separate thing from the above, it also removes rsa signature check during Download Play (WMB).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
