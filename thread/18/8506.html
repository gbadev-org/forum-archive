Unless someone presents something else you'd have to resort to DOSBox.
<br/>
Otherwise there is raw2c, bmp2bin, bmp2c and bin2s included in Devkitpro. Actually i think bmp2c isn't, i think i found it somewhere (maybe it's DF's?).
<br/>
The GIMP Scripts (http://www.dspassme.com/programmers_guide/gimpPlugins.tar.bz2) looked promising but i can't find an old enough version of GIMP.
<br/>
What i really want is PCX2sprite and PCX2gba, but the source doesn't seem to be anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Also anyone point me to any easy to understand tutorials on creating, converting and using graphics on GBA/DS? I haven't found a single one that explains everything (like what picture format, what size, how many colors, what flags to use with bmp2c, how to use the graphics on the DS (well i've seen tutorials that tell you that)) . Then maybe i can find a way without using these tools.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any others that people can suggest?

Allegro should build under OSX (and am trying now)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

tepples: I've installed allegro-4.2.0, and I can build bmp2tiles, but I cannot run it.  There is a problem linking it with the library, not a problem with your code (since it compiles cleanly).  I'll post info if I can get it working.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: is it possible that your code works only with 4.0 and not 4.2.0?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by SeanMon on Sun Feb 12, 2006 12:32 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
