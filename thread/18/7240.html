I've noticed a few moans here and there in the forums about libnds and devkitARM which on occasion I only see by chance or someone is kind enough to point me to a specific post. When bugs are reported via the mailing list or tracker they are fixed as soon as possible. When they're reported as a reply to some topic which may not even be related to a compiler or library issue then they tend to be missed.
<br/>
<br/>
For the best chance of getting bug reports to the devkitPro team please use the tracker, mailing list or reply to the threads in Announcements and Comments.
