    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my my they sure put some effort into what seems a very generous offering
<br/>
<br/>
XSI 6 ModTool
<br/>
supporting Python, Jscript, to Visual Basic, to C++, C# and .NET
<br/>
<br/>
It lets you install and even write and comiple plugins from within the app. How much can you give away before crossing aline.
<br/>
Collada, Milkshape, 3ds script and plugins already exist. not to mention lightwave and obj export out of the box.

Sadly this is Windows only.
<br/>
There is a commercial version availiable for Linux. Nothing for Mac.
<br/>
If they're as smart as they used to be,...then that's what they're working on.
<br/>
<br/>
With autodesk having long abandoned their '<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmax" target="_blank">gmax</a>' - 3dsmax light version, I think this offering shines as current state of the art freeware for 3D content generation.
<br/>
Texture filtering still can't be disabled [as in say Maya or any other package!] argh. i.e.: No fancy low tech DS preview :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
