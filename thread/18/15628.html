    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I've just bought a DS and an M3 Real card so I can play with doing some homebrew stuff. I am a newbie to coding for the DS itself, but am an experienced ARM coder.
<br/>
<br/>
I installed DevKitPro/ARM over the weekend, and built myself libmad and scummvm - that all seems to be working OK.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I might start off with getting a feel for the system by applying myself to various apps/libs etc to see if I could speed them up.
<br/>
<br/>
Moon shell looks like a prime candidate. Apparently it runs video at 20fps fullscreen, and 24fps widescreen. If I could tweak that a bit to make it run faster, then that'd be worthwhile, especially for PAL video that is natively 50fps (so 25fps would be a much nicer rate than 24 or 20).
<br/>
<br/>
So I downloaded the moonshell 1.71 sources, but can't for the life of me see how to go about building them. I might be blind, but I can't spot any Makefiles...
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here have any experience with building this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>

Moonshell is more where my interest lies though - I have a background in audio/video/graphics on ARM platforms :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately you're going to have a lot of trouble building either Moonshell or DSO from source. Both of them use older versions of devkitARM which are no longer supported. I believe the Moonshell author recently shifted to a commercial ARM compiler too.

You'll probably be much better looking at Chishm's TunaViDS - <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14720" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14720</a><br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

That's very interesting, and I shall certainly look into it. Thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From my understanding, for Moonshell v1.7x Moonlight switched to the 30 day trial of the ARM SDT to make some necessary optimizations to squeeze a bit more performance out of the DS.  After the trial ended, he no longer had a way to compile it, hence why the core of Moonshell has not changed in months.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
