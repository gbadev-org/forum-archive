    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been visiting mod gods, dslinux, and most ds modding sites for about a week now and i understand that there is a device called PassMe and another one called WiFiMe and that these are for homebrew games and such.  I have MANY questions to ask about all of this because i am completely lost.
<br/>
<br/>
1.I have a EZF Advance Realtime 256mb flash cart, does this work with PassMe and WiFiMe?
<br/>
2.How do you buy a WiFiMe? I thought it was a hack.
<br/>
3.Which one is better,PassMe or WiFiMe?
<br/>
4.Is there any type of modification AT ALL that needs to be made to my flash cart?  If so, please walk me through it.
<br/>
5.Once you load the homebrew games into the ds, are they saved or do you have to do this process every time?
<br/>
6.Does my 802.11g router work with WiFiMe or do I HAVE to buy a PCI card?
<br/>
7.If so, what is the cheapest I can get for a compatable card AND the needed chipset?
<br/>
8.Do you need to be next to the PCI card with computer when you are playing or can you load it and leave?
<br/>
9.Do these inventions open up the possibilities for the suff I have been dreaming of?(Snes emulator, Internet Browser)
<br/>
10.Step by step, how do I play these homebrew games?
<br/>
11.How do I make one?
<br/>
<br/>
Whew, that should do it.  Im sorry if this is alot of questions but I am very clueless to how this works and I really wanna try it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1 I think it works yeah
<br/>
2 It's software, you download it -- for free
<br/>
3 They both have up- and downsides. I would like to refer you to Tim's WiFiMe for a list I think Darkfader or Darkain made
<br/>
4 No
<br/>
5 They're on the GBA flashcard for all i know, however I believe you do need to reload 'em everytime...
<br/>
<br/>
Egh I'm gonna quit. You can seriously find a whole lot of things by reading the PassMe and WiFiMe threads... You will eventually need to understand these things. Cause as of the now we're in a place where things aren't just being placed there with a USB cable and presented with a nice menu... Maybe someone else is willing to finish the list..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It's a hacked driver for yor PC and an application that signals your DS throgh WiFi to load code from the GBA port. It's not commercial, you can download it for free.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">3.Which one is better,PassMe or WiFiMe?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
That depends on your situation. Do you have a WLAN card that's compatible with WiFiMe? If so, it's probably better to download WiFiMe instead of ordering a PassMe card. 
<br/>

<br/>
No. You can use your cart as-is.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">5.Once you load the homebrew games into the ds, are they saved or do you have to do this process every time?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
With PassMe, you load your games from the GBA cart each time you turn the power on. With WiFiMe, the game is obviously only loaded from the cart when you signal the DS to do so from your PC. Turning off the DS' power requires your to repeat the process.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Routers don't work with the hack, for obvious reasons.
<br/>
You'll have to buy a PCI card if you want to use WiFiMe as it's primarily a hacked PCI driver.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">7.If so, what is the cheapest I can get for a compatable card AND the needed chipset?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Check out the list of compatible cards <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a> and the WiFiMe FAQ <a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php#faq" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php#faq</a> . You can get a cheap card for as low as 22 bucks.

<br/>
Probably not untill we figure out more about the DS's hardware. Currently, we can't access the WiFi hardware from the DS' side, and we don't have decent sound support AFAIK.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">10.Step by step, how do I play these homebrew games?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
1. Place homebrew game on flashcart using tools supplied with cart.
<br/>
2. Plug flashcart into GBA slot.
<br/>
3. With PassMe: Plug PassMe in DS, plug Metroid Demo in PassMe, switch power on. With WiFiMe: Install WiFi me and run it. Then select Download Play on DS and game will start.

<br/>
If you have to ask, you're years of studying programming languages and techniques away from actually making one.
<br/>
DS development is not how you'd start your programming carreer in the first place. The current state of the DS dev scene is strictly for expert, veteran computer programmers with lots of experience coding for other hardware. I suggest starting out learing how to program for Windows first. 
<br/>
Writing something simple for the DS still requires lots of knowledge of the underlying hardware at this point, and some current ways of doing things are not exactly novice friendly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You might be able to get one for $25 these days. CompUSA in Connecticut just sold some at that price this week, as a raw price cut. Don't spend more than $40 anyway. You probably have your pick of normal sales and $40/50 cards with $20 rebates.
<br/>
<br/>
If your chosen card from the list has a version number (i.e., v3 or v4) pay close attention to this. The same model Linksys WMP54G has different chipsets between a version 3 and a version 4, where you want a v4 in this case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can't program and have very little knowledge about computing hardware? Why do you want all this stuff?

<br/>
You're aware that you can't run commercial game ROMs through PassMe and WiFiMe aren't you?

As has already been said, DS programming is not easy. I've been coding since I was a kid and on a huge number of different platforms; and at many points I'm still scratching my head wondering how to get things working. It is definately not the machine for newbies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As for the Encore cards, the compatibility list doesn't mention anything about versions so you should be fine getting it. NewEgg's link: <a href="http://www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=33-180-007&amp;DEPA=0" target="_blank">http://www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=33-180-007&amp;DEPA=0</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Rinkwraith has a point. I just starting to do my own apps and it's no easy thing. Knowing C++ isn't sufficient one bit, I would be lost if I wasn't taking computer architecture right now.
<br/>
<br/>
marco might be in it for the cool factor, which is certainly there. To justify your investment though, you need to be able to do <span style="font-style: italic">something</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you do 2d/3d graphics? Then you could contribute to other projects and have a good reason to run homebrew apps.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to just play demos and games other people write? Then you could work as a tester. If you want certain apps to come out like NES emulators or Internet browsers, you can indirectly help that happen by assisting other developers in testing their code on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking at first that if you can't make your own, don't bother with homebrew at all. After some thought, there's some things that anyone can do. If everyone in the homebrew community was a developer, that's fine, but it's always a good thing to have testers and, imagine this, end-users.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
