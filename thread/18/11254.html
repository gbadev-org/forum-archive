    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a couple of versions:
<br/>
<br/>
gba_nds_fat
<br/>
chishm's original fat library, works alright with many devices.
<br/>
<br/>
Varios gba_nds_fat modifications
<br/>
There are a couple of modifications, like Rein. They generally support more devices than gba_nds_fat, but are probably more hacky and less tested.
<br/>
<br/>
libfat
<br/>
This is the latest version by chishm. It's the only thing he maintains, so even though it may not support all devices, it probably will in the future. It's using a better code structure than gba_nds_fat with modifications, and is generally superior. But, it has one drawback! You can not list the contents of a directory with it. In future versions, this will be included.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I use libfat, and I suggest you do the same.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This drawback, along with the lack of any information as to when "future versions" may appear, is probably the biggest reason why developers stick with gba_nds_fat.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Not quite. gba_nds_fat works too, but libfat <span style="font-weight: bold">requires</span> DKP r19<span style="font-weight: bold">b</span> (or higher) to function correctly (r19a had a bug in it).

The next version (which will support directory listing) is scheduled to be released with DKP r20. You'll have to bug WinterMute about the specific time frame.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I recently had the same wondering and it seems that the Rein hacked version is the most compatible one at the moment:

Actually, last I checked the rein one had a bug where you cannot enable both SC:SD and SC:CF at the same time. I believe there is a slightly newer version which was created by WinterMute(?) floating around, which  has the bugs fixed,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

libfat includes drivers for:
<br/>
gbamp
<br/>
m3 cf,sd
<br/>
sc cf,sd
<br/>
neoflash mk2/3
<br/>
FCSR
<br/>
EFA2
<br/>
maxmedia dock cf
<br/>
ninjads sd
<br/>
<br/>
I know for sure sc sd/cf, and gbamp are working, but I haven't personally tested the others (though i'm pretty sure m3 cf/sd, and neoflash mk2/3 are  also working)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
