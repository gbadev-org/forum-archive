    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on learning everything that I need to know to get started programming for the DS for the last two weeks. Tonight I wrote my first lines of DS homebrew code, and I've run into a problem regarding graphics files. Thus far, I've been unable to link any graphics files into my programs. I've tried using GraphicConverter for OSX to save as a byte-array and then use hConvert to convert them into .bin files, but I can't get them to link. Are there any special steps required in getting them to work?
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't had any problems creating my own tiles using something like this-&gt;</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">u8 myTile[64] = {
<br/>
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
<br/>
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
<br/>
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
<br/>
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
<br/>
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
<br/>
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
<br/>
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
<br/>
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 };</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and then drawing them to the screen using colors manually specified by the BG_PALETTE[1] = RGB15(what ever color I want) command. Coming from coding PSP homebrew, the DS is a huge change. I always liked programming 2D games and the PSP was a bit of a bear to use to make 2D games since it has 3D hardware. The DS is the first system that I've used that has 2D hardware, and I LOVE IT thus far. It's almost like cheating compared to the PSP stuff.

Thanks in advance,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check out the <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=159894" target="_blank">nds examples pack</a>, there's plenty of good graphics examples, including how to include .bin files to your project. In short you need to define in the makefile how binary files are handled - pretty much all the examples use directory called "data" for this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried using the makefiles for several of the 2d examples, but nothing would work. I'll take another look into it this afternoon and see if I can figure it out. I didn't have any problems linking in raw audio files, though; so I'm not sure exactly where the problem lies.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll post back if I can't figure it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should get into the habit of not linking .bin files directly into your project. It is wasting good ram with a permanent copy of data whose true place lies elsewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, you can malloc the memory when needed, read the files from disk using libfat, then free the memory afterwards. No ram wasted.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
