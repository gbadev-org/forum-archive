PALib is one of the worst libraries I've ever seen (that's including my own crap code). For a long time it was incompatible with the current versions of devkitARM that you had to use an old and buggy version that's not supported any more (more information <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.devkitpro.org/index.php/PAlib" target="_blank">here</a>).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that PAlib is bad, it's just that 9 times out of 10 you need to use an older version of the toolchain that may not work at all with the changes to the way that the homebrew menu works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Installing old and unsupported versions of the devkitPro tools and libraries in order to use something of dubious benefit is a recipe for disaster. PALib is *not* supported by devkitPro.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Yes, yes I am lieing and trying to save peoples feelings, but you have to admit that there are some good parts to PAlib, if you look hard enough, long enough and are ignoring the crap coding, there's some parts of the system that are nice...

I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE THIS POLITE ALL THE TIME - PALIB IS SHITE WITH A CAPITAL SHITE.....

What development IDE environment have you got set up to code your home brew projects and did you set it up ?
<br/>
<br/>
If you take Palib out of the equation for developing home brews does that mean alot less functionality in projects?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#172915 - wintermute - Thu Mar 11, 2010 3:39 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Taking PALib out of the equation actually means more functionality in your projects. Quite a lot of the functions in PALib are either just PA_ named wrappers for other libraries - libnds, dswifi, libfat, helix, an old GBA jpeg decoder, libgif to name a few. Their examples are also using a template from several years ago which can, and often does, make it difficult to compile them with recent tools - assuming they've been rewritten to stop using libnds internals which were removed a long time ago.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as IDEs go, there's Programmer's Notepad that's installed by the windows installer but we have plans to go with CodeLite in the near future since it works on all 3 primary platforms. 
<br/>
<br/>
The windows installer also installs a bunch of examples for DS, each example has a .pnproj file which you can doubleclick in order to launch PN2 with the example loaded - copy the template folder from examples/nds/arm9 to a new folder (without spaces in it's path). From there you can edit the code in template.c then click Tools-&gt;make or use the ALT 1 key compo to build your app.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Neither., the easiest to use is libnds.
<br/>
<br/>
PAlib is crap (or as I like to think it's the carp from Dwarf Fortress)

and ndslib no longer exists, it was deprecated a few years ago</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Err...
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://libnds.devkitpro.org" target="_blank">http://libnds.devkitpro.org</a> - the API docs
<br/>
<br/>
as for tutorials, there is none that are upto date as all the tutorials are about 1-2 years old :(.  I know WinterMute is wanting someone to help out in this area, but preferably someone that knows how libnds works.  Dovoto is also working on something to do with tutorials / video presentations (basically something like the Stanford iPhone dev tutorials) but I don't know how far he got with them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Patater's manual is worth a read, I'm not entirely sure how up to date it is but it should be recent enough to not cause too many problems.

For more advanced and in depth topics there's <a href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm" target="_blank">http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm</a> which covers a lot of GBA features. This is a good grounding for the DS 2D hardware. Can be a little scary if you're just starting out.
