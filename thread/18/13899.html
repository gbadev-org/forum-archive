    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I just made my first C++ program and still have three books to read before i'll be able to program games.  But, i'm already starting to think ahead  on what my first DS homebrew game will be.  Well, getting to the point, what languages does the DS support.  I know there's DSLua, but is there a program that lets you code in C++?  Do I even need a program to code in C++?  And what game engines does Nintendo DS support?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS hardware is much like a game engine itself. You program in C/C++/Assembly and compile the code using DevKitPro (of which DevKitARM and libnds are parts of).
<br/>
<br/>
The best way to get a project started is to install DevKitPro and download the example package that includes <span style="font-weight: bold">template projects</span> that you can use as starting point for your own projects.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS supports any language which can be compiled into ARM code, which C/C++ can via the compiler provided with the devkitPro package (devkitARM). The Nintendo DS does not support any game engine, unless you would like to write one.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, just to prepare you, don't think that reading books will teach you how to program. Theory is nice, but it is inherently worthless without practice.<br/>_________________<br/>- relpats_eht</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Motivation is good but the same cannot be said for arrogance.
<br/>
<br/>
I taught myself C++ at thirteen with nothing more than header files and a short list of syntax--no books, no tutorials, no forums, no help--in a month and by fourteen I considered myself an expert at all things even remotely related to programming. Now, years of programming later, I barely consider myself qualified on the subject.
<br/>
<br/>
All I am trying to tell you is that if you are just starting, you have a long way to go before you can produce anything of quality. Keep up the motivation, but keep in mind your inexperience. There is much more to making a game than four books could ever teach you. Be prepared for bugs that seem to defy the laws of computing, problems that seem completely unsolvable, and segments of code that seem possessed by demons.
<br/>
<br/>
For starters, throw out that CD. Dev C++ is a very old and very buggy IDE. You will want to use something more recent, such as Code::Blocks or Visual C++ (which also comes free in beta and express editions).<br/>_________________<br/>- relpats_eht</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NeX, even if you don't like books, you should read up on design patterns some day. (I also learned mostly without books, with the exception of a Python book and a C++ book, but I think they can be pretty helpful to give an extra bit of surety to what you are doing). I'm sure you've had those programming encounters where you kind of doubt that the way you are doing things is "the right way", since programming is so open ended. It's always helpful to see that there is a name for the odd technique you end up using.
<br/>
<br/>
As for motivation vs. arrogance, I think it's rather interesting how that works. I started off thinking I knew everything, but as I dig deeper I realize just how little I know, which encourages me (for one) to keep learning. There is a point where you realize your own inability in 99% of the field, and consider that a good thing; like design patterns, it is a realization that you <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> on the right track rather than "cheating" by accident ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

It's a funny thing you mention this, though in my case I found that learning to program (like everyone advised me years ago) has actually killed my interest in game development. I used to be full of ideas and fantasy stories. Now I'm just a mediocre amateur programmer.

It came to the point for me that i want to quit my job.

As for reading - you wouldn't raid too far if you have had to invent everything  starting from the wheel invention.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

I can relate to that experience.  I think there is a simple trap that can fallen into when making the transition from wanting to make games to coding them yourself.  You go from only thinking big ideas about neat game systems, stories, etc, to instead only thinking about how to implement code and data structures, how to optimize it, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Both the design and the programming aspects require creativity, but in very different ways.  To do both it requires the ability to take off and put on different mental hats at different times.  My general rule of thumb is to not try to do more than one on a particular day.  I find that getting away from the computer when thinking about design can be helpful too.
<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents- hopefully this is a helpful word of caution for the prospective game programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
