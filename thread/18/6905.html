    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having a bit of a problem with running homebrew code. I want to start development but can't seem to get anything to run.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got everything compiling and working. I started with doublec's tutorials, which when compiled and sent to the DS via WMB.exe crash with a corrupted logo as it fades to white. The .nds files from the site also crash in the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
Desktopman's nibbles and tetris also crash in the same way, as the Nintendo logo fades to white.
<br/>
<br/>
The Polarium demo runs fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I've downloaded all the software today - driver, devkitpro, examples, code, libs, everything.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any pointers? Sorry if this is in the wrong forum BTW.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds like you are using WMB like the following:
<br/>
<br/>
  wmb -data demo1.nds
<br/>
<br/>
Whereas you should be doing:
<br/>
<br/>
  wmb -data wifime
<br/>
<br/>
Or something like that. To directly send an .nds file it must be signed and no homebrew program is signed. Instead you use 'wifime' which sends a signed file which then runs the homebrew you have stored on your flash cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you could put a new firmware on your DS which would then not check to see if it is signed, and allow running homebrew programs directly.
<br/>
<br/>
If none of that sounds like your problem we'd need to know more details. Are you using a flash cartridge, what type of DS do you have, is your firmware flashed, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awesome, thanks. That's exactly the problem. I didn't know about the signed part.
<br/>
<br/>
I bought a flash cart but I don't think it's a useable one (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.efa.cc" target="_blank">www.efa.cc</a>), so I'll look into the firmware thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have EFA cart and everything works perfect - just flash ds.gba file to cart (without menu) and start "wmb -data wifime"<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im curious, how did wifime get signed?  I always thought wireless didnt need to be signed at all, I did wonder why FlashME claimed to do just that when I thought it already acted that way.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WiFiMe got signed because it's just Super Mario 64 DS, which is signed, with a few header changes. It appears that the Nintendo DS official firmware doesn't verify RSA on the header, only on the data.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem initially because I had flashed my DS before the second flash became availible. Make sure you are using the lastest bios update.
<br/>
<br/>
Also are you definitely uploading the *.gba files to flash and only one at a time? This could cause this too.
