    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to have a connection set up in your Nintendo Wifi Connection settings in order for Beup to connect.
<br/>
<br/>
You can do this by setting up any WFC compatible game for online play, or by using FWNITRO (I've never got this to work, personally).<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
