    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm following along with the small updates of DS reverse engineering, but I don't think anyone has really been able to put some kind of answer on how the DS communicates to find other DS's or computing systems which will provide it with software.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS obviously sniffs for other machines which are emitting a signal for it; does anyone know anything about the signals? Or am I barking up the wrong tree here..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, I am barking up the wrong tree. Heh, I'm just thinking aloud though. It's the fact the DS sniff's for a signal that makes me wonder if its possible to broadcast a fake-signal that the DS could respond to... then I saw the, "Cracking the DS wifi" thread. :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FriedChicken I i belive your correct, but the only problem with that is with every body trying to crack the  pictoChat thing im sure it will only make things more difficult to crack. Also i understand why they do it because it would only interfere in places with high wireless activity(ex. Los Angelos?). But if there planing to go there im sure they'll need way more freqs. to contain the signal.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://img159.exs.cx/my.php?loc=img159&amp;image=jasn2mo.jpg" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://img159.exs.cx/img159/3901/jasn2mo.th.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
