He also sez no to SNES DS because it would be time consuming.

Further along...yes.

More advanced...not even close.

DS needs way more optimization than a PSP equivalent.

I was under the impression that an official firmware could reflash the DS without having to short the pads, assuming the official firmware didn?t need to write to the very beginning of the EEPROM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I thought I read something today that said they cracked the US PSP units... not sure if it was just the first batch, but I'm pretty sure that now at least it's not only japanese first batch.

<br/>
<br/>
There are three possibilities for emulating the GB layers on GBA or DS hardware: <ul><li>Text mode. This cannot be stretched horizontally. </li><li>Rotation mode. Good luck fitting everything into VRAM, and if you try GBC emulation, good luck finding enough layers, as you'll need some extra layers for mixing the GBC's different model of tile background colors with the sprite priority bit. </li><li>Bitmap mode with software rasterization. Good luck getting this to run anywhere near real time. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
