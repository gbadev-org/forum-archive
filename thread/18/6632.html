    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What sort of lists will run well on the DS? I was thinking of using a vector list to store some data in my program, but don't know how fast it'll be, would a linked list be a better idea?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends entirely on the problem, none of them are 'better' for the DS.

<br/>
Linked lists are good if you need to insert/remove elements frequently, but you have to traverse the list to access any particular one.
<br/>
<br/>
Vectors are good if you need random access, and don't know how big your list will get. Bad if you need to remove/insert things in the middle of the list.
<br/>
<br/>
Static arrays are best if you know ahead of time the maximum number of elements you can have.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, I know about their advantages, I just wasn't sure on how well any of them work with the DS so was just wondering what peoples experiences were.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to access the list quickly, but it does need to be dynamic so I'm going to try a vector list and see how it goes, I may implement a linked list too and try to test the speed some how</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Vectors are like C arrays.
<br/>
<br/>
Each element of a linked list is a separate object, with a pointer to the data and a pointer to the next element of the list.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
