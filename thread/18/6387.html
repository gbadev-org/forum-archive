    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have somone made a program for the wifi pass me that can broadcasts song in the same manner as Band Brothers. As well as recieve and share with others? That would be a great thing. And people would love it. ^^
<br/>
<br/>
I could help out as much as I can if someone tries to do this. &gt;_&lt; I'm not that knowledgeable in this area.
<br/>
<br/>
I also want the songs broadcasted from the JP Download Centres. The song from the PDF format takes 3 hours to input if it is long and as of now you have to meet people you want to share the songs with. =(
<br/>
<br/>
REQUEST!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure that anyone's cooked up a program like you describe
<br/>
it shouldn't be too hard to brodcast them using the wmb server &amp; firefly's
<br/>
tools but you'd need to have them captured in nds format,
<br/>

for the only bb specific software there's the bandbros music editor by

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, cool. But it would be fun with a easy program that just let you share it wireless to and from the computer. Though it may be not so fun if you already have another working way. ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
