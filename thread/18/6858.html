    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried out a Visual Studio .NET <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/ds_project_template.zip" target="_blank">Template</a> designed to be used with devkitPro, but I can't get it to compile with the latest version of devkitPro. Has anyone been successful at this? If so, could you give me some tips on how to get it to build?
<br/>
<br/>
For reference, I just installed devkitPro updated 1.0.7 (1.0.8 was just released as I type. Could this help fix the problem?), and devkitPro builds successfully via the command prompt. Could the template project just not have the directories properly setup with the latest version of devkitPro?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for the help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just so I know, are there any other Visual Studio .NET templates available, or are most people using other IDEs? I noticed in Dovoto's tutorials, he recommends .NET.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Start with the default template, copy it to the name of your new
<br/>
project, and create a new VS project in that directory. Choose a
<br/>
makefile project. Then make a couple of .bat files, build, rebuild, and clean.
<br/>
Put "make" in the build one, "make clean(new line)make" in rebuild
<br/>
and "make clean" in the clean one. Now look around in visual studio
<br/>
for a place where you can assign commands to the different tasks.
<br/>
You can also make the ! run your program in an emulator, or over wmb
<br/>
if you have that.
<br/>
<br/>
I had some problems with PATH, but I think I solved it by putting
<br/>
'set PATH="(whatever-my-path-is-which-there-are-many-ways-to-find-out)"'
<br/>
in my .bat's.
<br/>
<br/>
Just tweak it 'til it works. :)<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
