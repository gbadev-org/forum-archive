<br/>
(Unless anyone can recommend me a high quality notebook for less than $2000 australian . ..  US$1500ish) It has to be of good quality since it will also be being used for audio production, needs to have good connections on motherboard to the usb&amp;firewire ports, etc... which is why im avoiding something cheap like a dell... I've been told the only really decent brands are toshiba, sony &amp; apple. . and only one offers me student discount :D
<br/>
<br/>
anyway I'm just wondering if anyone is making stuff for gba/ds on macs? I guess I could dual boot with windows but i would rather not bother.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've recently ended up with an iMac myself, after my last computer melted.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't actually set up the toolchain yet for doing GBA/NDS development, but given that MacOS X is BSD based, and they provide the gnu toolchain /with/ the machine (even if you have to install it yourself)..
<br/>
<br/>
I can't imagine that it would be too difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
Worst case scenario, if you can't stand the BSDish environment, you could pick up Parallels.. Lets you install WinXP in a virtual machine, and there you go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Plenty of people, including myself, use the Mac for GBA and DS development. Just go to the devkitpro site and grab the installer they provide and you're set as long as you're willing to use the simple command line tools. With a tiny bit of effort you can build in XCode, and even directly launch the product into a GBA emulator from there, but there isn't a decent DS emulator yet, you'll have to use hardware for that.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, try the search feature here and you'll find lots of information.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm currently considering an imac, partially due to it having a video card worth at least *something* (even though its not amazing), and also a big plus is the fact that unlike the macbooks it has a socket for the CPU so i can change it out for a high spec merom one day when i need a bit of extra kick.
<br/>
<br/>
other options are:
<br/>
<br/>
macbook (sh*t video, no upgradeable processor)
<br/>
<br/>
or
<br/>
<br/>
mac mini (sh*t video, but upgradeable to core 2 duo at some point, very cheap)
<br/>
<br/>
I really love the macbooks its just a shame that you have to jump by over $1000 (AUS) to get a decent video card in one. not having socketed processors hurts too for future-proofing... then again they should have core 2s by next month hopefullt :D will have to wait &amp; see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I used to use wifime and given the right setup it was relatively painless. I have a gba cart with USB link, but it is pain in the ass to use since it require the cart to be removed before I can update it.

There's no reason for desmume to not work on an x86-based Mac.  The issue with desmume is that it has endianness problems on PPC.
<br/>
<br/>
Grab SDL or Gtk from fink or darwinports and give desmume a try and let us know how it goes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm using these days more flashcards than wmb/wireless transfers - especially with larger files it's more convenient to copy a file to CF/SD card and switch it to M3/SC/adapter of your choice. While debugging and testing the continuous card exchanging does start to annoy you after a while, though. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
