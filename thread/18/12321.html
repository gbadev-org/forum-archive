    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yesterday I did a update to newest toolkit. after that I tried to compile this fatlib and got an error in this RTC functions (read date/time). the struct doesn't include member 'time'.
<br/>
<br/>
after replacing this code with return 0 it runs fine. current toolkit seems to have a missing or older RTC support??

@Chishm

<br/>
thanks for releasing this new libfat!!
<br/>
<br/>
now I have implemented this missing io-driver (for R4, G6, Simply, EZ, MPSD ...) in your code and it is running fine. is there a chance you insert this into your standard libfat?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The RTC time should be in the latest libnds. Wintermute did that for C99 support. I have frozen the IO interface as of 2006-12-25 (release day of DLDI). One reason for DLDI is so that I don't have to keep updating libfat with the newest drivers, and no one else needs to update their code to the latest version to support a new device.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DLDI is a very good idea to support new devices. but I think it would be comfortable to have most of the existing io-intefaces within the code. it's only a few kb more code ...
<br/>
<br/>
I would do the job for integrating new io_driver into current libfat release.

<br/>
another idea:
<br/>
<br/>
a DLDI patcher for each card would be nice. for example if you have a R4 card, you only have to copy DLDI able homebrew to the card. after this you start the patcher application (dldi_r4.nds) and it would search for unpatched DLDI software and patch it for R4.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
