    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The MOD format has a "goto" command (Bxx). Is it that your MOD player is ignoring "goto" commands? (This is more common among players with a playlist feature so that they don't get hung up on a single file for a half hour.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
I had no idea, thankyou.
<br/>
<br/>
How can I set this in an existing mod file?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Protracker-modules are looping by nature. They contain a field of where in the order-table to jump once the end of the order-table has been reached. If a player doesn't listen to this field, then it's either broken or there's an option for disabling it (due to playlists as tepples pointed out). There should be no need for any jump-commands.
<br/>
<br/>
For us to be able to help you with looping with code, we need to know more about the context. For starters, how do you playback the module in the first place?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
From what you're using the simple solution is to edit the file using a tracker like MPT, or Milkytracker, or any other tracker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
