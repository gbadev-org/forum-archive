    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just curious what IDE people are using.  I suppose this is a general question but I'm more curious in your IDE of choice for NDS development.
<br/>
<br/>
I recently got interested in NDS homebrew...I have had some GBA experience in the past as well as many years of C and C++ programming experience.  I went and got devkitARM with the ndslib...but using Programmers Notepad is a nightmare!!  I'm also not a huge fan of coding in one environment and then switching to commandline to make.
<br/>
<br/>
I attempted <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coderjoe.net/archive/2007/07/30/using-devkitarm-and-libnds-with-visual-studio-2005/" target="_blank">this article</a> in order to get VS2008 to work, but I had no success.  The article is for VS2005, but I hoped it would be about the same.  I can use VS to compile and check for syntax errors, but it won't produce the .nds for me and it doesn't seem to care much about linking since it doesn't complain about false .h includes.  I still have to go to command line and "make" if I want a .nds file.
<br/>
<br/>
So what IDE are you all using and did you use a tutorial to make it compile for you?  I'd be interested in using VisualHAM if VS2008 is a no-go.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the time!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did a bit of research on Code::Blocks.  I like it I think, but i'm curious as to how the debugging works.  I know the way I have VS set up I get full intellisense and full compile support, but I have no way of debugging.  If I wanted to debug I'd have to do it through a secondary app (i.e. insight).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yeah..i gave gvim a look.  that was immediately followed by nightmares of messing with vi a few years back. haha.

i've managed to get Visual Studio 2008 setup with a project template that loads up a simple "hello world" program and has all the build options set up.  Only thing I have left to do at this point is figure out how to link debugging up to insight and dualis.
<br/>
<br/>
i don't think visual studio is set up to debug for ARM so i need to send it to insight when i build in debug.  right now i have it set up now to load the .nds in dualis when i build in debug...but that's hardly debugging.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I get the make output and compile errors in different windows.  I have to say that VS is very hard to beat in terms of easy of use and simplicity.  Even intellisense works well with makefile projects.
<br/>
<br/>
I debug the build with <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gba-dev.htm" target="_blank">no$gba</a>, which is started directly from VS toolbar.  Software breakpoints and debug messages both make debugging a brease with no$gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.visualsvn.com/" target="_blank">VisualSVN</a> for version control.  I have my local source code on my laptop and an subversion repository on an external usb hdd.  Can't be too safe with source code.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, debugging is an entirely other world than on the PC.
<br/>
no$gba sounds like it is a great help, but Martin still doesn't respond (I mailed him because I wanted to order the debug version of no$gba) and I there's no way you can get anything but the free version of the emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
But even the free one has a very helpful feature: the F3 error counter!
<br/>
Basically it gives you a rough idea of how buggy your program is and if you break execution at one potentially problematic line, hit F3, find no errors (or 1 standard error I get plus 11 errors that fatDefaultInit() causes - which all are no problem at all), continue execution, hit F3 and you see an increase in errors, you have a very basic (and not totally efficient) debugging system.
<br/>
<br/>
There have been some sources and stubs released around this forum. They include wifi debugging (I think it was simonjhall who release his implementation, as well as his profiler. I'm positive about the latter, but unsure about the first one.) and debug output in emulators (don't know who released it.)
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't used any of them, yet, so I am less of an help then I'd like to. Sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Btw: It's really easy to set up a template in Code::Blocks. Simply make a new projct that contains all the settings and files (like the makefile) you need and you can create a template right away by clicking "File" -&gt; "Save project as user-template", done.
<br/>
<br/>
Also make sure, you create compiler settings for the ARM gcc (devkitARM), simply by dublicating the default gcc settings and selecting your devkitARM folder (and selecting make form msys/bin.)
<br/>
<br/>
PS: You can also start batch files directly from C::B by double clicking them (they have to be included into the project, just like every "usual" file and set to "open with assosiated... " something :^p , when asked, which is a one time procedure.)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

There's a great nds project template wizard for it made by Rodrigo Sieiro. You can get it, along with instructions on how to set it up, at <a href="http://www.palib.info/wiki/doku.php?id=day1" target="_blank">http://www.palib.info/wiki/doku.php?id=day1</a>
<br/>
under the heading "Installation". It was originally made for VS 2005 so you have to change a couple of lines to make it work with 2008. It's all explained on that page though.
<br/>
<br/>
The wizard is intended for PAlib projects but it's very easy to customize it to include whatever files you want in the project.

Much better to do your debugging on the real thing imho. But then again, I'm a simple man content with trace messages as my only debug tools.

I'm putting the finishing touches right now on a little dev lib with support for downloading a new .nds file off a web server and booting it (using rebootlib), all from within your app. Takes about 10 seconds to download and run a new version.

<br/>
Currently iDeaS has a basic debugger which allows you to break execution and step through the instructions. It's useful to grab offending addresses and throwing them into arm-eabi-addr2line.exe to figure out where the crashes are coming from.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The C++ code completion has become very fast and powerful. You can add your Makefile's targets to your project so you can easily build and install your project from within the ide.

<br/>
And it's very very easy to set up: Just make a new non-managed c++ project using the "other toolchain" template and set the project folder to where your source is. In the project settings you may need to set the DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM environment variables, and that should be it.
