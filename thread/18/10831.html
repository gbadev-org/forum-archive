    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey cearn this question is mostly for you - but I guess that the answer could interest other people of course :)
<br/>
<br/>
Are you planning to make a TONC version for DS? Your explanation for GBA was the most complete ones, and since DS tutorials seem to be really imcomplete so far I was wondering if you were planning to make a TONC version for DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be seriously awesome!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Should DS tutorials assume familiarity with GBA mode or not? Except for the NoPass-RW cards, the SLOT-1 SD adapters, and the MAX Media Dock/Player, all the popular DS homebrew tools can also be booted in GBA mode to run at least mb.gba programs.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My experience is that libnds examples cover pretty much the gap between gba and nds programming. Although a guide to the 'perfect' template would be nice. Working with makefiles and different graphics converters can be confusing.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have been working on a set of tutorials and will be releasing first few chapters soon if it matters.  I think TONC ended up doing a better job than my pern project tutorials so seing an updated TONC would be interesting.  My tutorials are wiki driven this time so perhaps I can talk him into joining forces ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd love to start writing for the DS. However, there are two major issues that keep me from doing so at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
The first one is time. I'm in the process of updating pretty much everything I have right now which, well, takes a while. Tonc in particular needs across the board changes, in particular to make sure its codebase can work nicely with libgba. It's dumb, time-consuming work, but it needs to be done before I can move on. 
<br/>
<br/>
The second is more DS related. I only got my DSLite a couple of weeks ago. As far as I know the emulators aren't stable enough for real development (though it seems no$gba is getting there fast), so there's hasn't really been a way to even get started. And then there's the insane about of hardware options, with potential incompatibilities between them -- I'm not particularly looking forward to browse through the dozens of threads to come to a shopping list for a non-flashing DSLite solution (and yes, that is a hint :P).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cearn, I'd go for the Supercard Lite [fits perfectly into your DSL] and a 'Mycom/MediaMarkt microSD geheugenkaart' (cheapest I know of).  Flashing is really easy and actually saver in the long run, ph33r no malware.
<br/>
<br/>
As for time, just buy it. Very cheap on eBay.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
