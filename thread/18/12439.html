    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">anyone use GFX_VERTEX_DIFF in libnds? I am trying to use it for triangle strips and it is not working correctly. I believe that I should be finding the difference from the last point and diving by eight and then packing the results similiar to normals using packed v10 or NORMAL_PACK. Any ideas as to why this is not working? I would realy like to use this feature as I am a little short on ram and this could free up quite a bit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
