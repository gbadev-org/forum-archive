    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was going through no$cash GBA and DS specs and while I've known for a while that a lot of the registers, OAM, palette, BG are almost the same, there seems to be some hardware bugs that a DS developer needs to be aware of.
<br/>
<br/>
So how different is it? Also should one think of the ARM7 core as a dedicated soundchip or does nintendo allow its use for executing gamecode now? Not sure if the bugs that exist in ARM9 core are also "available" in the ARM7 core.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, on the GBA you have to handle all sound mixing, graphics processing, game code, etc. on the only CPU available for GBA. On the DS, though, You have the ARM7 dedicated to handling WiFi, sound, etc. while the ARM9 handles game code, graphics, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The only downsides I see are about TCM [which is why I don't use it xP] reading old memory, etc. Apart from that, I don't see any downsides. However, you have to keep in mind the different LCD registers.

<br/>
Well, the official dev kit doesn't even HAVE the means of writing ARM7 code and is therefore dedicated for sound, WiFi, etc. And AFAIK, the ARM7 side doesn't have any 'bugs' since it doesn't have caching, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Oh yeah, and VRAM access is limited to the ARM9; writes from the ARM7 won't do a thing [other than possibly give errors on no$ ;D]
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2:
<br/>
Well, sort of. You can assign 32KB of VRAM to the ARM7 but that's rare</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is putting code in TCM/Cache the same as putting code in IWRAM for GBA? Oh, and is better to use ARM code or will THUMB code be alright because I read something about code execution but couldn't understand it for now.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, putting code in ITCM [instruction TCM] will mean that it will act cached regardless of other settings [as long as it's enabled xP] and this will usually result in a VERY big speed-up, so yeah about the same as IWRAM on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I personally use ARM for the ARM9 side and THUMB for the ARM7 side, but either can be used as the ARM9 will read 32-bits at once anyway, so it's better for ARM optimized code. But if you're looking for space/speed for small routines, THUMB is the way to go. As for the ARM7, it's a LOT like IWRAM on the GBA [no caching, 3 cycles load, 1 cycles for most arithmetic, etc], so you can use either THUMB or ARM, but I use THUMB to maintain space [since you only have 64-96KB of its RAM].</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah I was reading lots yesterday. If I understood right, polygons are done using a 4x4 matrix. To do 2d, use the image as a texture on a quadrilateral polygon(I'm only gessing on this part). And I have no direct access to the polygon/vertices RAM, I have to use/send the commands and the 3d engine will sort things out from there.
<br/>
<br/>
Did I get those parts right? The last part is kinda similar to the Genesis/Megadrive video processor I think, if anyone is familiar with that.

All of the Castlevania games use the 3D engine entirely for the gameplay screen. Contra 4 uses the 3D engine for the top screen. Some games like MMZX Advent use the 3D engine just for sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
The 2D engines are not useless. You need to use it in some capacity on at least one of the screens (or have no display at all). A lot of games mix 2D and 3D to good effect - see NSMB, which gets a lot of detail out of its models by making most of the screen use the 2D engine. The number of quads you can draw in a frame is pretty limited, even for some kinds of 2D.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, but A3I5/A5I3 modes for poly texturing along with all the other effects you get with 3D make it difficult to justify tiled maps.

    <h4>#173871 - Exophase - Wed May 05, 2010 6:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you do a 2D game that allows moving between both screens (say, like Yoshi's Island DS) you probably will want to use both 2D engines, if only for convenience. When using the same 8x8 tiles the 3D engine can't actually draw the same amount the 2D layers can. Contra 4 had graphics that were visually similar on top and bottom but tiled completely differently, which probably wasted a lot of memory.
<br/>
<br/>
I somewhat agree though - I feel like Nintendo would have been much better off scrapping the main screen 2D engine and using the die space to improve the 3D engine instead. DS is the only platform I've ever heard of that has full 2D and 3D engines, even Saturn needed to use VDP1 to draw sprites. If anything this way would ease some constraints for DS emulation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. in fact you can use the sprite blitters ala oam (ie. screen resolution of 256x192).  
<br/>

Here's a demo of a particle system to test how fast the 3d core is at rendering 2d quads.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been reading through tutorials and source code(NDS 3d specific tutorials are are hard to come by) and if I understood right, the only memory used for graphics(polygons, textures and palettes in particular) is the VRAM right?
<br/>
<br/>
The palette memory of 2d mode is just for 2d mode yes? 
<br/>
<br/>
Also one I haven't found yet is about texture. In 2d mode, sprites and tiles are cut up into 8x8 pixels. Is this true for textures in the DS as well, or are textures formatted like a bitmap(One whole image) and then use x and y coordinates (as well as other values like S and T which is basically length and width)to determine the texture displayed by a polygon? From what I read, its the latter so sprite animation might be a little different when using 3d mode in that case. Can anyone confirm?
<br/>
<br/>
Another question is about tiled BG using the 3d mode. Isn't this expensive on resources(meaning copying 2d mode using in this case 8x8 quadrangle polygons each displaying an 8x8 tile and then filling the screen with such polygons) or is there a way to just use one big quadrangle then display multiple textures using a table?

glTextures are linear. aka bitmap. They are not cut in 8x8 tiles. Actually I just made a 2d renderer using only gl calls and its fast and does not have a sprite limit of 128.  The way you would render sprites via 3d core is IMHO a lot easier than oam.

Yeah, my example uses one texture image but uses texture offsets to blit different parts of a texture.  oam gfx data would hold as much as texture data.  I am also using 256 colors for my textures these days.

I can't seem to find the max allowable size of textures for NDS. I can't recall where I read this. Although texture parameters indicate 1024x1024(probably only for 2 color).

Some of the questions have been answered, thanks to all! But the last one hasn't yet! So how do we do something like WIN_OBJ in 3d mode?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

there's surelly an easy way to perform some basic window, but have you checked all what you can do using windows (specially tricks involving object windows or hblank DMA)? I doubt you can easily do all windowing on the 3d hardware easily... that said the effect you gain surely worth more than windowing and some special 2d effects...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
