You can use bankswitching, but then you have to code the bankswitching separately for each make and model of flash card, and some cards' bankswitching methods aren't known to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you can use a CF or SD card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

SD would be a little more difficult since there are no fully working read/write libs for it (at least the write part of the available SC one is not working right yet...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
