    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I was just wondering if anyone knew this:
<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of switching my in-development game to this console. One issue is this: The game has 3D cutscenes, that are AVI files on the computer. They are quite large files. I wonder - will I be able to put these video clips on? I dont know if anyone knows, it's eary days, but this is a crucial issue.

Because video is a patent minefield, and it might cost more to pay lawyers to verify that your video codec violates no patents than to actually develop the codec itself. When you outsource your codec, you're also outsourcing the legal work that went into it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nah, you just roll your own compression scheme.  Compression isn't that hard of a concept if you take some time to study it.  It's all about predicting what the next byte will be.  If you can predict that next byte to even a 50% probability, you'll get 87.5% lossless compression.  When 75% sure, that goes up to 95% (heck even 6.25% sure yields 50%.)  With a bit of image smoothing/quantizing and before frame, after frame, and a few pixels of previous data for use as predictors, movie compression isn't that tough of a beast to conquer.  It'd probably take me about 2 weeks to roll a scheme on the above idea that would be close to the video only side compression of Majescos codec.  By close, I mean within a couple percentage points of there stuff which I estimate to be roughly 97-98% compression from the studies I've done.  No reverse engineering, no LZW cheating (though in the US, the patent on it expired a couple months ago), just solid Huffman/Arithmetic algorithms with a good model.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even if you "roll your own", you may still run into a subsisting patent. Alexander Graham Bell beat Elisha Gray to the patent office for a broad patent on telephones[1], and Gray was barred from selling telephones without Bell's permission during the term of the patent even though he "rolled his own". For a more recent example, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ross.net/compression/patents_notes_from_ccfaq.html" target="_blank">see the story of LZRW1</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
[1] No, it wasn't "just by a couple hours"; the facts were more in Bell's favor than some shady "Patent Your Invention Right Now!" firms would have you think. Bell filed a <span style="font-style: italic">finished</span> patent app a couple hours before Gray filed a <span style="font-style: italic">first</span> draft called a "caveat".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, but depending on the type of video, general purpose compression could be a alternative.
<br/>
Compression will be nowhere near as good as with a video compression scheme, but at least it decreases the size of the video to some degree. Especially if there is lots of the same colors in the video.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yes, but I thought of that myself :) I honestly didn't know MPEG did that ??? But then again looking at them, it does look a little like it ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#22218 - ampz - Tue Jun 15, 2004 12:05 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can implement a _very_ simple version of the above method if:
<br/>
A: Your video is rendered or computer generated in some way (static objects in two adjacent frames are exactly identical).
<br/>
and:
<br/>
B: Only small portions of the screen is updated most of the time.
<br/>
<br/>
I belive MPEG can rotate, skew, scale, compress (change x/y relationship) and move picture elements (tiles) from one frame to another. Right? There must be some kind of filtering algorithms to smooth the edges between two tiles as well..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I only said he had mentioned the basics :)
<br/>
<br/>
Still, averaging the pixel velocity between frames (1 value for all pixels instead of on a per 16x16 pixel matrix as MPEG) and using that as a predictor to the next screen with arithmetic compression will by itself yield in the neighborhood of 75% lossless compression.  (On a computer generated scene where your not cutting from 1 area to the next or fading.)  Add a little bit of logic for moving areas and some quantizing and you get Majesco level compression :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
