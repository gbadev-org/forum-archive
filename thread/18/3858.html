    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Um, should there be any discussion (or poll) on this since the answer is obvious? Have you found any GBA flash carts from your local store or sold by Nintendo to anyone? No and no. That will include DS carts. However, if you may have checked, some online companies make GBA flash carts that us hobbyists and developers use for development, so it is safe to assume that 3rd party DS flash carts will be made in the future, but they will not made by Nintendo for our use, nor will they be available at stores. You'll have to look online once they actually make them.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
