    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I'm new here and just getting into Nintendo DS programming. The only problem is I downloaded and ran the Devkit Pro installer and don't know where to move on now. So my question to you guys is, how do I setup the Programmer's Notepad that came with the install to compile C++ Nintendo DS source code ? How would I get the Notepad to include the include and lib files ? I looked at the Devkit Pro setup instructions and could not really understand the Environment Variables section. If you guys could assist me or simplify this process in any way I would be very grateful.

Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, it's explained <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/faq/how-do-i-use-devkitpro-toolchains-with-programmers-notepad-2/" target="_blank">here,</a>
<br/>
but as it says, Programmers Notepad should already be setup correctly - open one of the examples, then open the source code. Next click the tools menu, then click on make if it's there. If it's not there, we'll explain how to set it up.

PN doesn't handle that, the compiler does. So you don't need to worry about that.(Tutorials explain how to include the includes needed in your source code)

Don't worry, you shouldn't need to get into that. That's mainly when you manually install Devkitpro, you used the automated installer, so you shouldn't need to touch that.(Note: devkitARM is the compiler, while Devkitpro is the publisher, which contains several toolchains, included devkitARM)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
