    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I was wondering what is the fastest method to get homebrew code on the DS? Currently I am using the NeoFlash 512Mb and the USB Loader that came with it. It works great, but it takes forever to load anything other then simple text demos. It is supposed to be USB2, I doubt it. I was looking at the Magic Key 2/3 (I have MK1) since they accept CF memory, but would this solve my problem? What other mehods are faster?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your DS's firmware is flashed and you have the hardware to run FireFly's WMB program, then that's probably the fastest way to get programs running on your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of a crazy idea I?ve had for a fast way GBAMP users could get files on their CF cards.  However, you would need this setup:
<br/>
<br/>
- flashed DS firmware
<br/>
- hardware for WMB
<br/>
<br/>
The utility would consist of two parts:  a PC program and a DS program.
<br/>
<br/>
First, you run the PC program to select the file(s) you want to send to your CF card.  The program then appends the files to the DS program file and launches the WMB program to send it to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Next, turn on your DS with the GBAMP inserted, enter the DS Download Play mode and download the file.  When the DS program launches, it would either write the files immediately to the CF card or you could choose the directory first.
<br/>
<br/>
The size of the files, plus the DS program, would all have to fit in the DS's 4MB of RAM, but most of the files I transfer to my CF are usually fairly small.  With enough features in both parts of the utility, my card reader would be made practically useless, I would probably never remove my CF card from my GBAMP again, and I would become the laziest person in the world.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hey! i didnt get your method! It seems awesome! no need to remove the cf from the gbamp. But i didnt get how to do it! did u do a special program by yourself?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I like this idea, but with this method we are limited to only write a file, smaller than 4mb - size(write program). And is this method fast enough to be handy?

Won't there have to be some sort of 4 KB stub in <span style="font-style: italic">battery backed</span> SRAM in order to boot FlashMe on the new DS firmware? Is the M3 capable of this?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It can.  Just try something like ScummVM DS, or one of the PocketNES revisions I've heard about that write saves directly to the compact flash card.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This would also be possible, but this would be unpractical I guess. If you want to send say 16mb it means you need 3 (maybe 4) multiboot roms and they need to be send one by one, so taking your CF card out of the gbamp would be much faster.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why? It will probably be like a supercard with built in RTC and Save RAM. Unless there is a way to disable the built in 32 MB of memory, or bypass it through commands on the GBA Cart bus, we won't be able to access the CF card. This will limit us to 32MB, like every other flash cart (except for bank switching). Don't assume that GBAMP code will automatically work on the M3. We will just have to wait and see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
