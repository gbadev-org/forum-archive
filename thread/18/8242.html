    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi guys.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new in DS dev and I have a few questions:
<br/>
<br/>
- Is the LibNds witch is in the devkitpro an official DS library? I guess no but how these guys have managed to do it?
<br/>
<br/>
- Is there a way to debug the homebrews in an IDE? I've built some demos and tested them on my DS. But If I have to put my files in my DS every time I want to test, it will be very long. Maybe there is a way to use an emulator and to bind the process to the sources in order to trace and to do real time debugging??
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your answers ;-)

No there is no real way of debugging, some of the emulators give memory and cpu visualisations but nothing like stepping to my knowledge</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Devkit Pro comes with gdb/insight which are the standard gnu commandline debugger and graphical extension. They are full source-level (i.e., step through your C/C++, not just through hex and assembly) debugging tools used widely outside the homebrew world with a small bit of code that sits on the target development hardware and speaks a remote debugging protocol with gdb.
<br/>
<br/>
Visual Boy advance implements this protocol for debugging the gba. None of the DS emus do this yet as far as I know but I would encourage their authors to put it in instead of spending time on their own built-in debuggers.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.btinternet.com/~ahcox/GBA/" target="_blank">3D on GBA</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
