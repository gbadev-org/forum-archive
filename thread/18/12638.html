ok sry 
<br/>
1). it's not firmware it's just a booting app that I thought was cool to take over for CreeboMe which is really cool and everything but it doesn't work with DS booting and homebrew booting for the MMD
<br/>
2). i was just being blind and forgot to include the scroll.c
<br/>
3). im not coping. i am making a modification of an open source project for my own use.
<br/>
4). I do know what I'm doing i just don't pay attention to things
<br/>
5). i have downgraded to r18 and libnds april 10 06 so i could build this project
<br/>
6). this is a learning aid for developing my booting app
<br/>
<br/>

Why in bloody hell would you want to take over CreeboMe? I don't even use it. It's only a beta and it looks like its going to be for a while before it gets a version 1 stamped on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
besides take it easy on me im only 14 and trying to leearn C/C++ and PAlib sucks cuz you cant do anything with it

BTW, if I installed CreeboME onto my DS and it didn't work, there would be no way to re-flash FlashMe on unless i got another card<br/>_________________<br/>Flashed DS Phat (FlashMe v7)

I am using an older libcartreset that I modified slightly. I am not going to use it anymore though because I still need to add a bunch of stuff and this is just taking up too much space and is kinda slow.

Hey, I'm only 14 too and I never said ANYTHING about palib.

I am not doing ppflash to restore from a bad firmware developed by 14 year old kid! (actually it's not bad I like it a lot, i envy it which is why i wish i could have the source so I could add support to the MMD which is the only thing I can do right now really, is add support to stuff. it's got a great GBA launching process)
<br/>
even if I made a firmware i wouldn't use it. and i highly doubt that ur actually 14. how many 14 year old kids do you know that know full enough C++ to make a functional firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>Flashed DS Phat (FlashMe v7)

For the second part, I take the whole thing to offense. I don't care that you put the envy sh*t in there. If you don't believe me, I couldn't really care. But if you have the guts to insult me and then ask for the source code for MY firmware then I say tough luck and move on.

P.S. It was developed in C and there are at least 6.5 Billion people in the world (thats 6,500,000,000 people if you don't know what a billion is). I think atleast 500,000 would be in my situation or even higher.
