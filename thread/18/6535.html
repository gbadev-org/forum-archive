    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Doesn't really matter, as they are almost the same. A C program will compile in a C++ compiler 99% of the time. Most beginners find classes complicated, and recommend C to begin with. You should probably begin with PC programming, as it is a lot easier, and get a good hang of it. C++ is better for console programs, imho, as it uses cout instead of printf.
<br/>
<br/>
The choice between C and C++ is a choice between not object oriented and object oriented programming. I suggest you use C++, but simply don't make any classes and stuff like that until you feel ready.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In traditional programming, the program moves from command to command, jumps
<br/>
to functions, executes the commands there, jumps back etc...
<br/>
<br/>
In OOP, you base your program on a bunch of objects (classes) that communicate with
<br/>
each other and do certain tasks. This requires an entirely different way to think, but is
<br/>
usually very flexible. Classes communicate with the world through API's (just regular
<br/>
functions, nothing fancy and complicated), and this allows you to change how the class
<br/>
works internally, as long as you don't touch the API.
<br/>
<br/>
That was pure OOP, you can also combine the two, and have classes that encapsulate
<br/>
stuff, but you're using them as you would in traditional programming. This is very flexible
<br/>
too, and the method I tend to use.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I have a Background class for my DS programming, and I can write
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Background bg0(0, MAIN);
<br/>
bg0.init(0, 31);
<br/>
bg0.LoadPalette("master.pal");
<br/>
bg0.LoadTiles("bg.raw");
<br/>
bg0.LoadMap("bg.map");</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
instead of
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">BG0_CR = BG_256_COLOR | BG_TILE_BASE(0) | BG_MAP_BASE(31);
<br/>
<br/>
*about 10 lines of code that I don't feel like writing now*</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
It's alot easier to see what it does, and is faster to use. And you can make classes manage themselves with destructors and stuff, so you don't have to
<br/>
worry so much about them. It's great!<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll possibly get flamed for this but for learning OOP principles, Java is a much easier language to start off with. To learn fundamental programming basics, try visual basic.
<br/>
<br/>
As for a demonstration of OOP here's a comparrison of hello world programs which just displays a lots of "hello world"s
<br/>
<br/>
using a linear programming Language (BASIC) which operates using a list of commands.
<br/>
<br/>
10 Print "hello world"
<br/>
20 goto 10 
<br/>
<br/>
using OOP (JAVA), this won't actually run by itself but I can't be bother to write a full program. OOP works by calling methods/functions which you can tie to objects. It allows for space saving re-use of code and modular programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Void HelloWorld()
<br/>
{
<br/>
   system.out.println("Hello World /n");
<br/>
   HelloWorld();   // performs the method again causing an infinate loop
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both OOP and Linear programming can perform the same tasks , the only difference is the structure and the amount of code needed</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could however be starting from scratch and look and see a page of code full of pointers and complicated String handling functions (I've seen textbooks where they don't use pre built string functions) and go 'buh?'

Java for all the hate it gets is much easier to read than C++ and quicker to learn. You can't tell me that pointers aren't a nightmare to learn to get your head round.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The unclean approach is necessary due to some very poorly implemented JVMs.  
<br/>
<br/>
The overhead you incure by using c++ on DS is generaly negligable. If you find yourself at the limits of the performance that c++ can provide you will likely have to implement it in ASM to get the results you seek.
<br/>

The choice between c++ and c should be one of comfort and portability more so than speed or resource usage.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It's complicated because the question could be rephrased as: "Is there any program that breaks the rules of object orientation and cannot be implemented as efficiently while conforming to those rules?"  It's an intractable problem.
<br/>
<br/>
It's ambiguous because it depends on language implementations and the definitions of object orientation.
<br/>
<br/>
It's irrelevant because performance hardly ever depends on the high-level organization of an application.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's true that OOP code is often slightly less efficiend than other code,

You can of course create terribly inefficient code with OOP, but you can create

equally horrible code without it.

There are a few options. There's a beta of Microsoft Visual Studio here:

<a href="http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/visualc/default.aspx" target="_blank">http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/visualc/default.aspx</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Visual Studio is an easy to learn and common compiler/IDE, so it's probably a good choice for a beginner.
<br/>
<br/>
Another good compiler is gcc, you can gind a windows version if it here.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/" target="_blank">http://www.mingw.org/</a>
<br/>
Gcc is kinda complicated, and you don't get an IDE, so I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. The good thing about it is that it's free, non Microsoft, cross platform
<br/>
compatible etc... If you want to go with this, I suggest you get Dev-C++:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html" target="_blank">http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html</a>
<br/>
This includes MinGW, but packaged in a nice IDE like Visual Studio.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make stuff for the DS, you'll need DevkitARM, which includes a version
<br/>
of gcc that compiles for the ARM (DS processor).

<br/>
<br/>
OOP doesn't necessarily 'involve significant use of virtual methods'.  Heck, in C++, the default is for a method to be non-virtual.  There's a reason for this (aside from the performance benefits).  The problem is that, when people think OOP, they mistakenly assume that means inheritence, which, it turns out isn't all that useful most of the time, and ends up being horribly abused.  In fact, many of the cases where inheritence is used can be refactored to use composition.
<br/>
<br/>
OOP is, really, just a nice, formalized way ot tying data together with the code that modifies it.  It also encourages modularity and contract-based design patterns, since you can formalize the interfaces to code and then hide away the internals ('course, you can do that with procedural code, too, but OOP makes it aeasier).  
<br/>
<br/>
But there's nothing about OOP that's inherently slow.  Heck, you can develop OO code in straight C if you like, using structs and function pointers... oh, wait, that's just a C++ class without the syntactic sugar.
<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, the real-time operating system VxWorks is, AFAIK, written in C++.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Abcd1234 on Thu Aug 11, 2005 11:15 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I have read Bruce Eckel's "Thinking In" series for C++ and Java and found them pretty darn good. Another author that I highly recommend for C++ is Scott Meyers, though his books aren't free.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the Everything vs C++ argument that always comes up in these situations, I firmly and strongly believe that C++ is the way to go <span style="font-weight: bold">for the DS</span>. There is many other cases where it is not suitable, though personally I think it is a fantastic language and programming method.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I understand a lot of people feel that C++ is just syntactic sugar for C. Yes, that is partially true, but I say take the sugar and raise your productivity by coding in a clear efficient OOP manner. It may take some time to get used to coding correctly in C++, but then again a lot people seem to have trouble coding correctly in <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> so that may be unimportant.
<br/>
<br/>
One last point, and one that I wish was stressed much much more to begginner programmers. Take the effort from day one to write code that causes compile time errors.
<br/>
<br/>
An example:
<br/>
<br/>
Most beginner books write things like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">int myfunc(int* array, int size);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
You should write it like this (or similar):
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">const int myfunc(const int* const array, const unsigned int size);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This is both for clarity, possible compiler optimisations, and compile time error generation. The amount of people who seem to avoid the const keyword at all cost (particularly with its other use of marking class member functions for const object use) is simply astounding.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Compilers don't make optimizations based on const declarations because they can't assume that constness isn't casted away.  I also don't remember ever catching an error due to a const declaration.
<br/>
<br/>
And yet... I use const declarations religiously.  I even declare local variables const.  It lets readers make more assumptions about the presence of side-effects.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Java is good to learn OOP with, but you miss out on pointers and memory manipulation. So don't learn it unless for OOP.
<br/>
<br/>
Procedural is the way to begin. Pascal or Basic are good places to start. Then C.

<br/>
While still a beginner, avoid Assembly (ASM), and using advanced graphic libraries like OpenGL or DirectX. You really shouldn't try to learn to program using the DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, if you know what C++ classes do behind the scene, you will wish you never even started thinking OOP. There is better ways of tying data together, and faster ways of accessing them.
<br/>
<br/>
I rether go by a simple C struct, and pointers, instead of a protected and private data that does nothing but slow down read and write.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine you want to do a 3D game using hardware accelerated graphics. The first choice you get is C++ classes when using D3D from Microsoft. Everything is nicely put into classes, and virtual methods. But this is such a waste of speed! Just because you get 3D for free doesn't mean you can waste cycles on stack loading and all that. What you need to make a good 3D game is a lot of CPU power to calculate all the realistic 3D space math things such as ragdoll and stuff.
<br/>
Yea, you are a waster! Get back to assembler and kick ass! I will use C because it has everything I need, and the extra can be accessed from assembler.
<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want object oriented code, write it yourself, and don't trust the compiler to speed it up for you because it won't. I trust the human brain more than a compiler.

Well, I'd rather suggest recommended features:
<br/>
* tabbed file views
<br/>
* code formatting is a must
<br/>
* brace indicators are helpful
<br/>
* a simple to configure build/compile button is always a plus
<br/>
<br/>
I currently prefer jEdit, but it doesn't have tabbed file views so switching between multiple files is a PAIN; it uses a drop-down list of current files that you must manually remove to keep it clean. It does have good tabbing and code formatting however.
<br/>
<br/>
Response to Lost:
<br/>
I agree with using the most efficient language/compilar especially when dealing with limited resources, but I'd just like to comment on the merits of C++ and other OOP languages. While there's an obvious and certain performance cost, development time and quality is the benefit. Some things are much quicker to code and keep working using C++ rather than C, and that's why C++ is so popular for games. I agree with using C when that's all that's needed, of course.
<br/>
<br/>
These days commercial game budgets and development timelines are getting HUGE, so the real issue is reducing those costs, instead of producing the most optimized product. Thus, game dev libraries are commonly written in C++.[/quote]<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Use the best tool for the job :)
<br/>
<br/>
(1) Portability
<br/>
If you use assembly, you lose portability because assembly differs between CPU architectures. With C/C++ you can usually just recompile for a different architecture without any code changes.
<br/>
If you really need a highly-optimized routine (see point 3), you can use inline assembly with most C/C++ compilers.
<br/>
<br/>
(2) Maintainability
<br/>
C/C++ is arguably easier to maintain than assembly code. It's also easier to read for other people.
<br/>
<br/>
(3) Performance
<br/>
Usually programs spend 99% of their time in 1% of their code. You need to only optimize this 1% of code. Use of inline assembly is possible if a better algorithm cannot be found. Don't bother optimizing the rest of the code, since it's almost never executed.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
