<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if i could gather a little info from some of you coders out there, i am looking to get some funding froma  few of my sources and with this i am hoping to put together a small team and create a RPG on the DS, now i do not have a great amount of information on the DS but i am hoping to send a demo of the game to a selection of publishers
<br/>
<br/>
i was wondering what kind of pay some of you coders would expect or like on a job like this, now please bear in mind its not a high budget team infact it will be very very low budget
<br/>
<br/>
Thank You
<br/>
