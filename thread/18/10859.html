    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it dead? No.
<br/>
Will it be finished? Yes!
<br/>
<br/>
I had to put it on pause for a while for life things. I now have another person working on it who is very capable. In the last week or so we started moving forward again with it.
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to go underground for a while with it like I have recently. At some later date it will be released. The main reason I went public with it to start with was to flush out some talented people, and it worked.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
