Is there even one out yet? It would suck to have to use windows just to debug applications :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After reading this thread, and since I just loaded an old laptop of mine with Ubuntu 6.06 the other day, I decided to see what Windows emulators would work with Wine.  Here are the results:

I don't think there's any need to develop in Linux and debug in Windows, you've got 3 pretty good emulators (DeSmuMe, Dualis, No$gba) to choose from!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">start up terminal, 'winecfg' select the Audio tab, disselect OSS and select ALSA.  set the windows arch to XP.
<br/>
next up, hack the .ini of dualis to disable sound ([APU]
<br/>
 EmulateSound=0)
<br/>
that did the trick for me. (i'm using Dapper as you do)

sorry for the off topic: while you're here, think you can fix your wifime tutorial? it's got some bad info that every so often confuses someone.
<br/>
<br/>
the main problem i know of is the few parts referring to double-clicking wmb.exe. This will not work, as the latest version of wmb REQUIRES some commandline paramaters. I would suggest either redoing the entire tutorial with latest wmb files, or at the very least posting a notice at the top that the directions are out of date.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
