    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the idea of an online sports score tracker (probably more specifically English Premier League (my fav!)) for DS.
<br/>
Its no request, just thought i'd throw the idea out there.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably going to try and learn some coding after school exams finish (nov this year).
<br/>
I'm a quick learner, but i'm sure it'll probably take quite some time if i aimed towards producing this idea.
<br/>
<br/>
So this isn't an announcement either, but i might pick it up one day, assuming no-one else does (seems probable). I think it could be quite feasible from what i've seen in other DS wifi projects.
<br/>

Your peaceful non-coder,
