I assume this is gonna have large firmware changes... anybody think we'll have problems getting code to run on this thing?
<br/>
<br/>
The big reduction in size also worries me a little... does this even have a GBA slot?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm pretty shure there will be one. Why? I guess, the DS gets flashed after it is assembled. This way, you can easily change the firmware before the DS gets shipped. If you flash it earlyer, you have a lot of ready-to-assemble flash chips or mainboards with a flashchip and find a bug in the firmware -&gt; you have to ship a lot of "broken" units. 
<br/>
<br/>
But i guess we will find out in few month.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, good point.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm absolutely *loving* the re-design and am hoping it will spark a second "buzz" for the Ninty DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Will also be a lot cooler to use for homebrew applications. E.g. VNC with the ugly DSv1 would be looked upon as "geeky". I'd feel a hell of lot more at home controlling my computer with this baby.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tha'd be sweet!

I also hope PassMe 2 still works on the new model (I dont have PassMe 2, but I do have Passme1)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There has been some speculation about this on the topic for the DS Lite on the DS misc forums.

I can't wait to see a real one and not just a mockup.  Heh, Nintendo redesigns their handhelds and I fall for it almost every time.  :P
<br/>
<br/>
If it'd be possible to FlashMe this baby I might just buy one when they are available.  Only if it has the GBA slot though, I really doubt it'd not have one since Nintendo has already released, for example, a Rumble Pak that uses it, or in Japan there is the Band Brothers expansion cart.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
