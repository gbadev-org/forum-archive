    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I'm totally new to this, so don't kick me if I do something pretty dumb. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested in coding for the Nintendo DS, I also already have soem knowledge in a couple of coding languages, including C++.
<br/>
<br/>
I followed a couple of tutorials, but all are the same: Download devkitpro, install it, go to an example and run make.
<br/>
But here is already my problem:
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
make: *** [build] Error 2</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, it tells me no such fiel or directory. The examples are installed properly, and there is also no space in the filename. So why is this happening? I didn't change anything, so shouldn't it work right after installation?
<br/>
I'm using Windows Vista 32 Ultimate, could it be a issue with my operating system?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can (and will) help me. :)

<br/>
You're either gonna have to source some other operating system (eg XP) or roll with Linux inside VMWare or something until the problem is fixed.
<br/>
Btw this problem seems to affect not only the ARM versions of the toolchains but for other (non-DKP) targets too...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just had to add additional paths to my PATH-var. Now it works and I was able to compile the examples. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Either way, Vista/gcc/bintutils problems should be fixed soon...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
But I'm having one more little problem, maybe you can help me.
<br/>
<br/>
With the exampel makefile, the cpp files have to be in one of these directories: gfx source data
<br/>
But usually in Visual Studio the cpp files are in the project dir. For example the project is called "Fubar", then the cpp files are in:
<br/>
..projects/Fubar/Fubar/
<br/>
I want to edit the makefile to use the files from that directory. But how?
<br/>
I tried
<br/>
SOURCES		:=	gfx source data $(CURDIR)
<br/>
SOURCES		:=	gfx source data $(CURDIR)/
<br/>
SOURCES		:=	gfx source data $(shell basename $(CURDIR))
<br/>
<br/>
Each doesn't work. When I copy the test cpp file into the subdir "source", then it works.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you maybe know what I have to write there?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Snaeng, could you please post which directories you had to add to your path in order to get rid of the CreateProcess error during makes.  I am getting the same error on Vista and am going crazy trying to fix it.

<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For all of you saying Linux is better than Windows for development, I think the opposite.  I've had great success using Visual C++ 2005 Express + the PAlib App Wizard (which would work with libnds, just change the includes from PAlib to libnds), in Windows XP.  It has the compiler and stuff set up for you, and you can add an option to test it in an emulator (or multiple emulators) and copy it to your media to test on real hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
I use Linux for everything BUT development it seems (and Wiimote use) because there seems to be no decent development environment for it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Having your path set this way will break your toolchain when  release 21 is availalable.

Make a note:
