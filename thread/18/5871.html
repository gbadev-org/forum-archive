    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a GBA emulator on the DS yet?  If so, how far is it in production?
<br/>
<br/>
I really want this because:
<br/>
I want X and Y to do something.
<br/>
I want to turn on/off the light.
<br/>
I want to use the touch screen.
<br/>
I want to use multiplayer (woot!!!).
<br/>
I want to support scaling.
<br/>
<br/>
I want, I want, I want!!! :-)

<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like what? Mimic the A / B buttons? GBA games weren't coded to use the buttons so having them run on the DS via emulation isn't going to automagically assign new buttons to ingame functions.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I want to turn on/off the light. </span>
<br/>
I doubt GBA emulation would enable this under the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I want to use the touch screen. </span>
<br/>
Again, what for, a ROM loading menu? It would do nothing in game for GBA titles.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I want to use multiplayer (woot!!!). </span>
<br/>
Tunneling the serial protocol over wifi would be neat admittedly, but at this point in time the wifi in the DS isn't known to homebrew developers.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I want to support scaling. </span>
<br/>
Er, well, I guess the screen would get slightly larger, but only slightly so if you wanted to maintain a correct aspect ratio.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

its been proven the gba cpu doesnt run at full capacity and can be sped up im not sure if this can be done though software only, alternatively you could try to make it use the ds cpu instead
<br/>
<br/>
the menu could have some options like
<br/>
*return to rom selection screen
<br/>
*backlight on/off
<br/>
*scaling</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">X and Y could be like the L and R buttons on some NES emu's for GBA.  Maybe like a turbo-button (hold X and A = A, A, A, A, A, A...).
<br/>
<br/>
The touch screen could do some stuff, like setup (of course, the screen would remain black to save power until it is touched).  Just a thought...
<br/>
<br/>
Well, has anyone even started?  Or maybe completed??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

don't think so and I guess you will have to wait a while for it cause 
<br/>
1) you are already able to play GBA games on DS.
<br/>
2) SNES/NES emulation is (by far)more important to the people than a GBA emu.
<br/>
<br/>
wait a minute.....
<br/>
the DS <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> a friggin' GBA already.
<br/>
so if you wanna pirate, get a flash card and use the GBA slot.
<br/>
<br/>
wifi multiplayer would be neat though...<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBC multiplayer, on the other hand, looks possible at first glance.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some other big advantages of creating a homebrew GBA emulator for DS is we could add support for GB and GBC games.
<br/>
<br/>
We could also have the system sleep when the lid is shut. That is one of my biggest pet peeves about GBA-mode on the DS as it is today (and one of my peeves with the GBA SP)
<br/>
If it has a lid, it should shut off/sleep/do something when you shut it. End of story.

Does anyone know if the DS's ARM7 makes it easier to write a GBA emulator?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GB &amp; GBC have almost nothing in common with GBA, so for an emulator to support both GBA and GB &amp; GBC, it would in fact be two emulators...a GBA emulator, and a GB&amp;GBC emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

TGB Dual runs well on a 133 mhz PC, and why isn't it possible that the DS emulates 2 GBAs? The ARM7 is already there, you just need to add some stuff to receive controller data from the other DS, and I guess the ARM9 is powerful enough to emulate another GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Much of the GBA back-compatibility hardware is shut off in Nintendo DS mode. You'd also have to translate between GBA and Nintendo DS video models, between GBA and Nintendo DS sound models, between GBA and Nintendo DS timer models, etc.
