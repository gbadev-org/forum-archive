    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've decided to release my libmikmod port for Nintendo DS that we use for playing music in the tetattds project. The software mixer is slow and the hardware mixer is buggy, but it's still usable.

I don't have much time to work on this anymore, so if anyone want to look into the bugs of the hardware mixer it would be nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends on what you mean. The software mixer does its processing and mixing on ARM9, and ARM7 plays back the result. In the hardware mixer the module is still running on ARM9 but instead it tells ARM7 what to play on the different sound channels.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
With the hardware mixer, can you limit the amount of hardware channels it uses to play? I mean, soundeffects playing at the same time is usually desired. Too bad it's kind of buggy as you stated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It should also be possible to allocate channels and play sound effects through mikmod, but I have never tried this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
