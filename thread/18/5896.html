        <h2>DS development > Palette info in tile memory</h2>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I discovered yesterday that the DS stores the palette for backgrounds along with the tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
I store my tiles in the first first block of memory and the map in the second block.
<br/>
<br/>
This works fine until my tile data starts breaking into the 2nd section of the first block.  Apparently the first bytes of this section are used to store the palette as now my tiles are replaced with the palette info.
<br/>
<br/>
I am planning to store my tiles 'around' the palette.  That is, break them into two chunks, one stored before the palette and one stored after the palette.   
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a cleaner, more standard, solution?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
