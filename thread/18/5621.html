    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey im doing a remake of Goldeneye 007 for NDS
<br/>
i have only just started and i have begun making 3d models.
<br/>
<br/>
how many polygons do you think i should use in a character model?
<br/>
(they are all aimed to be modelled same as N64 but with nicer Textures)
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your help
<br/>
anyone who would like more information on this project should contact me:

All I can say is, try it out..

Put the model in an app and then render maybe 10-20 copies of it and see how well it does :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would that even be possible? I don't think dreamcast even had a full speed port of quake 2 and it's a more powerful system, or is the 3d hardware of the DS better understood?
<br/>
That it'd be quite a mod to go from quake 2 to goldeneye.

The quake 1 engine would probably be an easy port though.(at least in terms of performance)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The limit *appears* to be 2048 polys. Yes, really. However, this isn't quite as bad as it seems - backface-culled polys don't count towards this limit, and I *think* a quad counts as a single poly.

There was a port of quake 2, but I don't think it ran well, and the 200mhz SH-4 of the dreamcast minus 3d acceleration probably had more power than the 66mhz arm 9 of the DS minus 3d acceleration.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any proof behind this? I want to start making some 3d models for a DS game i Have planned and I REALLY need to know the maximum polys it can push and the most textures it can push.

Sounds about right, it cut out with (64+64)x16 pieces (with a random number showing depending on my angle).  That is including my quads in the count :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm confused, does this mean you are saying the DS can run 2048 tris on screen with 16 64x64 textures at 60fps? If so, is this the highest you have been able to make it go without lag? Any information on this would be fantastic.
