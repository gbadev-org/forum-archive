I don't know how many of you use PALib to make a commercial game for the DS, but i was just wondering if anyone actually uses it, and if it's legal to use PALib for DS development ?

It depends. Has the price of NoPass circuitry fallen to where one can buy blank SLOT-1 cards in bulk for under $10 each? You'd need that in order to price-compete with $20 DS games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't think this is a real issue, if i.e EA wanted cheap NoPass circuitry, they'd be able to get that. I have seen some of the distribution-options some of the major publishers have looked seriously at, and some of those has been pretty... extreme in comparison.

You still need to include a Nintendo-logo in your program to be able to boot it, right? That makes it violating copyright laws.

I think the biggest problem is that when you publish a cartridge(with included passme and game) and Nintendo decides to update the firmware in such a way that your cartridge can't work anymore, you're in big trouble with your clients, because the game they bought for the DS will probably never work again on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I love it when someone creates an account just to post information when they have no idea what they are talking about.. yeah!

We all know that Nintendo requires official developers to use the official licensed SDK for them to publish a game.  But, that doesn't make it illegal for unlicensed developers to use other software.

Is this a true statement?  1) Is there a Nintendo logo in the current DS homebrew we are using right now?  2) Is there a Nintendo logo built into the NoPass code included in the current slot-1 devices?  3) If so, is it a fully copyright enforcable logo?
<br/>
<br/>
As for the cost of the hardware, I believe you could do it at a reasonable price.  But, after you have spent the money on 10,000 write once cards and the programmer... Then what?  You'd have to spend a lot more on marketing to get the game out there.

Placing logo's is usually because of using SDKs, just like with Havok. IANAL, but it would be very wrong to place a Nintendo logo on something that is not certified by them in any way.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] And while you can't use Nintendo's logo, they have the right to warn customers to "never buy non-certified software(without the logo)" as it hasn't gone through their QA department.

Writing it to hardware would be a very risky thing as it might become invalid with possible future firmware updates, as I stated in my previous post.
<br/>
And of course, when you try to rival with Nintendo and publish your own cartridges, you can bet they'll put effort in tightening their security to disable homebrewn software.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I think that the question that remains is: can I sell my homebrewn ROMs as files(not cartridges)?
<br/>
And this would depend on the laws of the country again. I think you might not  be able to do so in the US, but I think it's possible in the Netherlands, but again, IANAL.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What you create in such case is the idea for others, that they can make their own games for the DS without going past the Nintendo company(who wants a share of the game profit). I think that's not a threat to a game, but to Nintendo itself.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] Furthermore, I don't get the problem:
<br/>
If you have a commercial game, you should have written it in such a way that it's easy to replace the libnds code by the official SDK. That's what I do.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course Nintendo isn't going to welcome the idea with open arms, but as long as you follow the laws (or do something that isn't in the law yet and can afford to go down that route) there isn't anything they can do legally.  Of course, laws don't really matter if you can't afford to protect yourself in the first place.  If Nintendo sent every homebrew web site a cease and desist order, although we aren't breaking any laws, how many could hire a lawyer to defend themselves?  It only takes a few hundred dollars to file a complaint and you are then forced to hire a lawyer to represent yourself.

Not sure if this has been pointed out already, but <a class="postlink" href="http://digital-law-online.info/cases/24PQ2D1561.htm" target="_blank">Sega v.

To the contrary, Accolade included disclaimers on its packaging materials which stated that ?Accolade, Inc. is not associated with Sega Enterprises, Ltd.? When questioned regarding the Sega Message and its potential effect on consumers, Alan Miller testified that Accolade does not welcome the association between its product and Sega and would gladly avoid that association if there were a way to do so. Miller testified that Accolade?s engineers had not been able to discover any way to modify their game cartridges so that the games would operate on the Genesis III without prompting the screen display of the Sega Message.

Whatever Sega?s intent with respect to the TMSS, the device serves to limit competition in the market for Genesis-compatible games and to mislabel the products of competitors. Moreover, by seeking injunctive relief based on the mislabeling it has itself induced, Sega seeks once again to take advantage of its trademark to exclude its competitors from the market.

Indeed, it doesn't matter to write structured and tidy code if you are developping homebrewn software, but then you can't expect an easy path to get commercial results afterwards.
<br/>
(although some project's code make my hair stand up - no, not yours rhaleblian)

Even aside from the laws: if they just want us to stop making homebrewn software, they'll probably just introduce new firmwares with fixes to avoid running homebrewn software. At the moment we're no real threat to them, so they just let us.

Both solutions could be suicide for Nintendo. But suing homebrew sites would be the cheapest and get the fastest results.
<br/>
<br/>
But, we need to keep in mind that they can't change the firmware to the point that original released commercial games no longer work.  So, if (this is just theory now) we somehow used SuperMario 64 DS to exploit something, the "fix" they release would still have to allow the original SuperMario 64DS to run.  Sure, they can fix "dumb" things like we did with the Original PassMe code from DarkFader by checking the headers to make sure they are starting the code within the real range code should be run from, but if fixing it rendered thousands of commercial games broken, I think you'd find a very angry customer base.  They would then need to decide if potential pirates outways the public attention making such a move would cause on all media formats.  Right now, slot-1 devices are acting like official released games.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, the two obvious problems with this are 1) there's hundreds if not thousands of games out already; the hash list would be huge and 2) hashing the ROM could take a while.

The main reason for this seems to be the FCC regulations for radio-based wireless devices, and a standardized ARM7 library makes sure games aren't doing nasty stuff with the Wifi chip.
<br/>
<br/>
I've read in a few places that Nintendo offers the source code for their entire SDK, ARM7 lib included. I'm not sure if you're allowed to modify and recompile it (probably yes, otherwise why include the source?).
<br/>
<br/>
I've also heard of commercial GBA games which were entirely developed using HAM-lib or other homebrew libraries alongside the official SDK for "blessing" the game. The same should be possible for DS development: since the whole thing is memory mapped, like the GBA, all you need is a document of all memory addresses and what kind of info you can write to/read from them to make your game work.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the booting process surely must have some details which require copyrighted data for the games to work properly on non-modified DS units. Does the pass me devices contain such copyrighted data?
<br/>
<br/>
In the end I also agree with what was said before: if you want to make a commercial game using, use good coding practices so you can replace LibNDS or PALib by Nintendo's SDK when you secure a publishing deal. I'm doing that right now, by coding a "platform" layer which sits between libnds/libfat and my game code so we can start developing the game while the lengthy application process with Nintendo crawls around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You must have developpement experience in game industry to access nintendo license dev, but if not, you just have to convince an editor to work with you and it would help you to get the license from nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
About the official devkit, they apparently cannot dictate you what you have to use to make your game, but if it is not official tools you use, then they cannot help you back with problems you would encounter.
<br/>
The answer was pretty clear about that, since the game run perfectly and pass nintendo quality tests, you are free. (Some licensed game designers told me those tests are not technicals, a game must have the approval of the nintendo fan club, if i remember they are just players who test your game, they checked if it is bug free and fun ... and with some dollars you can buy the approval of an horrific game ^^)

The approval method is a bit more involved than implied here but unfortunately I'm not sure how much I can divulge.

One GBC game I worked on failed it's initial lot check due to some issues running on the wideboy. They also raised a concern which I'm not even sure how they found - it involved how I was setting the link port during multiplayer setup.

Yeah, because people are so totally going to pay actual money for raw .nds files to write to their flashcards.

Assuming that "commercial" means "licensed," that is.  Once upon a time, it didn't.  It does at present mostly thanks to the lock down on distribution.

Who said anything about .nds files? On the Wii's Virtual Console, people do pay actual money for Internet-downloaded games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was simply implying that the type of people who buy flashcards tend not to want to ever pay for the materials on them, warez fuckers and homebrew enthusiasts alike. Of course everyone is welcome to distribute whatever they want in the way of PC software over the Internet, but I don't think you'd find much of a market trying to do the same for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
And everything on the Wii's VC is licensed, of course. I mean, it has to come from Nintendo's own site. As far as consoles go, commercial and licensed have meant the same thing since the NES, and after Custer's Revenge you really can't blame them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
