    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember that the text at DSDev.org mentioned that a DS-specific forum would be created once enough people were onboard. Well, I think we can all agree that people are very interesting in development for the DS, and this board is seeing plenty of action, so are we ready for our own forum? 
<br/>
<br/>
Or do you think that would be too disruptive to ongoing development at this point? If so, when do you think would be a good time for a DSDev.org forum? Perhaps when we have managed to boot code on the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i think it really is about time to move the DS forums to the DS site but i think some people might not find it at first =/<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Meh, there really isn't anything more to talk about that wireless hacking/cracking at the moment. Other than that, there really isn't much to talk about. 
<br/>
<br/>
If homebrew actually becomes a possiblity, then I think we will need a new forum, but at the moment, it really isn't worth the hassle. Too many links are pointing to this site already!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Of course we all think it's time to have our own board reading DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Subtopic will be more clear and arranged. 
<br/>
Now everything is mixed up ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like to see a separate DSDev.org board; that way we could have subsections for "Programming", "Wireless Cracking" and "Random Speculation That Will Probably End Up Nowhere But Is Fun To Talk About For A Few Posts".<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Except that
<br/>
a) There is no "programming" yet to speak of, making that premature
<br/>
b) "wireless cracking" is the extent of the research to date
<br/>
c) "random speculation" is useless anyway, so how about we just curb that now?
<br/>
<br/>
So that leaves us down to the one already existing topic which this board is set up for, making a new board unnecessary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the board is not big enough yet to move. When the first after market kits come out and we have demos to work on, then it will be time. If not then, it will probably need a seperate forum once the Option Paks come out. (Oh, that's gonna be a trip, believe you me.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the Option Paks aren't just rumble. There's a few other ideas being kicked around for which ones to release at what time. The bottom port of the DS was meant more for expansions than GBA games. So, don't be surprised if the first Option Pak includes Rumble, and some sort of memory upgrade to boost the graphics capability of the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Evilish!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
