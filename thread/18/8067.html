    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't get the metal bits of the hinges between the two halves out. I'm trying to change the shell from silver to this blue replacement one but those things will not come out. If I tilt the top half so it's almost in that angle that it "snaps" to when you open it to play, the metal hinge pieces will slide out of their holes a tiny bit, maybe a few millimeters, but they don't come loose and I can't get the halves apart. What am I missing?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it seem to be a mechanism that it only comes out at a certain angle, which means...i think you need to put the top and the bottom together again, keep the 2 little metal cylinders ALL THE WAY IN, this is important, since if they are not all the way in, they wont come out even if at the right angle. yes i know they can be pushed out a couple millimeters, but ignore that fact, in fact, avoid doing that. only push out the two cylinders when you are snapped at the usual play angle, and make sure they are all the way in (cant stress that enough)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
