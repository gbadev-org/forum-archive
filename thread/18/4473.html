    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, you could be 5 feet from a group of people playing First Hunt deathmatch and your DS wouldn't even know it. I mean I know you could see them, but say you couldn't. Why didn't they add a feature in the OS where the DS would search for any multiplayer games happening at that moment? Or better yet be able to find other DS's even if their not playing wireless? I know this means that all DS's would have to be giving off a wireless signal when not playing multiplayer and would suck the battery down quicker, but if they made ever DS give off a signal every 30 seconds or so, it wouldnt be all that bad, right? Just an idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a 3rd party or even Nintendo would release a cart that allows you to detect other DS's using wireless without having the same game.....it'd be nice IMO.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's probably not supported in current games or something. It clearly says that the DS can wake up if it senses other units in the vicinity (actively). Maybe this points to a firmware upgrade of some sort. I know that people have also been complaining about how you have to restart the system everytime you change a setting in the DS main menu.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
The manual of Mario64 also clearly states that you cannot join a multiplayer which has already been started (supposedly because of the multiboot transfert required).
<br/>
Your suggestion would then be only valid if you have the corresponding cartridge in your DS 
<br/>
<br/>
Moreover and AFAIK, Mario64 does the multiboot transfert even if you have the game in your console, because there can be only one master at all. Dses that have already a cartridge inside are supposed to be masters.
<br/>
<br/>
I may be wrong though, so do not hesitate to correct me if I'm wrong.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the multiboot prevents this, yeah.

Hopefully once wireless sniffing gets figured out we can pop a patch into Netstumbler so you can detect it from your PocketPC, or write a sniffing app or something for the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've used wi-fi tons on planes, they only care during takeoff and landing. As long as the sniffer isn't actively sending out pings to look for other devices (like Kismet on aggro mode does) it shouldn't ever send out a signal, and just intercept other DS' "I'm Alive" signals.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
