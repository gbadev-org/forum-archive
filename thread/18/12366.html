    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had my Supercard Lite for a couple weeks now, and have found the DLDI driver on Chishm's site to be broken. Any home brew application I patch with it, even Chishm's DLDI_test corrupts my memory card completely after a write is performed. Funny enough, the card passes the DLDI tester, but the supercard gives an SD card error on the next reboot; plugging the microsd card into my PC shows that the drive is corrupt.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else experienced this problem? I'd assume I have the revised, less compatible SC lite, as I received it not more than a few weeks ago.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any suggestions, they'd be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Hmm, turns out the issue is with 1GB Kingston Taiwan Microsd cards only. No problems with a Sandisk card. Both of my Kingstons corrupt every time data is written.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Doom5 on Thu Feb 08, 2007 10:41 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I had the same problem with my GBAMP, and later noticed even Windows writing to the card was corrupting it. :-/<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wish I knew about this "new" revision before I made my purchase. I just wanted a good homebrew Slot 2 solution that fully supported GBA(memory), DS, and had drivers written for it, which I thought it did.
<br/>
<br/>
Guess it's time to play the waiting game. If someone here has the asm knowledge to fix the driver, I'd gladly loan them my card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was having problems with my SCLite when I got it.  It was getting corrupt whenever I put too much on it.  Turned out the problem was the crappo SD reader I was using with my PC.  Even though I had done a bunch of copies using DSO, when I checked it on my PC it was corrupt.  The SD reader was doing something funky...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I've been using the SC Lite DLDI just fine; reads, writes, and all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

UPDATE: The SC SD driver passes the DLDI_test and doesn't corrupt my memory card. Great!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seconded. I had exactly the same problem with my Kingston 1gb micro, Started using the SD DLDI patch, and it works like a charm. So I don't the individual card is defective, but I am curious as to why it is specifically a Kingston problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
