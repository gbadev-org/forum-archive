    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you were to copy a gba binary to slot-2 ram and switch to gba mode, would it boot into the supercard menu or to the gba binary?
<br/>
I just had this crazy idea to send small gba programs to the DS using wmb while I learn gba development.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to get this working but all it does is boot into the sc menu.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Got it working, needed sysSetBusOwners( true, true ); to work.
<br/>
Luminesweeper booted just fine through wmb :D</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lazy1 on Sat Mar 15, 2008 11:04 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Currently the process is as follows:
<br/>
1) Build GBA binary
<br/>
2) Inject GBA binary into wmb2gba DS binary
<br/>
3) Send DS binary using wmbhost
<br/>
<br/>
This is good for me since I can do tests faster on hardware without the need to swap carts.
<br/>
I'm not sure how many DS developers there are who want to step back and learn the GBA though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That might be faster and would allow larger binaries to be sent, unfortunately I have no way of connecting my DS to the internet atm so I cannot do it.

Maybe when the dswifi library gets updated...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
