I found that the top screen is broadcasted to  (or around ) channel 3 on an old tv.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i'm german and my dad brought me a US DS from his travel last year. (In the end i saved 30 euros in comparison to an european DS)
<br/>
<br/>
I also tried to get a tv signal from my DS, but without results. Then i took my old SNES antenna cable, wrapped it around the DS und plugged it into the tv.
<br/>
I manually searched through the frequenzies and finally found a picture. It went away, when i shut off the DS. The picture looked like a  shifted white frame, but i couldn't recognize any content from the DS. Maybe because i have a simple PAL-BG tv that can't process NTSC.
<br/>
<br/>
I later found out, that the tip of the cable was enough to receive the signal. The best and only receiving place was in back of the battery, at least for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope, that will help you :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Did Nintendo experiment with wireless connections to a TV as a user-selectable alternative to the TFTs? Only to dump it later for obvious reasons while accidentally leaving part of the original hardware designs in place?
<br/>
<br/>
Or is The Big N setting up a sinister demographic-polling scheme designed to provide enough information on the average gamer to conceive an apt world domination plot using our country's finest as mind-controlled pupets killing for the sheer promise of being allowed to play their favorite games as a reward?

All the FCC does is make sure it is within an acceptable range so that it doesn't make other devices malfunction.

Causing a scrambled picture when located 4 inches from a TV antenna is well within the acceptable region for unwanted interference.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Actually they had a few of these adapters when they were demoing the DS way back when. I can't remember which show it was (wasn't E3), but it was very close to release day.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the cable plugged into the back of the DS, was a bright blue (incase you can locate pictures), and can be seen on some of the movies that were on GameSpot. The video out was then projected onto a large screen behind the presenter. I think it was most visible for the demos of Spider-Man 2 and The Urbz, os see if there's videos for those on GameSpot.
<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the gaming sites asked them about the adapters but they said they weren't for sale and interal use only, so I'd doubt if we'll see any official ones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It is more than likely that it's an unintended sideffect of the unit, that is pretty understandable. If you think about how electricity carries the signals around your DS and your TV, then it is possible that if they're broadcasting (even to their own screen) on a channel the other broadcasts on (in this case, channel 3) then you will see at least some of image on a low grade television, providing you get close enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">See, I understand most will say it is interference, but from what I have learned, it would most likely be in a form of a static image ( like noise). A television receives radio wave signals to cause the picture tube to draw an image, Not digital data. From every thing I have read, doesnt the DS operate with Digital data. The point I am trying to make is that LCDs do not use radio ways to operate, they use  1,0's (Binary)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also note that in order to transmit video data to a TV, one must modulate the transmitted signal specifically for that to happen.
<br/>
So the DS is using NTSC compatible signal modulation for some reason.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem must lie with the way the screens expect image data...
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps someone will publish a hack one day which exploits this trait and allows for on-tv playing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In order to display a color image on a TV using the antenna input, you need a normal greyscale scanline signal, and on top of that greyscale signal you must put a color carrier signal at 5-6MHz. That carrier must be phase modulated according to the color you want.
<br/>
This is a "composite video signal".
<br/>
In order to receive it on the antenna input of a TV, you need to produce a video carrier, and modulate this carrier with the composite video signal.
<br/>
<br/>
Greyscale ghost images on TVs can be caused by normal interference, But not color images.
<br/>
<br/>
66MHz happens to be the frequency of the main CPU, so that would explain why the image appears on channel 3. I can't explain the second image at channel 8.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
