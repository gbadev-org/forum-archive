So, if I'm reading that page right, developers can tell the temperature of the touch screen?  And where in the screen are these temperature diodes?  (ie top left, bottom right, etc)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The diodes are on the die of the TSC, not on the touch screen itself, and fairly innaccurate.  According to the datasheet, I can read to an accuracy of 2 deg C without a callibration step, but I got bogus values using their formula, will play with it later.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not certain what you're going to do with a rough idea of the temperature of the DS as a whole, but I'm sure someone will think of something :D<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

I'd guess that the big N didn't list it as a feature it's because they want to be able to switch touch screen suppliers and not have to explain why the alleged temp sensor disappeared. It could also just be that the temp senses are used to normalize the touch screen readings somehow as touching the screen when it is cold or hot may affect the readings.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Again, this is only speculation, but, perhaps the temperature sensors are there so games can tell the difference between a player using their finger on the screen (picking up the body heat from your finger, wouldn't have to be 100% accurate for that), as opposed to the thumb strap or stylus.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree. It might just be a feature of that particular model of touchscreen, and it's not officially intended for use with the DS games.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#36057 - Joat - Mon Feb 14, 2005 6:47 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got the measurements working now, the formula relies on the Vref voltage, which is normally 2.5 V, but Nintendo have run Vcc to Vref.  Using 3.3 V in the calculation instead netted very realistic numbers and the results fit on the curve given in the datasheet.
<br/>
<br/>
It's nothing to do with the touch screen, as I said, it's measured in the touch screen controller chip, which lies *inside* the case, a little bit underneath the ABXY cluster.  It's fine for ambient readings, but basically nothing you do to your DS that doesn't also affect the rest of the air around it (like going outside, or refridgerating your DS) will have any impact on the readings (which are only accurate to around 2 deg C anyways, it jumps between 25 and 27 deg C in my office).
<br/>
<br/>
I never said it was *useful*, but I wanted to get it working anyways.  I imagine the original purpose of including the hardware in the TSC (which is an off the shelf chip used in a lot of devices) was to provide overheat detection or enable a fan.  2 deg C accuracy on a chip near some other warm chips would give you enough resolution to know when to turn on a cooling fan.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice one figuring it out Joat. It may not be of much use for development purposes, but I have a use for it. When Animal Crossing DS comes out I'm going to start a rumour that it uses the temp chip to affect the game; like there are less fish around when your DS is cold, or it's harder to make big snowballs when your DS is hot: then sit around and see how many people believe it, or even claim they have proof of it. &lt;evil _laugh/&gt;

I would be interested to see your findings. Of course, if you are ever found out doing this, I will personally smite you. Oh, I will deny ever speaking to you too. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
