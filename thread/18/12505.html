Is this AP-less functionality exposed in dswifi?

I remember someone did a DS download play thing recently and I vaguely remember it not requiring an access point...

Guess what I'd like to use this for :-D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DSwifi does not have any support for DS to DS(adhoc) communications; I do wonder if the code from the above mentioned program would aid at all in the development of adhoc support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He was completely/utterly unable to get a DS-DS style AD HOC connection due to lack of documentation and lack of processing power.

<br/>
I'm sure someone might be able to do it someday but as we speak.. its not possible using DSwifi<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

Oh and probably unrelated: Did you guys know that the DS 'download stations' are just a DS with a charger running a cartridge in them allowing for download play?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But, figuring out registers to be in the proper mode, and then using NiFi to communicate isn't going to be as easy.  Unless, you create a SoftAP within the game/application.  And then, each DS would still require a means of running homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yet. TGB Dual, NO$GMB, and several other PC-based emulators of the 8-bit Game Boy could emulate more than one Game Boy system on one PC, connected through an emulated link cable. It's only a matter of time before PCs become fast enough that an emulator can emulate multiple Nintendo DS systems and/or to virtualize the packet interface to the PC's networking layer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
