    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">? can't find it back, so i'll post it here. Is it possible to cut on the FPS (60) to get more polygons per seconde if you do 30 FPS? I have not really the time for it to look for it somewhere, and someone wishes too know it.
<br/>
<br/>

That was <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> the point asking who's time was more valuable. It's just that i'm to busy atm that i don't have the time looking for it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.picfront.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">www.picfront.com [ Upload your pictures ]</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

AFAIK even when we can do that it would be tricky, unless we have a way to capture/write the depth buffer every scanline -_-<br/>_________________<br/>If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, why the heck do you care?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How did games efficiently do depth sorting in the era of software rendering, when a Z buffer was considered too expensive? They used things such as BSPs (binary space partitions), portal engines (a generalization of raycasting), and model sorting. It's tricky, but near the end of DS lifetime, games will be expected to pull it off.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Ain't that revealing a bit too much.
<br/>
<br/>
Meh, as long as mysterious NITRO dev documents don't start flying all over the 'net, with a hidden embedded footprint with sajimori's dev team "written all over it". That wouldn't be a good thing, now would it? :P<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It reveals nothing. Nintendo's sprite engines have had the equivalent of a depth buffer ever since the NES. Change "priority" to "depth" throughout the Super NES or GBA documentation, and see if it doesn't look more familiar.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, you wouldn't need to keep the depth buffer if you draw everything in back during one frame and draw everything in front during the next. Sorting in world space before submitting your models to the OpenGL implementation would be straightforward using a BSP or portal engine.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

However, I know "from someone" that it is possible to display 3D on both screens by using one frame to display it on the bottom screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could get more polys by software rendering them to textures (or even sprites - as was done by a few GBA games)
<br/>
<br/>
For example, in a racing game, you could software render a car into a texture, then put it in the hardware 3D scene as a billboard
<br/>
<br/>
Tricky to do well, but definitely possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've often heard that technique referred to as 'imposters'.
<br/>
<br/>
In particular, you can use it to save rendering time on things far away that either won't be moving much, or perspective will not shift on them much. Clouds, or trees in the far distance.
<br/>
<br/>
Only re-render those when perspective has shifted a certain amount, or they get within a certain distance.
<br/>
<br/>
Downside is this technique requires more ram (as you're generating a lot of textures), which is at a premium on the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
