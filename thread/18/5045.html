    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi all
<br/>
<br/>
apolagies in advance for posting in wrong section (i know some of you guys know the ds inside-out... well nearly :D )
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i have an imported ds from the us with a us copy of mario 64. Every now n then the sound seems to go really phased (like its part of the game) it doesnt seem to clear until i restart, ive tried changing the sound to stereo,surround,headphones etc doesnt seem to stop it.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason i post here as it appears to possibly be a bug with maybe my ds, or infact the game. its quite annoying i just hope its not a faulty ds.
<br/>
<br/>
thx for any help given on this strange problem im experiencing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If when the DS goes into sleep mode, if it's registers are resetted, maybe the sound bug would go away. So closing the unit and then reopening it might do the trick.

You got that idea after starting Panel de Pon.mb from PogoShell and then noticing that PogoShell's sound bias bug got cleared up if you went into Panel de Pon's SURIIPU-MOODO and back, didn't you?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I haven't. I only thought the whole sleep mode thing would work if it was similar to how the GBA would require certain registers to be dealt with before the actual sleep mode was initiated. Still, it's only an idea. Maybe someone will get lucky and have that bug again, and will try the sleep-mode trick (would that be considered lucky? lol).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hiya,
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking about Mario 64DS (US), there is also a bug in the "maze cave" (or something like that) level. When you go down the lift platform to descend toward the underground lake (with the dragon-like monster), if you stick Mario with the back on the wall (facing the lake direction) and position the camera behind him (pressing R), you'll notice the camera passes in/behind the wall and start going away until you see the entire level. Goes back to normal when you press R again or move the camera. Strange.
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno whether it has been fixed on the other releases of the game.
<br/>
