    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I've gotten .ds.gba games like Omalone working on my DS via GBA flash carts, and I've gotten devkitPro to compile programs to .ds files, and those .ds files run on emulators, but I can't figure out how to convert .ds files to .ds.gba files so I can run my own code.
<br/>
<br/>
I found Darkain's ndspatch and WRG's loadme, but they both give me errors when I try to run them. (ndspatch specifically gives the error "Couldn't not find instruction 'ldr r0, [r1, #0x14]', aborting", and I don't know if that means there's a problem in ndspatch or in my .ds file)
<br/>
<br/>
Please help! Thanks! :)X</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nevermind. I found dsbuild.exe in the devkitARM/bin directory, and that seems to have fixed it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
