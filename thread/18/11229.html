    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it is really possible at all if you plan to retain the original case and look of the case.  First, you have to take into account the space.  Any "decent" speaker will most likely have a heavier (bigger) magnet.  Basically, the speakers are a little bigger than headphones.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, you have to match the impedence (ohms) to the current speakers or get higher impedence ones.. which will reduce the volume.  If you get lower impedence ones, it will increase the volume but add stress to the internal amp, and if you go to low you will most likely blow the amp or the speakers, as most speakers are blown due to distortion, not over power, and running lower impendance speakers will cause the amp to distort at a lower volume setting.
<br/>
<br/>
Idealy, you would get better quality speakers and also add another amp to power them.. but, good luck getting them to fit into what is already a pretty small space as well as power the extra amp if you add one.
<br/>
<br/>
You'd be better of trying to make a "speaker docking station" that the DS would plug into that used 'C' or 'D' size batteries to power the speakers with an internal amp and just plug it into the headphone jack on the DS.  The quality of the output of the DS is quite good.  Plug it into your home stereo system (if you haven't already) and see how nice it actually is.  Even with a nice set of headphones the quality is pretty darn good.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

small, no external power reguired, only thing is, will the quality and volume be good? Their cheap so i dont really mind buying them to see, but chances are they cant be that bad if they were made mp3 players in mind.

<br/>
Jabba, have you even opened the DS up to see what the current speaker imedence is? And what impedence the speakers you linked to are?
<br/>
<br/>
The feeling I get:
<br/>
<br/>
Speakers fit, and sound better: .01%
<br/>
Speakers fit, and sound worse: 40%
<br/>
Speakers don't fit and sound worse: 45%
<br/>
Speakers fit, and blow the internal amp: 9.09%
<br/>
Internal shorts from mod blowing something: 5%
<br/>
<br/>
Chance of a broken DS: 98%
<br/>
Chance of a DS in parts, but still working: 2%
<br/>
Project success (that being, replacing the speakers, them sounding better, and the DS going back together and no shorts): 0%<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One other thing i was thinking, was building the speakers in where the current ones are and maybe wiring them from the headphone jack, sound better?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't believe just putting in a better amp will help anything either.  I think you will find that you get the best sound + safety with an externally powered speaker that plugs into the headphone jack.  Headphone jacks aren't designed to power external speakers, except for the ones sitting on you ears,  which don't need near as much power to sound good.. because they are sitting on your ears.
<br/>
<br/>
So, even if you upgrade the amp, the speakers are matched to the internal amp and would probably either sound bad, or just blow.  The main issue is space and nothing else.  Speakers and amps are pretty easy, you just need room to fit them.
<br/>
<br/>
So, unless you are willing to mod the case, I don't see it possible to actually get any benefit out of it, as "sound quality and volume" is hard to measure by ear.  If you don't have a multimeter, I doubt you have a decimeter either.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Huh?  Where do you live?  There is NO Multimeter that I have ever purchased that have measured sound level. I have like 4 or 5 of them, all in the cheap range, I know FLUKE makes meters that can measure just about anything, but then again, they aren't cheap!
<br/>
<br/>
I just checked and I was spelling it wrong.. It's dosimeter.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's used to measure noice/sound and uses a very sensative microphone to measure decibels (db).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then it's just another voltmeter..  You have to have a microphone to measure sound pressure level, as you are actually measuring the amount of air that is being moved.  You can't measure that any other way.
<br/>
<br/>
Docimeters are commenly used to configure a home theater system so that you can tune each speakers output level to the proper amount to create a "sweet spot" at the center of your couch or chair.  Newer system have one built in, where you just place the included mic in the "sweet spot" and it will auto adjust all the speakers outputs to the proper level.. it's actually pretty awesome, as it does sonar type ticks to measure distances and stuff..  
<br/>
<br/>
And of course, they are the device used for automotive Sound Off competitions (reason I purchased mine).  Mine only goes up to 120db which isn't enough to run a system wide open, but is very helpful in figuring out what frequency to play to get the best cabin gain out of a vehicle.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
