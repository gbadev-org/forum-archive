    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was working on a spi to rs232 uart, and i accidentally shorted vcc and gnd in the NDS carrtidge slot, so now the DS doesn't do anything anymore (no powerled, nothing).
<br/>
There is no money to buy a new one at the moment.
<br/>
Can anyone tell me which are components likely to have been destroyed?
<br/>
I don't have the knowledge of electronics yet to deduce this by myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
