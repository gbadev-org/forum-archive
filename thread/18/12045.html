    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hate to be asking again for help with debugging something, but there's a problem with the soft reset code in Moonshell. Apparently, after the reset, the PSRAM is unusable, at least with the M3, requiring the system to be powered off. While this mainly affects running backups, it can also affect any homebrew that uses the PSRAM, which includes Moonshell itself.

His soft reset code is based largely off LoveLite.

Here is the source, if someone wants to take a stab at seeing what's wrong.

And if you don't mean the technical definition, it's the additional 32MB of memory on the M3.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, then it might be a problem with the M3 drivers. Are you resetting while a file is open?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How interesting... The behavior has changed in 1.6 final beta.
<br/>
If no file is playing, it either whitescreens or resets Moonshell improperly. If a file is playing, it seems to work right, as long as it's not in the middle of reading a new file (in which case, it just whitescreens).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
