    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ran a checksum on the IO registers on the DS and the SP between 0x4000000 and 0x4000FFF and when there was a difference I narrowed it down by chunks and found a couple of differences.

Grab crccheck.gba from there and see what numbers you get on different systems with a flash card. If possible run it in single-rom mode so the loader on your flash card doesn't intefere with the results.

EDIT:

<br/>
Seems the difference at 0x4000800 was well known as a missing hidden register, but why the timer control data shows up different is something I would like to know.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
