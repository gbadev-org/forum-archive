    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As you may know, Moonshell 2 includes a feature that allows you to load a file with a given extension with a given homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
you just need to rename your homebrew as [ext].yourapp.nds and place it in the extlink folder of Moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing is that this homebrew has to be able to handle this feature, and Moonlight apparently did a lib for that (that doesn't seem to be included in Moonshell for the moment. If you have it, I want it :))
<br/>
<br/>
It's used with ysmenu to load nds roms directly from Moonshell, and replacing your flashcard kernel with Moonshell (pretty cool, compared to the lamy DSTT kernel I had)
<br/>
<br/>
What we need now is that feature included in all our cool homebrews (Especially emulators).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
