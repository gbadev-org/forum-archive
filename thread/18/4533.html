    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this is mainly out of curiosity. i was wondering if anything can be programed on a gba flashcart that could utilize both screens? my main reason for asking is because of the gba movie player that uses compact flash cards. i was justing thinking how cool it'd be to have that with a control menu on the touch screen with videos playing on the top screen. however i have no idea if the gba hardware of the ds is even connected to both screens, so let me know what you more knowledgable people think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I mean, remember the 'added functionality' for GBA games on DS for free? That only uses a GBA cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
"Added functionality for GBA games" could just refer to reading the BIOS checksum, determining whether it matches the GBA or DS, and unlocking a door in the GBA game based on the result, as happened in the <span style="font-style: italic">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle</span> games for GBC.

Nintendo said a lot of things. Remember 64DD?[/pessimist]
<br/>
<br/>
If and when Nintendo does it, I'm sure there will be teams of eager developers getting their hands on it and tearing it apart, though (TBH, it would be really cool to have a version of the homebrew GBA Chaos with stylus control -- but I'm just dreaming).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
