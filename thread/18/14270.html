    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to programming on the Nintendo DS. I've got the input system figured out in "libnds" and messed with the framebuffer mode. I have the following questions, and I'll be glad if someone can help me out.
<br/>
<br/>
1. I referred to Patater's manual, it demostrated how to display a sprite and a background. I need to know how can I display a level consisting of many tiles like those in a top down shooter or a side scroller.
<br/>
<br/>
2. How can you reject the background (e.g, the color magenta) in a sprite? Do you use gfx2gba for that?
<br/>
<br/>
3. How would one carry out animations? i.e how can I move on to the next frame of animation?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by phoenix23 on Fri Oct 05, 2007 2:52 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Some of the really good ones I referred to have these sections under development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS hardware background and sprite modes work nearly identically to the GBA ones, so most GBA tutorials on using those will apply to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If by saying "reject the color magenta" you mean "having one color of my choice transparent", that's easy: pixels using the first color palette entry (for both sprites and backgrounds) are always drawn transparent.
<br/>
<br/>
And for animations, well... just switch the sprite image every few frames to animate them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, thank you very much for that valuable insight. I shall look into GBA tutorials. I could find just one DS tutorial that was incomplete, but intended to answer all the questions I had.
<br/>
<br/>
About the keyframe animation, I know how one would do that in general, but I couldn't figure how would you do it on the DS.
<br/>
What I was wondering was how would you access a particular frame of an image (say frame 3) in order to render it.
<br/>
I did not know that the rendering pipeline is the same for the GBA and the DS. Once again, thanks bunches for that information :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I did was I had the whole animation in a bmp or some other raster file.  I would know how big each frame was and from there I could calculate the offset to the i-th frame.  Also, it helps if the frames were lined up in a column instead of a row in the bitmap.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
