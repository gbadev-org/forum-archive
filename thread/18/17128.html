    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I am modifying the homebrew frambuffer tutorial <a href="http://double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop2.html" target="_blank">http://double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/nds_develop2.html</a> such that the red rectangle moves to the point that was touched. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now I've got the example as is to work just fine. But, the touchRead in my main while loop never reads the touched value- always zero. If I put my drawing routines in the while loop (which obviously causes the rectangle to move along really fast) and remove the InitInterruptHandler(); etc.- then a touch is atleast detected. But if I put the InitInterruptHandler(); back in- again no touch.
<br/>
<br/>
I was going through previous posts- and I got the feeling that such behaviour is expected. However- those posts did not say how this problem could be solved.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

InitInterruptHandler(); has been removed since some time (since libnds 1.3.1, if I'm not mistaken) so don't use it.
<br/>
<br/>
To read touch position, do that:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">touchPosition touch; touchRead(&amp;touch);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
maybe you can check the 1st example of this page of my tutorial, <a class="postlink" href="http://wcms.teleion.it/users/cgq/nds/tutorial/video.html" target="_blank">here</a> (text and code comments are in Italian, but it shouldn't be a big problem...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">#1 That leads to a bigger question then about how vblank or any other interrupts should be handled another way?
<br/>
<br/>
#2 Also, this implies that a whole bunch of stuff on that website is outdated. Is there a place where I can find more recent stuff?
