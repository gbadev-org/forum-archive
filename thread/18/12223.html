    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
ComicBookDS V2.0 Beta is available.
<br/>
The homepage is updated (userguide, install instructions, history, ...)
<br/>
It's here : <a class="postlink" href="http://Gnese.free.fr/NDS/ComicBookDS/" target="_blank">http://Gnese.free.fr/NDS/ComicBookDS/</a>
<br/>
I've created a new page for ComicBookDS free content here <a class="postlink" href="http://cbds.free.fr" target="_blank">http://cbds.free.fr</a>.
<br/>
It should evolve soon. :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't use the PAFS functionnality anymore, so compatibility should be improved. Instead, a FAT access is performed thanks to the new DLDI.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://Gnese.free.fr/NDS/" target="_blank">http://Gnese.free.fr/NDS/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Feel free to take all the stuff from <a class="postlink" href="http://homebrewcast.com/comic" target="_blank">http://homebrewcast.com/comic</a>. No one contributed, so I stopped, but the files are still there. Also, they are like version 1.2 files, so they are a bit outdated. But still good content.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We'll see if i have more luck.

The new .cbds format is easier to be shared. It might help.

Strange. :(
<br/>
I've got some questions : 
<br/>
Are the main thumbnails displayed (at application start) ?
<br/>
If you don't put any .cbds files in your card, can you navigate in the menus ?
<br/>
If yes, have you got the same problem with the sample : <a class="postlink" href="http://cbds.free.fr/Fichiers/La%20Vie%20De%20Norman.cbds" target="_blank">http://cbds.free.fr/Fichiers/La%20Vie%20De%20Norman.cbds</a> ?
<br/>

If I wait for all the thumbnails to load, I can click the arrow without issues.  If I try to press the arrow icon while the thumbnails are still loading, there's a chance it will freeze.
<br/>
<br/>
That said though, awesome release!  Glad to see the new version finally come out.  The application is very professional, and you somehow improve it each release.  Great job.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I have a M3 DS Simply and I patched the .nds file with the appropriate DLDI lib, I put everything in the root folder of my microSD and renamed the comics 1. and 2.
<br/>
<br/>
When the app loads everything seems to be working fine except for the fact that the touchscreen does not work at all. I can navigate through using the buttons but I would very much love to be able to use the tuchscreen. Has anyone else had this problem with an M3 Simply or R4, if so, is there a fix?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I also tried an unpatched version of the nds and returned an error about FAT.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I should add that the latest version of Warcraft Tower Defence also had this problem when the developer released a DLDI version, has something in the libraries changed that is breaking DLDI compatibility?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

FWIW, I can confirm that the M3 Simply DS has problems because of the PALIB: I?ve patched other homebrews and seen them work in a limited fashion or not at all. In particular, the touch screen functionality doesn?t work, even if the game or app does run.

Just got a DS Lite, nothing freezes now. The grey border wasn't flickering when I did it on my DS Phat. Must have been a problem with CPU power or something.

I converted a comic, copied it into the root of my card along with the ini files and the .nds. When I load it with start (as it freezes the DS before loading anything when I use a) after a long pause, it speaks it's greeting then prints "Fat Access not supported." 
<br/>
<br/>
With beta5 the borders would shimmer and I could move around the interface at this point but now with the final it just freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
Following Gnese's instructions on his comicbookds page I have also tried patching the .nds with m3sd.dldi and m3sd_alt.dldi found on chishm's dlditool page. Neither patched version works, they both act the same as the raw .nds version with the exception of loading instantly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm also a bit confused why you need to zip up the images only for it to unzip them again...)

Minor bug, there's a glitched line across the diagonal of the screen in portrait mode when you scroll around.
