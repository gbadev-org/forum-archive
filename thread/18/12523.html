    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
sorry if this sounds a bit redundant (its been mentioned a couple times here), but I want to use freetype in my app, and can't seem to figure out how to compile it for the DS. I've searched and found some people mentioning that they are using the library, but they don't explicitly say how they got it to work. I've found <a class="postlink" href="http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/navi-misc/nds/.message/2160" target="_blank">this</a>  and looking through the makefile just confuses me. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any helpful hints? Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: OK, got somethin going. I'll be sure to post more questions because i am retarded :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
