    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As promised, I am offering to the GBADev community my <span style="font-weight: bold">Display List Exporter for Maya </span>!
<br/>
<br/>
This tool uses the popular 3D software Maya to extract 3D data for use on the DS !
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.autodesk.com/maya" target="_blank">http://www.autodesk.com/maya</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It is written in MEL Script, Maya's scripting language.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a screenshot:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.vurtx.com/ds/DSDLExp.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This tool generates a display list in a .h file, already in a u32 variable, ready to be rendered with <span style="font-weight: bold">glCallList()</span> !
<br/>
<br/>
It's good for beginners who just want to get some 3D objects onto the DS and start experimenting.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What it does:</span>
<br/>
- Exports geometry, texture coordinates and vertex color
<br/>
- Easily scale the object (plus, blocks the export if the object is larger than -8 to +8)
<br/>
- Allows the manipulation of various settings for the UVs
<br/>
- Automatically saves everything into a handy u32 variable in a .h file
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What it does not (yet !) do:</span>
<br/>
- Exports polygon normals
<br/>
- Extracts the texture applied in Maya
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows the syntax for the polygon normals in FIFO, please tell me !  Once I know, I will be able to add support quite easily.  I know that NORMAL_PACK is in there somewhere, but I don't know all of the details.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">To use:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Create a 3D object in Maya.
<br/>
<br/>
Use the exporter to create the .h file.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, add something like this into your code:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#include "your3DObject.h"
<br/>
<br/>
glCallList(your3DObject);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at the excellent Display List example in the devkitPro install for more information...

If you want me to add a sample project, just let me know and I'd be happy to whip up something simple.

Are you planning to turn this into a proper file format with animation support and so on? Or just an exporter? I'm working on a texture converter, perhaps I could give you my code for use in this, or we could agree on a standard file format for DS textures?<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I would be interested in collaborating.  I don't know much about the texture format, 3D geometry is more of my specialty.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know much about animation either, but I'd like to support it one day.  For now, I just thought it would be fun to make a Display List exporter to get some simple objects going for beginners such as myself.
<br/>
<br/>
OK I've read a bit about tciny's work.
<br/>
<br/>
As I said in my first post, I'm not much of a programmer :)  The exporter gets the job done, and allows for all the features required for a complex model.
<br/>
<br/>
However, it does require Maya and it does creates a .h file... it doesn't create an intermediate format which is then interpreted at compile time.
<br/>
<br/>
I could take up the project of converting FBX or COLLADA into a Display List.  I don't think it would be that hard, but I only really know MEL Scripting and a bit of C and C++.

If you decide to do it, you?ll want to make sure to use COLLADA-DOM and not FCollada, since it doesn't run on Linux without some work. I'd also write a command line only converter, so conversion can be automated in Makefiles and portable on many platforms.

I took a look at the format, and it's not that complex... it has a lot of info that I would probably ignore... I just need the vertex positions, texture coords, normals and vertex colors.

<br/>
- Now exports the Normals on a per vertex basis
<br/>
- Added a tool to unlock the UVs (in case they are not exporting correctly)

- Various small tweaks and updates
<br/>
<br/>
Now the models can be lit with glLight.

You don't hear people say "yeah, I made a photoshop exporter for the DS without detours involving png".

Perhaps it's a relic from the time when 3D modeling programs were so vastly different that it was impossible to create a shared file format?

I don't mean that the Maya exporter is bad, I really hope that people will use it so I get cool games to play. But creating 3 seperate exporters for the same format seems like 3 times as much work as needed, not to mention they'll be  written in completely different languages.

seems like the community got used to annoying tool-chains :)
<br/>
to keep your example: the ds is capable of using a compressed texture format. wouldn't it be useful to have a plugin to export such format with preview etc directly from photoshop or gimp?
<br/>
the situation is more complex with 3d-software, which handles data internally in a much different manner as you actually require it.
<br/>
sure, you can use external tools to convert your data from one of the few standard-formats - but at the end it makes development just more time-consuming.<br/>_________________<br/>"The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I understand your argument, having exporters is clearly much more convenient for the artist. However, I do think that a few extra mouse-clicks to launch a seperate converter will by far pay up in the end. First of all, you'd need many different exporter for many different programs. I for one at least want a Blender exporter, I have some wierd free tools fetish.
<br/>
<br/>
Say we actually had people making exporters for the different programs, everything would be going nice. Now imagine the Blender guy got caught up in real life. A feature is desperately needed from the 3d, an extension to the file format must be made. But the Blender exporter still uses the old version, and no one understand the guy's code, or are willing to update it. The whole situation would lead to incompatible loaders and general pain and confusion.
<br/>
<br/>
To me, the effort the artist makes to use an external converter is not nearly the same as the effort it would take to successfully maintain exporters for all the popular 3d modeling programs. But that's just me I suppose, and I really won't complain if you make a 3ds max exporter. :P<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nothing like a bit of debate to keep this topic going ! :)
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with both of your points... I like having an exporter directly in the 3D software, because it is more convenient.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you have something external that's more generic, you could write a script to automate the process of converting.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Agreed that any external conversion step can and should be automated by the build process.  At first, that would make a converter for a generic format seem like the better approach.
<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense to be able to preview compressed textures in Photoshop because the artist needs to see what kind of loss is involved, but how does that relate to choosing whether to have a custom exporter or an external converter?  Neither approach automatically lets you preview what the model will look like on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Off the top of my head, the two potential problems with external converters are:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  The intermediate format may not contain as much information as is available to the exporter through the 3D application's API.  This is basically the question of whether COLLADA is broad enough to cover our needs.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  How does the artist select DS-related conversion settings that don't correspond to any native concept in the 3D application?  For instance, you may want a bitfield that allows the artist to specify which of the 4 hardware lights should apply to the model.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's a really good question. Perhaps an option in the converter/exporter/whatever (alphabetical order :P)? As for preview, the emulators seem to do a fairly good job emulating the DS's 3D hardware, so perhaps the converter/exporter/whatever could use OpenGL to display what the model almost would look like.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If converter options are used, the artist will need a convenient way to edit the options, i.e. not editing makefiles.
<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, I'd like to see these kinds of settings get saved with with the art file and parsed by the converter.  There could be a generic GUI-based editor for these settings that works directly on COLLADA files.  Edit: I should clarify that this might require some kind of "custom data" section in the COLLADA format; I know nothing about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Having a separate editor can be a little inconvenient, so built-in editors can also be made for specific 3D applications.  Still, a separate editor doesn't sound too bad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I imagine an asset directory, and a data directory. The converter is run in configure mode on every file, and saves a little text file with conversion instructions for that file. The Makefile calls the converter, which traverses the asset dir and puts the converted data in a data dir, updating files if they're changed. This could be taken a step further, one could write a configurer for the 3d modelers, which would act as an exporter, but it would just save to Collada and config file. I think that would be easier to manage than exporters for every scripting language.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, this would create a both programmer and artist friendly environment. For big projects, the asset dir could be shared with some versioning system software, and easily shared and tweaked by all team members, in different modeling programs even. Building would be a breeze.
<br/>
<br/>
Configuring could be made extremely simple. Save your art to the asset dir, start the converter and it tells you which assets need config files, so you can easily go through them, with preview and everything.

<br/>
The problem is to make all this sweetness. :D<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi ikaris, really great script, but I'm having trouble using it.
<br/>
<br/>
I can compile your DSViewerLights example, but when I run it in Dualis, the torus is missing.
<br/>
Fiddling with zoom, rotate doesn't bring it into view.
<br/>
I can get textured objects working in other demos.
<br/>
I've also updated my drivers (ATi Radeon 9000) and tried with multiple emulators, none of them work.
<br/>
<br/>
I modified your code to display in wireframe, incase it was a lighting problem, and the torus IS being drawn.
<br/>
But it jitters very quickly in one spot and you can't rotate or zoom on it.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I also get this when I try to load any displayLists (including your torus) into my demos and run with Dualis:
<br/>
OpenGL Error
<br/>
GL_INVALID_OPERATION(End)
<br/>
<br/>
All I'm doing is including the header and replacing the draw code with: 
<br/>
glCallList(displayList);
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thank you for your comments, I really appreciate it !

I like to know if people have been trying out the scripts, and that they work.

<br/>
DS Emulators are notorious for not being able to render Display Lists correctly...
<br/>

if anyone knows how I could modify my code to work better with an emulator, I'd be happy to know, but I think it's just not possible !

Correct me if I'm wrong !

<br/>
<br/>
I'm running Maya Personal Learning Edition 7.0.1 (I'm new to 3D modeling), and I made a model that I wanted to try out on the DS, so I got your script, and tried exporting, but it says this in the Script Editor...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
// Warning: line 191: fopen: unable to open file "C:\displayList.h" for mode  "w". //
<br/>
// Error: Path does not exist or file is read-only. //
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts? Obvious the path exists, but I also don't have any files called displayList.h either that could mess it up.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yes i was not aware that Maya PLE does not support that...

<br/>
I guess it makes sense because they dont want you to be able to get files out.
<br/>
<br/>
However, try make sure that displayList.h is not read only...
<br/>
<br/>
and maybe try changing the name of the file, like dispayList2.h

I would be more than happy to add this open to my exporter....

its really not hard to do... at the end of the process, I end up with a string which I can either write to a text file, or to the Maya History window.

I saw this method (ikaris's way) of getting 3D onto the DS, and just thought I'd give a shot at it, since this is the first time I ever dealt with 3D in programming, and a while since I touched a 3D modeling program.
<br/>

Mainly for kicks, but if I actually get somewhere in testing things out, I may try out a larger idea of mine that I've had for a while.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I see how the display lists are formed, and I hand-made a simple 6-sides box, using 12 triangles formed out of 3 vertices each, all having points of 0.5 or -0.5 on each axis, and assigning an RGB15 color of (15,15,15) per vertice.
<br/>
<br/>
Tried it on Dualis, and the box only showed up for a frame or so before disappearing. I thought I did something wrong for it to do that, since your first non-lit donut shows up on it, but I tried Ideas, and it actually showed it in all it's glory, hehe, although it didn't seem to do any Z-buffering.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping sometime soon I can get the hardware needed to test it out on the actual DS hardware, but until then, I'll just study a bit on the libraries and registers of the hardware and tinker with what is available.

Yes, I have. I'm actually using ikaris's own project code because I merely wanted to get an object displayed before I get into the more complicated parts of dealing with 3D.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I've never used OpenGL before (the DS uses a subset of OpenGL, right?), but it doesn't seem too complicated. I was messing around with ikaris's donut, editing a triangle here and there just to see how things would change on it. However, when I deleted a triangle from it (and made sure to adjust the command count), the entire donut does the same thing like my own cube in Dualis, displays for a frame and disappears afterwards. Not even the lighted donut with normals shows up on it, but I'm assuming that is more of an emulator problem. No problems with Ideas though, except for it being slower and no Z-buffer.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess in order to truely see if it is working, I'll need to get it running on hardware.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I have a Blender-&gt;Collada-&gt;Header file program setup already with an OpenGL preview. I want to use it for NDS dev too.
<br/>
<br/>
I've written it to use in OpenGL ES games. Currently it outputs one big array with vertex positions, normals, and texture coordinates. The ES program then sets up array pointers and calls glDrawArrays.
