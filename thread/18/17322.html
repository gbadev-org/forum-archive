To do so, go to /devkitPro/PAlib/source/ directory and run the clean.bat file, then the build.bat file.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to run either clean.bat or build.bat  it gives me the following error:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">/bin/sh: d/devkitPro/msys/bin/make.exe: No such file or directory
<br/>
make: *** [all] Error 1</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
When I checked other makefiles (in devkitpro's examples) I noticed that "direct" makefiles for one source folders work fine -  but makefiles used for a group gives the same error. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have Devkitpro 1.5.0 and PAlib 0912XX_beta. My OS is windows XP.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Relevant enviroment variables*:</span>
<br/>
DEVKITARM | d:\devkitPro\devkitARM
<br/>
DEVKITPPC | d:\devkitPro\devkitPPC
<br/>
DEVKITPRO | d:\devkitPro
<br/>
DEVKITPSP | d:\devkitPro\devkitPSP
<br/>
Path | d:\devkitPro\msys\bin; ... etc
<br/>
<br/>
What's going on here?
<br/>
<br/>
*(Originaly, all the Devkitpro variables were in the form "\d\devkitpro\..." but I changed them hoping it would make it work.  the makefiles that give me errors, don't work  either way - but should I change it back to "\d\devkitpro\..." anyway?)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit</span>: I tried checking variables using the set command - devkitpro variables are shown in "\d\devkitpro\..." format. even though they appear in the "Enviroment Variables" window in "d:\devkitpro\..." format . What?!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I did quite a mess with the enviroment variables... but the problem seems to be solved -_-;
<br/>
<br/>
The story is, I set "make" command manually beforehand as "/d/devkitpro/msys/bin/make.exe" (thinking it should be written like DEVKITPRO and the others; not knowing that "path" already takes care of it and other msys tools - I only had the basic understanding of enviroment variables as "system shortcuts" ).
<br/>
<br/>
Later, I  tried removing the "make" variable, but unknowingly, a certain program (free Commander) would crazily bring it back for some reason (and so it would reset other things I tried changing).
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I tried closing that program and then the "make" variable was finally removed. Later I changed the original devkitpro variables back to "/d/devkitpro/..."
<br/>
<br/>
After all that, "make" command finally works both with PAlib (build/clean.bat too) and with other makefiles (until the next time I mess it &gt;.&gt;;)
<br/>
<br/>
Now I just want to make sure my envioment variables are correct. So what are the Enviroment Variables set for DevKitPro ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also,  PALib just interacts with devkitarm, it doesn't really change how devkitarm works, does it? Is there really any harm in keeping it ? (likely for its source code)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably check the available links for a good tutorial but if you have ones you recommend I'd be glad to hear it. (So far I made a quick follow through dev-scene's incomplete tutorial. patater's seems over comprehensive for me right now)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't see any harm in keeping it. It's just a library as far as I know (I've never used it so don't quote me on that). Others might chime in with a better answer on this.

You got me there. I'm not sure of a complete, high level tutorial for the DS. I just learned stuff by poking around libnds examples, library source code, reading GBATEK, and a bunch of trial &amp; error.
<br/>
<br/>
This seems to come up a bit: Is there a decent, recent, complete tutorial for the DS? I was somewhat excited to accidently find a paper some guy wrote for his master's degree that looked like a pretty good and complete write-up on the DS. My smile went upside down when I was told it was out-of-date. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the post about it: <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=17068" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=17068</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone could contact the writer and ask for permission to use the DS part of his paper. If allowed, we could begin bringing it up to date. At the very least it would be a good base to start with. Maybe even wiki it. I dunno, I'm just talking out my ass.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is best for newcomers to skip PAlib because in the end you would have to port your PAlib project to libnds (which is painful if you don't know how the DS works).
<br/>
<br/>
Starting with plain libnds means you will be able to access official devkitPro support &amp; you won't rely on third-party tools that might get outdated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The reason devkitPro doesn't support PAlib is basically due to the damage their installer caused to a devkitARM installation. At one point, rather than fix their library to work with the latest tools they chose to overwrite tools and libraries with older and/or modified versions. This resulted in a situation where none of the libnds examples would compile.
<br/>
<br/>
Please don't read the PAlib source code, follow PAlib tutorials or listen to anything PAlib fans tell you, you'll regret it later.
