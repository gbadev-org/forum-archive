    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are many different ways of doing this.  You can hardcode the relative file names into the make file or even the absolute value into the make file.  The prefernece is up to you.  Generally how you do it depend on your preference on the build environment.  When I create a project I just put all the code I want compiled into my source directory in the project and my make file finds all the files and compiles then with the output going into my build directory.  Then the link step links all of them into an elf.   My current make file is tageted at GBA code but with minor changes it can do DS.  See <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10923" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10923</a> for a sample setup.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
