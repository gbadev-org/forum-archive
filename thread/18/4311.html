    <h4>#28422 - mymateo - Sun Oct 31, 2004 6:01 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read some early specs that said the DS would only be capable of 3D graphics on one screen at a time.  Since then, I've seen some screenshots (no videos, just stills) that would suggest 3D is possible on both screens.
<br/>
<br/>
My theories:
<br/>
<br/>
(1) One screen is pre-rendered with the 3D hardware and kept as a still image on one screen, while the second screen has real-time 3D.
<br/>
<br/>
(2) The DS has enough VRAM and is capable of moving it fast enough to render simpler 3D scenes (60,000 polys) at, I dunno, 30 FPS.  It renders to the buffer and flips it onto the screens like a bitmapped mode.
<br/>
<br/>
(3) It's all in my mind, or I'm just too hopeful.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any insight or information that can confirm or deny my theories?  Just thought I'd ask!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, it can have 3d on either of the screens, but not both screens at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm sure there's ways of getting around that and making it *seem* like there's more than that going on. (One prerendered, one realtime.  Or one hardware, one software. etc.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was 100% prerendered on both screens.  It was just playing back a video.

I've asked before, and I'll ask again; Can you post a link to a screenshot or video that <span style="font-style: italic">shows</span> this phenomenon? 
<br/>
I saw the E3 video of this game. Yes, it showed a pikachu running from one screen to the other, but it <span style="font-style: italic">never</span> appeared on <span style="text-decoration: underline">both screens at once</span>. It removed itself entirely from the first screen before entering the second.
<br/>
Judging from the video, here's my best guess as to how this effect was achieved; The grass and background are pre-rendered, and displayed as a static background. The pikachu is then drawn over top by the 3D chip. Despite the fact that both screens appear to have 3D backgrounds, and pikachu appears to move effortlessly between the two, the DS can only display 3D on one screen at any given time. Anything else is just smoke and mirrors.

The GBC is a little before my time, I didn't really start programming untill it was pretty much on it's deathbed. But I believe the technique Mike is alluding to is palette manipulation during the Hblank. It was good for displaying high-colour static images on the GBC, although the actual number was closer to 2500. Of course the GBA is powerfull enough to do video with this technique, and so is DS. I'm sorry to burst anyone's bubble, but Mike wasn't letting slip any great secret (he want's to keep his job), he was saying 3D on both screens is likely pre-rendered.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">May I add that in pac n roll, there is REAL 3D on both screens, the actual game on top and a 3D ball on the touch screen, the thing is, it's really just a ball, there might be enought power to spare some to do basic 3d stuff on the seconde screen, or cutting the frame rate in half and doing it on both. Anyway, the things I read point to the DS NOT having a frame buffer. In the end, what should be expected is 3D on one screen and 2D on the other.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know I could be wrong but <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cube-europe.com/news.php?nid=6748" target="_blank">here</a> in this movie at 4:19, if you watch for a few seconds you see Pikachu fish on the top screen and then the fish is sent to the bottom screen and Pikachu dances in the distance, while the fish is moving. 
<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong though, since the rest of the Pikachu demo needed him to completely vanish from one screen and appear on the other.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Um... I'm sorry, I looked for where you've asked this "before", but was unable to find it in this topic...  If you asked, it must have been in another topic.  So apologies if nobody answered your request...
<br/>
<br/>
But, it seems zazery answered your request, so I guess I don't need to.  But I will anyways!  Besides, that's what this topic is about  :)  - discussing whether it was possible for 3D on two screens at once.
<br/>
<br/>
Go to gamespot (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamespot.com" target="_blank">http://www.gamespot.com</a>), go to Feel the Magic: XY/XX and look at the movie <span style="font-weight: bold">Official Trailor 1</span>, and at 1:15, you can see the girl lean towards the screen.  Up until that point, you can tell which screen was 2D, but at that point both screens look like they were done in 3D.  Sorry, I can't post a link to it (you need to be signed in to download it), and you need to go to their site to watch it streamed.  Here's the link for the site, hopefully works:

<br/>
There are two screens, and one rendertarget split in half. So simple. It draws the same rendertarget buffer over both screens. The screens aren't that big you know. So why two screens instead of one large screen? Well, Nokia N-gage has that 90 degree screen size that no one seemed to love.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Zazery, I'm currently downloading that video you posted. The short one goes bad about halfway through, so I'm downloading the larger one. But at 32 MB it may take a while for my slow Telus dial-up connection to do the job. I'm also going to check out mymateo's link.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and just FYI LOst?, The DS doesn't use a framebuffer of any sort. the 3d is rendered directly to the LCD in question.

Allmost... You can probably switch which screen that should be doing 3D halfway, so you can probably have the bottom of the first screen and the top of the second screen doing 3D at the same time =)<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a lot of lawsuits tossed around by people that already know they don't have a case.  It's used as a business tactic.  Hasbro Interactive,  for example, did that when sueing a bunch of budget game developers with the intention of drowning them in legal fees to force a settlement. For the most part it worked; only one of the companies they sued held out until Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames. And Nintendo is known for having some iffy lawsuits as well.  Unless the book "Game Over" is inaccurate, Howard Lincoln is one heck of a lawsuit-happy sob.  Come to think of it, I think he admitted it in an interview once.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
