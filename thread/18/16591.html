    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
I am begginer to NDS and have couple of questions if anyone have little time to help me.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Extended  - 256 colors x 16 palletes
<br/>
Is this apply to engine on start and all screens in game need to use those 16 predefine pallets , or i can use 256c x 16 for each screen i have.
<br/>
<br/>
2, Direct Bitmaps BGs - this is very little documented
<br/>
I have lots of static screens, so .. can i use 256x192 true color bitmap to draw background, and 5~6 smaller for example 50x50 true color bitmaps for animation like clouds faces etc. Similar as in win32 with bitblt to draw whole scene.  Or should i stick to BG tiles/objects and extended pallets.
<br/>
<br/>
Point is that there is not much animation and action on screen , but images are rally beautiful/complex and i would like to keep them that way when i put them on screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Emulating existing hardware features using software blitting is fairly slow on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Using the 3d hardware to draw in 2D would allow you to use truecolor textures as "sprites", giving you what you're after.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I never used it but there should be a 15bpp BMP mode that could be just what you need for your background.
<br/>
Maybe you can read the example <a class="postlink" href="http://dev-scene.com/NDS/Tutorials_Day_3#Bitmap_Graphics_Modes" target="_blank">here</a> (uses MODE_5_2D and background #3 in BG_BMP16_256x256 mode)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
