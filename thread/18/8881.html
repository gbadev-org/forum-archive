The DS, on the other hand, is rather new, so there are still new games being distributed and millions of active users who could pirate them if they were given dev kits.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Where did you read that Nintendo released the official N64 devkits? I couldn't find such news in the few gaming news websites I browse.
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds more like "someone leaked N64 SDK software on eMule" or something.
<br/>
<br/>
And if Nintendo simply gave away DS SDKs, why would they go through all the trouble of triple-checking a company and making them go through several NDAs before allowing them access to the SDKs and the developer boards? When a developer licenses the SDK, they are bound by contract to protect it and prevent it from being seen by unlicensed eyes with their lives (they even require the developer to proof that their facilities can offer enough security to prevent the development units from being stolen or destroyed).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Where's it say that Nintendo has released this devkit to the masses?  It probably just somehow ended up on eBay and Nintendo didn't care since the N64 is no longer with us.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
