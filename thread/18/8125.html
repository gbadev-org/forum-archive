You can also replace the DS slot with an SD slot. Who needs a DS slot anyways?

Upgrading the RAM was a nice idea though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Upgrade the DS slot with an SD....how will I play my DS games?!  Haha, I am actually using a broken DS.  Whats broken on it?  Well, to be honest....just the hinge.  I got it for 50$  :p  Next, I would use the SLOT-3 for even bigger memory expansion.  Let's say I get about 8 megs......thats still pretty small, it would be cool if I could attach an SD to the memory and expand it.  It might require a chip, but I bet I could get one in development.  Finally, just for the record, I would never, I mean never ever mod my good DS.  I dont wan't to hurt my baby...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">...You plan to add an SD slot in place of the RAM? You do realize that SD cards are far slower than RAM and wear out after a few million writes?
<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea though. If you could add RAM, I bet games might start activating debug features. The debug systems have 8MB and it's just an SWI call that tells if you're on a normal or debug system. (You could just hack the game to assume it returns true, but then it'd try to use nonexistant memory. :-/)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#67585 - HyperHacker - Thu Jan 19, 2006 5:24 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the only feasible thing to use in place of RAM is more RAM. Flash memory is slower and can only handle between 10,000 and 10,000,000 writes (depending on the chip), optical/magnetic media should be pretty obvious, and everything else is way too expensive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#74201 - silent_code - Fri Mar 03, 2006 1:55 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm no expert, but i don't think commercial games would waste rom space and runtime for debug features. if i made a final/release build of a game there would be no debug stuff at all... so i suggest commercial games would neither use additional ram nor any other development systems features and you definitely wouldn't see any debug info. the nds is quite limited as you know. if someone put debug stuff into a pc release noone'd care, but on a nds? i doubt it.

i just might be getting something wrong. if that's the case, i'm sorry and please correct me.

though developers tend to release multiple versions on hte market during a products life time - like other nintendo games where bugs have been fixed and stuff... i think in metroid prime some loading crashes (!) have been fixed in later versions.

Some of that stuff, with GoldenEye at least, I bet it was because they still needed that size of cart, so they probably figured why bother since it won't do us any good anyway. ;)[/quote]<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
