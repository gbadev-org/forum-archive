    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you think there would be anyway to emulate that? It's pretty much making a mod of an old mouse or something to the DS. It would work similar to the emulator on the computer but actually using a mouse?
<br/>
Comments appreciated..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Funny you should mention that. There was a link posted in IRC the other day to a japanese game with what looks very like an optical mouse peripheral.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It should be possible to rig something up with DSerial if you can find an old serial port mouse (not a PS/2 mouse or a USB mouse). But if you have the room on a desk for a mouse, then wouldn't you also have room for a laptop computer?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PS/2 should work fine as well (it's just a simple serial protocol -- though I think it may need voltage level adjustment)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though I might have room on a desk for a laptop, I also have room in my wallet for money towards a laptop...

<br/>
Plus doomDS/quakeDS would have to be recoded to include the added mouse...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
