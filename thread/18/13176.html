    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've read tons of tutorials and guide from all parts of web. However i didn't catch the general vision of nds dev, and i misunderstood some concepts (maybe because i'm not english).
<br/>
<br/>
So, i've got some concept questions to ask:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Storage. 
<br/>
Example. I've got my Slot-1 card, i've got my app in it, how much storage R/W i have? The data sheet of NDS got around the web tell me that i have 4 mb of Memory to store my app.
<br/>
But the cards have gigabytes of storage. These numbers is related to different things? Explain me please.
<br/>
2) FileSystem
<br/>
I see many library about fs. But where is the "disk" where i put the filesystem? is the ram of NDS? Is in the slot-1 card? I've to put a gba card and use it to storage qwith a fs?
<br/>
<br/>
3) VRAM
<br/>
I've understand that in NDS i've got bank of hardware ram, from A to I. That's simple.
<br/>
But what is "mapping"? Why i have to map ram? What's the meaning of this table?
<br/>

Thank you for explanations :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Your binary can have a maximum size of 4MiB (= Main RAM of DS). You can always load media files on-the-fly from the disk with 2).
<br/>
<br/>
2) FileSystem
<br/>
Use "libfat" that comes with the latest DevKitPro version. It will give your software access to the Media device (SD card or whatever). 
<br/>
<br/>
3) VRAM
<br/>
I'm not sure why the VRAM has to be mapped, but seeing that the functions of the banks differ (some banks can't do 3D, some banks are for palettes), I'm guessing it has to do with the connections in the hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll explain by analogy to a PC.
<br/>
My PC has 384 MiB of RAM, 64 MiB of VRAM, and a 40 GB hard drive.
<br/>
Likewise, my DS has 4 MiB of RAM, 2/3 MiB of VRAM, and a 1 GB CF card.

<br/>
You map RAM so that the hardware knows what to do with each bank. Common settings for 2D are A main bg, B main sprite, C sub bg, D sub sprite. In 3D, some games use A-D texture, E main bg, F main sprite, G texture palette, H sub bg, I sub sprite.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
About VRAM another question.
<br/>
What is the relation between mode and vram mapped bank?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
