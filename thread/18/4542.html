    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1.) Does it have a "real" GPU? That is, is it separate from the ARM7 and ARM9?
<br/>
<br/>
2.) Who made the 3D-acceleration circuitry? Have we found this out yet? Nintendo made big announcements when Silicon Graphics was handling Nintendo 64 and ArtX/ATI was handling the GameCube, but we've heard no similar announcements for Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't recall any big announcements on the order of the ones for the N64 and GCN launch. Can someone pry open their DS and see if there's some sort of manufacturer ID printed on the GPU?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
