    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I'm new here--I've read alot but haven't posted. However, I have thought of something that seemed good enough reason to register.
<br/>
Nintendo has said that the DS will be able to play multiboot games, and it will do so through a wireless connetion. Also, it is unknown whether the DS-to-DS link will be 802.11, bluetooth, or some proprietary signal, or even whether or not multiboot games will be able to play over the wi-fi online connection. But, if conditions were favorable regarding this, it might be possible to emulate this data stream and send RAM-bootable games straight to the DS from your own computer. This would definately be a convenience for homebrew development, as there would be no need for a special cable or anything--all we would need is to crack the encryption (if any at all) and it'd be clear sailing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">they could easily write a protocol that could ride ontop of IP and Nin-Prop-Wifi,  might even make the proprietary one close to ip so they can run udp/tcp on top of it, they would also have less troubles debugging it.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit:] or IP could run on top of Nin-Prop-Wifi, since IP runs on top of all kinds of other protocols anyways (ppp,ethernet,wifi,etc....)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That doesn't sound too promising. I would have figured they would have settled on something by now.
<br/>
<br/>
If not, maybe there's still a chance of bilinear filtering to be done in hardware. That would really make the DS a worthy 3D handheld.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think a full out analog stick would really help to keep the system compact. It's really not the analog stick itself that makes it so necessary for 3D, but the difference in sensitivity you expect when moving the stick from a slightly forward position all the way to the top.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be better to have a pressure sensitive D-pad instead. And make it a bit "looser" like an analog stick to keel the same feel. But nothing that rises to much from the surface. I don't want something to accidentally break. Have you seen some of the Wal-Mart displays at their demo kiosks? I've seen entire analog stick ripped off. I'm talkin' about actually knowing what a PS2 controller looks like without having the rubber on it! :(<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Note that Nintendo has been doing this for ages.  Nintendo seemed to drop out of the arcade market soon after JAMMA was established.  Was not that over 20 years ago?
<br/>
<br/>
You can still pick up Nintendo playing cards in Japan- or at least you could when I was there 5/6 years ago (I feel old all of a sudden).  Aside from the ultra fancy backs (highest quality playing cards I have ever seen), they appeared pretty standard to me.  (No Mario, just really nice colorful designs on the back of the cards.)

Wrong.
