    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there!
<br/>
I'm afraid of asking these boring questions guys, but I cannot figure them out by myself.
<br/>
I'm a coder (oracle stuff, java stuff, c++ stuff, etc...) in real life, and I bought my ds lite some couple of weeks ago and excited about homebrewing it I decided to give it a try in my spare time.
<br/>
I just download devkitpro, a pair of emulators (dualis, ideas) and PAlibs.
<br/>
<br/>
So here are my questions:
<br/>
1)Does devkitpro includes a compiler?
<br/>
2)Can I use C++ with templates, STL, and such (maybe... boost??), or I'm constrained to use C? And in this case, what part of the standard library can one use?
<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions to the forum:
<br/>
It would be *very* useful a detailed and updated tutorial (with lots of screenshots) on setting up a programming environment with free tools (like code::blocks with mingw, or visual studio express).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In the DS homebrew development you can currently use either ASM, C and C++ (with two basic libraries: libnds &amp; PA_Lib).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you very much for the reply! I appreciated the link :)
<br/>
Now I've a somehow clear idea of what's going on in developing for DS!
<br/>
What I'm missing is some spare time, but I hope to realize something like a 3d engine soon :) eheheh!
<br/>
Thanks and bye!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
