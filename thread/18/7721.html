    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just been playing with a NDS rom extracting tool (the one from darkfader) to see what lies within a DS rom with a full video intro. What you find is some files in the "intro" folder that look a lot like codec files, and a .vx video file... 1 minute intro, good quality audio and video at what looks like 24fps, and its only 2.5mb (its an MPEG4 varient).
<br/>
<br/>
Now given you can extract said files, would it not be possible to encode a new video, in the same format, rebuild the .nds file and have a movie played? Of course the problem here is that the Actimagine codec is not freely available as yet, but if it were, this could be rather good. Yes?
<br/>

<br/>
and for the sake of interest :
<br/>
<br/>
VX is a video codec for Consumer Electronics and Telecom devices allowing a TV-like high display quality with low CPU requirements. VX comes with its own patented video codec (no MPEG royalties).
<br/>
<br/>
Technical Features:
<br/>
- Typical performance: ARM9 @ 67MHz for 256x192x30fps
<br/>
- Compression ratio ranges from 100:1 to 400:1
<br/>
- Decompression code size: 30 KB
<br/>
- RAM Usage: 2 frame buffers + 256KB</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They both have the Actimagine logo I think, so they're probably both the same codec.  I wish there was a way to play these on my computer, especially since it looks like Metroid Prime Hunters when it comes out will have all kinds of interesting FMV.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

or not so simple... the new NDS file is 20mb smaller, it seems the Create method removes the random space in the file, but breaks it too... no joy here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, the Wi-Fi version dosnt have the logo...at least, not on the one I have here..
<br/>
Could be an error though...the "e3 book" option dosnt work at all, and the film glitchs near the end.
<br/>
Maybe the logo is somewhere were it goes wrong.
<br/>
Its not at the start of the video sequence where Id expect though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Check out the final horse attack scene in it as opposed to the released video from Nintendo. Link is making a different sound.

Yeah, I noticed that...the other stuff, like the E3 book, it's a beta version of the NDS WMB version of the trailer.  If you don't beleive me, check the website where it can be downloaded, or the WMB banner...I'm pretty sure it says this.  ^_^;;<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
