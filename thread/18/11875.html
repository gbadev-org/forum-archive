    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have just finished writing a gesture recognition demo using the touch pad for the DS. I have given it a sample library of numbers to input (0-9) but it could be used for any single stroke gesture.
<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to check out the demo it can be downloaded from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mutantdiscovery.com/gesture.nds" target="_blank">http://www.mutantdiscovery.com/gesture.nds</a>. I also put a screenshot of the editor up at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mutantdiscovery.com/gesture.png" target="_blank">http://www.mutantdiscovery.com/gesture.png</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I have only tested it on my M3 adapter miniSD version so if anyone else checks it out please let me know if you have any problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice work! Really nice! Are you planning to release it in library form? And will multiple-strokes per character be supported?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmm, nice to see someone else is working on an input system...
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment I'm mucking about with an implementation of QuickWriting which will hopefully be released pretty soon :-)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: The screenshot looks very cool. Gonna test out the demo now as well :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't added support for multiple strokes since the game I plan to use it for doesn't need them. It wouldn't be hard to add though or you could use the first stroke to select a series of second strokes to choose from depending on how you wanted your game to work and it would work with the current system. Say a circle is the base spell if you do a figure 8 in the middle it might mean tornado spell rather than just rain spell.
<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't really thought about releasing it, I don't think there would be any issues. I would just have to tidy a few things up first :) and the Wii comes out midnight tomorrow here. It really has only been designed for the needs of my game idea though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
