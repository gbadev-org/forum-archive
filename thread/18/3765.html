    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is taken from GameSpot.com from the rumor section. So of course, it's just that, a rumor. But I'll keep my fingures crossed anyways. :) Here it is word for word, you can see the article at - <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/07/16/news_6102932.html" target="_blank">http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/07/16/news_6102932.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
"RUMOR #1: The Nintendo DS will be released on November 11 in the US at a price point of $179.99. 
<br/>
<br/>
Source: Anonymous sources cited by games-press magpie Gamesindustry.biz. 
<br/>
<br/>
The official story: "Nintendo does not comment on rumors or speculation."--Nintendo of America spokesperson. 
<br/>
<br/>
What we heard: Though it originated in "unconfirmed reports from Japanese retail sources," the Gamesindustry.biz story has a surprising amount of detail. It outlines a two-tiered DS launch. On November 4, the portable will launch in Japan for a retail price of 19,000 yen ($174.78). One week later, it will land on US shores on November 11 for a retail price of $179.95, $20 lower than the speculative $199 price at which online retailers are currently taking preorders. So should we Yanks expect dual-screen action on Veteran's Day? "That plan is remarkably close to the truth," said one informed source, who also said the leak had prompted Nintendo to go on "information lockdown."

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nobody.  Nintendo can change the release date on a whim.  Something could happen to delay the launch.  Has the design been finalized?  Are the factories are set up yet?  How many units have been produced so far?  What might delay production?  Might a business reason pop up to delay the launch?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I hear that Nintendo isn't showing up for the TGS and has put their Spaceworld event on hold for the third time in a row this year. But they are also planning on holding an event during the time of the TGS, so who knows? They probably will have the final design by then.

I'm wondering how effective an emulator is for development with this kind of system. I hope they ship actual hardware to them soon. I don't want a game that would have played great on an emulator, but became difficult on real hardware... Might cause some delays too.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As long as the official emulator properly emulates the wireless link [cough]VBA[/cough], the PPU's effects [cough]no$gba[/cough], and memory access timing [cough]VBA[/cough], there shouldn't be much of a problem when using an emu for initial play testing. Simulate the controls with a Wacom tablet and a PS1 controller (plugged into the EMS USB2 adapter) and open a 320x560 pixel window (two screens separated by 80 pixels).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Battery life is never a problem to the consumer when it comes to a "non-AC" powered device. The ARM is pretty powerful considering what Nintendo is doing with it, but it is designed with portability in mind.

The thing you have to realize is that this ISN'T a GameBoy and won't adhere to the usual "below $99" price that has become associated with the handhelds Nintendo has put out. In fact, this is really the only technological thing I've seen Nintendo do ever since they tried to "downplay" the low storage space of cartridges compared to CDs by creating the 64DD. Of course that crashed and burned really quickly in Japan, hopefully this won't...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

well, i am a consumer and batterylife does concern me.... im not commenting on there marketing plan, lol. portibility of what? if it was designed for portiblity id figure they would resemble the processor after a previous console. its basically an easy and powerful processor thats capable of pulling off ports on many systems. nintendo is creating a new branch of gaming, and i think that many other companies see that aswell. so i doubt that we will see as many ports as there was for the gba.
<br/>
<br/>
i'd thought that the original price would be only $150. i clearly stated that i thought the system was still pretty cheap....<br/>_________________<br/>want to earn some cash??  no joke, its awesome!

My parents didn't think it was necessary for me to get a console, and so I only had my Original version Gameboy to play around with... And so missed pretty much of the whole NES/SNES era as I didn't get to play except at friends, who didn't want to play very often as they played them constantly when they didn't have friends hanging around!
