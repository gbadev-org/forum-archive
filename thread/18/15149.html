    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using the latest version of PAlib. RAW sounds will play just fine, but MOD music will not play for me in either No$GBA or DeSmuMe. I thought I was doing something wrong at first, but the example in PAlibExamples/Sound/ModPlayback won't play either. It doesn't give me an error; it compiles just fine, but there is no music. Is this a problem with the emulators that would not be present on an actual DS or is it something more sinister?
<br/>
<br/>
The same thing with video. The PAFS_Video example will compile, but alas, in an emulator, all I get is a black screen (rather, I get two black screens XD).

I suppose I don't REALLY need music or video to make a game, but it'd help a whole lot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
