    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using Dualis 20.3
<br/>
<br/>
When I compile and run the Display List 1 example, I see the tri-colored triangle deforming on the screen for a half second, then Dualis crashes.
<br/>
<br/>
With the Display List 2 example, I see the silhouette of the teapot for a half second, then the screen goes black... the arrow keys do nothing... if I move the camera away using gluLookAt, I see the teapot further away, but again for a half second, and then black.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any suggestions ?  Is there another emu that works with display lists better ?
<br/>
<br/>
Setting the renderer to D3D and GDI does nothing... I'm using a Geforce 6800...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">forget emus when it comes to 3d. they run most 2d ok, but 3d sucks. you may try no$gba (no cash gba), it also runs nds roms. though it crashes with some roms (like my game - and it RUNS on hw)...
<br/>
<br/>
test on different emus, like dualis, ideas, desmume, dsemu and no$gba. results WILL vary.
<br/>
<br/>
in the end you'll have to use hw for 3d.
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i'm using the same emu, cuz it's fast! but it sucks at 4bit sprites... :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the feedback !
<br/>
<br/>
Dualis is a great emu... but I can understand that it can't do everything perfect !
<br/>
<br/>
So I'll test with my GBA cart for now... maybe I'll get a miniSD or SD card rig, or send via WiFi to make things a little less painful...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there are two causes of your problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, each major DevkitARM release tends to break the emu's, this will probably be fixed in the next release of the emu.
<br/>
<br/>
The other problem is that Dualis expects the FIFO_NOP command to actually use one u32 of data, when it's really not supposed to need any. I've notifyed Mic about the problem, and he will most likely fix that in the next release as well. Just wait and see.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
