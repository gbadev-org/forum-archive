    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just saw <a class="postlink" href="http://forums.warppipe.com/viewtopic.php?t=13217" target="_blank">this thread</a> over at the WarpPipe forums. Apparantly if you hold the DS up against a TV with aerial connector you will pick up the image from one of the two screens... How is this possible? And isnt there specific rules about these kind of things (no interference etc.)?<br/>_________________<br/>"Duct tape is just like the Force.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the rules also have proximity limits though.  Like 3 feet doesn't matter.  The rules also say that if the device has issues due to interferance from other devices, that the device must accept this interferance.  And last, if the device causes interferance with equipment that is protected under certain fcc rules, then the device causing interferance must be turned off.  Check out this <a class="postlink" href="http://www.arrl.org/tis/info/part15.html" target="_blank">site</a> for more info.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I have seen some threads about this too, and some of the posts in them make me slap myself on the forehead. I can't help but laugh when people say things like "Wow, Nintendo must have done this on purpose and was gonna tell us later" or "How do I get sound to work too?" or "Does it work with satelite TV?".<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You oughtta tell them, yes it works with satelite.  Just duct tape the ds to the disk and it will work.  Would be funny because most of those people would try it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I was in college, I live in major downtown core, my buidling had a cell repeater on the top.
<br/>
<br/>
One day I was bored walking around and found a colour zenith crapbox portable tv in the garbage.. I brought it home.
<br/>
<br/>
The lowest UHF channel, then fine tuned lower with the other dial got me chunks of cell phone calls. The screen would start drawing blocks all over the place when the caller was moving out of that cell influence. 
<br/>
<br/>
It was a party piece for so long, I have party's with this thing plugged in. Some nights you'd could only hear arabic cab drivers others it was "Hey i've been waiting outside of club x for an hour.. then I saw X and she said you were dating here.." and people picking up voicemail was classic with messages like "You #&amp;@^* I cant believe you did so and so...."

<br/>
Damn interference it gets in the way all the time..
