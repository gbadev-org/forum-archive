    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been playing Elite Beat Agents lately and was wondering if someone could help me identify what background modes it uses for a couple parts of the game. The first question is on the top screen it has a lot of stuff where it's a background not moving then a like half screen character sliding across the screen. How is that done? Is the character animation like combined sprites (because it's so big) or is it just framebuffer mode? What sort of background mode would that be? My second question is for when you have to spin the large circle you can spin on the bottom screen. What background mode is that? Also is the spinning circle some sort of sprite or do you think they're just doing the stuff in framebuffer mode? Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
