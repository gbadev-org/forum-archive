Is there any Free speech synthesizer that can speak arbitrary English words, such as the (keyboard-entered) name of a character, and run in real time on a GBA or DS?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Free as in GPL? Not sure if the source is available for it, but there is a "DSSpeech" linked on:

I had seen that one before, but it was so robotic it wasn't funny. I've heard better voice out of an Apple IIe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Well, I remember from way back when the Commodore 64 was singing Stars &amp; Stripes. I guess I wasn't expecting anything but robotic voices.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually the DSSpeech sounds very much like a Vocoder. It would certainly interest me to find out more about the requirements of a decent text-to-speech, and how far one can push the DS to do it, both from a theoretical and from a practical point of view.
<br/>
<br/>
Just one observation from me, a fairly recent DS-convertite: DS has some speech recognition capabilities, surely that is far more strenuous on the hardware than synthesizing, isn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW increasingly I'm thinking about collecting a list of apps-that-would-be-nice-to-see-a-DS-version-of, for prospective developers to choose some nice projects.
<br/>
<br/>
To me as a new kid on the block it seems that the DS homebrew community is somewhat fragmented (it is not like there are some definite one-stop-shops that will tell you all you need to know, although this place seems to comes close), or perhaps this is a distorted view or perhaps an indication that it is very dynamic.
<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas of things that I would like to see (and perhaps already exist) and if I could clone myself even work on, that either don't exist, or could become a bit more polished:
<br/>
Subtractive Synthesizer
<br/>
IFR Simulator (like on the VIC 20)
<br/>
VIC 20 emulator (port of VICE?)
<br/>
Skat (German card game)
<br/>
Nine Men's Morris (I'm working on a version)
<br/>
Bridge
<br/>
lots of ideas along the lines of flashcards programs; somehow letting the DS help you memorize/learn facts/vocab/stuff.
<br/>
those dev tools I mentioned: profiler &amp; source level debugger
<br/>
Football/Soccer Manager (I'm working on porting Paul Robson's SDL port of the original FM)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and please point me to some examples of some of that allegedly superior Apple II speech synthesis; I'd like to form my own opinion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is correct everywhere except possibly in a galaxy far, far away. (In the <span style="font-style: italic">Star Wars</span> universe, it appears that R2 astromech droids can recognize speech but can't produce it.)

That might even be useful as a first step toward a speech synthesizer, as the production of vowels and consonants involves exactly the kind of flow through tubes that subtractive synthesis was intended to model.

I made one of those for the GBA, but I never got around to packaging it. Who wants to see my "flash card emulator" made to run on both GBA (with GBFS) and DS (with libfat)?
