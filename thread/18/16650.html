    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">R4 ultra team has released the R4i kernal (kernal for the flashchip)

Run "<span style="font-weight: bold">ultrai_update.nds</span>" on English System to reflash the chip of R4i, and don't power off when flashing.
<br/>
This is an .NDS file that upgrades the internal working of the 0fc2 flashchip.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So we have the code to upgrade our original R4 card or other clone card to a card with R4i kernal.
<br/>
After the upgrade you have SDHC and R4i support.
<br/>
<br/>
The only problem is that the R4 ultra team has protected the rom to flash/run on an other flashcard.
<br/>
<br/>
ive checked the R4ultra card:
<br/>
Chip ID:0fc2
<br/>
HW: 8181
<br/>
<br/>
original R4 card:
<br/>
Chip ID:0fc2
<br/>
HW: 0000
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone out here who can change/hack the <span style="font-weight: bold">ultrai_update.nds rom </span>and disable the HW 8181 check?
<br/>
<br/>
If this can be done, everyone who has a flashcard with chip ID: 0fc2 can upgrade his flashcard to new kernal with <span style="font-weight: bold">DSi</span> support.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope someone can help us out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I mean, the SDHC is only a protocol issue, but might it be that the original r4 isn't that updateable?
<br/>
<br/>
Well i guess i have a look at the binary and check a bit if the firmware (not the part that is stored on the SD) is changeable on the original one too. If noone has done it already.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It might be me just being paranoid, but looking at the actual website on this information, they seem to only be talking about the upgrade to the R4i and R4 Ultra, with nothing pertaining to the R4DS. Kinda like they are continuing to work around Nintendo's attempts to block the cards and improving them, rather than giving the older cards additional improvements. I'm probably wrong, but that's how I interpret it.
<br/>
<br/>
But, if this does work, and it does give the original R4DS cards the added support, could that also include the M3DS Simply?  I believe it's considered a clone to the R4DS, but I'm not sure.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This means the R4 cards firmware is writeable.

I let you know if it works on DSi now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

New R4's are all fake.  Does any of this stuff work on the original R4?<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it don't work because it does not erase the full R4 card and write a complete new bios on it.
<br/>
It just flashes a sector with new code!

<br/>
Run "ultrai_update.nds" on English System to reflash the chip of R4i or R4, and don't power off when flashing.
<br/>
This is an .NDS file that upgrades the internal working of the 0fc2 flashchip. 
<br/>
<br/>
The file with no protection writes to an R4 card, so that means that R4 bios is upgradable! (like EZ V is also upgradeable)
<br/>
<br/>
I will try to dump the full memory of an R4i ultra card into an .NDS file.
<br/>
Maybe someone can integrate the R4i bios into a flasher program, so we fully overwite the whole card!
<br/>
<br/>
It's just an idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
