    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I was reading an article in popsci magazine that said that I could find out how to turn a Ds into an ipod and a bunch of other stuff with instructions from this site. I'm a total noob to this and i have a few questions to ask:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Will doing this cripple my DS from playing games?
<br/>
<br/>
2. What's needed to do this and if there is equpment what is the best to use?
<br/>
<br/>
3. What other things can you do besides the Ipod DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance notify me ASAP</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you need to buy special hardware (~40 - 50 $) and download the freeware player (most likely you meant LMP-ng) and load it onto the device and there you go (heaviely simplified). though you better not ask here in the development forum, better go to the nds misc forum. there's a thread in this development forum that's about the player. maybe you can find someone there that can help you and give advises on wich hardware is best suited for your needs.
<br/>
<br/>
greetings.
<br/>
<br/>
ps: this process shouldn't do anything to your nds, as you don't need to modify it, only plug the device into it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
