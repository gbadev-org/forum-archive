    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have some homebrew gba apps i messed around with.  VBA + insight is perfectly good for debugging and stuff...but i was hoping to play around with them using my R4.
<br/>
<br/>
clearly this isn't possible as the R4 doesn't know how to run a .gba file and there is no physical way for slot1 to play a slot2...
<br/>
<br/>
is there any sort of conversion or possibly a GBA emulator for the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
