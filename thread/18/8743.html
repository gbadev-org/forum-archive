I used this tutorial, tried to compile it and I got a fuzzy screen, but this is a really needed program in order to display jpegs to the screen.
<br/>
I also noticed that keysInit() doesn't work in this program.  Does anybody know how to fix this part of this project and does anybody know why this won't show the proper picture to the screen or operate input correctly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you can comment out the keysInit() call that was removed a couple version of libnds ago, since the tutorial was written, I commented it out and compiled it, and it does display a little funny in the latest dsemu. Not sure how it runs on hardware though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I compiled it on hardware and none of the key commands do anything and the picture works for about the first 50 pixel lines, then it goes to crap.  I just need the part that converts a jpeg into an image on the DS.  If anybody had anything else that would nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could try that libnds version. I've not yet had a chance to look at it in detail. You could try using the jpeg decoder library it uses in your own program and see if you have better luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
