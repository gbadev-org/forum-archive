    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just starting out and I followed a link from a tutorial and installed devkitPro r12, but then I realized that the link took me directly to the r12 page, and there could be a newer version, so I dragged the entire folder into the garbage and found and downloaded r16. I tried to install r16 and it said "You can not continue, there is nothing to install." I am taking this to mean that somehow r12 is still installed somehow. Where else does devkitPro install files that I would have to delete outside it's main folder? Or is there another issue causing this? Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem.  Here is a workaround from the guy who made the Mac package:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
<br/>
Right click devkitARM.pkg and select "Show Package Contents." 
<br/>
Enter the Contents directory. 
<br/>
Double-click Archive.pax.gz to decompress it. 
<br/>
Rename the newly-created Archive directory to devkitpro. 
<br/>
Move devkitpro into /opt/local/. 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
