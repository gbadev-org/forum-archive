    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After playing with 4 different DS'es, I found out that 2 of my purchases had super clear image on the bottom touch screen, while the other two had extra coating.
<br/>
<br/>
This only means that nintendo is selling some of its touch screens without any additional coating which why some people are getting easy scratches on their DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not know if this is a defect or intended.
<br/>
<br/>
On one side, some DS'es display a clearer picture while others have this liquidy crystalized texture on it.
<br/>
<br/>
You decide which is better.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting.  Can you work out a way to determine which is coated and which isn't?  Without a basis for comparison, how would we really know?  If it's generational, pertaining to the production, then something like the serial number should be able to identify it.
<br/>
<br/>
My touchscreen displays graphics, to the best of my ability to tell, in the exact same way as the top screen.  And I have noticed very tiny scratches, what I would describe as micro scratches, on my touchscreen.  They're very short, only visible with the backlighting turned off and holding the DS up to a lamp or the like, but they're still there.
<br/>
<br/>
I've taken pretty obsessive care of my DS to date, using only the thumb and pen stylus and keeping it clean with an eyeglass cloth.  I also haven't played many stylus intensive games (Maybe three or four times with the Boo hunting mini game on Mario 64 is the worst).  From what I've read, many people describe games like Feel the Magic where it's necessary to apply the stylus rather harshly, and having no visible signs as a result.  So I was beginning to question why mine seems to be different.
<br/>
<br/>
If what you say is true and mine isn't fully protected, I would certainly be interested in having Nintendo replace it with one that is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perhaps it is dependant on when you got it, or where, or even how...
<br/>
<br/>
Could be a faulty batch or two of these DS, and the newer ones are fine (Problems been solved by Nintendo). Perhaps they knew about this, and said they would replace the touchscreens for more than just the deadpixel problem... Or it could happen to people who had theirs repaired by nintendo at a certain time when they had gotten a faulty shipment of screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is definitely a difference in the appearance of some of the touchscreens, but I'm not convinced that this is a "defect" or anything.
<br/>
<br/>
They may have two touchscreen suppliers, which do not produce exactly the same screens visually. Having said that, this would not affect the way the screens are scratched at all; no matter whether your touchscreen is kind of fuzzy or perfectly clear, the same plastic layer sits on top of it, and that's what the stylus touches.
<br/>
<br/>
I will say that my DS's bottom screen is a tad "fuzzy" compared to my friend's DS which was bought at the same time, but I don't know if it's because there is more than one manufacturer or maybe some screens just aren't aligned quite as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm suprised that there are some DS's out there with bottom screens the same as the top. I have a "Crystalized" screen and thought it was a normal side-effect of the touch sensitivity. That said, the screen is not distorted of fuzzy at all. There is what I would describe as a slight grain to the screen, but it is not noticeable during gameplay unless you are <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> looking for it. 
<br/>
The best way to tell if you have a "Crystalized" screen or not is to tilt the DS gently from side to side. There will be a slight wobble of the pixels due to light refraction. I'm perfectly happy with my DS and do not feel "cheated" at all. I think calling it a <span style="font-style: italic">defect</span> is going a little far, it's hardly noticeable to the casual eye.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers.

But my top screen is the mystery... the bottom screen seems to be a normal LCD where the image is always steady.  The top screen is... well, like looking at a CRT.  It's hard to describe, but it's like it has a visible refresh rate.  If an LCD refreshes at 60 Hz, you don't really see a flicker because the crystals keep their brightness/image/whatever-you-wanna-call-it longer.  But on a CRT, 60 Hz has a *very* noticeable flicker (gives me headaches).  The DS screen doesn't give me hedaches, but sometimes I swear the screen flickers in a similar fashion to CRT's...

I noticed those flickers, its not from the LCD, but from the stereo speakers, if you lower the speaker volume, it will go away. I guess its from the magentic resonance within the speakers.

I can tell my brother's DS apart from my DS based solely on the touch screen surface.  I have an early US one, and there appears to be diagonal lines across the screen when I tilt it at a certain angle.  But my brother's DS, a newer Japanese one, looks textured when I tilt it at the same angle.  Interestingly, my GP32 appears to have the same diagonal lines effect.  But the GP32 doesn't have a touch screen, so it can't be the touch screen itself.  It must be some kind of protective LCD covering material.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A quick search seems to indicate that it's probably your ad blocking software (possible a firewall or other internet security program) that's blocking the image.

<br/>
Failing that people seem to suspect some form of malware, so it's time to run Spybot SD or similiar.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got off the phone with a Nintendo rep, and he said pretty positively that there is only one Nintendo DS being manufactured now, so everybody's components should be the same throughout.
<br/>
<br/>
He also said that because it's a brand new system Nintendo is currently replacing them for free no matter what.  If you stepped on your DS or dropped it down a flight of stairs, Nintendo would replace it currently.  So I'm getting mine replaced since it's continued to accumulate those micro scratches despite my carefulness in only using the included stylus, wiping it only with an eyeglass cleaner cloth, etc.  I also confirmed that the replacement one will be warrantied for a year, so if it blows up or whatever I can still repeat the replacement process free of charge.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, he said that Nintendo doesn't have an authorized touchscreen protection filament a'la PDAs, so I may go out and look for a PDA one that I can cut down to size with a razor, or something to this effect to make certain this doesn't happen again.  I'm certain that I can find a satisfactory cover without sacrificing the touchscreen responsiveness.
<br/>
<br/>
While we were at it, he took some feedback on the DS to send along to whomever it concerns.  I brought up the issue with the mandatory health warning, and made my case that a customization setting in the internal OS should allow individuals to opt out of it so we don't have to press every time we start up the machine.

<br/>
Of course, unless the firmware is indeed updateable (which he couldn't confirm it was) it wouldn't matter anyway.  They'd either have to include it in a future model or not do it at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Normal nintendo representative's have no clue about nintendo DS assembly plans and where they are produced or how many manufactures assemble them.
<br/>
<br/>
I bet you if you call again, some other rep will say something else. What you need to do is have a call with the senior lead which I did. After hours of talk, and evidence of pictures I sent, they have supposedly forwarded my case to the production team. 
<br/>
<br/>
I doubt Nintendo will release an official response to this problem, and pretty much I think they will like to remain hush hush till they fix the problem and slowly goes away.
<br/>
<br/>
I think they will meet this issue at an individual level, meaning they probably will replace your DS if you are like me and know what the problem is.
<br/>
<br/>
I got a replacement because I had uncoated version. Now they sent me with coated version. So it's pretty obvious there is more than 1 kind of lcd.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have clear type bottom touch lcd, I suggest you call up nintendo and ask for a replacement. Don't bother yourself with crappy third party protectors or take the chance of scratching your DS with an uncoated screen. Do it now!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mine seems clear too and also I can't see any scratches forming.  I do see the textured look if I look at it from the side though (the actual touchscreen I presume).
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I noticed is that I think a little dust is getting inside my screen but as im in the UK theres no way im sending it back to the US just to get it replaced.  If it gets too bad I might try sending it to Nintendo Europe once they are released over here.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, my touchscreen seems a little clearer an image than the top screen - though I believe I read this is due to a different pixel format.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My theory on the whole fuzzy LCD thing, is it's extremely clever tatics by Nintendo.  It works like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo goes with a specific type/batch of LCDs from a specific manufacturer for the initial round of DS units.  Immediate feedback on release day indicates these LCDs are not very durable for touch screen use, and have a number of flaws.  Realizing that if this gets into the mainstream media (IGN, PGC, etc), it could do irrepairable harm to their image and affect their sales of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
So they go with the choice to use a stronger, more durable system, and offer to replace damaged/broken DS units free of charge (provided they get your damaged unit back), no questions asked.  This keeps users from complaining, which keeps media sites from writing up a story, and it gets the DS units with the bad LCDs off the streets.  They're obviously taking a hit in the pocket book somewheres for this, but unlike Sony, they can afford it quite easily until all new units sold include the more durable screen, then they might start becoming more restrictive on who they give free replacements too.
<br/>
<br/>
I practically broke my DS within the first 2 days of owning it (Zelda II GBA irked me the wrong way, the top LCD paid with its life for that irking), and the customer service rep, realizing I'd physically broke the unit out of anger, still replaced it for free.  The new unit I got had the more durable touchscreen.
<br/>
<br/>
To sum it up -- If this is Nintendo's strategy, then whoever thought it up deserves a cookie for some damn start manuvering.

I bet you're right about that. New consoles are risky ventures, and especially for something as original as the DS. A widespread misconception that "DS screens scratch too easily" would be catastrophic, possibly even sending people back to the whole "newer consoles need better graphics, and nothing more" system.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the fuzzyness on some of the durable screens is part of that too. Perhaps:
<br/>
Once they discovered the original flaw with the scratching, they were in such a hurry to fix it that they ended up settling for a screen that wasn't as clear. But it was considered aceptable for the time being because it still didn't look too bad, and at least it didn't scratch. Then, once they were able to get ahold of them, they started using a "good" screen, ie no scratching but doesn't look fuzzy.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, maybe the fuzzy ones are just nothing more than the scratchable ones with an extra protective layer added, and they're doing that until they were able to fix the original manufacturing problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think "conspiracy" is the wrong word for it.  It's smart business sense.  Damn smart business sense, and if I were in the same situation, I'd make the same or similar decision.  I'd personally applaud Nintendo for this move if it's close to what actually occured.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who follows politics a little will see the same tatic used all the time, since if you make a mistake, even a simple one, it can get blown really far out of proportion.  If Nintendo spent months and months touting "Touch! is good", then people discover poor-quality touch screens, it's roughly the same equivalent of what happened to poor Bernard Kerik.  If Nintendo made a small mistake to go with a different style of touch screen that later turned out to be poor, then they quickly switch to a more durable one and quietly swap out as many units as they can w/o attracting media attention, then they've succeeded.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the "crystalization" of the screen, My theory is it's part of what explains the durability.  Take clear-as-glass hardened plastic for example.  The stuff shatters like glass, and just as easily.  Now, take plastic that is also hardened, but is a little fuzzy.  The strength is probably near 10x better than the crystal-clear version.  Why this is probably requires a degree in chemistry, physics, and probably a deep understanding of the technology behind plastic, but I for one am not bothered by the fuzzyness of the touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the touch screen is more for input than it is for viewing stuff on, so it can afford to sacrifice a little clarity for durability, while the top screen needs to be crystal clear.  This is also why Nintendo sells a replacement kit for $3.95 that can replace the top screen cover in case of scratches, so I'd say they've thought this out very well.

Didn't I see you on my street corner the other day, waving a bible around and yelling about how GW Bush was a dragon and he stole your soul?  The guy with the dirty underwear (where were your pants, anyway?)
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with your little theory is that it's completely baseless.  It's conjecture, it's speculative, and you have nothing to support it other than unverified claims that there are more than one touch screen (which at the moment isn't even a certainty).  From that starting point you've woven this plot, but never bothered to notice that none of it has the slightest empirical foundation.
<br/>
<br/>
The saddest thing is that despite your specious reasoning, it's even been refuted because, as manicdvln wrote, even if there were multiple touch screens they would all have come out at the same gerneral time.  Therefore your claims that Nintendo is engaging in a massive coverup couldn't possibly hold.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, dual-sourcing components is a pretty standard manufacturing practice. Some industries would be playing russian roulette if they relied on one supplier alone for components.
<br/>
<br/>
So, never assume that if you disassemble any unit (be it games console, mobile phone, etc) and find two different types of any part, that one supercedes the other.
<br/>
<br/>
The first real question is, is one type significantly better specified than the other in terms of scratch-resistence? Then, is one of these specs lower than Nintendo's base spec for scratch-resistence (and there will be one). We almost certainly won't find this out. If a part was found to be substandard when delivered in quantity, it will be phased out as per whatever Nintendo's manufacturing process states.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unlikely. The release of the system in both territories was within 2 weeks.

I think the system was ready for release in Japan when it was released over here, it's just that Nintendo wanted the finish production of the Japanese versions of its DS lauch games first as it was going to battle the PSP around it's launch.

<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure I got the clear, flexible version as well, but I've had it since launch day, and while there are a few small scratches on the surface, they are completely invisible unless I'm really looking for them, and they don't affect the performance of the screen one bit -- the DS's touch screen is bar none the best-performing touch screen I've ever used, and it still works just as well as it did on day one.  I've played through all 150 stars on Super Mario 64 DS as well as all three game modes on Feel the Magic plus most of the Memories stars, and the thing still works wonderfully.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it really worth a replacement this early in the game?  The US DS is warranted for a year.

I do not think there will be an official announcement on this, because alot of customers would be pissed, I think Nintendo, if they are aware of this problem by now, will deal with it at the individual level, meaning, anyone who has a clear screen, will not be notified by nintendo, and people here like us will have to figure out that there are 2 kinds of screens and ask for replacement.

Remember, no one would have figure this out if they didn't have a second DS to compare it, hoping that the second one had the second type of touch screen.

Anyone who follows politics a little will see the same tatic used all the time, since if you make a mistake, even a simple one, it can get blown really far out of proportion.  If Nintendo spent months and months touting "Touch! is good", then people discover poor-quality touch screens, it's roughly the same equivalent of what happened to poor Bernard Kerik.  If Nintendo made a small mistake to go with a different style of touch screen that later turned out to be poor, then they quickly switch to a more durable one and quietly swap out as many units as they can w/o attracting media attention, then they've succeeded.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

The problem with your little theory is that it's completely baseless.  It's conjecture, it's speculative, and you have nothing to support it other than unverified claims that there are more than one touch screen (which at the moment isn't even a certainty).  From that starting point you've woven this plot, but never bothered to notice that none of it has the slightest empirical foundation.

The saddest thing is that despite your specious reasoning, it's even been refuted because, as manicdvln wrote, even if there were multiple touch screens they would all have come out at the same gerneral time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This may be unrelated, but I've noticed that my sister's DS (which we got very recently) has a somewhat different plastic than mine (which I got at launch). The feel and color is different. I think Nintendo may have cut some corners to ship more units for Christmas, but there is nothing wrong with her DS and I am not complaining. 
<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading somewhere that Nintendo used a greasy film on the touch screen for protection which would explain why alot of scratches seem to wipe away and some screens look fuzzy. Perhaps they changed the process and that is why some are clear looking... or maybe some DSs have more grease than others. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Nintendo is trying to cover anything up. This is new ground for Nintendo, and aside from unpopular systems like the Game.com this is the first time a touch screen has been used in a game system. They are probably just trying to provide the best service as possible since they are trying something new. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think it is best to get a screen protector, but it pisses me off that I haven't seen any for sale with just a bottom screen protector. The top screen already has one that you can replace if you need to. I am a little annoyed that the screen protector I have sticks to the screen with an adhesive, there is plenty of room around the touch screen to add a slide in cover like they have for PDAs. Those are probably a better choice anyway.

Exactly -- It's conjective, it's speculative, it has no independently-verifiable scientific backing whatsoever, aside from my own observations.  At <span style="font-weight: bold">no</span> point in my post did I state that my theory was the truth, that I could back it up, or that I was right and everyone else was wrong.  This is the entire <span style="text-decoration: underline">point</span> of theories and hypothesises -- Sometimes they ARE wrong, sometimes they ARE right, sometimes they're a little of both, and sometimes, they're nothing at all.  What's important is that I proposed it.  What should happen then, is other people take it in, work it around their own thought processes, and form their own opinion that can either back my theory, debunk my theory, enhance my theory, degrade my theory, and so on.  This is the process through which we ultimately arrive at a perceived truth.

You obviously failed to understand from what angle I was presenting my theory.  I did not state it as a coverup, and I even suggested in the post in question that "conspiracy" was too strong a word.  I simply offered up an idea, a concept, a unproven theory, whatever you wish to call it.

If your DS got scratched already, guess what would happen 6 months from now. Don't tolerate it.

Believe it, the stylus itself scratches the LCD touch screen even with coating.
<br/>
<br/>
This is because the sylus itself is a 2 piece mold, meaning, it can have jagged edges in certain angles that can scratch your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
When I scratched the bottom touch screen with stylus, i tried again with same angle, it scratched again. Then I rotated stylus and tried with another angle, and no scratches, even if I press hard.
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest everyone inspects their stylus before usage, they can chip or have mold defects that can damage your screen.

Seriously. I was dissappointed with the quality of the stylus, and I use a third-party japanese one now.

BTW, the airform cases on lik-sang come with a neat strap that, to me, is preferable to both the stylus and the thumb strap in most occasions.

It can't have scratch resistant coating and clear screen at the same time, because the coating itself degrades the clarity of the screen. The coasting is like vasseline like feel to it, and texture makes the screen look a bit like fogged up.
<br/>
<br/>
Once again, i have compared many DS'es, and if you want to know if you have clear or coated version.
<br/>
<br/>
Check the top DS screen and then look at the bottom screen when starting DS with white boot screen. If both screen are similiarily clear, it means you have clear screen.
<br/>
<br/>
If the bottom has a bit of degraded clarity with a bit of crystalized fuzz look, then you have coated version.
<br/>

Clear screen are also ruff with the stylus, and does not slide as smoothly with coated version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be nice if everyone had a good enough camera to take a close shot with enough clarity to easily distinguish between clear, blurry, crystalized, diagonal lines, scratches, or whatever else it is you want to see in the pic.  You *might* just have to take his word for it.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Well I have played with 6 DS'es and have screenshots and lots of talk with nintendo reps. 
<br/>
<br/>
So it will be hard to take the word of people who only played with 1 DS, no screenshot and are less knowledgeable than me on this issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Still i will give the benefit of a doubt and would like to see some screenshots, not just for evidence but aswell for general information of what the hell is going on in nintendo manufacturing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It sounds to me like it doesn't matter how many DS'es you play with, it doesn't change how "knowledgeable" you are on the topic of "This is what I see when I look at the screen".  It seems the only real knowledge you need is -How do I describe the screen- and -Is the screen resistant to scratches-.  I'm sure you know an awful lot, but I still have faith that baku, Gatchers and others are able to discern for themselves what their screens are like.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I agree it would be nice to be able to compare DS'es from around the world from different people with different ways of using their DS'es (play a lot vs. barely play, treats like crystal vs. treats it like a toy, etc).  I, too, would like to know what Nintendo is doing.  It's too bad big companies like these can't be a little more open about what they do.  But, hey, that's the world we live in.  And attitudes like "That's the world we live in" are why it's going to stay that way.
<br/>
<br/>
That's my $0.02, though I doubt anyone would pay that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Fact is, every person I know that owns a Japanese DS (only 3 people, but still :p) claims to have a clear, scratch-resistant screen. To those claiming that this simply can not be true: have you held a Japanese DS unit in your hands?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have an image I've just taken which very clearly shows the diagonal lines. I don't have time to crop and upload it as I'm about to go to work, if someone wants me to mail it to them to do so, PM me here and I'll mail it from work.

I have previously described a manufacturing process which is common among mass-market consumer electronics. I work on the design and development of very similar types of devices with similar display technology and a similar market and which shares some of Nintendo's suppliers. One thing I can safely say is that you cannot claim to be knowledgable in this area, you cannot take the word of reps you'll ever be able to get hold of on the phone or by email regarding the company's manufacturing process, and you cannot make judgement on a sample of 6 units  - this is absolutely by no means a reasonable cross section of samples!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i dont have a camera with sufficent macro quality to show you the pixel attributes, 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">but</span>..
<br/>
 i can say that because the touchfilm has a diagonal effect, your eyes will see the visible pixels plus the effect in a slightly different way to those which are not under a diagonal striped film.
<br/>
<br/>
however, as the diagonals are near-invisible, the effect makes for only the barest difference.  i dont believe you will view both screens displaying a solid colour in a different way.
<br/>
<br/>
and yes, the topic is about the stylus scratching anyways..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am pretty sure your word is better than mine since you only used 1 DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, i got fed up by unappreciative ingrates like yourselves, fuck if I care if you don't believe me.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you can't tell the difference in my screenshots, thats because YOU HAVENT HAD MORE THAN 1 DS AND CANT SEE THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.
<br/>
<br/>
THE CLEAR ONE HAS NO ANTI-SCRATCH COATING, I HAVE HAD 4 DIAGONAL EFFECT CLEAR TOUCH SCREENS, AND THEY ARE MORE FRAGILE THAN COATED VERSION. THEY ALSO ROUGHER ON THE STYLUS, WHICH MEANS WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR STYLUS ON THE SURFACE IT HAS A  ROUGH FEELING.
<br/>
<br/>
THE COATED VERSION ARE MORE FIRM AND HAVE A FOG LIKE COATING ON IT, WHICH SHOWS ITS SPRAYED WITH SOMETHING. THEY ALSO MOVE WITH STYLUS ON THE SURFACE MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY LIKE YOU THINK ITS SPRAYED WITH VASSELINE.
<br/>
<br/>
God some of you are dumb. 
<br/>
<br/>
HOW THE HELL CAN YOU DISCUSS DIFFERENCES OF SCREENS WITH ME IF YOU NEVER INVESTIGATED, COMPARED WITH OTHER DS'ES.

<br/>
No more responses from me on this issue, and when your touch screens does get scratched, dont come crying to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If you read my earlier mail, you'll know that I actually own 2 DSes. I've used many, many more.
<br/>
<br/>
And nowhere did I say that the two different display types you referred to don't exist - I just said that the picture was terrible. It's you who refuses to believe that there is another display type, calling people who have seen these types unknowledgable (compared to you) and illogical.
<br/>
<br/>
So, to repeat using simple words - there are at least 3 types of screens. Anything other than that, you don't know. Don't assume that someone with less than 6 screens doesn't know anything, and don't assume that someone who does have 6 screens knows everything.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, apply complete thought to this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i dont really think you needed to worry about that one anyways! :D
<br/>
<br/>
people can comment on DS's with you because they own one. they own a DS which they can tell you about with a certainty.
<br/>
<br/>
my advice would be look into buying a 3rd party stylus, and if your screen does get scratched, swap it for a new one.

<br/>
<br/>
I've just received one of the 3,000 units available to Europeans ahead of the Euro DS launch. These are Euro DS units, with Mario 64 (US game in European packging - hence they call this 'pre-release'), A Wario Ware Touched! Demo, the US Metroid Prime demo and a T-shirt.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the differences are the sticker on the underside (as I recall, there's a matte and gloss version of the US sticker) and - the screen on this is the crystallised one, though the crystallisation appears below the surface of the touchscreen, so the surface itself is smooth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">About the stylus scratching screens, i have found a simple way to fix it (if you catch it early!) I used to use this on my PDA styli and I make my own custom styli this way. 1). Get a piece of printer paper. 2). Take the stylus and move it in a circular motion while pressing semi-firmly down on the paper. 3). Repeat until the stylus nub is smooth and uniform.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps some of you guys, I always do it with new styli, just to make sure ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
