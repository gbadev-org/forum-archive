I want to know what the ultimate difference is in graphics when comparing the Nintendo DS and the N64.
<br/>
<br/>
If you guys can, please explain to my <span style="font-style: italic">why</span> the graphics are better. If it is, is N64 emulation possible on the DS?

I don't think anyone knows specific details of the DS's graphics yet, but from what I can tell it probably pushes a few more polygons/sec than the N64, and it doesn't appear to use any texture filtering such as bilinear filtering.

I doubt it, at least at full speed w/ sound. To correctly emulate another system you need to be on something that's at least a few times faster than the machine you're emulating. The DS is faster than the N64, but I doubt it's *that* much faster.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You need a machine much more powerful than the machine you are trying to emulate. The DS has only a slight edge over the N64, and even then, not in raw computational power.
<br/>
<br/>
Which means you could <span style="font-style: italic">port</span> N64 games to the DS without too much difficulty, but you could never emulate one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even if they're the same exact people (which I consider unlikely), they're not the same team they were 8-or-so years ago.  That was a long time ago, and Mario 64 was likely their first 3d game.  By now they'd be more experienced and should be reasonably expected to produce a technically better game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It might be interesting, possibly nearer the N64 version and possibly not all the levels perhaps? Maybe nearer what it was like at E3? It might be interesting to compare and contrast - may hold some clues into what they took time trying to get right...
<br/>
<br/>
Also, It mentions that the Metroid Hunters: First Hunt demo (probably same as the US one) will not be compatible multiplay-wise with the final European release of the game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The way I understand it (they way that I understand things is in no way guaranteed to be accurate), the MMU keeps track of where everthing is in the memory (ie. its address, expressed in those weird numbers that darkfader uses sometimes like 0x08000000 (hex numbers)).
<br/>
<br/>
It is usually part of the cpu, and when a piece of code wants some data, it asks the MMU for it. I believe "memory" is defined as "any accessable storage medium", and applies to hard drives (and flash cards) as well as RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
If the DS did not have an MMU embedded in the CPU (which apparently it does?), it would be up to the software to handle memory management, which, as always, is slower.
<br/>
<br/>
all this was revealed with a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/MMU.html" target="_blank"> quick google search</a>, something that is not outside the capabilties of most forum members ;)

I am definately pushing the limits of my limited knowlege here, but shouldnt there be some sort of serial number associated with the chip that you can look up? or is Nintendo using its own "special" version of the chip?<span style="font-style: italic"></span><span style="font-style: italic"></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does anyone know if the ARM9 core in the DS definitely doesn't have an MMU?

<br/>
An MMU is nice for things other than just virtual memory etc support - sometimes you want to run code with a small amount of RAM and a large amount of NAND flash which you can't execute from directly, etc, etc. ALso, it can help with debugging.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a hard time imagining true shadow volumes on the DS... They're definitely fill rate eaters (the DS has plenty of fill rate given its resolution so I suppose that's ok) and they need the mesh silouhette which is particularly expensive to compute. And since the DS doesn't even have a frame buffer I guess we shouldn't count on a stencil buffer neither ;) so I don't see how shadow volumes could be implemented...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Is this the truth then? Seems strange to me. How do certain DS games (like Feel the Magic), do special screen effects? In Feel the Magic, there are certain mini-games which have a wave effect over both screens. Now if I were to do this on the GBA, I'd simply setup a hblank interrupt and offset the drawing. But obviously I'm drawing the image line by line, so it makes sense. But 3d on the DS wouldn't be drawn line-by-line would it? So how would they achieve a wavey effect without some kind of buffer to edit?
<br/>
<br/>
Or have I missed the point here? Is the DS display drawn line by line?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting. I pulled out my copy of Sprung as a result of reading all that (I had found the blog by chance during a search when I was in the US and picked up my first DS last November), the credits show the names being referred to in the blog (Jason etc) but it appeared that the blog had been written by someone who had been working on aspects of the user interface, the person creditted for that is called Joshua.

<br/>
I don't know if I'd entirely agree with the comments made that it obviously looks like it's making full use of the DSes CPU bandwidth, and having played the game I can't really see why it seemed so crazy to make it use the touchscreen as an input either...
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the original location of this blog - I can't for the life of me find it anymore, I'm sure a search for 'DS dev kit' or something found it for me before... either way, I think they should post here :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
