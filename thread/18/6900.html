    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was making image converter to my app, and I have stupid problem - rom made with devkitARM and libnds, based on code in samples, have size size set to 256 kb. I'm using almost 64 kB, so I need to dump 512 kb from my cart, but it dumps only data what is set in rom header (?). EFA software crashes when I try to change it - is there any simple way to set it in configuration, that it will be set in rom, that save is 512 kb?<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
