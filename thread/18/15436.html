<br/>
So, do use 8-bit bgs with contents that's constantly changing, or stationary for things that hardly ever/never change?
<br/>
<br/>
Choose rendering if you only change the bg at one time per frame, like for some animation that fills the whole bg. Chose rendering with blitting if you draw stuff on the bg, that doesn't fill the only bg, and moves around, like what I'm trying to do with my Backgrounds thing that won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
If you use blitting, could you please show me the code you use?(Entire demo please. PM if you want...)
<br/>
<br/>
Chose 16-bit blitting if you do the above, but with 16-bit bgs...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
