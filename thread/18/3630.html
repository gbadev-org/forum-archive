I think tepples is on to something here.

<br/>
Also, the angle of the pen could affect the Z-rotation of the ball...  sending the ball out of the screen.  That would be very cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Also a view mode where you see the ball's perspective - projected down onto the lawn, but not so far as to affect the gait.

Yes, the original PlayStation was a true 32-bit machine, with dedicated coprocessors for triangle filling and T&amp;L.

This framebufferless rendering may have implications for how much transparency a scene can use, as remember that a GBA can't do sprite-on-sprite transparency.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I know it was a 32-bit machine, I was referring to 3D processing, but I guess the triangle filling was the answer. The PS1 had T&amp;L? I thought consoles like the PS2, GC, and XBox started using T&amp;L.
<br/>

Because the MIPS processor model in the PS1 didn't have a floating-point unit, Sony added the GTE chip (not Verizon but <a class="postlink" href="http://psx.rules.org/gte.txt" target="_blank">Geometry Transformation Engine</a>) to help with vector arithmetic chores such as transformation and lighting.

<br/>
That's quantization. It seems either the GTE or the triangle filler would sometimes lose precision and round vertices to pixel boundaries. In addition, the triangle filler (called <a class="postlink" href="http://psx.rules.org/gpu.txt" target="_blank">GPU</a>, nothing to do with NVIDIA) used affine texture mapping, and later games compensated by subdividing larger surfaces.
<br/>
<br/>
TRIVIA: The GBA uses the PS1's pixel formats almost exactly. Major difference is that the PS1 uses linear textures instead of the tiled textures of GBA sprites.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

it certainly does - I've avoided doing anything GBA specific to devkitARM for just that reason. It should, in theory, be sufficient to provide a suitable crt0 and linkscript and use the appropriate -mcpu option.

W is 1/Z, it means you have greater resolution  closer to the viewer.

I see what you mean about the sprites but I find it difficult to imagine HW 3D as rotated scaled sprites. I suppose when all's said and done it's a natural progression from sprite rendering though.

The part I have trouble with is the per pixel granularity of the 'priority' that would be needed to fake Z or W buffering effectively</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
air hocky first person veiw on bottom
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
use the styllus to move the airhocky thingy? and have a classic pong veiw on the top screen (use the d-pad to move it or the L and R buttons). a picture/picture view would be cool too. the score text can be transparent to save more screens space for extra features....
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, now for gameplay ideas
<br/>
<br/>
i was thinking of a mario tennis esque.... 
<br/>
you choose from different characters that have there own special abilities....
<br/>
when you score a point your character can do a celebration on one of the screens...
<br/>
<br/>
you can have power shots (speeds the ball up), some kind of funky (a special move that varies w/ every character), and maybe some others....
<br/>
<br/>
of course there could be different options, (classic pong, air hockey, new pong, and what other things people can think of).... 
<br/>
<br/>
airhockey would give you the ability of move the paddle in true 2d (up, down, left, and right). 
<br/>
<br/>
------
<br/>
<br/>
then you have different boards. 
<br/>
-slow, fast, intermediate (speeds)
<br/>
-maybe a board w/ rubber on the side walls that makes it bounce more than normal
<br/>
-etc. (all i can think of at the moment)
<br/>
<br/>
ill come back w/ more ideas if i get a reply again<br/>_________________<br/>want to earn some cash??  no joke, its awesome!
