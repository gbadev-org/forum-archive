Okay, guys - I am having a weird issue with libnds and DSWifi -
<br/>
<br/>
So I was working on this project for the past 3 weeks, getting good progress and the right kind of vibe with the system, getting the 3D engine, the picker, the RTC, and etc to work - and as of last night, I shoehorned DSWifi support in.  For some reason, once I shoehorned DSwifi support in, the 3D layer seems to vanish completely - even though iDeaS does not do that at all -
<br/>
<br/>
(Although iDeaS does not exactly do everything correctly either)
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone look through my code and see if there is a subtle mistake that might've caused this to happen?  
<br/>
<br/>
The previously working version without DSWifi support is here:

<br/>
<br/>
The version with DSWifi support but does not do 3D is here:

<br/>
<br/>
Did I forget to trap something in the ARM7 code, or is this something even more subtle?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
