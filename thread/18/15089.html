<br/>
I have always wanted to start coding on the DS just for fun.
<br/>
But never made time for it.
<br/>
<br/>
If I start to convert this am I going to hit a lot of problems?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going at first to use the touchscreen.
<br/>
Just want to get it running. I still think it is a great game as is.
<br/>
But if I enjoy what I'm doing who knows.
<br/>
<br/>
regards,
<br/>
