I tried writing a log file out using FAT while running under desmume and I discovered it doesn't actually write to disk, it just "virtually" writes to disk and keeps it in memory. :-(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know that desmume works with GDB, but I don't know how I would send a log message to GDB.  How do you do that?  I am new to gdb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, $1700 for the version of no$gba that supports source-level debugging.  Hmm..... Does the $15 version allow me to write a debug log?  There's no mention of logging on the web site <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gba-dev.htm" target="_blank">http://nocash.emubase.de/gba-dev.htm</a> so I'm unclear.  $1700 is a big much for free game development.  $15 is probably too low actually. :)  Well, I guess I can try the $15 version and see if it does anything.  That's not too much to "donate" to the no$gba project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You want custom debug messages from an emulator? Even if the emulator doesn't support this natively, you could just fill some memory region with your current debug contents.. and have a seperate application snoop the memory of the emulator, and extract it that way. (Look into attaching to processes and reading memory from other processes .. Linux has a ptrace interface)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given, that in this case you got to do several address translations (from NDS app to emulator memory location to mapped process memory) i really wouldn't recomment this approch to anyone (even if you know what you are doing)
<br/>
<br/>
But using the build-in memory, code, register, etc viewers might be helpfull.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
