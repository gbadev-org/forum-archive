    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It supports 802.11 wireless networking. I'm not sure whether is is 802.11b or 802.11g, but it is probably the first, to keep costs down and that's all that is really necessary.

I've been wondering, what does WiFi stand for? I know what it is but not what it stand for. I think the "Wi" stands for wireless, but what about the "Fi" part of it?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
