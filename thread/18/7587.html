    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">given enough time you could certainly do it, you certainly dont need 64 megs of ram it played fine on my p 100 an 16megs.  minus all the bloat of windows and it could be possible some sacrificies may have to be made.  or you could simply use the extra ram provided by an m3 or supercard.

That appears to be the case.  The playstation was able to play Quake 2 it had 2M system memory and 1M video memory.
<br/>
So it's not a matter of IF it's more a matter of anyone being motivated.
<br/>
Why don't you port it? :)

Ugh, the Playstation version of Quake 2 was...  blergh! That was not Quake 2, it was an entirely new game engine used to make a new game that vaguely resembled Quake 2.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if the DS could support the Q2 polycounts, since the CSG-based levels use a lot more triangles than required in order to subdivide intersecting surfaces so the software renderer could sort all polys back-to-front and live without using a z-buffer.
<br/>
<br/>
Probably you could port the engine, but the original art assets would be too much for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Quake 1, in other hand, sounds much more doable. Of course, being able to render the screen in two or more passes is vital to get around the polygon limit and push all of the original art assets in the screen (with good coding, maybe it could run at 20~30 fps). That's quite hard to do with the current homebrew tools, however.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i believe quake 1 engine has almost nothing in the way of optimisation (ie no backface culling etc) so theres certainly room for improvement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Really? So you're saying that some how costly rendering massive amounts of triangles per frame IN SOFTWARE on an inherently slow platform was pulled off with little or no optimization work?!
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that's why groundbreaking (at the time) technologies such as PVS and BSP had to be incorporated to achieve a decent frame rate. Not to mention the hard work of John Carmack and Michael Abrash, arguably the best optimizing graphics programmers...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I remember IGN had a little preview of it, but it was later canned.
<br/>
<br/>
I am positive Quake2 could be made to run on the DS, although, like mentioned above, a lot of assets would need to be changed.
<br/>
Still, I think you could get the end result looking pretty much identical.
<br/>
<br/>
The real question is....why is it left to homebrew :?
<br/>
Why arnt companies going mad porting FPS games left right and center to the DS!
<br/>
I mean the system is  *perfect* for them, and its only got one so far.

The far less suitable GBA, by comparison...had..what...10 ?

I'll guess that some of it is because the name "Nintendo" is associated with E and T games, leaving M games to "Sony". Think about it: if the Leapster handheld video game system had a killer feature that your favorite genre could use, would you want an M-rated game ported to a system marketed to kids in elementary school?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Honestly, I see Quake and Quake 2 (in the sense of the N64 version rather than a true port) as an enormous possibility, if not an inevitability.  But, you're right, there seems to be a huge sign around the DS that says to prospective companies, "Your target demographic is on the OTHER portable."  It just needs to go over that hump.

Didnt stop there being 7-10 FPS games on the GBA did it?

<br/>
I'm guessing most developers are just waiting for Metroid. They want to see how much stuff it will cram on the screen and how the controls will work (they're rumored to have been improved since the demo), and let it open the gate for DS FPS'es, before starting mass converting stuff like Quake, Perfect Dark and even Medal of Honor (the original game was on PSOne, remember?).

And the DS version of King Kong is a FPS as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
