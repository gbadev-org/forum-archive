    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok dude, I found another problem, but I also found the fix to it
<br/>
<br/>
this pertains to 2k5 only,
<br/>
<br/>
as of right now, it is saying project creation failed
<br/>
<br/>
so to fix this, I have to open up Nintendo DS and GBA Project Wizard.vsz and change 
<br/>
<br/>
Wizard=VsWizard.VsWizardEngine.9.0
<br/>
<br/>
to
<br/>
<br/>
Wizard=VsWizard.VsWizardEngine.8.0
<br/>
<br/>
to get it to work
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I do not know how you are going to fix this in the installer, but it looks like you are going to have to determine the difference from 2k5 and 2k8<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

Odd it works for me (without changing the vesion line) although i do have 2k8 express installed so maybe it is finding the right wizard library...
<br/>
<br/>
I will have to poke around some.
<br/>
<br/>
In the meentime I recomend you upgrading to 2k8 express (its no issue to have it installed along side 2k5).  2k8 is much more responsive and about 5 times faster starting up.
<br/>
<br/>
If you do happen to go that route could you check if the wizard runs on 2k5 after you install 2k8 express so i can narrow down the cause of this bug?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking a poke an I will see if i cant get it straitened out.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks...clears up why it works for me and not you.

<br/>
And you can uninstall it from add remove programs (it is listed as setup.exe).  This will be remedied when we switch to the production installer.

Except perhaps for the most generic of file types the makefile rules should be added as neaded.  Perhaps there is a cleaner way than cut and paste of each data inclusion rule for each file type but I dont think the solution is to stick in every possible file type in either.  The template makefiles included in the wizard are from the official libnds release and will be updated from that source.

Getting the same problem. Downloaded "Nintendo DS Wizard Setup.msi" today. Was almost impossible to remove the old version without finding the old "Nintendo DS Wizard Setup.msi" file and run with /uninstall. Since Add/Remove programs doesn't include it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Hours and hours of trying to find the right tools and libraries. All because gcc refuse to understand my portable C++ code that uses functional notation type casting &gt;.&lt;
<br/>
<br/>
int (variable); &lt;- r24 doesn't understand this and r26 won't work with old libnds and your wizard.
<br/>
<br/>
if (signed int (unsigned_variable) &lt; 0){} &lt;- gcc: what the hell is "signed", I want ";" ?
<br/>
<br/>
of course if ((signed int) unsigned_variable &lt; 0){} worked, but then i would have to rewrite way too many lines of portable code that already works with Microsoft's and Intel's compilers.

I even tried to rename template.c (in case gcc thought everything would be compiled as C) into template.cpp but powerON was ALSO defined as an inline (confusing stuff).

Getting the same problem. Downloaded "Nintendo DS Wizard Setup.msi" today. Was almost impossible to remove the old version without finding the old "Nintendo DS Wizard Setup.msi" file and run with /uninstall. Since Add/Remove programs doesn't include it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Hours and hours of trying to find the right tools and libraries. All because gcc refuse to understand my portable C++ code that uses functional notation type casting &gt;.&lt;
<br/>
<br/>
int (variable); &lt;- r24 doesn't understand this and r26 won't work with old libnds and your wizard.
<br/>
<br/>
if (signed int (unsigned_variable) &lt; 0){} &lt;- gcc: what the hell is "signed", I want ";" ?
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
and no, registration does nothing but allow you to comment on things.  The site is currently being restructured...long process it seems.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the removing the wizard you can use add/remove but its called "setup.exe" in the list for some reason...i have not had time to make a proper installer for it (it does nothing more than copy a few files)
<br/>
<br/>
Adding an option to support c++ (which only requires you rename the .c files .cpp) might be a good addition.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyway, got it to work now.

<br/>
The solution was to install devkitPro from its installer. The problem was to find this installer. 
<br/>
Their website download page links to individual uploads of different projects, and not the installer! You have to manually edit the URL to go back one page, then install an older version, and let that older version auto-update into a new version. 
<br/>
<br/>
Why does this have to be so hard?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also it took me a full day of 8 hours to convert C++ type casting into C type casting for 12,000 lines of code! &gt;.&lt; Just because GCC (g++) doesn't understand proper C++. Now I know why there can never be world peace.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One issue though, if I move the created folder that contains the project and try to build, I get a "Couldn't reserve space for cygwin's heap" error. Moving the folder back into it's original place and I don't get the error. When I move the folder, the path is correct in the Properties window and I can open all files in the Solution Explorer (so everything seems to be relative to the folder's new position).  Is there any way to make it independent of the folder's current position?

Not entirely certain i understand...it adds the default header files to the intelesence path...not sure where it would copy them to or what you would gain from this via just bookmarking the docs or the header file folder<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
