    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A few people were put off using my keyboards because of the shading, the latest keyboard example simplifies the look so it will suit a broader variety of apps.
<br/>
<br/>
- Source is now in one file (plus header) to make integration easier.
<br/>
- No more use of lcdSwap() function as it messes up on some carts. I was obviously being lazy before, now the keyboard is drawn to the sub screen like it should.
<br/>
- Cleaned up the code a bit.
<br/>
- Keyboard is now at the bottom of the screen, so it's easier to use (apparently).
<br/>
- Removed my custom pen jump checking code, since libnds takes care of most of this these days and is always being improved.
<br/>
- Updated source using latest LibNDS template.

<br/>
- Added back my pen jump checking code. It seems to work better on h/w, although it doesn't work as well in Dualis.
<br/>
<br/>
While your debugging your apps in Dualis you might want to comment out the following line to remove the custom pen jump detection code:

If you liked the old beveled blue keyboard like in the previous example, I have added a zip file of just the keyboard binary data that you can copy over the latest ones in the data directory.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't mean for the keyboard with more keys, but the current less-keys one.  Maybe it could be like in DSOrganize where you could swap keyboards for a full key-set one or a large-sized one (but with less keys).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like a good idea to me. A cut down keyboard might be more appropriate for some people. Like removing the function keys and Home/PgUp/PgDn/End etc. because they might not be used in many apps. I've got a new project going at the moment, but if I get some time I'll knock up an example.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is a version without the F key row that I made:
<br/>
<a href="http://deku.gbadev.org/temp/Keyboard2.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been using your keyboard graphics in my ever-so-slowly progressing DS tracker, where I only need it for entering text, so that top row never did anything. I also added undo/redo keys, at the cost of the DS and context menu keys.
<br/>
<br/>
Just for fun, I also tried going down to 4 rows, moving the numbers over to numpad style (although still affected by shift for symbols). It's pretty cramped though, and there was no space left for alt or delete:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Also, some number-only versions:

<br/>
<a href="http://deku.gbadev.org/temp/KeyboardHex.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I ended up writing my own code for it, but the graphics are very nice, and I love your idea for the table to map from which char was touched to which key was pressed. Makes it nice and easy to switch between multiple keyboard layouts :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Deku, good to hear your still working on your tracker. I remember our suprise when we first saw 0xtob's screenshots for Nitro Tracker. Did you check out my custom skin for it? Unfortunately he's written custom control drawing code so it wasn't possible to just replace the tiles with mine so my skin will probably never be used :( Anyway, I look forward to your tracker (looked good in the screenshot you showed me). Perhaps I will do a skin for it some day.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've now released a cut-down version of the keyboard which very closely resembles Deku's modified version. It again has the option of the blue beveled keyboard or the plain grey version. I didn't remove the Home/PgUp/PgDn/End keys because it looked a bit strange without them.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
