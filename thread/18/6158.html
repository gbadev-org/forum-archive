    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
I'm in need of a demo that I can learn from for the NDS... You will recieve credit in my final program (GameMakerDS the GameMaker player for the NDS!)... I need to be able to read a file on the compact flash card on the NDS... It should be able to read single bytes, longs, and shorts from the file as well as ANSII text and return them to the program. The encoding to read is little endian. Thanks -Leif902

Using standard file functions like fseek(), you can read as many bytes as you like from any file at any offset.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I'm doing is creating a reader program for the DS that reads gm6 files and playes them (using both screens, mic, etc... full functionallity!)... First the gm6 file is converted into a gmds file (converter is almost done w/ settings) and then that is read on the DS w/ a nds reader... it can have ds specific code (such as draw only if on ds and junk) through my own special scripting system... It's comming along great, I just wanted this to start the reader (and it needs to read/write bynary!) Thanks again -Leif902
