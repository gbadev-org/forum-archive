    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a few questions regarding the matrix and div / sqrt registers on the NDS:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Are there any issues with doing other processing on the CPU while doing a div or sqrt on the math processor?
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Can you do a div and sqrt simultaneously?
<br/>
<br/>
3.  All of the examples I've seen that use the matrix registers are in relation to the model / projection matrices on the GPU.  Can you use them to perform operations on matrices in general?  E.g., multiplying several matrices together to transform a vector (not a triangle vertex), and reading the transformed vector back once the operation is complete.
<br/>
<br/>
4.  If (3) is possible, is it more efficient than doing than implementing the same operation on the CPU?  Any ideas on how long they take?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
