    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Because of differences in the underlying models of the audio hardware, it might be easier to convert GSF files into programs that run on the GBA (or on the Nintendo DS in GBA mode) than to make a GSF player that runs in DS mode.
<br/>
<br/>
As for PSF, it'd probably be easier just to convert it to WAV, downsample it to 18157 Hz mono, and run it through GSM Player, especially given that a lot of PSFs are streamed.
<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility: figure out the file format for the tracked music in common GBA and PS1 music engines (a la Sappy/Saptapper) and make a player for that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
