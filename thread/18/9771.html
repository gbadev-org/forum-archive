    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, i updated to 19 right away...
<br/>
<br/>
bad surprise #1: the dsbuild was missing... big thanks to WinterMute for posting it.
<br/>
<br/>
surprise #2: code builds fine as usual, but will crash dualis and any other emulator that ran it before updating the devkit.
<br/>
<br/>
i mean, without it, i couldn't even think of coding for nds. i'm really thankfull!
<br/>
<br/>
... but it can't be that it trashes working code. what a disappointment. (or is it just silly me?)
<br/>
<br/>
i hope you guys fix that soon! (it says unknown arm 9 operation or something on some emu... dualis just quits...)
<br/>
<br/>
or do i have to update something else? i don't use any libs except libnds.
<br/>
i even uninstalled the whole thing and deleted any remains, just to reinstall it and see the rom still crashes the emus... and i don't have hardware yet.
<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Please do not grade devkitARM based on what happens in emulators. If you want to develop programs that run only in emulators, then you're developing programs that run only on a PC, so why not just use AllegroGL directly?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well... i don't have money to buy a devkit and a nds, yet. i'm doing my best to save a bit here and there.
<br/>
i wish i didn't have to rely on emus, but that's the way it is.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for making it clear that this is an emu problem (though ensata won't run it, too - and that thing eats a very big bunch of nds software others don't).
<br/>
<br/>
this basically means i have to downgrade and stick with 18 untill i have a devkit (and a nds).
<br/>
<br/>
i didn't grade it... did i? i haven't said it's crap or something, i really like it! it's just that i can't continue working after the update, that's what upsets me.
<br/>
<br/>
and if i wanted to develop pc software (which i do, too, without use of any libraries) i woudn't care about posting here and learning to use the hardware... why would you say that? i mean, perhaps i'm not a noob, but i'm still pretty new to the thing...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then code for the GBA instead. The GBA emulators (VBA, RBA, NO$GBA) are pretty accurate, and most of your skills should transfer to the DS.

It's the same as what Michel Iwaniec said over on the nesdev.com forums. If you're not learning to use the hardware, then you're not really "learning to use the hardware."
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: Get good at GBA programming, and you'll pick up DS 2D quickly. Get good at OpenGL programming, and you'll pick up DS 3D quickly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i don't want to get personal [especially not with one of the respectable nds veterans], but why are you pushing me towards gba? is there a special reason? i COME from gba dev and i want to program for the NDS...
<br/>
that isn't too hard to understand, is it? i also started coding for gba before having the hw... and it was OK.
<br/>
<br/>
i have WORKING code for ds, but after upgrading the devkit and recompiling it won't run on EMULATORS anymore and i don't know why?! and because emulators (i use dualis) are the only way to check my code without having hw and relying on others... (and bothering them with testing buggy code that could be easily detected with an emulator  - aren't emus for that purpose anyway [map/sprite viewers, memory viewers, register viewers...]? i mean from a developers point of view, not a "pirates")
<br/>
<br/>
because of that i was asking for HELP in this forum.
<br/>
<br/>
i hope this is enough to comprehend my problem. this sort of p*sses me off... again I KNOW NDS 2D ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME SIMPLE STUFF LIKE HARDWARE BGS AND SPRITES TO DISPLAY MY GRAPHICS and other things. everything in hardware. i also did some framebuffer software rendering. yupp, i did my homework.
<br/>
<br/>
so PLEASE!!! stop telling me to do gba programming instead just because i don't have a nds, yet! man, it isn't just me who doesn't have hw and programms for nds!
<br/>
<br/>
btw: i don't have ensata, i just sent it over to a buddy who told me it will crash... i don't see why this is important... even ensata can run code that hardware wouldn't and it won't run everything that will run on hw... just as every emu. remember: for some people it's the only way to learn the hardware BEFORE having it available.
<br/>
<br/>
please stop on commmenting if you don't want to help. i won't return to gba for sure. really, i mean it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
big break:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
QUESTION TO EVERYONE: does anyone have the same problem? i will "investigate" further and see, if i find a solution. (i would post it here, if i found one).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because all of the current Nintendo DS emulators are inaccurate in some way, shape, or form. I'm pushing you toward a platform where better emulators exist.

<br/>
Because the current state of Nintendo DS emulation is analogous to the state of NES emulation roughly ten years ago, even before Nesticle became capable of running the first <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario Bros.</span> game.

If you can't afford hardware, you can't afford DS development in the year 2006.

Sometimes the most helpful answer that we can give is "Sorry, the best publicly available emulators are not good enough, and it's not your fault. You'll need to mow the lawn enough times until you have $220 to buy a DS, a NoPass, a SuperCard, a CF card, and a CF writer." I regret not being able to help you further until you tell us something about your financial situation, including filling in the "Location" field of your profile so that we can know whether you live in a high-wage country or a low-wage country.

Yes, I do have the same problem. My AXE demo runs fine on hardware but doesn't run on the versions of the emulators that were current when I released it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you really have more time than money, then you could download one of the emulators and single-step through the init code of both your program compiled under devkitARM R18 and your program compiled under devkitARM R19, seeing where it breaks.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the later part of you post is super cool info for me, so thank you. then my code isn't screwed, it's the emus (as you posted before).
<br/>
<br/>
i'm studying computer sience and can't find work that's somehow compatible with my time scedule till now. i had a few jobs (up to two at the same time), but that was like two semesters ago. i live in good old germany. yep. not a poor country, but it certainly gets worse every day. it's quite hard to find a job as a student without those "special friends", that means relations.
<br/>
<br/>
so all i can do is work as security on some events, but that's like 20 ? an event and max 2 or 3 a month... and i do it just to avoid lending money from anyone. you see, it's quite hard to save some money. plus days like today aren't rare, it's 2 am and i'm still in university... doing damn homework (and not because i'm late, there's plenty to do... it's even been a free day here!) - ok, i'm having abreak right now ;)
<br/>
<br/>
enough. i don't want to sound like i'm crying. i can handle it. but if i want to achieve SOMETHING i have to learn as much as i can and that includes nds deving without hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your time. i think this thread can be closed now, because i have the info i needed. i'll be working with r18 untill a better dualis comes out or i have the hw.
