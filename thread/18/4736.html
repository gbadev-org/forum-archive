    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well out of coincidence I got two `Belkin Wireless G` USB sticks over the holidays and wanted to try see if they can at least find my DS. The problem is even after reading the 20+ page thread I just don't know where to begin. The Windows WLAN is up and running, but when creating a profile to try pick up the DS I have no idea whether to set it (the WLAN) as an access point or peer to peer, what transfer rate to set for the best chance, what channel to use, authentication on or off etc. I have Mario and the Metroid Hunters demo, and if anyone will recommend a way to even just see the DS appear in Netstumbler I'd really appreciate it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was able to get the DS to appear in netstumbler.  First, set the mode to Infrastructure (access point), not Ad-Hoc (peer to peer).  In infrastructure mode, you don't choose channels, the card automatically scans.  Also, the DS uses the 802.11 protocol, so only Short Preamble will work.  I've gotten NetStumbler to work on the DS, but not Ethereal (yet).  That's all I can tell you.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any advice on which is the game most likely to be discovered (Mario, Metroid, Pictochat)..? I did try for a while yesterday without any luck but I'll give it a try again tomorrow. It's the `authentication on or off` and `transfer speed` questions that really add confusion to it. Cheers for the advice though. :) Sounds like a moronic question but I have to start somewhere after all.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Hm, looks like the Belkin in Access point mode is only scanning channel 1. Can't seem to change it. Perhaps someone with another Belkin adapter can advise on this one..? :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Short Preamble
<br/>
Infrastructure
<br/>
2.0 Mbps transfer speed
<br/>
Authentication off
<br/>
SSID = "ANY"
<br/>
Encryption disabled
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When filling the SSID property, enter the literal string ANY (three letters, all caps).  This allows for scanning of any SSID in Infrastructure mode.  Also, in Infrastructure mode, you can't choose which channel you are on, because, in Infrastructure mode, the card scans all channels that is broadcasting an SSID, and when you choose to connect to an SSID, it finds out which channel is broadcasting the SSID, and connects to that channel.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gave it another go leaving Mario on the waiting screen. Netstumbler doesn't even seem to notice the DS at all still, just my normal network. I also don't seem to get the choice over a lot of options with the Belkin software (No SSID or short preamble choice for example). Might try my luck and see if Knoppix will pick up the wireless stick at all.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Just been looking through the Windows device manager and found options galore for the WI-FI stick. SSID, "Ad-hoc" and "infra.." modes, all that stuff called by their proper names. Not sure how changes made there will relate to the Belkin software but worth a look...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im not sure what you trying to achieve.  Even if it DOES show up in NetStumbler you are no closer to being able to do anything useful.
<br/>
<br/>
I would have thought having read the 20+ page thread you would have realised that the DS cannot join a WLAN, the only way it can do anything is by tunneling and that isnt release yet and only works with 1 USB stick which seems to only be available in the UK.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

That's what I'm trying to achieve. I'm a tech enthusiast. Much in the fashion of booting Feather Linux from a pen drive, I just find things like this interesting and fun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do know what you mean, but there isnt ANY public code to allow us to do anything with wireless on the DS right now.  Therefore unless you can write the drivers yourself (and logic would suggest you wouldnt be asking these questions if you could) its pointless trying at this point.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I just said, if I can get it to show up under Netstumbler that's all I want for the moment. At least then I know the chances of the Belkin stick being compatible in the future. I want to learn, that's all.
<br/>
After all going on the logic that trying anything with the DS is a waste of time right now, why have people bothered releasing the model viewer/extraction tools? They aren't "useful" in the strictest sense either since no repacking or such options are available yet so why should they have bothered? Well, because they did it to help people learn and for the fun of doing it. Something quite common in the homebrew and emulation communities.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
