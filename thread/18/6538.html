all those graphics are ripped from the windows version, running under XP. controls could be worked out fairly well for left and right hand simultaneously:
<br/>
<br/>
stylus would to be used to assign jobs and increase/decrease drop rate
<br/>
up/down (X/B for left handed) cycle through jobs
<br/>
left/right (Y/A for right handed), or stylus on lower map could be used to scroll level
<br/>
L (R for right handed) toggles fast forward (green arrows)
<br/>
double tap select (sorry, righties) activates apocalypse
<br/>
and start to pause
<br/>
<br/>
the entire game directory, minus the massive acrobat manuals, is only about 6 mb, and it only seems to use about 5.5 mb of ram (under XP!) so a ds.gba format port is definitely a possibility. .nds format would probably have to be handled on a level pack basis, which.. well, i don't think this is legal anyway, i just felt like drawing it up to fit with the DS' resolution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd love to see a port of this for the DS.  None of the versions of Lemmings that have been released since the originals have been worth playing.  Which version is the PSP port based on?  Or is it something new?
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, there *is* an OSS version of Lemmings... it's called Pingus (http://pingus.seul.org/welcome.html).  I haven't tried it yet but the screenshots look nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The job selection buttons are on the bottom, but the amount of each is on the top in order to save space &amp; give more room to the play area. Not sure what to do with the empty space on the top.
<br/>
<br/>
Other controls like speed / nuke all could be accessed through a menu (press start) or have a menu button on the touch screen somewhere

No two screens? Put the status bar on the other. No touch screen? Extend the sprite follow hack to include memory locations for both x and y, and either press directions on the D-pad based on the displacement between the cursor sprite location and the touch location or modify the memory location directly.
<br/>
<br/>
It's all a question of effort vs. payoff: do you add a feature to an existing emulator, or do you write your own side-view RTS from scratch? The cursor movement hack code might prove useful for other NES games (such as <span style="font-style: italic">Nobunaga's Ambition</span> and other Koei simulations) as well as for Super NES games (such as for <span style="font-style: italic">SimCity</span>).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
How about using the stylus for scrolling the screen with a secondary non-map scrolly. Use the X and Y (or whatever takes yah fancy) for the Release Rate inc-dec, the (something else) for the task cycle buttons (and keep the dunnnnn sound effect!) but keep the jobs on the bottom screen, with their counts. If you redrew the brown panels with a new supersampled BGR magic-font widget, then you could get the job counts looking sharp (as opposed to my quick-draw resample here) :) Put some info about the level on the top screen... I'd keep the scrolling map at the top of the top screen because looking near the hinge is pretty uncomfortable. Bearing that in mind, it's probably better if the jobs go on the bottom of the bottom screen.

That DS mockup lemmings has something that's weird: a minimap on the touchscreen... what happens if the lemmings start to walk up there? (Like 'Truce' in the 2-player mode) ._.

If the minimap's on the top screen, then I guess the D-pad can be for quickly panning/moving the screen's line of sight. If it were on the touch screen, one could just touch a part of the minimap to change the view. The former sounds better.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this was in the original, but there should be white dots on the minimap representing lemmings. Don't forget the + and - buttons for changing the lemmings' dropping rate. (or was it walking speed) I guess you could use X and Y like in the pictures, but that seems lame.

I have a DS and I have written a fair few games for it. Surely coders out there must know the feeling of finishing a game and NEVER wanting to see the code again... I hacked Lemmings up in a week in my patented "quick-n-dirty" style, it works well but I really don't want to go there again... It was only fun the first time around.
<br/>
<br/>
I might think about recoding lemmings when I can get the touchscreen to behave correctly.

If anyone wants a copy of the source, graphics, music and sounds ask nicely and I might give it to you ;-)

By the way Dovoto, thanks so much for your site, it taught me just about everything I know about GBA coding (I even bought one of your teeshirts). Also, congrats on the baby...

The SMS/GG versions are better graphically, and musically plus they play closer to the original amiga version, since you just click on the jobs vs the nes key combo.. this would make it easier to put touch screen code into drsms similar to scumm..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Trademark owners are much easier to deal with than copyright or patent owners. For instance, if The Tetris Company cease-and-desists me for <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#tod" target="_blank">Tetanus On Drugs</a> because "Tetanus" sounds confusingly similar, I already have a backup name "Lockjaw: <span style="font-weight: bold">T</span>he <span style="font-weight: bold">O</span>ver<span style="font-weight: bold">d</span>ose" that fits into <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=100" target="_blank">the new project I'm developing on tetrisconcept.com forums</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
