Right now, I've heard that someone got something to display via the DS interface, but not much.  The 3DS is going to be nearly impossible to homebrew on if Nintendo has their way this time around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">English again, sorry.  This is from my limited knowledge, which is probably wrong since I've been out of the DS loop for ages:
<br/>
<br/>
There are many flash carts that can access DS mode on the 3DS and DSi.  They work by reflashing the firmware to make themselves appear like a legitimate game (faking the header, for instance).  The CycloDS cart is the only one that can run DSi stuff in DSi mode.  There are currently no flash carts that can run code using the 3DS's upgraded hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The latest homebrew programs, compiled with the latest version of DevKitARM, can use the DSi's 16 MB of RAM and maybe the faster CPU.  I would assume that these homebrew programs would require either SudokuHax or the CycloDS cart that can run DSi code, but I honestly don't know for sure.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I too do not know where any 3DS hacking discussion might be taking place.  GBAdev here is, well, kinda dead.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  Hm, apparently this was somewhat of a necropost.  Though, compared to the age of the rest of this forum...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, they use both the DSi increased memory and the ARM9 at increased speed. DSx86 shows this very well. Of course they also need a DSi mode cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I've read somewhere there are some first running tests of code working in 3DS native mode. Can't remember where I read it, ATM :|</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Those fake a ROM, not "firmware". There is no real dedicated 3DS homebrew forum AFAIK. <a href="http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
