        <h2>DS development > Thoughts on region lockout</h2>

    <h4>#27593 - sgeos - Sat Oct 16, 2004 5:48 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm assuming that the Japanese and US versions of the DS are going to run different firmware.  My reason for believing this is the bundled chat program.  Why would a US release console contain a Japanese IME?  The unit could use unicode internally.  I don't think it would be a big deal for them to include the IME, but I think that would confuse people.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine what would happen if some kid accidentally activates the IME.  BAM!  Kana.  'What in the name of holy Moses is going on here?!  What's up with all these China letters?!'
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what about other foreign releases?  I imagine that they are all going to have localized input methods.  (Using ASCII everywhere doesn't strike me as acceptable.)  Including all of them seems like it would be goofy.  Releasing localized units sounds like a good exuse to implement region lockout on DS games.  Just my thoughts.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I have read, pictochat has support for several languages on all the units people have used, so I'm guessing no region lockout (or at least I hope so because I have one on order from overseas).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't ask me where I heard this, 'cause I don't remember right now (I should be in bed), and it may just be a rumor anyways, but I read on the 'net somewhere that the DS is going to be region free.  Now, I don't know if this means ALL DS' will be region free, or just North America's, but it wouldn't make sense for us to play Jap games and the Japanese only get to play their games and no Eng imports.  Mind you, those guys on those great floating islands get the best games, almost always before we do!  So I don't think they'd really care that much, except for the people who think english is really cool, which may be a lot, possibly the majority, so maybe they would think it's a big deal...  hmmmzuh...  snrkt.....  bluffamunumuh......  bed... calling... zzzzzz.....
<br/>
<br/>
If I didn't make any sense ignore me.  I don't know why I bother going onto forums late at night, I end up causing more confusion than it' worth...
<br/>
<br/>
but you can take it from here... the DS may be region free...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With no region lockouts, the system won't really have to be tailored for a specific system.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, I only think region lockout are applicable when putting a PAL game into a NTSC system and vice versa due to the display format. I don't understand why they restrict it even further when it comes to US games and Japanese games. It's like torture when you have to wait for a game from Japan!!!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That would make it somewhat harder to port a game from one region to another. It's not a good idea to create barriers for developers when they don't need to be there in the first place.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just have a different header file that define the registers to other areas of the memory. When creating games for different regions the actual code is often the smallest problem, it's the content that is bothersome.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I was hoping Nintendo had already confirmed the DS being region free but I can't find any reliable info on that. However, I doubt it will have region lock-out, looking back on their previous hand-helds.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What really bothers me is when there's a lockout on a Japanese game I want, and nobody ever bothers to release a local version.  There's so many good games that never make it over here, Errnngghh!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When Microsoft lowered the cost of their Xbox from $499 to $299 (or whatever the US price was at the time, I live in europe) they supposedly lost alot of money on each unit sold. They where kind of prepared that they would lose a lot of money on the Xbox just to get a big enough slice of the market so they have a running start for the Xbox 2.

Anyways, back to the origial topic. Don't worry about region lock-outs. Nintendo haven't given any reason why there should be a lock-out and historically they haven't had it on their hand helds.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree.  They've always been the most liberal console manufacturer when it comes to regional lockouts.  Remember the N64's lockout system? A little piece of plastic :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And the GameCube's regional lockout consists of two points on the MoBo which either are or aren't soldered together depending on the region, lol.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
