    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a DS Lite, an M3 Lite and a Passcard 3. I'e been toying with the idea of buying another DS Lite and make the game im currently developing into a multiplayer game. 
<br/>
I'm aware i'd have to update the firmware of one of the consoles (with FlashMe v7 i assume)... but would i require another M3 Lite to have the game  run on both consoles? Or am i able to transfer the game to the flashed console via DS Download Play.. ?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NAT is only used if you are going out to the internet.  But, you are correct, there isn't ad-hoc mode available yet.  So, best you could do right now would be to create an FTP server on one DS and allow the rest to download from it, but they would still need to be able to run a homebrew FTP client to get the file from..  So, unless you have a WiFiMe compatible connection you're back to card swapping.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So I'm confused. If you had one DS Lite with FlashMe + M3 Lite and another DS with just a Passcard3, will download play work? Since I'm not interested in download play with pirated games, would the scenario mentioned above work with homebrew games instead?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS doesn't do ad-hoc. In commercial games using Ni-Fi (local multiplayer), the "master" machine acts as a software access point with no Internet uplink.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

So then wouldn't it be possible to use a homebrew enabled DS to act as a master server to distribute the game to  another DS ( which has no extra hardware)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wait a second... doesn't wifime show up in regular download play? How does it work that out? (reminder yo self: go try wifime on your repaired DS later)

<br/>
Anywho, I am interested in the ability to set up my games to run in wifi, so this is all good to me. Could someone point out where the appropriate library (and any tutorials on the subject) is(are)? Thanks.

I have got ad-hoc mode working for DS. It will be released together with the network stack I am creating for nintendo DS. I will also be looking into a software AP implementation for DS.
<br/>
<br/>
A software AP implementation will have a better datatransfer throughput than ad-hoc, but ad-hoc is easier to implement, so I chose that one to implemement first.
<br/>
<br/>
I will also be looking into WPA encryption, but I can't say for certain if this will be feasable for DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So is this a modification to SGstair's code or a completely new wifi library?  From the sound of it, it's the latter.  Just two questions:  Do you know if the two can coexist in the same homebrew file, so users can choose whichever one works better for their wireless setup?  And is support for non-broadcasted SSIDs planned?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good luck with the project.  Hope you hit success quickly and easily.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
