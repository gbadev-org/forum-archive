    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been following the patater tutorial on beginner's nds and i've been wanting to know how to first convert PNGs (in frames) to nds format using Grit and secondly how to apply that in the code( ie displaying the different frames ). if anyone could tell me how to do it or simply direct me to the howto for it, it'd be very appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Note: It's important, that you store frames in a vertical layout in the sprite sheets.

That's accurate for 1D mode. But in 2D mode, you might want to store the frames in a 256-pixel-wide (16-color) or 128-pixel-wide (256-color) sheet.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
thx for the suggestion. i did however search the forum before even registering an account and there were some threads about it but they were unanswered as well. more specifically, i was looking for what are the options to use with grit/wingrit. and i don't know, are they many different ways of doing this if using grit?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

for 1D mode, 256 colors, each frame 64x64, do you just do:

In 1D mode, a 16x16 object uses tiles 0, 1, 2, 3; in 2D mode, it uses tiles 0, 1, 32, 33. See also <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/regobj.htm#ssec-map" target="_blank">tonc:obj-mapping</a>.

<br/>
By default, grit distributes the tiles as they appear in the bitmap (i.e., as a matrix), making it more suitable for 2D modes. However, you can also clump multiple tiles together with the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/man/grit/html/grit.htm#ssec-opts-meta" target="_blank">metatiling options</a> -Mw and -Mh. You can also achieve this by arranging bitmap as a column of animation frames instead of a row. In a columnar layout, 2D and 1D are effective identical, so no additional options are necessary.

thanks i'll look at more on that metatiling thing as i'll be using a column-arranged frames. 
<br/>
Another question that i've been looking for is how you load up different frames of the sprite. can you show me an example? i've seen people using SPRITE_GFX directly( which i have no idea what's going on ), and the dmaCopyHalfWords(..) ( which i'm using from patater example ). if someone can show me an example of one of those or even each of the methods, that'll be really great.
<br/>
