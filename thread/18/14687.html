    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a Maxmedia dock and a Ninapass x9.  My program loads and works fine with the maxmedia.  With the Ninjapass, it starts up correctly, but it hangs when it tries to initialize the arm7.  Somehow the arm7 isn't loading properly and is crashing.
<br/>
<br/>
So the loaders on the two flashcards are probably different, and the maxmedia is doing something for me that the ninjapass isn't.  Any ideas?  Anyone run into a problem like this before?  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ran into a problem on the MK2/MK3 cartridges with the arm7 not loading, where it loaded elsewhere.  In my case, it turned out the crt0 used with my version of the toolchain was a false-positive to the neoflash bricker protection, and it was halting loading.  For me, I had to put a NOP in the crt0 to get it loading properly, but I don't know if this is the same case for you.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.
