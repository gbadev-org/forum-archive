I'll give you a step by step rundown - ignoring anything you might have done already:
<br/>
<ul>- First set up C::B, gcc, gdb etc. and compile a simple example (dafault project) to verify everything works fine.
<br/>
- Install devkitPro; a regular installation with everything you'll need
<br/>
- Compile an example to verify the installation (via make in the windows shell [run cmd])</ul>
<br/>
Ok, now on to the "fusion" part:
<br/>
<ul>- Open C::B's compiler settings
<br/>
- Select the GNU GCC Compiler preset
<br/>
- Make a copy of it, rename it to something along the lines of "NDS GCC"
<br/>
- Change to the toolchain executables tab
<br/>
- Select your devkitARM installation folder via (...)
<br/>
- All tools should be found, except the resource compiler, which is not needed. The tools' names start with arm-eabi-</ul>
<br/>
You're nearly done:
<br/>
<ul>- Select make from msys' bin folder.</ul>
<br/>
Next you need to make a new project or open an exsisting one and:
<br/>
<ul>- Go to Project-&gt;Properties...
<br/>
- Select only Windows as the target platform (may not be required, though)
<br/>
- Enter the makefile's name and check the custom makefile box (to be checked!)
<br/>
- In the build options, you need to select the NDS compiler setting you created earlier
<br/>
- Also in the build options, you will have to modify the make commands in the last tab: remove $target at the end of the first (build) and the third (clean) line</ul>
<br/>
Now you should be able to hit compile and rebuild without any problems.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Optional stuff:
<br/>
<br/>
You can't just hit "run." Well you can, but it won't run the rom. That's why I include the .nds files in the project tree. When you double click it (and it already exists), C::B asks you how to open it. On Windows you can select to open it with the associated application (e.g. no$gba).
<br/>
<br/>
You can also include some search directories in the compiler settings. I recommend including libnds' and some devkitARM include folders.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
