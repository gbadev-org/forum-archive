    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is there a way to connect people and play local wifi games like disgaea, mario party, etc etc and play them connected to the internet by creating a server, connecting via modem or ip or making a platform? or just connect 2 ds with internet?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/dstunnel/" target="_blank">sgstair's dstunnel</a> is ever finished then it might be possible but you would need extremely low ping to your opponent and it wouldn't be compatible with all wi-fi hardware.  There have also been no updates to the dstunnel webpage for nearly 3 years.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have developed a very simple Client / Server application (like a Chat Program) as a proof of concept. 
<br/>
<br/>
The configuration is fairly simple. There's a Server which accepts connections from multiple clients, which can be DS or other PCs, and just relays data passed from one client to the other(s).
<br/>
<br/>
I used the latest wifi example (AP search) as a basis for the DS code, together with the Keyboard and 'printing' routines from the 'old' wifi comms example. (I couldn't get the default keyboard to work properly) 
<br/>
<br/>
The server code is written in VB6 using Winsock but any language supporting Sockets could be used.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Whether this type of aproach would be acceptable for a 'real time' game where there are lots of things moving about etc I don't know, since there are many factors to be taken into consideration (eg Network latency, volume of data being passed around etc). With careful design and minimising the need to transmit lots of data (eg by sending delta values of things that have moved) and a good Application Protocol design and implementation you may be ok. 
<br/>
<br/>
The example I cited above uses TCP, but I suspect that UDP would be a 'better' solution for gaming as it wouldn't *really* matter if a packet or two got lost on the way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
