<br/>
<br/>
I am however very interested in DS homebrew and have been lurking around dev forums and blogs. Thanks to drunkencoders I've found out about an Apple Plus emulator on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Now for the reason on why I'm here... On one of the comments on Lazyone's blog, someone posted the following:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Really nice! I have an idea for reducing screen size: why not giving an option to put the screen in a grayscale mode, reducing the size to 1/2 per direction?
<br/>
It should be quite easy to implement, fast, and the detail you lose is partially recovered by the grayscale.
<br/>
Something like reducing a 4 bw pixel square to a 5 gray level pixel should still give a readable screen?
<br/>
cheers</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
Sounded iffy to me, but I made a few renders in GIMP for the heck of it and found the results to be pretty good. :)

Some of the text is a bit distorted but I think it would be a pretty good option to add in. Lazyone if you're reading this, could you tell us if this is possible to implement or would it slow the framerate down too much?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have taken a brief look at how scaling would work, how it would be done and how good it would look.
<br/>
<br/>
Text would be a problem, it's close to readable but not 100% - which is fine for games I guess.
<br/>
<br/>
As for speed, the only cost for rendering the 1bpp mac display is reading two values from a pre-calculated lookup table for every 8 pixels.
<br/>
<br/>
To render the entire 512x342 screen takes about 11ms, rendering a 256x192 area takes only 3-4ms but requires further changes to how minivmac tells the platform code to render the screen.
<br/>
In addition, not all of that screen needs to be updated all the time either so there's more room for improvement there aswell.
<br/>
<br/>
Since I have much more important work to do on the emulator I will not be looking into scaling right at this moment.
<br/>
However, since Mini vMac is GPL anyone can request the source and add it in if they want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

#4 Tetris? But why? We already have Tetris DS (Game Card) and TOD (homebrew).
<br/>
<br/>
I would imagine that the scaling could be improved by using orange and blue subpixels. It'd produce a bit of fringing on single-pixel-wide fonts such as Geneva and Monaco (non-bold), but that would just result in a charming Apple ][ feel. And I'd suggest an exact 2:1 scaling (down to 256x171), not 256x192.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If somebody was playing around with scaling, it would also be interesting to try leaving the menu bar at 100% and scaling the content area of the screen to 50%. Might be much more tricky to emulate though as you'd probably have to patch a couple of the menu routines.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would have liked it it when the screen is scrolling, for it not to go past the edge of the mac-screen, ie, keep the pointer centered unless your at an edge, then move freely, I hope I explained that good enough.

Is this emu capable of color?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have thought about putting in an options page where things like mouse behaviour and key binding could be modified.
<br/>
That would come whenever I decide to re-do the input/sub gfx system which is a ways off unless someone else wants to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
My next focus is on speeding up the emulator a bit in hopes of reaching 30fps.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, the emulator does not support a colour display.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
