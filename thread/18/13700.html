    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi good developer community! 
<br/>
<br/>
This is a question: any knows if it's possible to play ogg music on a DS? Moonshell does but not in a game. I'm producing a game and I wanted to know if there is a possibility to play OGG music, or if anyone heard of someone who made it.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we aren't talking about a CD quality music, just the basic quality.
<br/>
<br/>
We aren't talking about 4 minute songs either, just 20 seconds as much.
<br/>
<br/>
We aren't considering the possibility of using .xm either (or mod) because, the music is on .ogg and wav, so we are trying to research more on the ogg part (wav is possible we know).
<br/>
<br/>
Just that! 
<br/>

<br/>
There's this nice little thing called Tremor. It's a library designed for playing OGG files. It has a special version usable on low-power devices like the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty usable, although I recall hearibng that it needs some modifications to the code to run perfectly on the DS...
<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to be very careful with your audio quality if you plan to use OGGs in a game on the DS. OGG files require more CPU time to decode, so doing so while running a game is a little tricky...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

True, but I used streaming compressed audio (albeit not Vorbis) in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">a GBA game</a> and it worked fine, so it should not prove difficult to find a quality/CPU sweet spot.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, I'm doing some of my research. But, btw, what's wrong with asking? it bothers? it makes the elite devs feel like they are answering newbies questions? this forum is full of question and answers, topics and conversations which makes it one of the best for DS and GBA development. Why asking a question bring answers like "Please try and do *some* of your own research.... " like if I were hurting someone by asking a question? Isn't the whole forum point to ask questions and collaborate with the knowledgement we gain to help other forum users to clear their own very questions?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I made a question then. I used the search many weeks ago, I read every little post about Tremor but I wasn't sure if anyone accomplished something with OGG (wasn't clear for me).
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe was the term "research". Too formal. Bring the worst on people. Will remember not to use that one again between "this" kind of people...

Exactly, that was what I was thinking this morning. The thing is, I don't believe anyone did it yet so there is no good implementation of it. Too bad, we dropped OGG implementation yesterday so... we aren't going to try either.

Thanks anyway everyone for your help... yep.

I didn't modify anything to get it working in DSOrganize.  You simply need to set up the proper callbacks and call the proper functions.  The modifications he might be referring to were the three memory leaks posted to random forums across the internet that were brought to my attention.  It doesn't do anything to performance, just is better to know that it isn't leaking there anymore.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

Sorry for jumping on you like that. I'm not an "elite dev" either. I just find it a little irritating when people don't use the forum search function and Google first to try and dig up information.
<br/>
<br/>
There have been many prior questions about OGG and Tremor on the DS, so I just think a new topic is more likely to end up being a duplicate than anything else.
<br/>

Anyway, sorry for being bitchy :-)
