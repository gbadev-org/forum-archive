    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, well, i can divide the file in smaller files, but the thing is that if zlib can access those files... i will be very happy, and dont need to decompress the data, just gzseek it :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Many games use compressed archives and do not tend to extract the entire archive into memory while accessing one file within the archive.
<br/>
<br/>
As long as the file within the compressed archive you're accessing is not too large and the compression ratio method is not too intensive then accessing a single file on the fly and uncompressing it should not be a problem, as long as it's done correctly...
<br/>
<br/>
However, you will need to actually port zlib and test it...
<br/>
<br/>
It should be remembered, however, that computers have been accessing compressed data a lot longer than the DS has been around and that a lot of these computers were nowhere near as powerful as the DS. Hence I find the occasional "You can't do that on the DS posts" rather ridicolous, seeing as how it's been done on PCs and the like that were a lot less powerful...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">zlib works on DS without issue...however I have not tried direct integration with libfat. You may need to implement custom read/write functions, and not be able to use the pre-made easy methods (gzopen, gzread, etc)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A newer port would be nice since that version has two known security vulnerabilities.  I don't know how well it works with libfat.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
