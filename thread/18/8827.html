    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AS we all know, DS has two CPUs(one is ARM7 and the other is ARM9).Who can talk something about the communication?The follow is my way, but it doesn't work well?
<br/>
<br/>
I allocate two memories(256 bytes each) at 0x027ff000, one for ARM9 writing and the other for ARM7 writing. 
<br/>
First , when KEY_A is pressed, ARM9 change the record at 0x027ff000. 
<br/>
<br/>
ARM7 is waiting for VBlank_interrupt.When ARM7 enters  VBlank_interrupt, ARM7 check the record at 0x027ff000. If the record changes ,ARM7 change the record at 0x027ff100.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, when KEY_B is pressed, ARM9 read the record at 0x027ff100.
<br/>
<br/>
I press KEY_A and KEY_B,but the record at 0x027ff100 is always the same.Namely, ARM7 never change the record at 0x027ff100. Anything wrong with my program? Who can give some advice?
<br/>
Thanks a lot!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
