I have an important task to answer, so hope, you can help.
<br/>
<br/>
Suppose, a great company has the most modern official developing tools and perhaps the necessary engine for his games.
<br/>
If porting a great "GTA 3" or ?Assassins Creed" -like game from the iPhone to Nintendo DSi:
<br/>
<br/>
1-  How many members are needed?
<br/>
2-  And in what role?
<br/>
3-  How long will this project last?
<br/>
4-  What will be the most serious programming issues?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have more info on it.
<br/>
Thanx for any help or any suggestion where I should look it up. 
<br/>
Bye.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
