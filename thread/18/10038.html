You need a client to recieve from a server.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">some java basics for newcomers (this is REALLY basic, so don't shoot me):
<br/>
<br/>
java is a bytecode interpreted language, that's why you need the runtime environment... ;)
<br/>
<br/>
it has a virtual machine that is like a pc inside your pc that is able to use your hardware, but it's cpu is simulated within your pc. so java bytecode is like assembler for a processor.
<br/>
<br/>
every processor type has its own set of instructions (the assembler) and thus you won't be able to run code that a processor doesn't support.
<br/>
<br/>
now, you can program a client for nds, but not in java. you'll have to do it in c/c++ or assembler (for the arm family that's inside the nds). if there was a runtime for the nds some java programms could be written for it. but i doubt it will be kick ass fast. ;) (note: i like java and i have no problem with it's speed)
<br/>
<br/>
PS: i know of no server application that doesn't REQUIRE a client!!! this is nonesense!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as i said, i don't see it coming. as i remember there was a guy who tried to make a gba jvm, but i don't know how it worked out. i understand that there are some (or one) project that tries to implement a jvm, maybe even for nds. but i don't have any info on it and though i like java (i'm using it often) i'm not interested in running it on a nds. as i remember the gba jvm was likited to console stuff... and only basic programs. try to port your programmer mind to c++ for nds, it isn't that hard, as the syntax isn't too different (though the programming idiology and implementation techniques differ here and there).
<br/>
<br/>
i know that there are a lot of java classes, that aren't "natively" available in c++, but java uses some standards for communication, so it should be possible to communicate this the server via wifi. think of how to interface servelets ;) (not necessary how it should be done, but it shows a way of communication outside the java language).
