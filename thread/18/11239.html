    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On their fourm they tell how to compile apps for use with dslinux, now If I wanted to take a linux/windows program and put it on ths NDS what do I need to do.
<br/>
1) can I take any program that runs on normal linux/windows and compile it for use on DSlinux or normal hardware (supercard sd)?
<br/>
2) does it have to be source that I have written specificaly for the NDS
<br/>
3) How do you port somthing from linux/windows to the nintendo ds (like Command and conquer) I know someone is already doing it but I want to know for programming sake.
<br/>
<br/>
???  sorry for the bad spelling if any it is really late and my tv is very far away, cant see it that well!

3. Just No

First of all, you could only compile Linux programs for DSLinux, nothing written for Windows (unless it was something very simple). Second, the DS has limited RAM and a slow CPU. You can't just pick programs at random and cross-compile them, they would need to be programs that are designed for very low resource machines; or perhaps even better, embedded Linux devices. In addition, there is no GTK port for DSLinux as of yet, so that pretty much rules out anything with a GUI. So you are limited to low resource, terminal-only, applications.
<br/>
<br/>
To answer the second question; in theory, nothing should have to be modified to run on DSLinux, since it aims to be a fairly standard Linux system. The only exception I could think of would be software that doesn't compile properly on ARM versus x86. This is of course within reason. Some programs won't be able to work on the DS because of limitations in the current drivers. For instance, Kismet is console and low resource, so it meets the first requirement, but it would require more than the current WLAN drivers offer in terms of interfacing.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the third question, go back and read the first response.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the help. As for picking programs at random I'm not. Just wanted to get Ldraw(lego cad program) on my DS. Also would like to know how I get GUI on DSlinux with the new supercard SD version(the one with ram) so I can get some linux programs compiled to run on my NDS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Where do people get these ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
All supercards have 32MB of RAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that supercards come with ram they always have I was refering to the DSlinux build taht took advantage of the ram.
<br/>
Where do I get ahold of these programs 'nano' things?? I have searched googlea fewtimes in the past and come up short. Also when I get them do they come with an install guide.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
---Never mind I have found them,Now how do I get them Working??? In particular the server my DS says it cant find server. Also are there any decent VNC for the ds one that dont update every 3 seconds so I can do useful stuff from mycomputer on my DS, like the programs I want to run???</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hate to be a bore, but the DSLinux forums are dedicated to this stuff. It's not that people on GBADev don't use DSLinux, but rather that discussion over at the DSLinux site is kind of focused on this thing, so your questions might get quicker answers from there...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
