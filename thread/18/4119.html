    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was looking at the DS design, and I was thinking that you might be able to use the four buttons on the right side as direction buttons, allowing you to do double direction controls like Virtua-On.  Thing is, then you'd need shoulder buttons to use for firing weapons.
<br/>
<br/>
okay, so the question is - does the DS look like it's going to have shoulder buttons?
<br/>
<br/>
(sorry if this has already been answered - I couldn't find it in this forum when I looked. . .)

You could use the touchscreen for extra buttons...

I guess I just hadn't thought it through.  Anyway, I'm going to go back to fantasizing about my enhanced Virtua On game for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree about the touchscreen for extra buttons - use it to change weapons, or do streetfighter-style special moves.  hadn't thought about the microphone

Somehow I don't think I could manage to use the D-pad, buttons and touch screen all at the same time.  I may be being overly critical, but it seems I'd need three hands.

I was hoping for a third hand when my teeth fell out.  The tooth faery left quarters instead of a potion of the third hand.
