    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This was very odd. I was just turning on my DS one time, and I was trying out the alarm feature so that it could wake me up in the morning. I set the time, and I went to activate the alarm. Instead of going directly to displaying the current time and time remaining, another little window pops up asking me if I want to activate the "Rumble Pak" when the alarm goes off. This was odd because all I had in my DS was the Mario64DS game, and my EZFA GBA cart. I went to try the same sequence I had inputted before to activate the alarm, but I got no "Rumble Pak" request. I guess it somehow is capable of detecting it as the text was clear and obviously meant to be there, but finding it on a custom GBA flash cart with no "Rumble Pak"?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would assume that unless Nintendo releases its own DS-only rumble pack expansion, it would utilize rumble packs in GBA cartridges, such as the one in Wario Ware Inc 2: Twist and any new games with it in the future. I am actually surprised that Nintendo didn't add a rumble feature (and a motion sensor feature, for that matter) to the DS as part of the standard features.
