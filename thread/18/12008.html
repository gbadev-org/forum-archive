    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is the fat library the only way to read data from the slot-1?
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if my homebrew is 2Mb big(Arm9+7 binaries), but with 8Mb of various data attached in, is there a way to access theses 8Mb with a bios command or something like that to read the slot-1 rom?
<br/>
<br/>
Commerial games must use a system like that, using bios calls I think, but I wonder if there's a way to do the same thing with homebrews?
<br/>
<br/>
If it can be done, it could be used to implement an embedded filesystem (like GBFS) which could work either on slot-1 or slot-2 devices.

Thanks for the replies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Commercial games have a Nitro file system driver in (the executable part of) the .nds file, just as homebrew games have an MS-FAT compatible system driver in (the executable part of) the .nds file<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
