How do flashcarts work around this anyway ? Whats the 'flaw' in the DS design that gives us all this goodnees ?

Both methods require the DS to be flashed when transferring homebrew software to omit the RSA checks.

Ad-hoc networking between two DS's hasn't been done. Sgstair (author of the DS WiFi library) was unable to get it working, lacking proper documentation and processing power and it looks like nobody else has worked on it since.

most flashcarts DO support download play for commercial games - with just updates to firmware to make the fix. I've heard people say that this would never be possible, obviously only to be proven wrong by now.

the source for the firmware and OS on most flashcarts isn't open - but there is a new flashcart coming soon that boasts an open-source OS. isn't there some way to figure it out from there? I'm no programmer, so it's all speculation on my part.

All that means is that the warez tools don't mistakenly patch the client binaries (and thus don't break the signature) when patching the server. It doesn't mean that unsigned binaries such as homebrew will work through DS Download Play on a DS with stock firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As he put it himself - I do also still hope it opens the floodgates.

<br/>
The whole point of non-online wirelss play imo, is of course sharing and playing, your and other people's great work with people who do not have flashcarts [or flashed firmware for that matter] to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
@MightyMax - What are you on about ? Still think its just a few timing kinks in the wifi lib that need to be ironed out ? Feel like sharing those insights in more detail and/or code..
<br/>
<br/>
As with many things it would be really nifty to have a library for that. LibDS-Server
<br/>
..that's how the original Halo used to work. And it dynamically reassigned the server to the box with the best connection to all active players, mid gameplay mind you.

Well, for me the whole point would be no lag. But just because someone figures out how to do some sort of ad-hoc connection with two homebrew DS's, doesn't mean it will be one DS loads the program and then clicks "multiplayer" and the other just boots the normal screen and clicks download play. (Let alone sending it to an unflashed DS, oh why RSA, oh why...) More likely, I think, is a library totally built from scratch with raw frames.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Yes, just not between two DS, but the DS and the old wifime-card on my laptop (I still don't own a second flashed DS :p )
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have shared MACs (which you can do in several ways without breaking the 802.11 protocol, nor any other (802.3snap i.e.) you can simply send out dataframes to the destination MAC and you DS will happily receive them.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing to be done here is prefixing your data with a standard 802.11 header (Version 0, Type = 2, SubType = 0, toDS=0,fromDS=0). Resend that data until you receive an ACK. On the other side, recognize a received frame with ACK and process the data beyond the header. Done.

I'm not ready to release the code of the MessageQueue as it still needs some things fixed. But sgstairs build in functions should provide easy enough access to STA to STA data transfers.
<br/>
<br/>
Only when sending broadcasts i.e. to announce your MAC/ask for the MAC of the other station (so other STA or DS will try to read the data) you got to make sure that the data follows the 802.3snap, or you will probably end up with crashing an AP, as i did at the first.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Took a quick look at the DSWiFi library, and there's indeed ready functions for processing raw 802.11 packets. Hopefully you can get your MessageQueue into a release state somewhere in the future (or PM me if you're ok with sharing the current version privately for research purposes). I'll take a closer look on using raw frames with Sgstair's library, but with my limited network programming experience I have no idea what's the outcome of all this (especially knowing that even the author of the library didn't get this finished :)
