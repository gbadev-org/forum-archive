    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many of the memory-mapped addresses pertaining to 3D for the NDS have been wrapped together to operate, to some degree, in the same manner as OpenGL functions do, though the NDS doesn't have native support for OpenGL as you might think. Through these functions (or directly working with the memory-mapped addresses), you can take advantage of the 3D-accelerated hardware.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Along with devkitARM, devkitProUpdater installs libnds, which features an OpenGL-esque API for the 3D hardware. It comes with some demos showing how to use the 3D hardware, including ports of the NEHE tutorial demos so you can see what the differences are.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
