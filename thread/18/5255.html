Wouldn't a Metroid demo chip and a passthrough logic chip fit inside a standard DS cartridge size, on a suitable pcb?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You won't see ZSNES for Nintendo DS for the same reason you won't see ZSNES for Mac: ZSNES is written mostly in x86 assembly language. A Super NES emulator running inside an x86 emulator would be much slower than a recompiled Snes9x or (better yet) an emulator written from the ground up for the Nintendo DS, as PocketNES was for the GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Probably, with some design. But you would have a lot of troubly removing the Metroid Demo chip, it's a dye.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
