my old one would just turn off and the screen goes out. but on my new blue DS, the screen fades away like it did back on the gameboy color and advance. what does yours do? and why do only some DS's do this?
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone comfirm if the new DS acts differently or has new protection?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are lots of fades :)
<br/>
- Backlight fade (like the firmware patch does)
<br/>
- Fade to black (like what firmware does when it shuts down after asking for it)
<br/>
- crystal fade (like what happens if the system is powered off immediately or battery is removed)
<br/>
<br/>
Different brands of displays might result in different behavior when powering down. Layer thickness, density, transistor characteristics, driving circuitry.
<br/>
I doubt it's a firmware thing. Test if PassMe still works. If it doesn't... then it's a new version :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
