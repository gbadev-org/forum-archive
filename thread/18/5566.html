    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if it was possible to get clear pixelperfect screenshots or videos from a Nintendo DS...? Anyone ever tried?
<br/>
<br/>
I know there's this uber-expensive IS-NITRO-CAPTURE device from Intelligent Systems Co. Ltd., but when I asked for it, they said I should ask NOA. And *they* didn't reply. Oh wonder.
<br/>
<br/>
(The IS-NITRO-CAPTURE can output the video signals of Nintendo DS as a TV signal or a digital video stream via USB to a PC/Mac application.

I heard it's a blue box connected to the DS Cartridge slot. The box has a GBA and NDS slot itself.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">get a nice camera on a tripod, affix your DS so it can't move, and the DS screens are perfectly parallel to the camera's lense. take pictures/videos at a high resolution. then bring down the resolution so the width of the display is 256 pixels. That should get you pretty good quality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, I believe that the DS is permanently tethered to the main unit, and the cable connecting it actually replaces the cartridge slot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I've seen (pictures of) one, and it does look very fixed to the DS system.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
