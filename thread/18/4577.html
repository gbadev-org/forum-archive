<br/>
I'd like to give the drivers a try that were posted in <a class="postlink" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/infinityhq/dsdev/dsdev.html" target="_blank">this</a> post, but I don't feel like installing linux for this (too much software I need, and frankly: I like windows :p). However: does anyone know if it is possible to compile these madwifi drivers in cygwin in a way they become useful in windows? I'm still considering the purchase of a wi-fi card so I can't really find out myself, and I'm also quite noobish on this matter (right now I only use cygwin for ssh, I don't know much about what it is capable of)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
The answer is probably no since it's drivers related. Cygwin allows you to compile programs that make use of Linux signals without source code change.
<br/>
This means you'd need to have a win32 port of the kernel drivers to be able to compile the userland code against them. This is very unlikely because if you followed the wireless hacking thread, developers moved to Linux soft as they were no Win32 stuff available (and that the operations needs custom-made drivers)

I haven't played with colinux at all but am willing to bet that it see's all the NICs in the pc as one particular type instead of seeing the real NIC.  Like vmware always has AMD PCNET nics.  It's still just a virtual nic.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.  Nice try though.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually more excited about the wrt54g tunnelling work.  With that working, you could still load apps to the ds by having the standard wired nic send out the DS style packets.  I think that it's easier to make a normal NIC send out raw packets than wireless.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Solution 1: Obvious
<br/>
Backup your data, re-partition your disk
<br/>
<br/>
Solution 2:
<br/>
There is a program (found it a while ago, maybe 2 years) that will actually use your Windows partition, and install Linux into it as a multiboot, allowing you to leave your partition completely intact and entirely unchanged.  I wish I could tell you what it was called, but I can't remember.
<br/>
<br/>
Solution 3:
<br/>
Use Pratition Magic to resize the partition and install into the empty space.
<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, with options 1 and 3, Linux should set up multi-boot software to handle your existing Windows installation.  And (correct me if I'm wrong?) for those who have never tried this, you will want to install Windows first as it doesn't like working with Linux (XP may be different).

<br/>
Defrag your windows drive and use the partition resizer on the mandrake installation to have both linux and windows booting on one hard drive. Blame the hardware vendors, not linux for not allowing support (although that doesn't help you get it working). Or try using mac to lighten your mood, you sometimes can't even have support for your programs when you upgrade it from panther 10.111 to tiger 10.111+ =D
<br/>
<br/>
But it's when your modem driver isn't supported by the installation package and you need to get online to download a modem driver that installation is troublesome. Wouldn't it be nice if all modems had a set of commands that got it working at a basic level.

Sorry, I forget not everyone has a DVD burner, or access to all the HD space they need if it comes down to it.  I work in a computer store, so I get spoiled.
<br/>
<br/>
And seriously, I don't like recovery CD's.  I much prefer installing my windows FRESH, and updating the CD with a slipstreamed service pack to avoid d/loading updates.  There's nothing I hate on my computer more than trying to install newer drivers &amp; updates over top of the old (or even ancient in the case of a 3 year old recovery CD... then again, the computer would be too old to care...).
<br/>
<br/>
I just assumed you had a full copy of Windows.  I've met a lot of people through my job, and all of the hobbyists so far have thrown out their recovery CD's in favor of a full (or more recent) version.
<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, I'm try to keep my assumptions to a minimal, but I refuse to stop sharing my ideas!  (Until someone gets really mad at me 'cause my ideas are crap... which I hope they aren't)

In a word, yes. My main linux machine is a pretty decent Athlon XP, but I have a P2-600 that runs Fedora Core - wireless works fine - pretty much everything does.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the other points you've raised - well, the simple fact is that unless you're already a pretty knowledgeable Linux user, you shouldn't try to switch all at once - dual-booting is the way to go, and as you've already discovered with Parted, there are tools to help with that.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you're comfortable with the system, a distro like Gentoo, which keeps a fully up-to-date software library, is the way to go - distros like Fedora and Mandrake are somewhat at a disadvantage, as they can only add hardware support in their yearly or bi-yearly releases. Of course, you can make it work on your own; it just won't be included in the installer. I will say that it's been a long time since I've had any problems getting hardware to work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
