    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been looking at a few DS documents and trying to make sense of the sound hardware. But there's a few things I'm not understanding very well. Like for instance in the Channel Control Registers, what exactly are the data shift and hold bits used for? I'm guessing the data shift is probably in relation to volume, but could anyone explain them? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
