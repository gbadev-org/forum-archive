When you say "headphone jack", I'm going to assume you mean the small jack next to the headphone jack.  If that's what you're talking about, then any sound recording app will work as long as you have a DS headset - because that jack works the same as the regular microphone.  If you actually meant headphone jack, then see the above post.
<br/>
<br/>
I've thought about buying the DS headset so I could cut it up and try to attach a 1/4" input.  I think I could do it.  Then I could plug my guitar amp into my DS and rock the hell out.  I guess I would buy the cheaper headset (the $9.99 one) if I ever try it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're just looking for names of homebrew apps - DSOrganize records low quality, long length .wav files.  Nitrotracker records higher quality, shorter length .wav files (or so I'm told - haven't tried it myself).  The ram can only hold so much, so that's why there's a trade off.  On the other hand, if someone makes a recording app that fully uses slot 2 expansion ram - that would pwn.
<br/>
<br/>
With a 1/4" input and the right software, the DS could turn into a nice little recorder.  My minidisc recorder recently crapped out on me, and I'd love to transform my DS to replace it.  It'd be mono, but if you need stereo you could just carry two of them around with you (ok I'm kidding).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

one could stream from one DS to another via wifi, and could store a stereo file on the other DS :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im confused: a mic would only record mono? Is the circuitry for the line in recording not capable of stereo recording? Also, why is everyone grappling with using nintendo headset? Cant the line in just use a mic with a 1/4 inch preamped mic? my grado headphone jack fits, why would a recording device need to use something more than just the circle line in?
<br/>
<br/>
I got an email from the guy who wrote the Nitro* app. Seems to think there is a lot of potencial. I as well am interested in having he DS replace a minidisc type system. In-put recording via mic riiiiight to the SD media--not the ram.  More thoughts?

The connector has only 2 conductors on it: left signal and ground. There is no third conductor for right signal.

Because only Nintendo makes that plug. The 1/8 inch jack next to it is an output, not an input.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
