It is Python 2.4, I've detailed it here:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.disinterest.org/NDS/Python24.html" target="_blank">http://www.disinterest.org/NDS/Python24.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This library works fine on all other platforms I have compiled it on.  And it is in use by hundreds of thousands of people :)  I should add, that I am at my wits end with it.  It took like 2 hours to cross compile it and get it working on Dualis (from no DS development knowledge), and I have subsequently spent 2 additional days trying to get it to compile with different options, or different versions of the library, with no luck.  The same random corruption happens.
<br/>
<br/>
What I would really like to hear is something like:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li> Oh, that's because you need to compile with this option!
<br/>
</li><li> I ported something to the DS, and these types of pieces of code need to be rewritten because they just don't work reliably that way.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Or similar things which explain why what is happening, is happening.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good Luck on this port , biggest problem I see is the library loading and storage of them since there is no standard filesystem yet finished.

Well, it is not like there aren't applications out there (with source)  which get by, so perhaps it isn't an obstacle at all, even if it means more work in the short term because there is no standard method.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was running the devkitarm generated python24.nds on the Supercard, and because it was actually running (albeit badly) and because Supercard only runs .nds as NDS roms, I didn't question whether I should be running the .ds.gba instead.  Renaming the .ds.gba to .nds and using that gives me something that runs perfectly.  Too bad I wasted days on the erroneous raw .nds, when such a quick and simple fix was the right thing to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Python 2.4 works, now I just need to tack on some module loading as Troy mentions. As it stands, there is little you can do with it, besides using it as some kind of awkward command line calculator :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
