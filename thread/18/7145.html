<br/>
It's pretty simple (we only need .txt format supported) and really useful (don't have to turn on the PC when playing some game and get stuck).

You'd have to turn off the game you're playing and turn on the walkthrough viewer. Or were you thinking of integrating this into versions of PocketNES and Goomba for Nintendo DS? In addition, you'd have to tell your router to dial the Internet, at which point you might as well just leave your PC on 24/7 like I do.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's funny, it seems like DS dev is in a perpetual state of "ready to explode" with all these rises and falls in great releases and interesting ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
personally, i just think it'd be really cool to have a "send" button next to "load" in the multiboot loader.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's a good idea.  Ya if someone had a web browser made, we wouldn't need this.  But I was thinking it would be great if I'm playing my xbox,ps2, or cube in the living room that it would be great if I could just look up an faq on the ds.  Not so much for the ds games themselves.  And since my computer is upstairs and my living room is downstairs, this would be very useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A web browser is possible, they have been talking about having a zoomed out region on the top for example, and a scrolling "magnifying" glass type view on the bottom screen to read text, look at pictures etc.  You could easily press a button to bring up the touch keyboard.  It's possible, just tough, and nothing has been released so far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it's the walkthrough you want, instead of taking up more memory and getting complicated with WiFi and browsers, just save the txt file and put it on your flash cart (assuming you have a text viewer). Hell, if you want it while playing games (DS games probably impossible since they're using both screens) but for the NES or SNES emulator, I'm sure someone could stick a text viewer on the bottom screen as part of the emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
