    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm writing a DS app (it's nearly ready for initial release) which is designed to be power-friendly since it could be left on in an idle state for quite a while. At some times I need to power on/off hardware depending on the application state. I'm using the latest devKitARM/libnds With this in mind, I have a few questions:
<br/>
<br/>
* Will it make any difference if I power off things that are already off, without checking? Specifically, does anyone know if this will consume any additional power, or should I really be keeping track of state? What about powering on?
<br/>
<br/>
* Is there anything I should know about (that I  might not expect) powered up by default? I haven't checked the docs for this yet, so you'll have to forgive me if it's in there.
<br/>
<br/>
* Will Maxmod throw a fit if I power off the audio hardware while its paused? I kind of assume it's not even going to notice, but I figure I'd ask. (I don't have a need to do this, but it would be nice to know.)
<br/>
<br/>
* Not sure if this is really power management, but I didn't see anything about setting the screen brightness in libnds. Is there any way to do this without a custom arm7?
<br/>
<br/>
* Comment: I didn't see any libnds functions for checking power states. I haven't really looked into this is done at the system level though.
