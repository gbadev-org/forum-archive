    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why not creating a homebrew that read ebooks for the ds ?
<br/>
That would be fun to use the DS as a book so we could use it like an open book, touch screen for the left page and the other for the right page, to turn the pages we just would have to close and open the DS like we would with a real book, or using L and R buttons... I don't have the knowledge to do it but I hope someone will. Anyone of you will ever create it ?

True indeed, but on the ds the pages will be smaller (in portrait) or you have to use small fonts, which is a pain if you want to read long txt's. Actually, that's all a madder of opinion. They should make a version where the reader can choose his own format (portrait or landscape) :).

uses scaling and such to allow you to choose which direction the text sits in and resize it, unfortunately the author lost his code in an HDD crash and never restarted..  it would be nice to see similar functionality on a bookreader for DS, as well as save support/multibook support... 
<br/>
<br/>
my thoughts: use the touchscreen for navi/menus and reg. screen for ebook, and be able to switch off to "book mode" so the nds is like a book as the above pics suggested.... and if possible timeout the touchscreen light when in single screen book mode to conserve power, if it is at all possible to kill one screens light at a time without going into gba mode...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For a 'quick hack' I like it, dont much care for that font though, very non white on my DS which makes it tough to read, wouldnt want to go much smaller than crowe ebook reader's small font though... not sure whats going on when I press the B/A buttons, kinda funky stuff if ya ask me.

Subpixel rendering wouldn't be quite as useful in landscape mode, since most characters are taller than they are wide, and the BGR subpixels stack side by side when viewing the LCD in "normal" orientation.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't know if that made much sense. :P  
<br/>
<br/>
Point being that portrait mode viewing would take better advantage of your subpixels. Though with a wider-character font like Japanese or the like, it probably would be about the same either way.

<br/>
look at buildROM.sh to see how to include it. basically, I add the <b style="color:#FFA34F">ebook</b> to the arm9.bin, with the bytes "BOOKTEXT" at the beginning and end of the <b style="color:#FFA34F">ebook</b> so i can find them again later. then i make a .nds from the arm9 bin using ndstool.

For tile based, wouldn't the font need to be 8x8, or some multiple of that, as tiles are 8x8?

<br/>
<br/>
Planning to add in sram position saving next, trying to work out how to change the font and bg color along with the text color inversion while in the frame buffer mode (no luck so far on figuring out these framebuffer mode changes I'd like to do though, any direction on it would be appreciated). 
<br/>
<br/>
Considering moving on to sprites for more advanced ability to rotate/scale etc, but I will need to learn about sprites and 2d first (long road that way with little info on DS sprites that makes sense to a console.h type programmer like me, who knows though, maybe doublec has a tutorial on the way and will show me its simpler than I thought)

Currently the scroll up/down is too fast, so I had to implement some pauses (which really slows it down on the emulators) to delay key repeats and such, but on hardware it is working as I intended.

I'm also working on an cmdline exe that will take a txt file as input and just make the ebook in nds and nds.gba formats... just not tonite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just to chip in -- I've been working on an e-book reader. It doesn't use subpixel fonts, but it uses anti-aliased variable-width selectable fonts. It's also in portrait format, i.e. you hold the DS on end.
<br/>
<br/>
Expect a preprint edition sometime next week.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">An on-end ebook reader would be much better in my opinion. preferably with some sore of support for images, grayscale gifs or something.as for sup-pixel fonts, why bother?

<br/>
Exactly. The subpixel font rendering I've seen so far on the DS is great for when you need lots of text at the expense of readability. But it's not what I'd want in an ebook, where readability is priority number one.
<br/>
<br/>
Subpixel <span style="font-style: italic">antialiasing</span> is another matter; that can really improve font rendering, but it also costs a lot of time (or memory). Regular grayscale-based antialiasing is almost as good and much faster, because fonts can be pre-rendered.

<br/>
<br/>
My current solution uses pre-rendered AA fonts (5-15KB per font) and draws to frame buffer / background bitmaps. It takes about 0.3s for two pages of text. Faster isn't necessary, IMHO, unless you're reading at the rate of 6 pages per second or the book is a flipbook. :-)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd try to just keep it simple. Left and right on the D-pad go through pages, maybe up and down go back/forward one line or through bookmarks or chapters. A, B, X, Y, R, Start and Select are left for whatever purpose you want, eg changing font sizes, setting/clearing bookmarks, closing the file and choosing another, etc. (L would probably be hit fairly often by accident so best leave it unused.) This assumes you're holding it such that the top screen is on the left.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's currently just a quick "throwtogheter", I haven't yet implented power management, screen brightness control nor bookmarks.
<br/>
And I have a wierd bug which skips some chars between the first and the second page in the book. The other pages seem to be just fine tough.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://manifested.ath.cx" target="_blank">http://manifested.ath.cx</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
