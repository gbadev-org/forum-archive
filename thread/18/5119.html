    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was wondering whether or not i should buy a gba flash card (most likey x-rom 512 mb) because i thought some or maybe even most ds games wont fit on it once a commercialized passthrough is made
<br/>
<br/>
so what size are the games that are out so far?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The Tetris clone is well under 8 Mbits. You can expect a lot of games to be smaller than 32 Mbits, given that 32 Mbits is the size of the Nintendo DS's RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">As for commercial games:</span>
<br/>
If you buy a GBA flash cart now, buy it for GBA games. There's no guarantee that commercial Nintendo DS games will ever be able to run on the passthrough.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Although there are some larger GBA flash cards around, some use tricks to be that large and I can't imagine them bieng of any use either.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

256Mbit is directly adressable.

Anything above that requires bank switching. It should not be a problem as long as the bank switching registers are known.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">for playing commercial games, it WONT work.  it has nothing to do with filesize, but it has to deal with memory addressing.  the DS games are specifically trying to read data from the DS cart slot, and without the proper data/code there, the game will fail.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-
