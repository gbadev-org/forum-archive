    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i was very busy with making a code for the nintendo ds, that use both screens as one big screen. 
<br/>
So im done now... i hope.
<br/>
<br/>
But it works on the last dualis version, but my question is does it works on a real Nintendo DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I got a Nintendo DS, but not a passme and not a good wireless lan card.
<br/>
<br/>
So can somebody test my code to see if it works on hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
this is the emu version :

<br/>
<br/>
And this is the passme version:

<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for all people who would help me!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
take me 2 days and nights to make it and still doesn't works.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for your help.
<br/>
<br/>
Now i must try another way to use a ball on two screens at once.
<br/>
So it can bounce.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you also tell me if the homebrew game pongDS, wich has also 2 screen with a ball works on hardware?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check and make sure you're setting display mode to graphics in display control. That was what I forgot when I first got my passme and had things working on dualis but white screens on hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
