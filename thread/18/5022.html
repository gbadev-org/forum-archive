    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm an EE student, but have only had a few digital / microprocessors classes.  I've heard about PLDs, CPLDs, and FPGAs but have never used them.  Just to clarify,
<br/>
<br/>
Every pass-through design now requires the use of a CPLD or FPGA?
<br/>
<br/>
Which CPLD does natrium42's design use?
<br/>
<br/>
And finally, the point of these pass-throughs is to redirect execution through the GBA port right?  This allows people to run code in "DS Mode."  This has nothing to do with dumping games?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't care if I get flamed, but I'd like to know the answer so I can sort this out in my brain / educate my friends.  Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently the known pass-throughs are using CPLD or FPGA setups.
<br/>
<br/>
Natrium42 uses the Spartan-3 FPGA dev kit at the moment. He is creating a pass-through (PassMe) which will be very inexpensive in case you want to make your own without buying a dev kit. The details are on his <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/blogs/natrium42/" target="_blank">website</a> including the part list, schematic, and PCB diagrams.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe you can dump the roms using this setup.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, thanks for your quick reply!  
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering though, in his parts list I see the "XC9572XL (CPLD)"  Can these be ordered with the appropriate codes already flashed, or would we need further hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, it is a standard CPLD.  But, you only need a modified parallel cable (one resistor) to program the CPLD.  On Natrium42's PCB layout there is a header that you would tempararily connect the cable to while programming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Isn't Natrium himself doing that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, no, Natrium is <span style="font-style: italic">designing</span> a PCB layout that can then be printed cheaply. I'm sure that you would need a bit more than just PassMe to have a functioning setup, perhaps just some cables and connectors that need to be soldered on. No-one has yet come forward to assemble and sell complete units based on PassMe. The design hasn't even been built and verified yet! But I have faith. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've talked to Natrium about it.  If someone else doesn't do it on a large scale.. And, legally, it's not an issue, I will personally be building them.  I'm hoping to have both a kit (all the pieces, PCB, instructions) and a built one.  The main question is how to get a socket for the DS carts?  Current design require you to solder your DS cart to the passthrough.   My brother is an awesome programmer, but there is NO CHANCE he could build one of these.  Even with Natrium's excellent PCB.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a few of us have ordered the PCB, it takes up to 14 days to make/receive (not really sure) and due to Chinese new year, the company will be shut down from the 8th to the 14th.  Since I haven't received a ship notice, I'm assuming they didn't get to it before the shutdown.  So, I ordered it on the 4th.  We just have to wait.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of a DS compatible cart port that is commercially available?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered all the parts for it and need to order a PCB. I might just try sparkfun because barebonespcb.com won't work for me. Since I have a PACE SMT rework station, soldering will be a breeze. He chose really small resistors and caps, I think 0603, but with a good pair of tweezers it should be easy. Also another challenge is the card connector, but yoiu can build one like natrium did.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I only do minor hardware mods, but it seems like a simple solution. Why not just build the top of the card like this
<br/>
<br/>
____||||||||
<br/>
<br/>
There you go pins are on the top and out of the way of the slot, and you still have a ledge to push the card into the DS. the downside is that you have pins sticking out of the top of your DS, which can be easily dammaged.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
