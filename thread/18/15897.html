    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heya everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in need of a Circuit plan for the DS Lite/DS (I assume they should kinda be the same ?).
<br/>
<br/>
I kinda searched everywhere but sadly wasn't able to find one.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore I ask you guys if someone could be kind enough to lead me in the right direction.
<br/>
<br/>
Thx in advance:
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is very proprietary information, it is very very unlikely Nintendo would ever release it. In addition, it would be very difficult to recreate this schematic manually, it would involve using special equipment to X-ray the DS PCB.
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you want this information? Maybe we can help solve your problem in a different way</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, my father bought himself a DSlite and inserted a LCD screen to repair the (aside from the one display that had to be replaced) DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if you guys can help me with this, but it's nice to have an answer.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't need a schematic to repair the screen in a DS Lite or a DS Phat. However the screens are not compatible...if your top screen on your DS Phat is broken, you need a replacement DS Phat Top Screen. There are basically 4 types of DS LCD's - Phat Top &amp; Bottom, Lite Top &amp; Bottom, they are all different.
<br/>
<br/>
Replacing the screen is technically easy, it just involves a lot of manual work. Taking out lots of screws, carefully disconnecting ribbon cables, taking apart the plastic housings, etc.  I recently completely disassembled my DS Phat and then put it back together, it's very modular, many different parts could be separately replaced.
<br/>
<br/>
You can buy replacement LCD's on DealExtreme for very cheap, but I can't vouch for the quality, check the reviews on the items to be sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, sorry, I forgot to explain the second part: he bought a replacement, which triggered a short circuit..., since it was faulty.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">short circuit most of the time just causes the fuse to blow, and doesn't cause other damage. search google for replacing the fuse on a DS, there should be some guides out there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
