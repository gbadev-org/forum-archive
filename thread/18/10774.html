    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone explain in detail how to add more ROM's to StellaDS?
<br/>
I have the ROM's and I have devkitPRO installed. I have read that I need to "put the ROM's in the data directory and recompile."  My difficulty is finding the data directory. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well I should say that is my first problem. There might be more later.

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ugh. That's old. Now what you want to do is put the additional public domain roms in the actual /stellads/ directory of your cartridge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
