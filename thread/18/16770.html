    <h4>#169488 - darkchen - Fri Jul 17, 2009 5:19 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi~ I?m back. I want to continue the topic of GBA emulator for iplayer. Unfortunately, iplayer official refused to give me SDK, for considering copyright problems. But finally I have obtained SDK in other way what I?d like to keep secret. I beg you guys forgiveness. 
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, let?s back to the topic. Now, I? m analyzing the content of SDK. If you have read my previous post, you would have understand my idea, although you might not agree wity me, thinking it is impossible to emulate GBA by iplayer(my poor English ability may be a problem, I can not express everything perfectly). I consider It?s hard to write program all by myself. Fortunately I?m familiar with VBA (visual boy advanced), the PC platform GBA emulator, so first, I?m trying to migrate VBA form PC to iplayer. If it succeeded, it would suppose to be the best way. Before migration, I?d like to compare the parameter between GBA and iplayer.
<br/>
<br/>
Video interface port: GBA screen resolution: 240 X 160. 32,768 colors simultaneously displayable, Special effects features (rotation/scaling, a blending, fade-in/fade-out, and mosaic), 4 image system modes 
<br/>
<br/>
(I insist on iplayer has the ability to deal with it, because of high resolution video playing)
<br/>
<br/>
Audio interface port: 4 sounds (corresponding to CGB sounds) + 2 CPU direct sounds (PCM format)
<br/>
<br/>
(Due to iplayer audio formats MP3, WMA, FLAC, APE, and the maximum bit rate supporting, I think there is no problem)
<br/>
<br/>
According to the comparison, we should know the hardware interface meet the requirement, and DS buttons number is more than enough. First, I need to migrate video interface port, so that I could migrate PC keyboard control to DS D-pad control. Second, it would be the audio interface port migration. I?m going to put my hand to the migration work in the future days, and because of my job, I have little time to be utilized, such as weekend and the nights after off-duty. If I made any progress, I would tell you. Wish it would be smooth going.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">GBA emulator for iplayer progress updated</span>
<br/>
<br/>
More than one week has passed since I have got SDK, and I?was down to the GBA emulator development (in fact it calls migration of VBA) in this period.It almost took all my spare time. Now, I have made some progress what I?d like to share with you, that the video interface port migration has already completed. Depends on the effect of the games which I have tested, I think it is considered as success. Super Mario Advance and Super Robot War J is two of the games I have tested, which its photos is below, and the FPS is not bad, but I?m not sure that if I migrated audio interface port, it would still have a not too bad FPS.
<br/>
<br/>
Next step I will try to migrate audio interface port, and I wish everything will be OK. If I have any further progress, I will update this post. I will also update my blog: <a href="http://darkchen.blog.com" target="_blank">http://darkchen.blog.com</a>

FYI, the DSi doesn't have a GBA slot! Looks to still have the CPU hardware for it. Just not the slot.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone with a DSi and flashcart been able to use DSSision (or similer app that can boot the DS GBA mode) to boot GBA mode? I wonder if GBA mode still exists on the DSi.<br/>_________________<br/>Sig under construction...Please check back after the sun explodes....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So, what is the theory of operation for this GBA emulator?  FPGA on iplayer runs GBA emulator, squirts video data down SPI bus?  I don't think you quite understand what's involved.

Take gpSP, port it to iPlayer using illegitimately obtained SDK, throw in fancy GUI and intro screen, et voila.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone still confused at this point might not understand that the iPlayer has an SoC in it, probably a TMS320DM35x, which has an ARM9 and can go up to 270MHz. It also has a 4MB flash chip and a 32MB 16bit SDRAM chip, and what could be an FPGA of some sort - the latter possibly providing glue logic to convert an external memory interface to something that can drive the gamecard bus.
<br/>
<br/>
For what you get and what they're selling it for it's actually a pretty interesting purchase.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems noone is too sure what chips are inside the iPlayer.  I'll crack mine open tonight and take some pics, hopefully it'll have more than TMS320 printed on the chip.
<br/>
<br/>
And from what I've read, it is definitely gbSP, I saw a post from the author of gbSP saying that this has the same bugs.  The fact that gbSP is GPL does muddy the waters somewhat.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I have a little theory about the SDK:
<br/>
<br/>
[tinfoilhat]
<br/>
<br/>
It seems a little too convenient that in the space of one week darkchen managed to figure out the SDK <span style="font-style: italic">and </span>get something running without any assistance from the manufacturers.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's more likely that iPlayer helped 'unofficially' after darkchen explained that they could have the only DSi capable GBA cart on the market.  
<br/>
<br/>
The reason iPlayer did not 'officially' help darkchen is probably due to licensing restrictions on the SDK/hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
[/tinfoilhat]
<br/>
<br/>
So, am I right in thinking that the large majority of the work is done on the iPlayer cpu (whatever it is) and all the DS is doing is showing video and passing back button presses to the iPlayer?  This seems logical, as it is what the card was built to do in the first place.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">

From the pictures posted <a class="postlink" href="http://www.metagames-eu.com/content/view/2313/33/" target="_blank">here</a> you can clearly see TMS320DM, which is a line of TI DSPs. You can also clearly see that the second number is a 5 and the letters are "AZWG." The site went on to misidentify the chip as "TMS320DM6541", considering this equivalent to TMS320DM6441 (that number being a 4 IS significant, since that chip has a C64x DSP). If you look closely you can see that the first number looks more like a 3 or an 8 than a 6, although to be an 8 the typeface would have to have the top circle be smaller than the bottom one, which seems uncommon.

You're not the only one to think that darkchen is working with the iPlayer people, but who knows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know what this chip is, but TI does not make a TMS320DM6541. They don't make a C65x line of DSPs either. I also find it very hard to imagine that TI is making a custom chip for a Chinese DS flash card. The TMS320DM6441 line of chips cost at least $33, nearly the cost of the whole iPlayer. Also, the chips look like this: <a href="http://media.digikey.com/photos/Texas%20Instr%20Photos/TMS320DM6441ZWT.JPG" target="_blank">http://media.digikey.com/photos/Texas%20Instr%20Photos/TMS320DM6441ZWT.JPG</a> So I think we can rule those out.
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the chip's surface was ground off - I wonder why they would do that when the others didn't have that treatment? Maybe the label we're seeing now was added on top of the original one. This could be a chip that isn't even made by TI but is being rebranded by something that sounds close to something that is, possibly in order to deceive people.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm doubtful that it'd deliver similar functionality for a much lower price, it'd probably be something totally different. Gives me reason to go back to MIPS, which a lot of Chinese chips are these days. If it's not a TI chip then they'd definitely like for people to think that it is, there's nothing genuine about such a practice. Unfortunately it wouldn't surprise me because this sort of thing happens a lot in China.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Really?  I heard it wasn't.  The coder of WabbitDS, the TI-83 emu, said it wasn't possible iirc.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Just checked and I was wrong.  He just stated he never tried emulating other calcs so it would take him some time if he tried.

Time to start a reform to get a TI-92 emu!  WabbitDS looks so professional.  I would love to see it support other calcs.  Maybe we can get Jim to work on one!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
