<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">*Note that when I say standard I don't mean exactly standard like for example CD discs are</span> :D
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Nintendo had a choice to use any other link method. I believe they used this same because it's also in use and it will prevent them being sued. You know in the states ppl use to sue each other and innocent companys without the real reason. There have been also ppl who have tried to dry their cat's in the microwave oven without success. :D

I seem to have said thigs a bit unclear. What I meant was that those company's used the same wifi because it already exist. I think they are not making any co-operation, but rather it seems that they have been forced to use that 802.11b. On the other hand the can just do it because they wanted to cover their ass using that "familiar" wi-fi. Many ppl don't think it's familiar, so that's the reason why I mentioned those other stuff using the same wifi. I didn't mean that <span style="text-decoration: underline">only</span> Sony uses it, there are others too!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still don't get your point. They were not forced in any way to use that standard.
<br/>
But why should they take any other standard if there is already one that works well. Especially if they plan online gaming to be a feature of the DS, it has to work with your local LAN to use your DSL (or whatever) connection. And that way you only have to buy an access point and no special hardware. Your also able to play at every place where you have access to a wireless network.
