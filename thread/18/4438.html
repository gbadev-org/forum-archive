    <h4>#29564 - ScottLininger - Mon Nov 22, 2004 12:12 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey kids,
<br/>
<br/>
Got my DS this afternoon. Whoohoo! Here are my observations about the differences between it and the SP, so far:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1. Top screen subpixels are RGB not BGR</span>
<br/>
<br/>
This is weird. The subpixels on the SP LCD are GBR (green,blue,red). The touch screen on the DS is still GBR, but the TOP screen is RGB. 
<br/>
<br/>
This really doesn't affect much unless you're playing with subpixel rendered fonts or a high-colordepth engine that takes advantage of subpixels (which I've never seen in any current GB game, but has potential with the DS's faster processor.) If you're a DS developer and want to use subpixels, you'll have an extra layer of processing to use the same assets on both screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thingker.com/gba/subpixeltest.gba" target="_blank">small demo</a> you can run to see what I mean. The displayed text that is MUCH clearer on hardware when the subpixel order matches.
<br/>
<br/>
Swap the screen that the demo is running in and you'll see a marked difference...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2. The Gamma levels are way brighter on the DS</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Load up the same screen on both your SP and your DS. The DS is a lot brighter and more vibrant, which is GREAT from a player's perspective. From a developer's perspective, it means that giving the player the option to change their brightness is even more important. 
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, someone will discover a way to detect at runtime if you're on the DS so you can adjust the gamma automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">3. The DS is easier to hold</span>
<br/>
<br/>
There have always been complaints from adults about the size of the SP, especially for games that make use of the shoulder buttons. The DS is much more comfortable to hold, in my opinion. (Though the tiny stylus still makes for cramped fingers... Hopefully someone will release a larger stylus for larger hands. Until then, I think I'll tape mine to a chopstick ;)
<br/>

THANK GOD!!! My GBA isn't the SP, but playing Metroid Fusion, in particular, was an excruciatingly painful ordeal. And I mean painful as in literally, not just from all of the "Here's what you do next..." stuff ;).  I've entirely stopped using my GBA for anything but flash carts, in favor of the GBA Player.   In part because of the bigger screen, but also because it doesn't hurt my hands (as much).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seems there is. The GBA mode DS BIOS differs by one bit at the end. We can use this to detect the system and adjust automatically! Happy days!

Of course, an emulator with the original bios loaded will return the correct value for a GBA, but an emulator which is simulating the functions in C probably does not emulate this func at all, and either crashes or returns something invalid.
<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me if the inline asm is dodgy, I never use GCC's stupid mechanism, its much easier to just stuff it in a .s file.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, values were obtained from a real DS and a real GBA (original jpn model, but the SP bios is the same).  The bit that is different (1 instead of 0), is at 0x3F0C, and is completly unused during any normal boot process, it is specifically and only there to be detected by a bios dump or get checksum call.[/code]<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

So I guess this means that, if you want a more true-to-life GBA experience on the DS, you should use the bottom screen.  And the added bonus of combining these two efforts would be, I guess, detecting the DS, and asking the user which screen they're using so the programmer can switch the color order to clean up the graphics if need be!  ... I need a girlfriend or a life, it's sad when I get excited over things like this...  Anyways--

I noticed something else.  I loaded up the BGR/RGB demo on my GBA, yanked out the card (I know, probably not the smartest thing but I don't have 2 flash cards) and loaded it up on the DS to compare them.  When I looked really closely, it seems that the DS is a little cripser all around, so it's no surprise that the BGR looked crisper on the DS than the GBA, but for some reason, the RGB on the DS looked a little less readable, a little more blurry if you will.

I think this is because of improved gamma on the DS. Essentially, blacks are more black and whites are more white, so the overall contrast is much better on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, the physical pixels on the DS are *slightly* smaller. 240 pixels on the DS measure about 10mm smaller than on the SP... And anytime the pixels are smaller, the display will be more crisp.
<br/>
<br/>
So no, you're not seeing things. :)
