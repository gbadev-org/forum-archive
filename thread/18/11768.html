<br/>
<br/>
I have disassembled the Nintendo DS to have a closer look at the hardware. Under the DS cart slot, there is a large square chip that says "CPU NTR" and "ARM", I assume that is the main ARM9 processor. 
<br/>
<br/>
So there is the other ARM7 co-processor located? I have seen a tiny little chip in the lower right corner, but doesn't say ARM, but "MITSUMI". 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>

EDIT: Nevermind, I found the answer. They are on the same chip.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
