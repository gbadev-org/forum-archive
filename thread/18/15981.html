    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You probably already know this, but...
<br/>
<br/>
Have you noticed <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm</a> has just disappeared? 
<br/>
<br/>
EEEEEEEK!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the root site has still a page, but all links have been 404'ed... even the images are no longer there!
<br/>
<br/>
Normally, you would just say "meh, don't be alarmist, Martin's site is probably down &amp; will go up in a few days"... but seeing as he's been no longer within anyone's reach in quite a long time, well, I *am* worried.
<br/>
<br/>
GBATEK is currently the most comprehensive source of information for us GBA &amp; DS homebrew developers, and frankly, losing that source would strike a major blow to this community... it's just too important to be left out.
<br/>
<br/>
So, people, please, all of you who can, go to google.com, search for "gbatek", grab one of the many mirrors of the document, and mirror it yourself. Please!
<br/>
<br/>
I just placed a copy of it on my site, at <a href="http://dsotaku.drunkencoders.com/gbatek/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">http://dsotaku.drunkencoders.com/gbatek/gbatek.htm</a> . But please, create as many copies of this document (or any other copies you can find on the web) as it is possible, and publish it on your sites ASAP. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you could drop a line in this topic telling us where your mirror is, well, that would be very appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Kraln has agreed to host a mirror of the document, at:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.kraln.com/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">http://www.kraln.com/gbatek.htm</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's do this, at least, until we finally find out what has been of Martin &amp; his whereabouts, k?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!

Is <a class="postlink" href="http://nintendods.desperate-programmers.com/doku.php?id=start" target="_blank">this wiki</a> the one simon's talking about? Not sure why it hasn't caught on. (I probably would have chosen something more comfortable/pretty, IMHO, such as MediaWiki; but there are tons out there, so I won't pretend to know what's what. I'm just big on formatting/navigation/aesthetics.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone, I'm the administrator of emubase, the society that is responsible for hosting nocash (aside from many other sites on this topic). I'll say some words about the situation of nocash and the site. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is true, that Martin has vanished for some time now. I can confirm that his last change to the webspace was made on the 23rd of January this year and I've seen no traces from him on the net. Several people requested that I visit him personally to confirm his current status (not an impossible request since we live in the same city), but I'm a bit reluctant to do so, since he has taken long "pauses" before and maybe needs the time without the sometimes-not-so-nice internet annoying him (if you have read his email section you know what I mean). His current absence is noted much more than the ones before mainly because of no$gba being one of the (if not THE ONE) prime NDS emus out there (not even taking the debugger into equatation, which is unmatched imho). 
<br/>
<br/>
If the site is down, like this time, don't worry too much, mostly it's because our hosting provider got some problems (in this case the whole provider was down, because an external technician manipulated the central backup power unit unplanned).
<br/>
<br/>
If Martin were ever to delete his whole site, I would place a notice on nocash.emubase.de which explains the situation. If he would give his agreement, we (the emubase society) will keep up his whole site as an archive as long as we provide our hosting service (which I hope will be forever or at least for a long, long time), even he "shuts down" his services.
<br/>
<br/>
In the case you got any futher questions regarding this issue you can find me on #emulation@irc.euirc.net with this nick.
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings
<br/>
