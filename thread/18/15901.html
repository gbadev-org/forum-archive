    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why does devkitARM place DTCM at 0B000000?  There's a bug in NO$GBA that makes all data stored there appear as FF's.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you use a modified linkscript and crt0 to move ITCM and DTCM, NO$GBA is able to view them fine.
<br/>
For example, I moved DTCM to 0x02800000, and ITCM to 0x01FF8000.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Generally speaking, it's everywhere.
<br/>
According to multiple sources, people in Japan already start to prepare / wait (not in line, <span style="font-style: italic">yet</span>, but by not buying a new NDS) for a new device, making sales drop a little. That's common with new hardware coming "soon."
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo is expected to release some info regarding the NDS' or GBA's successor (according to Nintendo, the NDS, although being what I call a GB advance advance ;^D, is explicitly NOT the official successor to the GBA) in 2009.
<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is vague and I wouldn't count on it, but you know... console cycles are scheduled for five years.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I expect the NDS to make it longer than just five years, though.
<br/>

EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
One example is over <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mcvuk.com/news/31397/New-DS-predicted-for-Christmas" target="_blank">here</a>. But it's about a new NDS <span style="font-style: italic">version</span>.
<br/>
