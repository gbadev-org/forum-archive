    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am transferring my GBA-game to NDS.
<br/>
My program works on the real hardware (transferred via WMB), but the only emulator that works with my game is DualiS. 
<br/>
And even DualiS doesn't work right - when I reload a new build, without closing the emu first, I get unpredictable results (e.g. wrong data in OAM, unexplainable behavior of prgram etc.)
<br/>
I came to the conclusion, that DualiS has problems with reloading a changed file from the same location ?!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using mode 0 graphics, 3 text-backgrounds, sprites, everything in 16 COLOR-mode.
<br/>
Maybe that is causing the problems with DualiS (I use v.1.4 btw.)
<br/>
<br/>
The other 2 emus (ideas, dsemu) crash shortly after running the ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
What is causing my problems ? Can anybody explain ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
