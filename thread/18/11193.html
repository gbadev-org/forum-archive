    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright.. I've been looking into homebrew for some time now..

And I was wondering, what kind of coding should I learn, if I want to get into it myself?
<br/>

Also, would it be easy to make something to view pictures on?
<br/>
<br/>
Something like the Opera Browser..
<br/>
<br/>
You have the full view on the touch screen..
<br/>
And a magnified view on the top screen, of the area you have selected with the stylus.

C or C++ are the most supported. If you're adventurous, you can also use ARM ASM, Python, Lua, or Forth. Though I wouldn't recommend it, as they are much used, and it will be harder to get help.

Yes, you could make a picture viewer.

Making a graphical web browser would be very difficult

But if you just want a picture viewer, which views a single picture at a time, that's a good project for a beginner.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you don't already know C well, I'd suggest learning C on your computer using GCC and the Allegro library before you branch out to the GBA and Nintendo DS.

Something like DSOrganize's picture viewer?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
-- You know, the human.

I was just using the browser as an example. &gt;_&lt;

<br/>
But thanks! I'll begin trying my hand at the coding soon. :P<br/>_________________<br/>[no sig]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
