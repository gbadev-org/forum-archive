    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, im new here and to DS development, can anyone help me solve this codeing problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a 3D cube made with opengl and want it to face and move to the position of the screen that was tapped on by the stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you will need to be a little more specific. a cube is a 3d object, as well as it's position, and it's orientation. screen coordinates are 2d. do you want the cube to move along a plane parallel to the near clip plane? do you want the cude to move closer to screen? all at once or gradual? does the cube need to change it's orientation to face a new direction?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, thanks for the reply, it is a 3d cube.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to have an object in a room,the camera would be positioned above at an angle looking down at the cube and seeing the full view of the room.
<br/>
<br/>
When you click an ara of the room the cube wouldpoint at it and thenmoveto that location, so the cube would need tomove across x and z axis of the room but staying the same on its y position.
<br/>
<br/>
Dunno if that makes any sence?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
