    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if anyone haven't realized yet, when trying to do any a texture, the right line of pixels are cut, and so are the bottom line of pixels. I guess no one realized because he wasnt doing 2d using gl;)
<br/>
anyway, anyone knows a solution to this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im not sure about on the ds, but this happens on the pc i think so that when you wrap the texture the same pixels are not drawn twice. i remember my lecturer mentioning something about it last year i think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
