    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is using an included example, compiled on the latest version of Devkitpro.  The only change I have made is that I have changed an old variable that doesn't compile to a new one in the VRAM bank management.  Any explanations for this?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Works fine for me. I didn't have to change any code either (I'm using the r20 install)...
<br/>
Also on the top screen you should have text, behind the red ball.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd show a video too, but my housemate has pinched my camera!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why did you have to change some of the code to make it build?
<br/>
And when you get problems with the touch stuff there could be a problem with your ARM7 binary.
<br/>
Although the fact that you get no text on the back screen sounds a bit like it's just the display that's not set up correctly. That'd explain why the red ball thing doesn't line up with your pen properly.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">...so do you now get text on the main screen?
<br/>
And still, why did you have to adjust the code to make it build?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
