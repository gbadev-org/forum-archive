    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im having trouble trying to compile and link a simple ds example program via command line. I have done some programming on the GBA using VHAM but I have never compiled a c++ program through command line. I'm following the NDS tutorial on dev-scene and Im at the step where I compile the hello world example that comes with devkitpro. Every time I try to compile it the command prompt tells me that 'make' is not recognized as a valid command. Is there something simple that I am missing? The makefile is present in the hello world program's directory.  I have done a lot of searching through help pages and faqs and I cant find anything. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Make is part of MSYS. Did you use devkitPro Updater to install MSYS?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Go to your devkitpro folder. In there should be a folder called msys. In that folder run the msys.bat to bring up msys command line window.  Type your make command in there and it should work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the help. I opened up msys.bat and typed the make command but it told me there was no target specified and no makefile found. I am completely clueless when it comes to doing anything via command line. Thats why I wanted to read through this tutorial and learn how build a binary the hard way. The tutorial doesn't give me much info except just type make and it all should magically work. Can anybody fill me in on where I can learn more about building binaries via command line? Maybe a tutorial or something? I don't want to be asking questions on a forum all day like someone who cant help them self. Thanks again for all the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The best way to do homebrew is with an
<br/>
IDE, like Programmers Notepad.(Can be downloaded with the DKP updater)
<br/>
<br/>
Check the DevKitPRO website
<br/>
for how to integrate it with your project.
<br/>
<br/>
I can post on how to do what you want,
<br/>
but I'll do it later.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's how you use
<br/>
bat files, in Windows:
<br/>
<br/>
(This is want you want.
<br/>
Note that I wrote this in Win98.
<br/>
The following may be differen't if you're using a differen't version.
<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to do similar things,
<br/>
like the following, on a differen't OS,
<br/>
but you'll have figure that out yourself.
<br/>
Unless somebody else helps.)
<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I tried running make from
<br/>
Start-&gt;Run, it never worked.
<br/>
Instead,
<br/>
I had to use bat files,
<br/>
or an IDE.
<br/>
<br/>
In case you don't know what bat files are,
<br/>
they are basicly files
<br/>
which contain DOS code.
<br/>
All you have to do to run them, is,
<br/>
double click them.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way,
<br/>
the reason why msys.bat didn't work
<br/>
is because it wasn't in your project directory.
<br/>
If you would navigate to your project directory,
<br/>
it should have worked.(the command is cd,
<br/>
at least for me.)
<br/>
<br/>
1. Open Notepad.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Type "make" and "pause",
<br/>
on seperate lines.(Without the ")
<br/>
(make before pause)
<br/>
(If that pause wasn't there, you couldn't see the output.
<br/>
That also means you couldn't check/fix errors.)
<br/>
<br/>
3.
<br/>
Save it as build.bat,
<br/>
in your project directory.(with the all *.* filter)
<br/>
<br/>
4.
<br/>
Repeat the above steps again,(clear the textbox first)
<br/>
but this time, type clean instead of make,
<br/>
and save it as clean.
<br/>
<br/>
You're done!
<br/>
When you want to compile,
<br/>
just double-click build.bat.
<br/>
<br/>
However,
<br/>
there is a faster,
<br/>
and better,
<br/>
way to create bat files for this.
<br/>
(Which I use all the time
<br/>
whenever I use bat files.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Explorer's "Hide file extenstions for known file types"
<br/>
option must be disabled.
<br/>
(Explorer-&gt;Folder Options-&gt;View-&gt;above option = disable)
<br/>
<br/>
1. Create a text file in the project directory.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Rename it to the correct bat file.
<br/>
Do build.bat and clean.bat(check the above steps)
<br/>
<br/>
3. Type the correct contents for each bat file.
<br/>
(check above steps.)
<br/>
<br/>
You're done!
<br/>
Now you can compile
<br/>
by double-clicking the build.bat file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
