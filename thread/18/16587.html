    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen lots of cool midi apps on the DS lately, and I want to use them to sequence my hardware synthesizers. I want to do this without a computer, so I'm trying to learn as much about wireless on the ds as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to make a simple wireless midi receiver, and I think the first step is to capture the data coming from these midi sequencers that are supposed to be picked up by wifi. Does anyone have an idea how to get started with that? Would the wifi packets be pretty bloated? I'm hoping the receiver wouldn't have to be too complex...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to DS development, so please excuse me if my questions seem ignorant.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Also, I know about Dserial and all that, but I have a cycloDS and a EZ Flash cart. I need my slot 1 to run the software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Midi is a 9600 bps serial signal, Wifi is completely different.  I don't know if it would work.

The obvious answer is get a computer.  You can make an Intel Atom based PC for under $100.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess part of what I'm asking is whether the DS only transmits wifi. I figured perhaps the DS to DS communication was something different?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What you need is an access point that the DS can connect to and some piece of software that receives MIDI packets and outputs them on a MIDI port. This can be done using a computer, the DSMIDIWiFi software and a USB-to-MIDI cable. If you don't want to use a computer, you could port the DSMIDIWiFi server to a wireless router (anything that runs openwrt should do). For the router to communicate to hardware synths, it needs some MIDI output. The easiest way for that is again a usb-to-midi cable, so the router would need a usb port.
<br/>
<br/>
I say that'd be a hell of a project, both in the amount of effort required and in the awesomeness of the result.
<br/>
<br/>
An easier solution is the DSerial Edge, which also doubles as a flash card, so you can run your software from it. Unfortunately, MIDI out via the DSerial Edge is broken in DSMI currently. I'm trying to find the cause and fix it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
