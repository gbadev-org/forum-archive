    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do gl rotations still use a circle with 512 degrees? I know they now go from 0 - 32768, but the lowest value I seem to be able to use for a rotation is 64, which is the same as 1 out of 512.
<br/>
<br/>
If so, what's the point of the new 360 deg functions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Trig functions in libnds now use a 32768 "degree" unit circle.  32768 would correspond to one complete circle where as before 512 would correspond to one complete circle.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is more precision in the representation of an angle. Several people had hinted that the 512 unit circle was not fine grained enough.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Do the glRotate functions accept all angles from 0 to 32768? The comments still say angles from 0-511 are accepted and I can only manage to get them to work within intervals of 64, but if it uses the trig functions then surely I must be doing something wrong!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you passing the values as f32's? The new trig functions take an f32 between 0 and 512, so that may be your problem, by which I mean, you are actually passing 4096 instead of 1.
<br/>
<br/>
And I've been meaning to ask, not to derail the thread or anything, but why has arcTanLerp been commented out? It only needs
