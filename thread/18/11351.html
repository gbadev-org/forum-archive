<br/>
You could have a cache on the flash card like the PSP does with the memory card.
<br/>
As for RAM... use what little there is left on the DS or use specific FlashCard RAM. (eg. SuperCard).<br/>_________________<br/>==Hardware==
<br/>
DSLite, SuperCard SD 2GB V1.63, SuperKey.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Haha no. I don't think it even has the same type of CPU. The browser is designed for a much more powerful system, and porting something without source is damn near impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I fear a web browser cache on a memory card might kill it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
well, about the browser... opera for nds has a ram card (like the n64 had it's 4mb ram pack), doesn't it? *hint* ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
i also agree that "porting" something without sources is damn close to impossible... let's say it IS impossible, that makes things easier. some may say that one could "disassemble" it and modify (mostly rewrite) the asm code... but heck, JUST FORGET IT. that wouldn't even be called porting. it's more like hAcKz0R1nG. :^p
<br/>
<br/>
use a pc (or mac) for inet... life can be so damn easy. ;^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would be called writing a whole new program based on a dissasembly of a program with the same purpose for another platform. There's really no useful information you could get from a disassembled PSP browser that you couldn't get easier from an open-source PC/PDA browser*, and it's probably illegal.
<br/>
<br/>
*Well you could learn some things about the PSP itself (how to use its hardware), but that's useless to a DS developer. And you could learn some general assembly optimizations, but they may not apply to ARM and they can easily be found in tutorials and open-source apps.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The official PSP browser is very slow and of course it's not open source, so no you can't port that.  It would be possible to port the PSP version of Links (homebrew) to the DS.  You would have to seriously reduce the RAM usage or support a RAM expansion.  It would take the same amount of effort just porting Links from the official source, maybe a tiny bit easier since the PSP version has already been modified to use less RAM and work without a keyboard.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Judging from the forums you can get it running on embedded linux powered devices. However minimo is still in very early development status. Still its more possible to port it to the DS then the PSP browser ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I still think starting a *basic* browser from scratch is going to be easier then a port.
<br/>
Start with almost a text-browser that lets us navigate links, but build it with expandability in mind, and let any URL be downloaded.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
