    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had kind of a nifty idea for an emu to use. (Yes, I realise none of them are all too complete, this is just a thought.) You know how 99.9 percent of laptops have a touch pad, right? I know for a fact that it's possible to check what area is being touched on the pad rather than using it just for the mouse. So, why not set it up to act as a DS touch screen in the Emu? It would be a little hard to coordinate touches, but it would provide easier gameplay than using the mousepointer to click the screen. Thoughts?<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

You can't pick up your mouse, drop it in the upper right corner without sending movement input to that corner.  You'd have to assign a "pickup" button to do that in the emulator to halt stylus input temporarily.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: Well you could always reverse this and click to send input but I think it would be uncomfortable to hold the mouse button down for long periods of time, depending on the application.  A good emulator would probably offer the ability to switch on the fly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or you could tell it to interpret a touch with less area as movement and a touch with more area as a click.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK, the touchpad does not send absolute coordinates to the OS, it sends relative moves, like mouse. I don't think Windows can see touchpads as anything different than an ordinary mouse.
<br/>
<br/>
The only pratical difference between the DS touch screen and an ordinary mouse is that you always need to "click and hold" before moving the pointer.
<br/>
<br/>
Playing an emulated DS game will always be more clumsy than playing in a real DS, unless you have one actual touch screen or one of those full blown tablet PCs. But if you can afford that, why not affording a <span style="font-weight: bold">real</span> DS and <span style="font-weight: bold">real</span> DS games?
<br/>
<br/>
Might not be your case, but everytime I see someone asking for more user-friendly DS emulators, I think it's just someone that's too cheap to not only skip buying original games, but skip buying even the console itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless you have the right drivers. Many touchpads have drivers available that will turn the touchpad into an absolute pointing device.

Because a robot to move the CF card back and forth between the DS and the PC after each build would cost more.

Because a license from Nintendo to use official development equipment (including the rumored "ensata" emulator) would cost even more than that.
