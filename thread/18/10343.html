    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a couple of questions about making a 2 player wifi game for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Is homebrew wifi easy to set up? Do I need to fully understand networking?
<br/>
<br/>
2. How do I go about the actual engine?
<br/>
   Do I have one DS do all the work, and sent map co'ords and sprite locations to the other, or do I shard all the work between the two?
<br/>
<br/>
3. Do both DS's need a copy of the game, or is it possible to do download play?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
<br/>
2. It's really up to you.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Nope, no downlaod play yet. If the program is small enough, you could load it into memory and then swap the cart into the second DS.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

Except if you're programming on a PC, you're already connected to an access point. In a typical Nintendo DS play situation, such as on a 2 hour car trip, there may not be an open access point (nor even an AC power source) within range. In this case, one DS needs to act as an access point, or the systems need to use ad-hoc mode. Neither is implemented.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
