    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
     Recently, I downloaded Eagle, and started designing some hardware. One
<br/>
of the things I designed was a <span style="font-weight: bold">9v emergency charger</span>. Baisicaly, you
<br/>
plug in a 9v battery, and solder on [the end of] an NDS or GBA charger. Plug
<br/>
it into your DS, and it should charge. Unfortunately, I havent been able to actually <span style="font-style: italic">make</span> it. If anyone would like to try it, I'll provide the schematic
<br/>
and board files (eagle format). Also, can anyone tell me if I've made any
<br/>
electrical errors? This is one of my first designs, so chances are I've made a
<br/>
few.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and good luck! 
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I think I may try making it on a breadboard soon, but what kind of 
<br/>
resistor (i.e. Oams, mA, etc.) would I use to drop the current 3.8v? Thanks!

Ah... I'll look at some of those, I hardly know anything about hardware.
