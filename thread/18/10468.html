    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was wondering if there was a program or something that would convert .ds.gba files to .nds format, or vice versa. i'm personally getting sick of programs that only have one format of the two. i'm assuming just renaming the file wouldn't work. that'd be too easy :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. renaming may work sometimes
<br/>
2. dsbuild.exe (included in devkitarm) converts from .nds-&gt;.ds.gba, should always work
<br/>
3. <a class="postlink" href="http://davr.drunkencoders.com/pme2nds.zip" target="_blank">pme2nds.exe</a> tries to convert from .ds.gba -&gt; .nds (but it doesn't always work, this is trickier to convert)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, ironically, the author of that program is the guy who just posted here, josath.  From what I know, calcemu was made a while ago, when you couldn't convert files between the two types.

I believe that there was originally a wifi/emulator version, but since it included the copyrighted TI-85 rom, it was taken down from the site.  Now you can only get the one that builds a DS program from a user-supplied TI-85 rom, which only outputs a .ds.gba file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe the TI-85 will automatically copy the ROM when connected to the computer? The TI-92 does that.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
