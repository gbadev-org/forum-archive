    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">and has either a passme or a wifime compatible wireless card..
<br/>
<br/>
want to make a quick $10 by allowing me access to the aforementioned hardware for the five minutes it takes to flash my firmware? yeah, this is probably exactly the sort of begging that is going to eliminate any respect anybody would have for me on this board, but i really don't feel like spending the $30 to order something i'd only need to use once.
<br/>
<br/>
alternately, does anybody want to sell me theirs for cheap? we could use paypal or something..
<br/>
<br/>
believe me, i've been up and down my buddy list trying to find somebody who has a workable wireless card for the past month. also, i'm cheap. please?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">~ $25 lets you buy a wireless card and keep it you know. Plus you can use WiFiMe to mod your DS firmware for FlashMe.
<br/>
<br/>
PassMe is really only useful once, to get the firmware onto your DS. WiFiMe is still the fastest way to boot homebrew code, provided you have FlashMe on your DS already.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
