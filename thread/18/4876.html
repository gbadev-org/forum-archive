    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, unlike, some of the other threads on this topic, I'm more curious about general info regarding the SDK and the development process.  I figure this is pretty general info so hopefully it can be discussed with violating any NDAs that anyone here might be under.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo just say dev kits it costs "from $10,000 to $20,000".  Is there not a specific cost, or are there multiple devkits with different features, or...?
<br/>
<br/>
Roughly what is included?  From other threads, I presume you obviously get development software and an emulator (is it available for anything other than Windows?), but do they give you real hardware to test on?  Do you just get a one?  (Do you have to pay more to test wireless features?)
<br/>
<br/>
Presumably you have to sign the NDA before they'd do this, but before actually buying a dev kit do they have someone who can help you determine the technical feasibility of a project with regard to the system?  (The sort of thing only someone intimately fimiliar with the system could determine.)
<br/>
<br/>
And on an even more general note, what's the current range of available cart/SRAM sizes?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Current cards can be up to 128 MB (1 Gb) and SRAM is up to 64 KB.
<br/>
<br/>
I would assume that the dev kit comes with a debug unit, a box of documentation, the SDK/emulator/other software, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
