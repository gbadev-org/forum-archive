    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
I'm using grit (which is so much handier than using gfx2gba!). I have one issue. I have a sprite sheet, which has 2 animations in it, lets call them A and B. Each animation has 8 frames. Each sprite is 32x32. The sprite sheet is arranged as follows (where A(n) and B(n) a each frame of animation):
<br/>
<br/>
A1  B1
<br/>
A2  B2
<br/>
A3  B3
<br/>
A4  B4
<br/>
A5  B5
<br/>
A6  B6
<br/>
A7  B7
<br/>
A8  B8
<br/>
<br/>
I want to export these to be used on the DS. However, I've run into an issue with grit. 
<br/>
Using grit, I am able to export all the A frames seperately, as it allows you to specify the area of the image to export. I do by exporting the rectangle made up by 0,0 to 32,256. This works fine, and the sprites appear fine on the DS. 
<br/>
However, if I try to export 0,32 to 64,256 (i.e. animation frames B), it doesn't seem to work! The sprite data appearing on the DS is garbled. Anyone have any idea if there is any issue with this part of the program?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Whoops, should have read the manual more closely. The fields in wingrit are for the width and height of the area, not for absolute values. 
<br/>
Cheers guys!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess you mean 32,0 to 64,256 (?)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yip, that's what I did mean! I managed to get it working anyway. I just misunderstood the fields in wingrit, so was exporting the incorrect data.
<br/>
Cheers anyway</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
