    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before i go spending my cash and my time on homebrewing my DS, i was wondering what was availible to me by doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
I beleive I read aout a snes emulator some time ago and was wondering if its availible yet?
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, would it be possible to have a list of some of the software with links if availible please?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Think of homebrew hardware as an investment. You can get decent setup for under $100 and then load up any freeware software or even write your own games. They've got NES, Master System, SNES and Atari emulators in addition to ScummVM which plays the old lucas arts games. There are also applications that allow you to play MP3 or watch videos on the DS. Not to mention the random homebrew games + apps you can download for free. Its definately a purchase you will not regret. Just make sure to read up on the DS Flash Hardware forum so you know which device you want to get. I hope that helps.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are lots of neat stuff like moonshell (mp3 player, and so much more), win2DS (you can opperate your pc trhough the touchscreen and even see what is happinin :O) and a lot more. To conivce you, the DS+GBAMP+1gigCF Card is second on my list of best purchases ever (with my pc on number one, more than a year old and still beating most freshly bought machines :P)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
