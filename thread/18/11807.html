Anywho, can someone recommend some good, preferrably 3D homebrew stuff for me to try out? I'm just interested in the scene mainly. Thanks!

There is something called "FCSR" that you may be able to make use of if you recompile Doom.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Actually, you don't even need to recompile doom. You simply need to generate a FCSR image and append it to the binary. If you look through the ds doom topic, I made a post somewhere with dsdoom+shareware wad, which should work on almost any flashcart with GBAROM space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool. I think Ill try this one out now. 
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I have an EZflash cart, which lets me give as much as 2048 Kb of SRAM to a particular game. Using this knowledge, is it possible to compile a flashcart friendly version that does support saving? Thanks.

*EDIT* Actually, a much better question is what steps did you follow to actually create the file you posted? Not only do I want to try other wad files, I want to try appending the FAT thing to other programs so I can try them out? (I don\'t have a FAT solution quite yet, unfortunately... Mainly I want to try hexen and heretic. Doom was awesome though!)<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

Are there enough homebrew-capable Nintendo DS systems in the wild for this to be useful? And how would you copy the transfer program itself to the other DS?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
