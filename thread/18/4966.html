BSAFE encryption to be used in future wireless-capable DS software.
<br/>
By Craig Harris 
<br/>
February 2, 2005 - RSA Security today announced that Nintendo is a licensor of RSA's BSAFE encryption solutions for the Nintendo DS system. This encryption will allow for safe and protected data transferred wirelessly between Nintendo DS units. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RSA BSAFE technology is used to protect the digital rights of game publishers for titles shared over these wireless links. The technology also allows Nintendo to protect game software that is issued on a trial basis for play in retail stores and other demo environments. 
<br/>
<br/>
"Nintendo's use of our embedded RSA BSAFE technology in its portable game console is a great endorsement of our leadership in providing the security components consumer device manufacturers need, in order to offer protection for digital entertainment assets on their platforms," said Rick Welch, Vice President of Developer Solutions and Professional Services at RSA Security. 
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS systems have been using RSA security since the unit's debut in November 2004, as noted in the "RSA Secured" branding on the back of every system.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From the wording of that, it sounds like confirmation that current DS games do not use RSA for wireless and hence the DS supports *but* does not require it. In which case: Yay for us! Of course, it could just be poorly worded: maybe they were using future tense just to make it sound fancier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Doesn't the fact that people haved sniffed wireless communications prove that it's not required?  It reads to me that it has the ability to have RSA encryption, so if I want to click on "Order" to order Mario 64 DS using my DS (from a downloaded Demo?), I don't have to worry about my CC info being stolen..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as of current, i have not seen a single game use encryption on its wireless.  my guess is that it is only talked about as a means of 802.11 layer 2 encryption for hotspot access points that have said features enabled.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

Now THAT has me interested. Imagine Nintendo having a device in a retail store that just pumps out demo code to people's DS units that wirelessly connect to it. No more broken controllers on the demo unit at the retail store. People can try out games on their own equipment at no cost, before buying the game. Absolutely ingenious. "DS Wireless Demo Hotspot at &lt;retailer X&gt;!" Hit the mall every weekend to see what demos are playing. Absolutely incredible.<br/>_________________<br/>"Jesus saves, but everyone else in a 10 foot radius takes full damage from the fireball."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or download the demos off the internet from any hotspot or your own house after they release an internet play cart.  Or even a demo cart that you can pick up for free at any retailer that allows for online downloads.  The possiblities that this hardware is capable of is only limited by the imagination.  Nintendo did a good job designing this thing.  Let's just hope we don't have to play $20 for an online demo downloading cart, then $10 / month to download demos or online only games, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as i recall from E3 news, i do beleive nintendo did state they would have demo stations setup.  hell, it could be as simple as having a DS in a sealed case w/ power and a custom game cart that was specifically programed to give out a demo of a game.  no special hardware needed, and it would be easy for retailers to setup.  just leave a DS running underneath the counter w/ a custom game cart in it.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-
