    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've contacted the original creator of the TI-85 emu for the DS (<a class="postlink" href="http://davr.drunkencoders.com/calc/" target="_blank">http://davr.drunkencoders.com/calc/</a>). Apparantly he no longer works on it, and has given me the source code. Now I don't really know anything about making DS homebrew, hence why I'm showing you guys.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find the source here:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.megaworm.com/copper/albums/userpics/10004/TI-85_Emu_for_Nintendo_DS.7z.zip" target="_blank">http://www.megaworm.com/copper/albums/userpics/10004/TI-85_Emu_for_Nintendo_DS.7z.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I should mention, I believe it's based on the PC TI-8x emulator here (there's also a TI-8x rom dumper on there):

<br/>
<br/>
And also, this TI-85 emu for the DS is actually a TI 82, 83, 85, and 86 emulator; any of those calculator's roms are supposed to work, but only the 85 and 86 boot, with the 85 being faster.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I need this :)
<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday I had quite a dangerous encounter.
<br/>
Forgot my graphing calculator for math, but I remembered my DS (hey, one goes in my bag, the other goes in my pocket and is 50 times more useful). The teacher, of course, wasn't pleased.
<br/>
"So, you forgot your calculator but you remembered your game system. That's really interesting, Dylan."
<br/>
Heh... He let me keep it though; I think even he understood the awesomeness of Mathomatic and a Ti-85 emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your emulator looks excellent! I like that you're doing black on white with it, and your tidied up on-screen keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
Two suggestions:
<br/>
-Could you perhaps center or completely lower the emulated display on the top screen so there isn't such a huge gap between it and the touch screen?
<br/>
-Needing to press the On button really confused me for 10 minutes :S Could you change if?
<br/>
<br/>
Considering that you dared to mention saving and transferring files, I'm very excited to see where this will go :)
<br/>
Thank you!

Was going to do that, couldn't figure out how to move the screen last night, got it working now. I can also stretch the screen completely (it fits evenly, the original TI screen is 128x64, doubling gives 256x128, or if I triple the Y axis I get 256x192).

please enable us to build in the ti85 rom (i use an ez4 which is notoriously unfriendly toward fat libs) and you will be my new hero.
<br/>
<br/>
also, why not get creative with the key mapping? you aren't using the whole touch screen; not all of the buttons have to be the same size. consider mapping the arrow keys to both the d-pad and the face buttons, and the 2nd key to both shoulder buttons.

The ABXY buttons are being used for Enter and Clear, I believe. I don't believe X and Y have a purpose yet...

Good idea mapping 2nd to the shoulder buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else finding that these buttons are hard to press with the stylus, but easy to press with entire fingers?
<br/>
I'm finding the finger use kind of nice (very calculatorish), but I do wonder why it is...
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing:
<br/>
Is it possible to set this up so that pressing the Alpha key swaps the bottom screen to a more usable keyboard? (qwerty or MessageEase, perhaps?).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

As far as the finger thing, not sure what the issue is. Probably the standard problem of libnds touchscreen code not working all that well for some people. Right now, I'm not doing any special checks or anything, so I can probably improve touchscreen support a bit.

If you use a primary/secondary "layout" like my mock

DPAD + ABYX = arrow keys for left/right handed people

I'd also prefer having the right side buttons as 2nd and alpha for games, and perhaps using select or something to either switch between left handed or righthanded mode. Or possibly a config file, it's not like you'll change it often.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that I can't speak for left handed people, but is it truly necessary to have a left handed mode? The calculator doesn't really require fast action most of the time, and the last time I checked, my 84+ didn't have a left handed mode. Actually, if you compare your calculator to your ds you'll find that it already is in left handed mode! But maybe it's so easy to implement that it's not really worth leaving out.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i don't know; scummvm has pertinent controls on the d-pad and buttons in addition to the touch screen and i always thought that made it a little clunky no matter what. i suppose it comes down to whether or not we're actually going to be playing ztris through a ti85 on a DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately, the save state isn't working for me.

It loads fine (and my dump is with version 10), but if I go to CUST (assuming that's custom) and hit F1 (presumably launching something called Usgrd), it will exit the little menu but nothing shows up or happens.
<br/>
I know it's loading fine because 11 is in memory as the last result.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
