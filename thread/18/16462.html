    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible? I have a fairly slow SD card (using SCSD) and it's tying up my ARM9 :/
<br/>
<br/>
I'm reading a raw audio file with sampling rate 22050Hz. I can't read much more than 5000 bytes per read (~4 reads per second) or I miss the vblank and fall a frame behind with my graphics. I can't read too little either because the read itself has a lower limit for speed.
<br/>
<br/>
I do know that my graphics engine (2D over 3D) is probably not as efficient as it should be, but if I could just off the load to the ARM7 it'd be really nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do not believe that all dldi drivers work from arm7. In any case I would say this will probably not be the best solution particulary for a sound app as the arm7 is in charge of sound. tying it up with disk reads is probably going to cause all sorts of sound glitches - I guess you wont find out till you try though.

5000 bytes? isn't that enough data to last for 6 frames?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
