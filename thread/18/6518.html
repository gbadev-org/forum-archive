There is a delay issue with the DS, the lag over the internet causes the DS to disconnect  (I think thats what I read before) so as soon as the online games are released,  People will learn what is required to have a successful connection..

Hey, Nintendo will probably release a WiFi version at some point, Maybe Metroid Prime 2 - Hunted :)<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
