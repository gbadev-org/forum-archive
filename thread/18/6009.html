    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm new here, and would like to get started making stuff for the DS, but I've run into an odd problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I bought a suitable Wifi card to use with the wireless multiboot, and have sucessfully used it to transfer the commercial game demos fine.  
<br/>
<br/>
Then I had a go at running the homebrew roms.  I built some roms using NDS Dev Env 2.3.0.  I burned the .ds.gba file on onto my GBA cart and booted using wifime, but it seems only the Tetris demo and the Nibbles demos will run.  Everything else just displays two white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
It appears that those are the early ones that use a different template, but everything newer just fails to work.  I've tried all the ndslib examples and the ones that come with NDS Dev Env.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any ideas why?  I'm using a Visoly FlashAdvance Pro 128M.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem.  Check your environmental variables and make sure that the binary directory is not interfering with another (have the DKA binary folder first, or near so).  If that doesn't work, try redownloading everything, in this order:
<br/>
Template
<br/>
DevKitARM
<br/>
LibNDS/NDSLib
<br/>
MSYS
<br/>
Everything else
<br/>
<br/>
The first two steps got me up and running, thanks to DesktopMan for his help. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't work, remove everything you have and do everything again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Finally got it working.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I think was wrong in case other people are having problems:  I think the version of DevkitARM included with NDS Dev Env 2.3.0 won't build for the Arm7 correctly.  All the demos I could run were ones that had the arm7 binary pre-built.  All the others just crashed on hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
I eventually fixed it by getting DevkitArm r12 from Sourceforge (the self-extractor), and the latest version of ndslib from thepernproject.com.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I now can't build the examples that came with NDS Dev Env at all, all the NDSlib examples build and run on hardware, so I'm happy I can build code for both the Arm7 and the Arm9.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
