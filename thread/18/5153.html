I know Nintendo has said they will be officially providing an online service later in the year, but Im having trouble seeing how. No wireless modem routers support the NiFi, and only some can be hacked to support it (the  linksys WRT54G me thinks). Does this mean well all have to use Nintendo wifi bridges?

Someone help me out here my understanding is limited at best.

People still don't get this, eh?
<br/>
<br/>
The DS wireless hardware is an 802.11 transceiver. The only thing that makes it "NiFi" is the fact that Nintendo isn't running TCP/IP over the hardware, they use their own frame-based communication protocol.
<br/>
<br/>
For online-enabled games, all the developers will do is use TCP/IP over the same hardware, and it will be fully WiFi compatible with your router.

<br/>
<br/>
Again, online-enabled games will be playable on any WiFi router. Since the DS has built in RSA encryption, WEP is likely supported out of the box, and WPA could also be possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just tossing this out there, but could the NDS be using another frequency in addition to the 2.4Ghz band? Maybe another signal of some type to say "I'm a real DS" like 900Mhz? Heck, the things got a microphone, maybe it produces ultrasound?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see why Big N would set up NiFi so you could emulate it without specialized hardware. The idea of selling (forcing you to buy) another device to play the games online just sounds so... <span style="font-style: italic">Nintendo</span> of them.

Then you are probably screwed. You could possibly find your DS's MAC, then have your computer spoof that, authenticate with the web based form to get an IP, then drop the connection from the PC and turn on the DS.

<br/>
Depending on the school's system, that <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> work, but even if it does, it would be a bit of a hassle.

Apparently the PSP doesn't support it, so I doubt the DS will either. Still, there needs to be a unified way to save all that information. Inputting information to access a network takes time, and it would be a lot better if you could simply detect a hotspot and quickly join a game.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Im not quite sure what your getting at. i acknowledged that this forum is mainly for the development of homebrew code (and apologized for a slightly off topic post). All i did was ask what ppl knew about the wireless gaming implementation. i admit the question was somewhat a newbie question because i completely forgot TCP/IP is not implemented at hardware level.

if its using the same architecture, you dont need multiple CPUs (old and new).  look at the Nintendo DS.  in GBA mode, the ARM9 is disabled and the ARM7 runs at 16mhz. in DS mode, the ARM9 is enabled and ARM7 runs at 33mhz.  much like how todays 3+ghz CPUs can still run DOOM (which was designed for an i386)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

In every example of backwards compatability in consoles, the original hardware is still there in some shape or form. In the PS2, the original Playstation CPU is in there. In the Game Boy Advance, the original Game Boy CPU is still in there. The thing is that console/portable hardware is strictly designed with one chip in mind with little to no error. The actually depend on the clock speed of the chip itself. In the case of DOOM PC's today, the thing is that DOOM, as far as I know, doesn't run specifically for one clock speed. Doom is capped at running 60fps or so, so it really doesn't matter how fast your CPU is. Console/hardware games are intermittantely dependant on the hardware itself. Running the CPU twice as fast on a console doesn't make the game run twice as fast.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

which is why i also made the comparison of the ARM7 GBA to ARM7 DS.  its the same CPU, clocked different.  btw: the GBC vs GB was the same way (the GBC is 8mhz z80, the GB is 4mhz z80)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">mayb it emulates the GC part...its gonna b a PPC CPU, which means its a RISC, and its been hinted that nintendo might b dropping in a customised G4 or G5
<br/>
i'm wondering how the backwards compatability is gonna work controller-wise, since the Revolution won't have a d-pad or a and b buttons...mayb it'll use wireless controllers like the wavebird and u'll still b able to use the wavebird with it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know what you were trying to say, but console games do synchronize to vblank just as the Mode 13h PC games (e.g. Doom) did. If you hack an emulator for many consoles to use half or double the cycles per scanline, many games will often still run fine. This ratio tends to improve the further you get along in the development of consoles, with newer consoles' games being less dependent on clock speed than, say, Atari VCS 2600 games. To get the stragglers, the ones that depend intimately on the CPU speed, use a clock divider, as was used in the Game Boy Color to get DMG games working, as Darkain pointed out.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
