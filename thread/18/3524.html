<span style="font-weight: bold">Kaz Hirai:</span> Battery life is one of these things where if you state a number then everybody's satisfied. The only problem, of course, is it never matches what you state.  But if you don't state a number then it's like, "What's the battery life?"  So it's a continuous Catch-22.  And that's especially prevalent with the PlayStation Portable because it plays various entertainment content.  Again, if you're just listening to music with no visuals at all then it should last, as I said yesterday, about eight to ten hours just like an iPod would.  If you are playing a game that is consistently cycling through and putting the CPU to good use, yeah, battery life is going to be shorter.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Maybe about two and a half, three hours.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I think he was referring to the games that constantly stream data of the disc for dynamic loading like Jak II and the GTA series. We are going to see more loading screens compared to the PS2 even if the amount of memory is the same. And that would be the least amount of battery life for the system. But chances are, you won't be able to get more than 6 hours.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmmm.  I guess you're right.  I think the equivilent would be:
<br/>
while(your_engine &gt;= my_engine++);
<br/>
<br/>
But I think my original version would give the same results but with one less loop.<br/>_________________<br/>---

Actually, I copied it from someone off of gamedev.net, can't remember who though. Just like in the business world, don't fix it unless its broken and my sig. is running pretty smoothly right now! :P<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Consider the case when your_engine is greater than my_engine from the very beginning. That specific case breaks both your suggestions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you mean when my_engine is greater than your_engine to begin with? If so, yeah you've got me. In this case my_engine is incremented when there's no need to.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe "my_engine |= -1".
<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I should never have mentioned it in the first place... :)<br/>_________________<br/>---
