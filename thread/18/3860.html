    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know where the homebrew GBA register specs orignally came from, and (more importantly) how long they took to be published?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm simply wondering how long it will be between a DS being in someone's hands to a register spec becoming available.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the genesis of the GBA register spec, but there are two alternatives:  Either someone knew someone who knew someone who had an official deveopment system, or someone painstakingly disassembled games, and observed what they did and reverse engineered the register spec.  That second option sounds dubious, but hey, I'm not going to say anything if you don't.
<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of interest in this new platform.  It would be a shame to wait 6 months for a dev system - but I'd like to get a ball-park so I can have an expectation of the wait.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any historical accounts from the original GBA register mappers would be interesting to hear.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suspect that most development studios don't care it the homebrew community knows the specs as long as they (the studio) can not be held liable for the leak.  One could agrue that a knowledgable homebrew community is an assest to dev studios.
<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to individual developers, some of them may want to help out the community, but leaking documents is a big deal.  I figure that most developers do not want to risk their career to help out the community.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo doesn't want the specs out in the open.  There was an article about IP protection in the latest edition of game developer magazine.  Find it, read it- it's good stuff.  Pay special attention to the part on trade secrets.

<br/>
In short, Nintendo is going to be fussy and everyone else wants to avoid lawsuits.

Hardware 3D graphics implies a very complex register set to begin with.  Typically programmers get nowhere near 3D registers, instead working at a 3D API layer provided by the vendor (think, DirectX or OpenGL in desktop land).  Add to that the prospect of mandatory library calls to do things with sound and you're looking at a platform that Nintendo is trying to keep very closed, and a few register specs leaked here or there may not help with getting real work done.

As has happened on consoles and PCs, most games are now 3D.  2D games look antiquated.
<br/>
<br/>
I love 2D games.  3D doesn't ensure good games, but it's where all gaming is going (for better or worse).
<br/>
<br/>
That's why (as I waffled on about in the compo thread) I think the GBA as it stands today may be the last great homebrew machine.

<br/>
Exactly.  And where do you think you're going to get the libraries?
<br/>
<br/>
Three options here:
<br/>
1. The libraries are all in the ROM, so all the code has to do is know the API and the calling convention.  This requires hardware documentation and library documentation to fall off the back of a truck and into someones hands, so they can implement the headers and link-libraries to call the ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
2. The lower level drivers live in the ROM, but the higher level API is linked with the game.  So we're SOL because we can't use the copyrighted, licensed Nintendo binaries.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Everything in linked in the application.  SOL for license and copyright reasons.  Same as #2.
<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the GBA, where every bit of data on a cart is produced by the community (except for the Nintendo logo, which is just a key to get the cart to work), the DS may be unusable without proprietary licenced and copyrighted SDK libraries.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone on this board is a DS licensee, or knows one, could they at least give us a clue about how tight the binding is between the game application itself and any link-time proprietary libraries?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">3d rocks, 2d is awesome.  really depends on the game mechanics though.
<br/>
I doubt nintendo would have the 3d stuff in say bios function calls.  It would probably be a linkable library so they can offer new features in the future, and any bugs in the 3d api can be fixed instead of worked around.  I don't think it would be that hard to write an opengl implementation after someone figures out the registers.  then joe coder who doesn't like touching the hardware can just use the insanely documented opengl calls.  
<br/>
<br/>
if someone gives me the info on the registers i'll bloody write an opengl like api for the ds.  (opengl is weird license, go see Mesa3d website).
<br/>
<br/>
and if your just going to stay on the gba for a while the ds could be used as a  gba with 2 screens and a touchpad. so why?

First you have to get licensed, which means getting hired by a licensed publisher, which in turn usually means you have to have been involved with the development of a top-selling video game on an open handheld platform such as Palm, Pocket PC, or Java phones.

But, not a single post since the first one has even attempted to answer the question. Of course we would all agree that it would have to be some time before we can actually get our hands dirty; the game system isn't even out yet. But Marciano just wanted to get an idea of when that might be. I would speculate that it should take a least a year before we can get a good working emulator for the system. And that would probably be the same for an SDK.  But nobody else made that kind of speculation. A few made comments on what is in stake to get leaked info, but after that a person reading that this thread would received no more information on the subject. In fact, I think it was Marciano himself that first introduced a different subject line when he talked about that game from the german developer. Oh well, like I said I've seen stuff like that before but I just had to comment on this one.

But then again, the DS hasn't even been released and there is little new info on it. Heck, I don't even think developers have the final model in their hands yet! It's just too early to say anything.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In seriousness, though, I've lost a lot of faith in EA over the last few years.  They seem to have long abandoned the values and vision they were founded on.  I totally agree with your predictions on them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe the GC has more in common with DS? If Nintendo was smart, they'd make the DS&lt;-&gt;GC libs very similar. Then all those GC games (and licencees) can do easy ports. So if you got bagged with the GC licence at the end of the line, at least you might be saved some startup time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
