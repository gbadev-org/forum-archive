    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if this would be a good idea!
<br/>
Reading from files is pretty slow on my GBAMP. 
<br/>
So I was thinking to put it in a zip file and then unzip what I need on the fly.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think this would speed up loading time??
<br/>
<br/>
It would make the it a bit cleaner as I would not need a directory with all my files in just one zipped file.
<br/>
<br/>
Would it also maybe possible to put this code so it runs on the GBA process in the background???
<br/>
<br/>
Has someone port zip to ds yet?
<br/>
<br/>
regards,
<br/>

In fact, if you have libpng, you already have zlib.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
