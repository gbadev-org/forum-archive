    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As you may have noticed, I've been a bit busy lately and have been missing DLDI driver updates. Since DLDI was meant to be a way for libfat device drivers to be updated independent of me, it is a bit stupid for them all to be listed on one web page that only I can edit. Therefore I've decided to make a DLDI Wiki.
<br/>
<br/>
Sections I've thought of so far are:
<br/>
<ul><li>A page for each device
<br/>
</li><li>A page for each device for users to report compatibility
<br/>
</li><li>A page for each tool / utility
<br/>
</li><li>Tutorials on how to use the tools
<br/>
</li><li>Instructions for developers using libfat / DLDI-enabled gba_nds_fat
<br/>
</li><li>Instructions on how to write a DLDI driver</li></ul>
<br/>
Since I'm obviously not perfect, I've probably missed something, so I'm looking for suggestions of what else can be included. Keep in mind that this is specifically for DLDI, and not homebrew in general.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

dynamic enough to change.

I think one language (englisch) should be sufficient, since

imho it should be developer oriented.

Obviously some things would need to be reworded if it were to be used on the official site, and the "getting started" section is highly outdated, and the "Supercard Issues" section would either require its own page or be a part of the SCSD_moon.dldi page, but it's a good starting point.  
<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if any of the information here is incorrect.  I am not a programmer, so though I attempted to do research before writing the summary, I'm sure I inadvertedly posted some incorrect or incomplete info.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll also notice that I stole much of the info directly from the original libfat page, hehe.  Ah well.

<br/>
==History of libfat==
<br/>
For many DS applications to be useful, it is necessary for the application to read and write data to and from the storage medium (SD card, microSD, CF, etc) used by the homebrew device. This lets you save your login for IRC, save your TODO list, delete files, read MP3 files, etc.  
<br/>
<br/>
To do this, a coder named Chishm came up with a pair of libraries called gba_nds_fat and libfat, some reusable programming code that allowed for read/write access to the CF and SD cards of a few popular devices of the time, like the Supercard and M3.  Since coders typically don't like to reinvent the wheel, pretty much every homebrew application out there used one of these libraries.
<br/>
<br/>
However, herein lied the problem. What if you weren't using a supported device?  New devices started coming out more rapidly, faster than Chishm could successfully add stable, usable code to libfat.  Some cards, like the DS-X and G6, didn't even release drivers at all, so they remained incompatible with many DS homebrew applications.  In addition, after each new device was added to libfat, each and every homebrew program would have to recompile with the new libfat to add support for the device.  Needless to say, this became a problem for older homebrew that was abandoned by its authors.  In December of 2006, Chishm decided that a change was necessary.  He proposed a new system called DLDI that would replace the current system, bringing with it great benefits.  Most of the GBAdev community seemed acceptable to the idea, and thus Chishm gave the community a great Christmas present, releasing the first version of the DLDI interface.
<br/>
<br/>
==What is DLDI?==
<br/>
DLDI is a '''D'''ynamically '''L'''inked '''D'''evice '''I'''nterface for libfat.  What does that mean?  Basically, instead of including static drivers for each device in every homebrew program, a 32 KB placeholder is inserted into the code instead.  This placeholder is then replaced by the user, who patches the homebrew program with a specific DLDI patch for his or her specific homebrew device.  
<br/>
<br/>
==Benefits of DLDI==
<br/>
*Chishm no longer has to maintain all the drivers for all the cards. As soon as a driver is written by anyone, it is usable by everyone.
<br/>
*Cards that aren't even released yet are supported by programs that have already been compiled. No more having to recompile to add support for a card.
<br/>
*Manufacturers don't have to release source code to release an easily usable driver. No more having to recompile using other libraries. They don't need to make publicly available their trade secrets.  Of course, this means we have to disassemble whatever they do release to understand the hardware, but we already have to do this (M3, G6, GBAMP).
<br/>
<br/>
==Downsides of DLDI==
<br/>
*There is an extra step added to compile then copy to card then run a debug build. The tool is command line based, so this can be added to the makefile.
<br/>
*Users need to patch any apps that use libfat for their particular card. This is okay, as they already do it for commercial ROMs. Alternatively, multiple builds can be released on a website, but this kinda reduces the utility of such a scheme. 
<br/>
<br/>
Because users must patch each piece of homebrew they wish to add to their flash cart, users of devices already supported by libfat might view it as nothing but an inconvenience.  However, the benefits outweigh the downsides.  With the recent onslaught of new slot-1 devices being released, the DLDI interface allows for each device to be instantly compatible with many homebrew applications as soon as a DLDI patch file is made for the device.
<br/>
<br/>
==Getting Started==
<br/>
To begin using the DLDI system, first ensure that the homebrew program you wish to try has indeed been compiled with DLDI support.  Anything last updated before December 2006 will not have DLDI support at all.  Once you've found a suitable homebrew program, download it and extract it to a folder.  Then go to <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/</a> where you will download several files:
<br/>
#The correct DLDI patch for your specific device.
<br/>
#The patcher program itself, called dlditool.exe
<br/>
#The GUI program if you are using Windows and do not wish to use the command-line
<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer:  The GUI and the dlditool.exe program are made by two separate people.  As such, the GUI may sometimes be out of date.  
<br/>
<br/>
Command-line instructions:  once you've obtained the required files, place the DLDI patch file into the directory where dlditool.exe resides.  Open a command shell and type "dlditool.exe" to receive the simple syntax instructions.  As an example, typing
<br/>
 dlditool.exe scsd.dldi WordWrap.nds
<br/>
will patch the WordWrap.nds file with the Supercard SD DLDI file.  
<br/>
<br/>
The Windows GUI should be fairly self-explanatory.  
<br/>
<br/>
==Supercard Issues==
<br/>
Some newer Supercards have different internal workings that do not work with the default DLDI file.  Supercard Lites were the first to exhibit this behavior, but issues with regular Supercard SD units have also been reported.  They show few signs of being modified, and it is not a change that was ever announced by the Supercard team.  However, due to differences in the internal workings of the devices, normal libfat code does not work.  Moonlight, the creator of Moonshell, has created an alternate SCSD_moon.dldi patch file that has been reported to work on these Supercards when the standard SCDS.dldi and SCLT.dldi patches have failed.  
<br/>
<br/>
This modified DLDI patch is reportedly made up of Supercard SD fat code taken from older versions of Moonshell, which were different than that of libfat.  [http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12410&amp;start=15]

When adding a device driver, please follow the existing examples (use the template). If a driver is usable by more than one device, create a page for the other device and use a redirect like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#REDIRECT [[original device]]

<br/>
<br/>
If you have come across problems with a device, you may wish to use the Discussion page first, to see if it is just you or other people are experiencing the same issue. If it is a confirmed issue, then make a note of it under the particular device driver. For example, you might post this on the GBA Movie Player (Compact Flash) page:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">{{Driver | name=MPCF | dldifile=mpcf | sourcefile=mpcf | author=Chishm | lastupdate=2006-12-25 | readtest=Works | writetest=Fails }}

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Here are some guidelines for Sysops / Bureaucrats:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Add users to the programmer group if they need to upload a DLDI file or an image. Use your judgement and don't add them to the group if they are unlikely to contribute to the wiki in a beneficial manner, or if they are likely to cause vandalism. This process is meant to prevent abuse of the file server capabilities, and not to block all but a select few individuals.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Here are some general guidelines for all users:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Users are not to upload illegal content. The first time they do so, they get a warning, via email (if possible) and on their User: page. If they do it again, they are removed from the programmer group.
<br/>
<br/>
Users are not to link directly to illegal content, nor to a page that contains illegal content. Pages that are hosted on servers containing only legal content are of course linkable (just making this explicit). If a linked-to page is hosted on the same server as illegal content, and if the the page itself doesn't contain illegal content, and if there is no alternative source of information, then the page may also be linked. If a user links to illegal content, they get one warning, again via email (if possible) and on their User: page. If they do it again, their account is blocked for one week. For a third offense they get a permanent block.
<br/>
<br/>
The Wiki is intended for DLDI related topics, not general DS homebrew. Pages about individual homebrew apps are allowable and encouraged, but the focus should be on how that homebrew relates to DLDI. For example, information on converting movies for MoonShell is not relevant, but information on which devices have trouble saving the position in an e-book within MoonShell is relevant. All pages about DS homebrew should be added to the category DS Homebrew by adding the tag [[Category:DS Homebrew]] to the bottom of the page.
<br/>
<br/>
Users can apply for upload rights by posting to this thread or in <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=DLDIWiki:Upload_rights_request" target="_blank">this page</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's a good idea having photographs of the devices. An image of the device placed in its article would also be useful. This means we'll need to decide on a standard size for the photo, and a suitable angle for the shot. I suggest square-on facing the label side with the contact edge at the bottom of the shot. I don't know what a useful image size would be, and whether the wiki software can automatically thumb-nail them for displaying in a device table.

I'm aware of copyright problems with using images from manufacturer's websites, so that means all photos should be taken by the submitter, or express written permission given by the copyright holder.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've discovered something interesting related to the SCSD vs SCSD_moon thing.  Perhaps it's been discovered before, and if so I apologize for being repetitive.  
<br/>
<br/>
In essence, I'm not sure if the issue is really with newer revisions of the Supercard or simply different types of SD cards.  My Supercard miniSD with its cheap $20 miniSD card always worked with the SCSD.dldi file previously, and pre-DLDI homebrew that accessed the filesystem did so correctly.  Last night however I got a new miniSD card to increase my storage and found that MCtool, Moonshell, and DSFTP were all unable to initiate the filesystem.  After patching with SCSD_moon.dldi, all worked fine.  
<br/>
<br/>
Previously I was under the assumption that the failure of SCSD.dldi was caused solely by new revisions in the Supercard hardware itself.  My best guess now is that it's a combination of SC revisions and SD card revisions.
<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts on this?  Obviously I'm eagar to contribute this info to the Wiki, but I don't want to post inaccurate data, and there's always the chance that this is an isolated incident that's caused by user error.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, reinserting a Supercard without having the DS reboot is a difficult task by itself.  There's a method to prevent the reboot, but it's difficult and doesn't work all the time.  
<br/>
<br/>
This may or may not be relevant, depending on my understanding of what you're saying:  I used Chishm's cart save program on both of these cards, with interesting results.  My first card worked fine with it the one time I was able to prevent a reboot when using it, and the save file was backed up correctly to the folder of my choice.  It also worked on the second card that requires SCSD_moon, but in this case the filesystem did not appear.  I could move the cursor up and down, but there was no text beside it.  I simply hit B and it successfully created the savefile on the root of my card.  I'm attempting to do it again now that I've patched the .gba file with the SCSD_moon.dldi file, but it keeps rebooting the DS on me.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  How interesting.  I managed to get it to go back in without rebooting, but this time it froze before even getting to the file browser.  I see "Press A to write save" and do so, but now thing responds.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what to make out of any of this though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wasn't sure where to ask this, so I'm reviving this topic. Do you need to request upload rights to add a new device? The reason I ask is because it recently came to my attention that the DLDI drivers listed for the Slot-1 CycloDS Evolution are actually for the Slot-2 CycloDS (Mini/Micro). I've made note of that on the <a class="postlink" href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/index.php?title=CycloDS_Evolution_%28microSD%29" target="_blank">CycloDS Evolution page</a> in the DLDIwiki, but was not sure how to add a new device to the Slot-2 section to put the CycloDS (Mini/Micro) drivers there instead. I admit, I've never added a page to a wiki before, so I'm not entirely sure how. So what exactly is involved/required? Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
