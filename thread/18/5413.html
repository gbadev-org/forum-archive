    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi im new here, im just take a long time a look at this forum.
<br/>
So i was starting to develop my own games, but i installed aroonrogers tutorial. It al works fine but my emulators don't play my .ds.gba files??
<br/>
I downloaded smantouch and i modded a sprite and compiled it. But when i use dualis or something it doesn't works.
<br/>
<br/>
And the strange thing is that every demo has a bin file and i only got .ds.gba files??????
<br/>
<br/>
I have searched for converters or something but it all doens't matters!
<br/>
<br/>
Can u people help me ???? So i can mod some demos and compile it, and then play it on my dualis of nds emulator??? Because i'll tried all emulators??
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx!!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The .gba files are to be used with a PassMe.  human_tree is correct that you should open the arm9\arm9.bin file w/ Dualis (or other emu).

<br/>
So when will the DS emulators emulate a PassMe so that developers can run the same binary on the emulator and on hardware?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dualis can open .NDS files (don't know about the other emu's), but once we get a NDS loader, then the same file will work w/passme and w/ the emulator. ndstool can already create NDS files from an arm7 bin, an arm9 bin, and a directory structure</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
