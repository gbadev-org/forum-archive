    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I'm working with PA_Lib right now and just manipulating various examples for learning purposes. I am looking at the third platformer example, and I'm trying to get Y scrolling. However when I attempt to, the sprite gets all jumpy, the X and Y are in the negatives. Anyone who looked at this example, can you please help me out? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When X and Y go negative, you need to watch out whether bits get overwritten. See the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=418" target="_blank">GBA beginners' FAQ</a> "Q: Why do my sprites become corrupt when I move them off the top or the left side of the screen?"<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm I Don't think I worded it in the best way possible, because I was in a hurry. The sprite isnt jumbled, it just falls off the bottom of the screen, comes back from the top, and lands on nothingness. HOWEVER! The collision is still there as if the level were invisible! What the doodle is going on?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
