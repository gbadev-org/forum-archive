A decent source-level debugger.

It seems that for serious NDS homebrew coding, no$gba-debug is the way to go (seems an incredible value at 15 $!).
<br/>
<br/>
Does it support source-level debugging? I haven't yet tried any of the other emus (just the free no$), do the veterans have any other recommendations?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

guess what? no$ is from germany! (just goofing around) ;^p

that said, i have read that some (other) emulator (dsemume? ideas?) supports (srclvl?) debugging, but i haven't done any serious nds debugging myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

umm, okay, so what benefit does the $15 version offer? Sorry for asking all this in the forum when I could presumably find out in other ways...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It offers asm level stepping, full register and machine state inspection, and a really good debugger (with breakpoints on memory/registers read/write, etc...).
<br/>
<br/>
For $15 it's a pretty good deal, I've bought it myself and I'm really satisfied. You can learn more <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gba-dev.htm" target="_blank">here</a>, and read the compulsory comparison table between versions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, I see.
<br/>
I guess the two features I was looking for will set me back $750 each. Not an option right now, since I'm just doing homebrew for now. I will definitely get the $15 version though.
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, which (are there several?) of the open-source ds emus show the most promise and would benefit most from a motivated developer who would like to add the functionality himself?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/desmume" target="_blank">Desmume</a> supports full source level debugging of both the ARM9 and the ARM7 via a GDB stub (I was the person who put it in there but I have not done any work on Desmume for a long time so I do not know what its current state - I use version 0.7.2 for my development) so it can talk to any debugger that support GDB's remote debugging. It supports most of GDB features (breakpoints, watchpoint and the like).
<br/>
<br/>
I think the Desmume is the only open source NDS emulator so that would be your choice if you fancy helping with its development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
