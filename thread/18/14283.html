Of course, this can't with any certainty be generalized to the homebrew users out there, since there can be other factors playing in (Colors! not working on some card, Colors! being non-proportionally popular/unpopular in some region).

One thing I'm curious about. I've got a DS Xtreme, which for most homebrew apps manages to autopatch the DLDI driver during load. However, when it does that, the game in use never realizes I'm using it DS-X. It seems to think I've got whatever driver was originally in the app.
<br/>
<br/>
Do other cards have any similar behavior? I wonder how stuff like that effects the stats.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By the way, the R4TF tag includes both R4 Revolution and M3 Simply since they use the same DLDI driver.

<br/>
From testing a little more, the DSX seems to autopatch if there's already a DLDI driver included in the ROM, however, if the app reports what device its using, it seems to report the info from the original DLDI driver.
<br/>
<br/>
I see two possibilities: a) the DSX patches the code, but doesn't overwrite the section of the DLDI driver containing the identification string. b) the DSX patches in RAM, but most homebrew does the id by reading the DLDI info off the storage device rather than from RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
The DSX autopatching seems to fail if the app was distributed without any DLDI driver in the .nds file, requiring the user to manually patch.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if cards other than the DSX do things similarly. But there's definitely potential for stat errors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Really? So that also means that the non-patched Colors! I use in releases doesn't work on DSX without manual patching? I hate stuff like that. Would it be better to have releases patched to something different then? By the way, what is the Flashcard ID for DSX?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Jesse on Mon Oct 08, 2007 6:20 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well... I'm still using a SC CF. Though I got a DS Lite in the meantime and it sticks out pretty far, I'm still using it. I got it at a time, when it was, next to the GBAMP, pretty much the only solution with FAT-Write support (and mainly I bought it for ScummVM at the time and I wanted to play DOTT with speech). 
<br/>
It's still a sturdy design imho, since I never had any real problems running  different homebrew programs on it... also it has built in RAM, so it's still pretty much useful for DSlinux.
<br/>
<br/>
So, as long as it doesn't stop working,  I don't see many reasons to abandon my beloved Supercard CF at the moment :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
