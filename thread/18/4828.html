<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if in the near future, nintendo would possibly make certain games of it's cartridges access the bios and change certain things.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance maybe, able to get pictochat work on wifi instead of Nifi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry about the my misconception, but I just wanted to know if DS cartridges have access to DS bios to modify it, that is all.

Pictochat 2.0 on a cart? I doubt it, not a valid strategy for nintendo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, they are already coming out with a new "improved" chat program on a DS cart that has more features than Pictochat, but unfortunately it still uses the NiFi protocols.  Someone needs to build a REAL DS cart that has an included TCP/IP stack on it that can link to APs for real-time internet chat/play.  I know, I know, this has all been said before.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On its own I agree there's not much going for Pictochat 2.0 on a cart. But a full internet suite would make sense.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously a browser, not just 'cause you want a browser but you'll need it for authenticating to wireless hotspots. Opera runs pretty well on my phone, and that's ARM9 ~66Mhz.
<br/>
<br/>
Then you add in Pictochat 2.0. Better would be a normal IM client, something Jabber-like that's cross-platform would be best.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe an email client, but with webmail systems this might not be a necccesity. If Nintendo need to tick the email feature on the box they could always offer their own webmail service, wouldn't cost them much 'cause everyone would just use their own webmail accounts anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Then there's the mic. Or more likley the headset accessory with both mic and headphones. Anyway you shove a VoIP client on the thing and see what Nokia thinks about all the kids getting free voice calls without the need for a phone.
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to push the boat out you could make a system where you can download content to your GBA media player. Not only MP3s and movies but downloadable games too. Remember those Nintendo VIP stars you get everytime you buy a game? The ones that let you download hugely exciting things like wallpaper for your PC? Well if they earned you downloadable games and music... it might actually be worth it!
<br/>
<br/>
So if Nintendo offer that for US$29.99, I'll import it on the day of release :)<br/>_________________<br/>---

Indeed that would be awesome, especially if they add an SD card reader that plugs into the GBA slot. Lack of save memory is one of the main problems I see with the DS, especially as a creative tool. Sad that the PSP uses memory cards when it's pretty much strictly a gaming system, and the DS is stuck with on-cart saves when removable memory would allow a whole new world of applications.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

a few months before the DS was launched i was thinking about a sort of "port" of trillian using AIM, ICQ, MSN and Yahoo that ran on the DS. i had worked out what buttons did what and how the interface would look too :-P any way, that was some months ago now and just remains a dream for now</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm a programmer at the company I work for, and I've already pitched the idea of a DS "Gateway" website that would allow people to instant message with any DS that was connected.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there's still a ton of work that has to be done before that's possible (there's a reason I watch these boards), and there will probably be the requirement of special hardware. However, I've already started writing the server-side software for taking the text messages and converting them into the picture format we've seen from pictochat captures.
<br/>
<br/>
If we ever get it together, I'll let you know, and the company I work for believes in open source, so all the server side of things will probably be made available.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That would be great. Imagine you could store downloadable content, like Video, Audio and Downloadable Games/Demos, on such a device.
<br/>
There are many things you could do with the GBA slot. Nintendo could make a Graphic Chip or RAM extension to boost their DS games. Just like they did on the N64 with the RAM pack. Since it's connected with a 16bit bus this would be possible for sure.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have had in my mind recently the idea of streaming video over wi-fi.  Imagine having a media player that will play all popular formats (any AVI you have a codec installed for, MPEG, RM, QT/MOV) and would have the option (if your computer was fast enough) to dynamically re-compress the video into a more DS-friendly format and send it over a wireless connection.  In your DS you'd have a cart with the software to connect and supply the codec needed for playback.  Maybe even allow it to communicate with the computer and use buttons/touchscreen to control which file is playing.  I think this would be nifty, though not likely to ever happen as it would appeal to only a small group, 'cause who'd want to watch video on their DS 30 feet from their computer playing the video at a much higher resolution with better sound?  ME THAT'S WHO!

Or simply a PC wireless unit that can send/receive NiFi signals? It could use RSA encryption on the binary stored on a PC to keep people like us out of it so Nintendo has some sense of security and might actually release the thing...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
