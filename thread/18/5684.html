    <h4>#42371 - BMcC - Tue May 10, 2005 6:49 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You <a class="postlink" href="http://www.planetgamecube.com/news.cfm?action=item&amp;id=6231" target="_blank">may have already heard</a>, but Nintendo is partnering with GameSpy to bring the NDS online, for free, through WiFi hotspots and 'home broadband WiFi connections'.
<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean for DS homebrew?  Does this open the window for online DS games, if not through GameSpy, through some independent network?
<br/>
<br/>
And what about communicating with an unmodified DS through WiFi?  Perhaps GameSpy's service could be hacked/dissected to make this possible?
<br/>
<br/>
My head's spinning, someone please fill me in on what all this means.<br/>_________________<br/>&lt;3,

Oh.  I just assumed there was some kind of protection against <span style="font-style: italic">anything </span>communicating with the DS.  Some kind of signature or something.

That's what I mean.  With DS and (presumably) PC software coming out for handling online DS games, I figured we'd have better resources to work with, but I guess it won't make a considerable difference after all.  :^(<br/>_________________<br/>&lt;3,

Nope, no sarcasm.  I sincerely hope that the release date does not get pushed back, and I'm pretty sure that what I heard about AC being DS's first online game came from a reputable source, maybe even a Nintendo interview or something like that.  I'm not 100%, but pretty sure of it.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'd REALLY like to see is Nintendo's game list show accurate release dates for their games.  I mean, they had Need for Speed as being an April release, now it says May, now who knows if it's really going to be out this month or not??
<br/>
<br/>
And a game I wish they had waited until online support was available is Jam with the Band.  That game looks like it's going to be frickin' great!  But online?  Dang that would be awesome.  I mean, a real step in the right direction.  Too bad Nintendo has a way of having great ideas but not implementing them properly.  Virtualboy and broadband for GC are two great examples.  I'll shut up now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The president of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata personally made the announcement that AC was going to be online. It is certainly not a rumor.

Er, might want to head out to your local game store, this game is already out. It might take some time for it to ship to your store, but the game has definitely already been released.

No, actually, I imagine it would be terrible online. If there was ever a recipe for a cold and boring online game, it is Jam with the Band. You need to have the other people with you to actually enjoy it, not to mention any latency would make the game very hard to play.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

2) I live in SnoresVille, Nowhere.  Games usually have to be out for a week before you'll start to see them in stores, and even then I'm too broke to tempt myself looking at shiney new games... 'cause I'll buy them... but it's good to know it's out now.  Still... look at Nintendo's site.  It won't list a release date for the game, just that it will be (or in this case... is) out this month.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Fair enough.  I believe I would enjoy it anyways.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In a music game, latency only hurts if you're trying to send keysound timing data over the network. <a class="postlink" href="http://tonyville.f2o.org/?p=167" target="_blank">StepMania Online</a> works over the Internet, and latency doesn't hurt it as much because you don't have to hear other players' keysounds. (Actually, StepMania Online simulates DDR, which doesn't have any keysounds, making the network code even easier, but in the general case, you can just render the keysounds assuming perfect play for all parts but yours.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
