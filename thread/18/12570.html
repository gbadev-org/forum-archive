<br/>
Is there a Chance to get run libfat for this card (to write a io-driver for it). A readonly driver would be useful too if there is no chance for write support.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure Date has not developed this card itself, it is maybe the same like any known card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What should actually happen, is that due to the way datel, and most other third parties design their devices, You will get the same megabyte repeated over the entire dump, save for the first megabyte.   So,  what you do, is you dump the card, you chop off the first megabyte, and you chop off the remaining 14,  and you will have a complete dump of the firmware and all.

Also, chishm has a full rom dumper that will work for actually dumping the firmware of the game and music card, if he gets one on hand.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Uh oh.. Damon.. I don't think you know what you have gotten yourself into yet.. :)

But, it's like the boy who cried wolf.  It's not that we don't want to believe you, but Datel doesn't have a good track record for homebrew compatibility.  We aren't saying you don't try.. Maybe just not hard enough?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to see good homebrew compatiblity as I think Datel has the ability to make it into large retailers giving homebrew the ability to reach a larger market that it might not otherwise have access to.  But, it's all on Datel to allow the homebrew community that kind of access to it's hardware.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now of course, when someone asks what device they should get for homebrew we have to say "not Datel" and suggest something like Supercard or M3, who both distribute software for piracy on their website.
<br/>
<br/>
If the next Datel DS product were to focus on all homebrew compatibility, not just moonshell, and maybe also describe the concept of homebrew and some popular pieces of software on the box, this new device would be praised to the heavens ;)

The Games N Music could have been a great homebrew device if they would have just engineered it to be compatible, or allowed someone to make a DLDI driver for it.  At that point, it will not be any worse of a choice than any other DLDI supported device.  That is, if the DLDI driver works as expected.
<br/>
<br/>
Saying "BUY THIS, it's for homebrew" won't sell product.  But, "BUY THIS, it plays music and movies" has a better shot.  But, why not "BUY THIS, it plays music and movies.. oh.. and a hole crap load of free games  you can download off the internet" would be even better.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When they ran the "Make a Game" compo, a while back, all winners got their games included in the "Games 'n' Music" package.
<br/>
Unfortunately, they were dumped in a zip file on the included CD, instead of being pre-installed on the cart.  If they were pre-installed, then people would've instantly figured out the whole Homebrew concept.  Instead, it's left up to people to figure out themselves, which I think is a terrible shame.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, whilst we're on the subject, it really wouldn't hurt to have a better menu system than the basic icons thing.  Or if you're determined to stick with the icons, then at least have "Extra Info" pop up on the topscreen when an icon is clicked.  Maybe let us design little Amiga style .info files with our homebrew, or something like that.
<br/>
Maybe have a Homebrew Catalogue on the Datel site.  One that gets frequently updated.  And maybe a little bit of software, PC side, that can quietly sit in the background downloading new games/updates and then easily transfer them over to the cart when you want to play them.  All neatly catagorised, and all that.   That'd be nice.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm just fussing for the heck of it.  Quite frankly, the fact that I can nip into a store, buy a cart, and shove my games on it.. It's exactly the type of product we need. And it's more than enough for me.  Just gotta get the DLDI going, and I'll be happy.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for why they went on a disc... this was due to some shops not wanting this game or that and it being easier to master a disc than keep reprogramming cards for people.

Also made it a little easier when we had to recall the product as one of the games was not for the correct age group the product was set at.

Giving us the ability to make drivers so we can save in homebrew would be nice, but its not something they <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> to do. They arnt evil or nasty for not doing it.

Luckily, I had bought a GBA MP v2 CF right after I got my DS, but after finding the video quality to be poor and having to convert to .gba/.gbm and stuff, it gathered some dust.  I pulled it out, flashed it with Chism's utility, and I'm now using it for my filesystem.  It works, booting the .nds from the GnM's microSD, then accessing files from the CF, but it would be a lot easier if the GnM would just have its own filesystem.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll email Datel, even if it doesn't help, it will at least show them we want DLDI for the GnM.
<br/>

Also, should DLDI become available on the GnM, will apps such as DSLinux be able to mount both the microSD AND the CF (such as /gbamp and /gnm or w/e?)  Or is this a question for the DSLinux devs?<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Yes it would be possible. One exists for the GBAMP CF, but 1. it's only for GBAMP and not any other card, 2. it erases the entire CF card, 3. it's a ds.gba so you'll need a second SLOT-2 card to get it to work, and 4. it's primarily discussed on sites that cannot be linked from this domain.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It reveals nothing in particular. There are only so many ways of implementing a CF interface and it's hardly surprising that similarities can be found. In all honesty I'd be more shocked if there weren't.
<br/>

Unfortunately Datel chose to take the cheap option and have a bare CF interface rather than providing on board ROM. It's a valid choice but does require a slot 1 boot device.

Datel's "crap" is more available to the average consumer than devices  made by other manufacturers. Not all homebrewers have access to PayPal, credit cards or other means to enable online shopping.

More could be done to allow their devices to be more useful to homebrewers but the fact remains that the MMD &amp; Games n Music devices have done more to legitimise homebrew than any other product on the market.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Exactly. If the GnM-cards become wide-spread, DLDI-dependence will limit your user-group. Sure, stuff like Moonshell and so on will depend on this due to it's nature, but for small games among other things it's convenience might not be worth it. On GBA a lot of developers made multiboot-applications since the size-restriction made the cheaper to run (no need for a flash-cart). This might be feasible for NDS, since the size-limit is bumped quite a bit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Might be true. I haven't tested anything else than GBA-functionality, since that's what I needed it for. But I doubt that it should be too troublesome to set it up to work from Slot-1 devices, at least if the symbol where the data resides is known.

    <h4>#131862 - DragonMinded - Wed Jun 20, 2007 8:23 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DLDI is not a dependency, it is a tool that allows more freedom.  Before FAT support, you had to hope appended filesystems worked with your cart, which for me it didn't (GBAMP).  On top of that, the only thing embedded filesystems are useful for are small games and internet-only applications.  Anything large scale that doesn't want to overwrite the SRAM contents needs a FAT driver.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not just talking about DSOrganize, which wouldn't be a possibility without FAT support, nor am I moonshell, which seems to mysteriously get FAT drivers for un-hacked devices, but for ANY application or game out there that wants to have user customizable settings, data over 4 MB minus the size of the executable, or any application that expects to deal with external files such as emulators, music/video players/editors, picture editors/viewers, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
So when you say we should go away from DLDI dependency, that's like telling a windows or linux programmer that they can't read data files from the disc or save to the hard drive and that their software should be completely live off of the CD.  If the GnM device is to be any good for developers at all, it NEEDS to have DLDI support for it.  I only hope Datel gives a shit.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

I guess for example you could make your game such that if you don't have FS support, then it can only play a single level, without background music. But this is a lot of extra work on the programmer's side, just to support a device they probably don't even own, from a homebrew-unfriendly manufacturer. This is probably why there wont be a lot of support for this idea.

Seeing that the Slot 2 part of the MMD is much like the GBAMP CF (from what I've heard) could you put this bootme.nds and use it to access the files off the GBAMP?  This could mean using Datel's interface with the GBAMP instead of having to use Moonshell or DSOrganize...but I guess those apps have better interfaces anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
They need to release a firmware update for the GnM...that way it could be reverse-engineered, so hopefully there's enough wrong with the GnM's 1.22 firmware that they'll make an update.
<br/>
<br/>
I just installed PAlib on my VC++ 2005 Express...I've started some simple demos that may turn into simple games, but I test them on my GBAMP...I could test them in the GnM but they'd most likely work since my demos don't use DLDI or libfat or any filesystem access.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

The latter is closely guarded information because the same code that can dump the GnM firmware can also be used to dump Game Cards and distribute copies illegally over the Internet. People who know how to do this are either homebrewers who are vehemently anti-piracy, or they are pirates who don't want members of other release groups to get their hands on their private tools.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This is the reason that the GnM needs a DLDI...if it were supported, a lot of people would buy it (after seeing videos online, news, forums, etc) for the movies and music (Moonshell is better than the built in system...) and apps like DS Organize.  A few of them would even look into programming with it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Transformers was great, and I kinda needed a night out of the house, away from the PC and DS, to get myself motivated. I've got all of next week off, so hopefully I can write something then. I've got 4 other projects to work on too, so don't expect anything immediately.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

<br/>
<br/>
The DLDI is done, it supports reading and writing to the microSD card in a GnM. This version doesn't initialise the card, so the process you use to boot any application has to include running the GnM menu at least once. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to thank Tepples for supplying a firmware dump, and also HonkeyKong, BigRedPimp and everyone else who helped test it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The source is available to anyone who wants to give optimising it a try. It communicates with the SD card using SPI (one serial line for both commands and data) so it's going to be slower than cards that use the SD 4 wire bus. It's already running the SPI port at 4MHz, which is as fast as it'll go. You could try moving the openSpi() and closeSpi() calls to the startup() and shutdown functions, and use multi-block reads for a speed boost.
<br/>
<br/>
DSOrganize not starting up properly is more likely related to the way the GnM boots the NDS file. What happens when you launch it from the GnM but have it read from a SLOT-2 card instead?

The sad thing is the open-source Moonshell kills the Datel developed mp3 player in the firmware...The Datel one must run the music at 400% volume with no way to change it (and I do admit, the DS volume is horribly low) but amplifying the music in software distorts it beyond any level of bad.  Now I don't have to worry, just use Moonshell and it sounds great.  I was a bit worried when I bought my GnM and played mp3's on it, only to hear that painful noise, I thought the DS had a poor audio chip or something, but it's just the software.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to push the speed much further. It's already running the SPI port at 4MHz. The latest test version is using multiblock reads and keeps the SD port open between operations. There is a limit to the speed that it can read using SPI, and it's almost at that limit.

this isn't true. compile moonshell in a correct manner and it will start any nds.

<br/>
<br/>
the problem is, moonshell is working with old gba_nds_fat. so you have to use io_dldi.s for DLDI support. but it uses an old toolkit which cannot link eabi object files and cannot compile this io_dldi.s from Chishm.

It would require considerable hacking (probably) to figure out how to write to the onboard memory, if it can even be written to.  The default firmware has an OK file browser (though it'd be nice if the buttons were able to select, as touch detection isn't always the best) and the default apps for video and music playback are pure junk, with horrible quality.  I use MoonShell for mp3's because it actually sounds good.

If a firmware hack had a better media player and a DSOrganize-compatible boot loader, then it'd be great.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had wanted a homebrew device for a long time.  Even though I had a GBAMP CF, I had no way of booting DS from it.  When I saw the Games n' Music at Bestbuy (I was there to buy Wii Play/Wiimote package for my new Wii), I decided to pick one up and try out homebrew.  At the time I had not heard of a DLDI or any such stuff, though I did patch my GBAMP with Chism's package (though it did nothing without a pass device).  Only after I had it open did I realize the problem with DLDI, and resorted to my GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that it has a DLDI, I'd recommend buying a GnM if you want homebrew without having to go through online purchases, shipping costs, shipping time, the post office, out-of-country suppliers, etc.  I'm sure a device like an M3 Simply or R4DS would make a much better alternative, but the GnM is in your local US and UK retailers (well, it's in my local US retailers but Datel appears to be centered in the UK).
<br/>
<br/>
The other good thing about the GnM is it is a complete package.  You get the cartridge, a 128MB microSD to start you off (I'm looking into maybe buying a larger one when I get the money), and a microSD reader for the PC.  You also get some games, most of which are simple, to demonstrate the functionality of homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Datel are the laziest bunch of coders in existance.  They once made the Amiga's Action Replay.  remember how cool that was?
<br/>
Nowadays we get dodgy carts, and a severe lack of support.
<br/>
<br/>
BUT..  This cart is available in a store near you, as long as you're near a store that has it.
<br/>
And if everyone can head into a shop, buy a cart, wrap their head around "DLDI", then we're sorted.
<br/>
We can finally bring homebrew to the masses.
<br/>
It's 100% do-able.
<br/>
Heck, my Stringy Things is already ON the cart when they buy it!    (Note : Might be on the CD, not actually on the cart!)
<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, the most important thing.
<br/>
People who buy this cart will not be using it for pirating games.  You can't shove a pirated rom on here.   It ain't gonna happen.
<br/>
If Nintendo see this selling by the bucketload, maybe they'll finally realise there's a market for homebrew.

I'm not entirely sure what exactly they're doing, but it involves using the R4 "firmware" (that's what he said, though I'm guessing you just need the Moonshell file from it), patched with the GnM DLDI file, which somehow makes videos not lag anymore.  Could this be due to the fact that the R4 firmware uses Moonshell 1.6, and that 1.71 implemented new techniques for speeding up videos that may screw up with the GnM DLDI file?

Heh.. this is funny..  How many other commercial devices are out there that are "made" for homebrewing?  Or even mention homebrew in the product information?  What's that? NONE you say?

<br/>
Does Datel suck?  Yes! Do they have crappy support? YES!  Does most of their hardware suck? YES. Have you compared it to other companies?  Most of them suck.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is why I BOUGHT ONE!
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
 - A lot of devices require RE to make them "homebrew" friendly.
<br/>
 - They have the ability to get into your local chain store (What other brand homebrew device can you buy there?)
<br/>
 - It's $30 with EVERYTHING you need to run homebrew.  Nothing else to buy!  Not even a MicroSD card.
<br/>
 - Did I mention you can walk out of the store and instantly play homebrew?
<br/>
 - You don't have to be 18+ or have access to a CC to buy one.
<br/>
 - You don't have to worry about getting your info stolen over the internet to get one.
<br/>
 - It's sitting on the shelf right now! No shipping time.
<br/>
 - At least they tried to represent Homebrew in a good manner.  And now that it has DLDI support, be prepaired to welcome a lot more homebrewers.  Who knows, the next great homebrew dever could come because they bought this device.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Overall, Datel tried to do what others didn't.  They tried to market a device (actually, a bunch of devices) to bring homebrew to the masses without giving ROM pirates a chance to run their ROMS.  The GnM is overall a good device, much like many other devices.  The lack of DLDI was its only problem, and that has been solved, unfortunately not by the programmers at Datel.  The hardware is pretty good, it doesn't have RAM, but it's not any worse than any other plain Slot-1 microSD, well, the SD reader is a bit slow but that only affects movie playback.

<br/>
The only complaint I have is about the loader, DSOrganize only works with bootme.nds fix, but without an internal loader, you can't boot anything from DSO...and if DSO bypasses the main menu, you'll never be able to run anything but DSO.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

The DLDI support is what?  6 days old.  Sorry we don't have the pefect solution for you in  that time.. ;)  In other words, give it time.  Like DrangonMinded said, if someone can supply him with a card, he will make it work with DSO.  MoonShell gives and "Unsupported Adapter" error.. which kinda defeats the purpose of DLDI, doesn't it?  Then you'll have to come up with a different excuse to spend $45+ over $30 for your "homebrew" device.
<br/>
<br/>
The GnM launcher super blows, but the bootme.nds works fine.. so we just need a new loader that does a better job of prepearing the DS registers and we'll be set.  Just like the GBA MP needed.

That's like avoiding buying blank cds and dvds so as not to support music/video piracy.  The RIAA/MPAA would love for you to believe that's a legitimate strategy, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with manufacturing and supplying blank media.  At the end of the day, it's entirely up to the individual to decide if and how they're going to use it, not the supplier.
<br/>
<br/>
Buy the best quality you can afford, for however you define "afford", and make your own judgement how to use it.  Don't get suckered into buying a sub-par product from a company who won't even invest in the science to make it work properly solely because "it can't be used for warezing".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, in that example, it would be purchasing a DVD-RW drive that did direct copies of a DVD instead of one that only allowed you to write your own video/data to it.  And then paying 50% more, so that you could make direct copies of DVDs.  In both cases, the drives have the potential of writing non-copy protected video/data, but you choose the purchase the more expensive one.. Hmmm...

Tell you the truth, that is an excellent reason to purchase the product.  Maybe if people supported non-warez related companies, there might be more?

Let me know if I overlooked something..  
<br/>
<br/>
Copied qlshell directory to SD card
<br/>
Copied, patched, and renamed dschannel.nds to bootme.nds in the root of the SD card.
<br/>
Copied GMTF.dldi and GMTF2.dldi to \qlshell\dldi
<br/>
<br/>
It booted up fine.  But, all the icons on the bottom screen say "FIXME" and when I select one, I receive the following error on the top screen:
<br/>
<br/>
Unable to find fat0:/qlshell/drivers/GMTF.dldi
<br/>
<br/>
So, I created a drivers directory and put the GMTF.dldi file in it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, it boots, again, all the icons say "FIXME" but it actually launched some homebrew.. of course, they were the ones that came with the GnM, because I can't tell what I'm picking to choose moonshell or DSO, or any other additional homebrew I put on there..
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to know what the Icons are?  It seems to be random, as the first icon has been different just by restarting.  I'll keep playing with it and see if I can get anything new to launch from dschannels and post what I end up with.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Hmm..  actually seems like it might be worse.  Some of the homebrew I was able to launch before don't seem to want to launch from dschannels.

That might work if their "non-warez" schtick was based on, say, limited fixed storage, so you don't have enough space on the device for a typical commercial rom image (or, only enough space for a single commercial rom image, so you can't use your one cart to carry around 5 or 6 or more warezed games).  
<br/>
<br/>
But as long as their "non-warez" schtick is largely based around "we can't be arsed doing the research to make it work right, and we can't be arsed providing open firmware/drivers for the very community who we're marketing this to, and because of these limitations, you accidentally can't use it for warez any more easily than you can for homebrew" (which as far as I can tell is what Datel are all about), the only message you're gonna send to the market by supporting them is "don't spend so much time and effort on R&amp;D because we don't wanna pay for it".  And if you succeed in doing that, those companies out there who <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> currently producing blank cartridges that are as close to possible to the real thing, and are actively pursuing the research to continuously improve upon them, are going to learn very quickly (because these are bright chaps we're talking about) that the way to make a buck is to do a half-arsed job and flog it as "anti-warez".  At which point the entire community loses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Don't support non-warezing companies, because they don't do the work to make their hardware run warez..  Make sure you support the companies that make good hardware (aka, that run warez) because they might realize that they can make more money if they skimp on research and don't support warez either..
<br/>
<br/>
Uhh.. Yeah.. Right!  These other companies exist for that reason alone!  They will ALWAYS take the time to R&amp;D to the point that their hardware will run warez because that is where the money is.  So, stop losing sleep worrying that one day you will wake up and not be able to run your warez.  It's not going to happen.  If you have followed any of these topics, you'd know that without warez, there would be like 5 people able to run homebrew.  But, keep in mind that these companies will NEVER make it into huge chain retailers.

<br/>
As for providing a "homebrew only" device that is super small.. that just makes NO SENSE at all...  Homebrewers don't want to listen to MP3s, watch videos, etc?  Or, is it because I have a 2GB SD card in my R4DS, it MUST be loaded full of warez?  Also, just because it can only hold one commercial ROM doesn't make it for homebrew, it's made to sell fakes of commercial games.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He asked if I could provide him with some apps today, so he came over and I copied the contents of my microSD (the one that came with the GnM, 128MB) to his 1GB card.  I've patched everything with the newer version of the DLDI, with improved speed.  When we tried to start up MoonShell on his black DS Lite (My DS is an original, FW 1, release week silver DS, I think he got his DS Lite for Christmas last year), it stopped at the loading screen.  nesDS was able to view folders and contents of folders, but crashed on reading the files.  Same with SNEmulDS and LMP (iPod clone).  He then handed over his 128MB card that came with his GnM, and I put the files on it, and it worked perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
Later, we tried the first version of the DLDI, and for some reason or another, it worked great.  The same exact applications, just repatched them with the first version of the DLDI, and it worked.
<br/>
<br/>
Any reason why this may be?<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

AFAIK the internal tech was just shifted about, there's no reason for the slot/memory connections to have altered.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry for my question, I didn't read rules, but now that I have, and also that you mention the official demos, I bought the wireless card long time ago (check when I subscribe to this forum) to upload demos to my ds directly, but then loss the track of them, any info about the newest demos including like the demo of Zelda, for that demo I bought the games n' music.
<br/>
<br/>
Still I will buy the Zelda game when is release on the US, even more for the rumor about a zelda stylus via nintendo web page.
<br/>
<br/>
Any info and tutorial would be apreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can't play ROMS though, not only because they're illegal and we hate pirates here, but because all official ROMS are greater than 4MB in size, meaning they won't run on a device that can't overcome that limit.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Just popping in to say a big thanks again to Chishm.  New Stringy Things with (finally!) Saved Hiscores will be released soon.  Already got a couple of new games in there, and I'm sure I can come up with a couple more!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://AGameAWeek.com" target="_blank">A Game A Week.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
