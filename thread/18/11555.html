    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello guys! i have a very BIG problem
<br/>
<br/>
in italy there is an ISP (fastweb) that provides PRIVATE ip behind a NAT ip shared between a lot of users.
<br/>
<br/>
so two or more from this isp, cannot play through nintendo's wfc. but there is a "partial" solution: open multiple ftp connection to gain a temporaly public ip with a specific port.
<br/>
<br/>
but i need to know what port the nintendo wfc uses.. do you know what is the port?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
another idea that i got is to create a server/program that runs on a pc and is able to get the normal ds' wifi (not wfc, but wifi between ds devices) and redirect it over tcp/ip to another pc with the same program. so there is a nice schema:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DS server &lt;---&gt; PC1 &lt;---&gt; TCP/IP &lt;---&gt; PC2 &lt;---&gt; DS client
<br/>
<br/>
this would be very nice.. but i think impossible to do :\ what do you think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, that isn't a working product, so probably not.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about this FTP business, but have you looked into SSH tunnels or some form of proxy?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I can figure, I think you are asking for what is known as a 'VPN'. That would probably solve your problem, but I don't know of any that are easy to set up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dstunnel will probably solve my problems but isn't done :\ i'll try to contact the developer.
<br/>
<br/>
i'll look for ssh tunnelling and proxy but i don't think that this would help me (they wouldn't create programs like mozzarella/pomodoro if a proxy would fix this problem..)
<br/>
<br/>
what about vpn? ok i'll tell you :) my fucking ISP doens't provide free VPN service. it is locked :\

<br/>
sorry for bad english</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
