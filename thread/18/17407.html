<br/>
<br/>
I have recently digged up an old project of mine and updated it to make it build with the latest version of the toolchain.
<br/>
<br/>
In doing so, I discovered that libfat seems to have become broken at some point on Supercard SD Slot-2 flashcard: in fact, fatInitDefault() always returns 0, even after patching the .nds with the right scsd.dldi patch.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also an old Moonshell-specific dldi patch for the Supercard SD and I tried that too: using it, fatInitDefault() returns 1, but then any read from any file on the SD yields nonsense.
<br/>
<br/>
libfat used to work perfectly on Supercard SD when the .nds file was dldi patched, at least until r20 from what I remember.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a known issue of libfat?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
