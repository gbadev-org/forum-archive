    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using libnds for my compilation for the DS. I have managed to get the mainscreen to work using the framebuffer mode and have been doing various tests and things for a basic paint application. I wanted to set up a second framebuffer mode on the second (sub) screen to draw things like my current palette info and such. (Framebuffer mode-like so I can have more that 256 colors if I really need them.) 
<br/>
<br/>
For some strange reason, whenever I try to draw to the rotation background (which all tutorials and such say is basically a framebuffer with the rotation/scaling controls) I get nothing. Diddly squat. Poo.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how reliable my sources are, so I am asking for two things. I was always under the impression that a Rot/Scale background was in tiled mode, from my days in GBA dev. Is this still true, or is it really set up as a framebuffer mode now?
<br/>
<br/>
If this is the case, can someone show me some basic code (using libnds) to enable the subscreen with BG2 set as a rotation background and mapped to VRAM bank C? Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I have code to so this already, it's just not working, so I need to see where I screwed up. Yes, I set the scale settings to 1&lt;&lt;8 so the background would actually show. Yes, I am testing on real hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can offer, this problem is particularly annoying. I can't post any code right now because I am in a library, but I will try to post my attempt at a later date. (Prolly monday.)
<br/>
<br/>
Once again, thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are all your RGB15 writes (as if it were framebuffer mode) also ORed with BIT(15)?
<br/>
If you don't set the first bit (which can be done by ORing with BIT(15)), nothing will show up (a transparent pixel in the BG).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
