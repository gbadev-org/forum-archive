    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think Nintendo should capitalize on the "Developer's System" concept and open up to homebrewers. Perhaps with an official website where coders can show their work and get tips on how to improve it or execute it better. Maybe they could even offer a publishing contract once in a while! I think this could be a new way to "create" gamers the way playstation did. If Nintendo were to apply this to all their consoles, how would that affect their third party support? Would they lose contracts with Ubi Soft etc. because of this? Or would they gain an edge by earning the support and loyalty of up-and-coming game developers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not a smart recruiting policy by nintendo, as those types of developers have a straight line to the xbox.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The official line from the <a class="postlink" href="http://warioworld.com/apply/gcn.html" target="_blank">GCN application page</a> used to mention DirectX and OpenGL by name as examples of graphics APIs, but now it appears to have been changed to something more generic:

<br/>
Still, for somebody who's never managed to become licensed on a console before, then the only relevant experience on "other video game or computer systems" would probably be working with PC APIs such as DirectX or OpenGL+SDL. DirectX experience translates directly to the Xbox, while OpenGL experience translates to the PSP.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dunno, it seems to me that from a developers point of view, starting out for PC is a cheap effective way to build a folio, then move onto working on something half decent then get a licence etc. You have to remember that when we say Nintendo doesn't want you to have a license unless you are proven that it isn't you bieng discriminated against, it's the reason why there arent as many shitball games on the GameCube as there on the PS2 and XBox.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
