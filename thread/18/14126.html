    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I use libfat/DLDI for file IO on the DS. It works like a charm on the card, but testing on emulator, such as no$gba, is not possible anymore. That's a major problem for me, because it dramatically increases the turnaround times.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anybody has figured out how to workaround this problem already. Maybe we should kindly ask the emulator developers to implement some sort of libfat/DLDI emulation layer in case there is no other solution.<br/>_________________<br/>Kind Regards,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tested DSFile on Desmume, because it emulates a GBAMP, though only one folder is accessible, but it allows you to read, delete, copy, paste (though no effect, since same folder), etc.  GBAMP doesn't require patching either, but you can't test slot-1 specific things on it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no$gba works with fcsr.dldi with a special fat12 image appended to the end of  a .ds.gba file
<br/>
<br/>
desmume can use gbamp dldi for some things, better compatibility is to build a fat12 image and start desmume --cflash=fat12.img
<br/>
<br/>
ideas supports r4dldi and loads from same location as .nds file(now also emulates supercard 32mb extra RAM)
