And where can I find some info about how this thing works? I've found a demo, but it is seems completely ansolvable to me. How come child and parent part are the same, except of the connection type? What is AID? Where is shared data located? It's so different from what I've done before, that I can't just start anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
