<br/>
Yes, I am completely new to the concept of developing for handheld game consoles whos creators foolishly do not happily support independent game developement.
<br/>

Data to DS:

<br/>
I see a cable going straight into the DS card slot. Presumably, there is a way to transfer data straight to that slot which confuses me to no end about the PassMe, etc.
<br/>
Um... What is that cable, how do I do that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Software development: 
<br/>
So how exactly do I develop for the DS? 
<br/>
I know how to program, don't worry :) 
<br/>
I hear talk of Linux, I've checked out DSLinux.org and now am (Surprise!!!) confused. Does the DS natively support any program compiled for Linux?! Or does it take only a particular thing that <span style="font-style: italic">has</span> to be made in a lower level programming language like c/c++, or what?
<br/>
Just tell me everything basic here (questions asked, and what is to come).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Consider that a PassMe prototype, before the concept was miniaturized to the CPLD and custom board being sold on sites such as dspassme.com.

The same way as with the GBA: write code, compile and link in devkitARM using the appropriate makefile, flash to GBA cart, run in Nintendo DS.

<br/>
"Compiled for Linux" most often indicates x86, while the Nintendo DS uses an ARM instruction set.

Linux would introduce too much overhead to be competitive with writing custom libraries.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That picture is of my big FPGA passthrough. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">PassMe</a> is a small passthrough.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS has two slots: DS slot and GBA slot. What a passthrough does is allow execution of custom *DS* code from the GBA slot. As soon as you have booted from GBA slot using the passthrough, you can take the passthrough out of the DS slot if you want.

You need a GBA flashcart and a PassMe if you want to run your programs on hardware. After compiling everything into a binary, you put the binary onto the GBA flash cart (using a linker that comes with the flashcart), insert that cart and the PassMe into the DS and then boot.

DSLinux doesn't seem to have any capable developers working on it. But I'd like to be proven wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Programming the DS/GBA is all about setting the right registers and copying things (like graphics) into memory. I recommend reading a few of Dovoto's GBA programming tutorials since most of the information found there carries over to the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
