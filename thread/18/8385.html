<br/>
<br/>
I just made available online the beginning of a thing completely useless but pretty funny :-)) A penstroke recognition engine on the DS screen.
<br/>
<br/>
If you draw letters according the the following "alphabet" image  <a href="http://francois.pessaux.neuf.fr/images/Alphabet.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
the upper screen should tell you which letter it is...

Just for fun, it's at:

<br/>
Of course I'll release the sources. Currently they are a bit ... raw :)) There is an OCaml hack to generate patterns, then a C one after... :))
<br/>
<br/>
But this is a tuned implementation of a paper writter by Oleg Dopertchouck.

It does have some shortcomings, but after some missions, when you learn how to mix spells, and how to capture and control monsters the game grows on you and you keep coming back for more. I'm looking forward the US release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And you day its useless, but  I would love to see this intergrated into homebrew! So good work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hah, yeah I worked with that as well, though I still like keyboards better (I'm a lot faster with a keyboard :P). But I would still like to see it included in, well about everything with a keyboard. This way you can always choose which one to use!

And, this shouldn't be forgotten! A keyboard takes (visual) space. This doesn't :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A keyboard can be shown or hidden via a button though. And you'd need such a button to toggle writing if you planned to use the touch screen for anything else anyway.

If you're talking about this technique in general, it's very reliable.  I am very proficient at Grafiti and on my old Palms I can write a bunch of text reasonably fast (not as fast as a real keyboard or even thumb-board, faster than a virtual keyboard) and with very few errors.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're talking about this implementation, I couldn't tell you.  But I imagine it's similar in those respects to Graffiti and Jot.
<br/>
<br/>
But it should be noted that this isn't "handwriting recognition".  It's more like "gesture recognition" that's mapped to letters.  This has two implications.  First, on the good side, it's both simpler and much more reliable than handwriting recognition.  Second, on the bad side, it requires the user to learn the "alphabet" of gestures which the program understands.
<br/>
<br/>
Systems like Jot (used on WinCE devices and newer Palms) are sort of a middle ground: their basic engine is gesture recognition, but they aim to be closer to normal handwriting.  (In other words, you write a lowercase "L" as a vertical line, you write a lowercase "I" the same way, except you dot it.)  Graffiti, the system used on old Palms, is based on a one-stroke-per-character rule, meaning to write any character you can put the pen down, write the character, and lift the pen, and you're done.  I think single-stroke characters are a lot nicer to work with.  Either system (Jot or Graffiti) requires you to learn the alphabet for the recognition engine, but once you learn the characters I think Graffiti is quicker and more reliable.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I'd love Graffiti-like input on DS games, but there are some things to consider.  First off, how much DS software would actually benefit from a system that's more efficient, but at the cost of a learning curve?  Most DS software at most requires you to input your name.  If I were running a DS port of an Infocom game or an emulation of a system with a keyboard, a Graffiti-like system would be fantastic, but for something like Mario Kart it'd be minimally useful.  The thing is, having an engine like this available is a great thing, but it's worth considering carefully what it's really useful for.  (And yes, for most things you'd want that on-screen keyboard around as a backup.)
<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't download the ZIP file.  Got some weird page of derka-derka francophonic moon-language.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
