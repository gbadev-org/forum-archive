    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been looking round and can't seem to find anything that would work. I think it would be a very useful application - imagine if you and a friend are sitting around with your laptops and decide you want to play some networked games together, but didn't bring a cable? You could just power up the DS and make an instant LAN!
<br/>
<br/>
Please, if this already exists, point me in the right direction! If not, I have very little programming knowledge, so I regret to say that I would be no help in creating one, but I would certainly support anyone who wanted to in any way I could!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Possibly, but you'll be able to setup a much more reliable connection between the two laptops. Also you'd probably need to have your DS charger with you, which would defeat the object of not having a cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Can't you just put an ethernet cable in your laptop bag? It would probably take a lot of work to get a good connection passing through DS homebrew, and as it's largely pointless when you can use ad-hoc I don't think you'll get anybody working on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think this has been discussed before, basically the DS would be very slow at finding the key, and the DS wifi hardware is probably too slow (2Mbit) for most wireless networks to reliably capture the data. Although a tool to obtain the keys from captures exists for the DS, it is thought obtaining the captures isn't possible for most networks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
At any time only one successfull send can occure within visibility.
<br/>
Within this send it's using the full 2mbit (and this is where the hardware limit is)
<br/>
<br/>
On top of that several software/protocol restrictions will reduce it:
<br/>
Preamble: While helpfull in snchronizing and collision detection, this is no payload and reduce the netto bandwidth
<br/>
Collision Detection if two stations send at the same time and see each other sending. Both will abort and leave the channel free for some small amount of time before they retry
<br/>
Collision Detection if two stations do not see each other but the recipent does. It can advise all but one station to be silent for some time so that he can listen to one alone.
<br/>
Acknowledgement, other management and control frames. There is no netto data in them that contributes to the effective bandwidth, but occupies some time.
<br/>
<br/>
The more sending stations the more "timeslots" will be thrown away, but each timeslot will still be able to be 2 mbit.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://nintendods.desperate-programmers.com/doku.php?id=wireless_io_map" target="_blank">Trying  to bring more detail into understanding the wireless hardware</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
