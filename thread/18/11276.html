    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok i'm pretty sure this hasn't been asked, but before i go crazy resetting variables and using the forbidden goto statements.  I wanted to know if anyone knew of a fast way to restart a game within a game.  For example, while paused, if you hit select it would take you back to where it would have been if the game had just started.  I thought of possibly basing the entire game off of an object class, so at the end i can just destroy it and create a new one.  Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That sounds like a decent plan, putting the <span style="font-weight: bold">new</span> in "New Game".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lol, I get what your saying I was just checking if there was some standard that game developers used, that i wasn't aware of.  Doing it that way would work,  it would destroy all the variables and such but what about all the graphics? The screens would still have the previous data, I guess I would just reset that manually? I'll see what i can manage with it, thanks Tepples</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If anything in the constructor can fail, it's OK to throw an exception unless you're using -fno-exceptions to save code space. (But -fno-exceptions should really only be necessary in GBA multiboot or DS ARM7, which generally has a much smaller code section.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
