    <h4>#98637 - vb_master - Wed Aug 16, 2006 6:42 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible to make a WiFi Connection settings dumper to quickly transfer (or <b style="color:#FFA34F">backup</b>) the settings to a new DS. For example, my DS Lite's hinge had the crack, so I sent it in, and they sent me a new DS Lite. Now I have to go through and reenable all my <b style="color:#FFA34F">WFC</b> data. Now if there was a dumper, I could of backed it up and easily transfered my data while retaining friend codes (probably, unless serial number is involved).
<br/>
<br/>
So would this be possible, or even at all worthwhile?<br/>_________________<br/>Back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All you've lost is your <b style="color:#FFA34F">WFC</b> connection settings, which shouldn't be hard to get back.

<br/>
DSLinux does has a dumper built in which tells you the connection information, so you could use that but you still have to re-enter it manually.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Friend costs are stored on the game card, but that information is tied to the NDS serial key. Your own friend code is reset if you change DSes even though you're using the same card.. And according to the Mario Kart documentation, you lose all your friends, too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is correct, I lost my friends/rivals on Metroid Prime Hunters no less than 5 times due to replacing fauly DSes. And yes, I have terrible luck lol</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But there is no way to restore this information.

I haven't implemented writing to the firmware, as it could be used to brick your DS.

Someone should write a firmware settings restorer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe making a seperate app, and then make some very safe security warning. Like that you have to press random buttons before you can start it.
<br/>
So you show the warning message, and then the person has to put a button (everytime its diffrent, so the button has to be random generated) and then you say something "Are you REALLY sure?". and then have to press another random button.
<br/>
and then you say "OK then, if you say so. but keep in mind that this COULD brake you ds, and you can't reverse that!" and then you have to press ANOTHER random generated buttom (or press on some square that shows up on the screen at a random generated place).
<br/>
<br/>
i think that'll be safe enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
