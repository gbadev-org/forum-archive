    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I looked at the libnds example for 8 bit bitmaps in mode 5 but both of the buffers ( BG_GFX and the image ) are the same size ( 256x256 ).
<br/>
Could someone outline how to copy from a 320x200 source image into a 512x256 background?
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried a few things and the best looking result was everything being spaced by 1 pixel vertically.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
