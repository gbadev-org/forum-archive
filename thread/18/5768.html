Sometimes it works to remove via hex editor if the developer used a common loader. Can someone smart explain how to figure out otherwise?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

problem is, not all the files are .nds files + loader.  some are raw ARM7+ARM9 binaries inside of a custom loader (the way the template use to do it)... this makes me sad... :(
<br/>
<br/>
however, we are currently sitting at 70 total NDS files at my last count.  all but 4 or 5 are currently working w/ the loader (some might just be bad .nds files tho, havnt tested for this)

i'd really love to give out the "motherload" build, but i'm not aloud to distribute some of the demos im including w/ it yet..  :(<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

I'd love to <span style="font-style: italic">recieve</span> the motherload build, myself.  :)  What if you just took out those demos and rebuilt it?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what does the total file size come to with all the demos included?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, this will convert .nds.gba files into .nds
<br/>
It is VERY limited, will only work on things that were .nds files in the first place, created by ndstool. Won't work on any commercial stuff. Won't work on things that weren't made from .nds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

(Basically, it looks for a game maker code of '####' as well, as i've been seeing that in several .nds files recently. also, it aborts if it can't find the .nds in the first 16KB. a loader should never reach that limit, and it stops a couple false positives)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
