    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, Im fairly comfortable coding a platformer, 2d style, Where would you suggest looking/books to read on the subject of making a 3d engine, with the intent to make a 3d engine for the DS?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd highly recommend the "black art of 3d game programming". It's quite an old book, but I have found it extremely good. It was aimed at 486sx/dx computers, and shows how to optimise the engine you write between floating point and fixed point maths.
<br/>
<br/>
I used it while developing some 3d code for the GP32 (fixed point).
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,

I bought a OpenGL book, tried learning from it for a while, didn't go very well. Then I found nehe and suddenly everything became clear.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check out <span style="font-weight: bold">3D Game Engine Architecture</span> by David Eberly for a good overview.
<br/>
<br/>
The section on collision detection is oriented toward direct geometry collision tests though, and that may be impractical for full 3D environments on a 66MHz processor.  In my opinion, BSP is the way to go for world collision, but I haven't seen a book that covers everything I needed for our engine.  I drew various ideas from <span style="font-weight: bold">Collision Detection in Interactive 3D Environments</span>, the BSP FAQ, <span style="font-weight: bold">Real-time Collision Detection</span>, Stan Melax's home page, and the Quake 1 source code.  (Of course we had some of our own ideas too!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
