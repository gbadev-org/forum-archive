<br/>
Then click the "Downloads" link.
<br/>
<br/>
And, for that matter, if you specifically want to compile it from source...
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>
<br/>
Go to "Compiling DSLinux" under "For Developers:" near the bottom of the main page.
<br/>
You will need a good Linux distro (I recommend Ubuntu), and you may have to install a few extra packages, which are listed there.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can help you with setting it all up. The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Compiling_DSLinux" target="_blank">DSLinux wiki</a> should help with everything else, since it's pretty much the same between distros. (CVS to get the source, make menuconfig, make)
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, firstly, it's a good idea to become used to how Ubuntu works.
<br/>
A bit of exploration should reveal a lot of what there is to know...
<br/>
<br/>
For this process, you will need to use the terminal, which is available from the main menu under Applications -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Terminal.
<br/>
Don't worry about that for now, though.
<br/>
<br/>
All manner of software can be downloaded via Synaptic Package Manager, which is a huge directory of software (mostly freely available). It can also be used to remove or update installed software.
<br/>
Essentially, it's a few steps ahead of Windows Installer :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will need to use the package manager and an internet connection (assuming you have one through Ubuntu) to download a few development packages.
<br/>
So, open it via System -&gt; Administration -&gt; Synaptic Package Manager.
<br/>
Now use Search (just change it to search by name) to find cvs, gcc, make, binutils, ncurses development libraries (probably libncurses5-dev), and the zlib dev libraries (zlib-dev, zlib-devel, or something similar. Just search for zlib and choose the most likely).
<br/>
For anything that is not installed, choose to install it and then click Apply on the toolbar.
<br/>
<br/>
Those packages are also available at [url]packages.ubuntu.com[/url].
<br/>
<br/>
Now all the required packages are downloaded (hopefully), we can run CVS to acquire the DSLinux source, get the DSLinux toolchain, and finally, compile it!
<br/>
I'll leave that to the wiki, though :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, I'm having some troubles with compiling over here (broke something and have to download the whole thing again), and it would take forever because my computer with Ubuntu installed is garbage.
<br/>
(Compiling takes about an hour and a half).
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, why do you want just the regular latest CVS build?
<br/>
Kineox updates his (not-quite-)"<a class="postlink" href="http://kineox.free.fr/DS/" target="_blank">nightly builds</a>" page whenever something new is finished, so you can be sure to get a nice, stable, up to date build from there. In fact, the current one is only a day old.
<br/>
Apparently Nano has been ported, so that should be up eventually. (Yay!)
<br/>
<br/>
His SupercardSD build is here: <a class="postlink" href="http://kineox.free.fr/DS/dslinux-supercardsd.tgz" target="_blank">http://kineox.free.fr/DS/dslinux-supercardsd.tgz</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you want to change something in the source and compile it, it's a different story. I'll let you know when I get it working. Again :(<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
