    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I'm new to the dev scene and just playing around. I installed devkitPro through the automatic installer and set the environment paths etc. I was trying to test my installation by running some of the examples that came with the kit but when I "make" it through ms-dos I get "Cannot open - Cannot openMake: ***[build] Error 1" and then a whole bunch more writing. If anyone has any ideas for me to try I would really appreciate it. I'm running win me if that says anything for my situation. Thanks in advance,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The installer sets the environment variables for you.  You shouldn't need to manually modify them.  I doubt many people have tested it on Windows ME but it shouldn't be much different to installing on 98SE.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

and my pre-XP WinME.

(I had to manually add some commands

to a system batch file, however.)

Win98)
