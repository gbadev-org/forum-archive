    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
certain versions of conio.h for windows allow the cursor to jump to a specific position using the command "gotoxy()".
<br/>
<br/>
Is there an equivelant in the devKitPro dev environment ?
<br/>
<br/>
I know that not all versions of conio.h support gotoxy, and it is possible to roll your own... however, it requires windows.h which, of course, will not work on the DS...
<br/>
<br/>
therefore, if necessary, how would one write a gotoXY function ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

no problem :) in fact i find the examples very useful! sometimes invalubale! and you'll often take a look at them and save yourself hours of looking for tutorials and reading them... well, at least if you understand what's going on in the code and why it is the way it is... if you're having problems with that some good tutorials are a must.
<br/>
<br/>
@sajiimori: the lots of :) smileys should indicate that it's not laughing AT people... it's just that i'm in a good mood and stuff ;) i like to express myself with these things a lot :D thanks for mentioning it, though :) i may be misunderstood sometimes, that's true. but for me a *lol* isn't bad in any way, it's just a sign of my - maybe a bit childish (i'm 23 ;p ) - happieness sometimes. ;)
<br/>
well, at least it's my subjective attitude.
<br/>
<br/>
btw. what do you mean by "You seem to be in the habit."?  ?':|
<br/>
you mean i do that - what looks to you like laughing at people - often?
<br/>
