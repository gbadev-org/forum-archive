    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok this may be a stupid question but isthis method possible to find new registers
<br/>
<br/>
1- gather roms that do and do not do a particular effect (eg: stencilshadows)
<br/>
<br/>
2- dissasemble them
<br/>
<br/>
3- look for all the similar registersin all the roms and remove them as they are prolly standard registers for effects in all the games
<br/>
<br/>
4-find the registers that are found common in the games that employ the eefect and not in the one that doesnt
<br/>
<br/>
5- take these results and remove any that are already know to do other functions
<br/>
<br/>
6- look a the reamining register and findout how to use it
<br/>
<br/>
is this the correct method?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think in most cases people just list all known registers, then play with the ones that aren't in that list, and sometimes disassemble other ROMs to see how they work them. Information can also be found in patent documents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
