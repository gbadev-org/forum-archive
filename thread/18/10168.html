<br/>
I made some mods but.. if we add a mod music..
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it depends how you are playing the mod. Does your mod use features that your mod player does not support? Perhaps there are some bugs in your mod player? 
<br/>
<br/>
Mod is not a solid block of sound, like mp3, wav, ogg, etc, it just stores samples, and then info saying things like "play this sound, at this pitch, for this long" etc. Therefore, it is very possible that it can sound different, if the instructions are interpreted differently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Usually this happen when the mod player does not support all effect commands. So find out which theys are and simply does not use it in you mods or ask your coder to fix the mod player ;)
<br/>
<br/>
good way to test a mod player is playing some chip tunes which usually use alot fx's</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it like some samples are playing at the wrong pitch when looping? Probably is caused by the word-alignment requirement of the DS sound hardware. Try padding the start of the data with zeroes until the loop start point lands on a word boundary, and then unroll the loop until the end also lands on a word boundary.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
