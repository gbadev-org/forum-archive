    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For gameplay code, my best suggestion is to maintain a Win32 port of your engine, and debug in Visual Studio.  You can't beat pressing F5 and having your game built and running in a source-level debugger within a couple seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
For engine code... well, there's always No$Gba, but that costs money, and it doesn't have source-level debugging...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is no more No$Gba...at all.  Martin (the creator of the software and the ONLY person that accepts money and hands out the software) has gone MIA.  That's the precise reason this thread was created. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah..I saw on electrobee that it mentioned debugging capability wasn't out yet.  When is that supposed to be released?
<br/>
<br/>
Something about wifi debugging doesn't seem right...lol.  Call me old-school, but connecting straight into the PC and debugging while it's running on the DS is EXACTLY what I would like.  Debugging on emulation works okay, but I'd rather see it from the hardware's perspective.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably a matter of preference, but I actually prefer the emulation debugging. I'd worry on hardware debugging(for normal hardware; I'm sure special debug DS's don't have this problem)  about the side affects of whatever program is hosting my program on the ds. Specifically with things like memory and what not. Preferably I'd have that debugger be the GDB debugger; its emulation is near perfect; but desmume has gotten me out of some jams.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
