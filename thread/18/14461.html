    <h4>#144640 - napharianwolf - Mon Nov 05, 2007 6:33 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to ds development, but familiar with c++/c and opengl.  I haven't put a lot of work into actually programming until I learn some stuff, but I have noticed that libnds has opengl functions.
<br/>
<br/>
The question is, can these functions be used on both screens or just the one with 3d enabled?  I only need 3d on one screen, but I've come used to using opengl for 2d also...
<br/>
<br/>
Also, can anyone point me towards a good tutorial that shows specifically the drawing between screens?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OpenGL works only on the screen with 3D. You'll have to learn the classic GBA background and sprite architecture in order to draw anything on the other screen.[1] Try reading through the TONC tutorials.

<span style="font-size: 8px; line-height: normal">[1] Yes, I remembered the display capture method. But it's an advanced method, it reduces the frame rate, and you still have to use the GBA style background modes to draw the captured image.</span><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK it is possible to use 3d both screens by using the capture-capability if you accept dropping from 60fps to 30fps and wasting an entire vram-bank. I'd say listen to tepples on this one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
