    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
What is the best way to use the Console functions from the ARM7? I want to be able to display a text string. I have tried following Dovoto's example of ARM9 to ARM7 commands in reverse, but it doesn't work. Is there any way to use Console functions directly from the ARM7? Any help is appreciated. 
<br/>
Thanks in Advance,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Easiest method is probably copying a string over into uncached main ram (in devkitarm r13 and up 0x2400000-0x2800000), then sending a fifo notification over.  Also, be sure to check the FIFO recieve register, IPC_FIFO_CR in ipc.h is correct, it should be (*(vu32*)0x4100000).

The caching thing is probably what is catching you if arm9-&gt;arm7 stuff works fine, as the arm7 has no data cache to worry about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
