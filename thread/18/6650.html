<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to work on a vertical shooter in the vain of nanostray. If anyone wants to take a look at what i've got so far (no much a 3d background and a player ship that can shoot), chuck me a mail and i'll chuck u the latest ds.gba file. I can't take any screenshots at the mo as my web cam is wack.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as it working:
<br/>
On hardware -
<br/>
   Flash ME: I'm flashing the rom on to a cart and it works okay
<br/>
   Wifi ME: I dunno i don't have it so i don't know if it works with it
<br/>
<br/>
Emulators -
<br/>
   It doesn't work very well on any of the emulators i have, something to
<br/>
   do with me using the ARM7 (9?!?) for my maths maybe?!?
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone's interesting in loaning me a ridculously small amount of webspace to stick this on i'd be well happy
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
<br/>
