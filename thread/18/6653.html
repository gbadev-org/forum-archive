    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I started out with C, but truthfully I've forgotten almost all of it.  Mostly, I just program in PHP for my website or in EPIC4's tcl-ish scripting language.  I tinker in Perl too.  In short: I'm a Script-Kiddie.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, is there an easy way for people like me to create games or programs?  I remember hearing a mention of WinDS-Script some time ago but it doens't look like it's becoming a reality anytime soon.  Would it be hard to compile perl (and my own code) into DS Linux?
<br/>
<br/>
If you guys would tell me my simplist option--avoid the criticism--then it'd be most helpful.  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although not compatible with PA_Lib, but still highly recommended, is doublec's tutorials...

Learn c++, it can be almost be used as VB. Because VB is just an easy language, to easily make windowed proggies, without windows VB has no value above c/++.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well maybe in the beginning it's "that damnit asterisk", but when you get the hang of it, it pretty darn great :) I've learned (ansi) c this year, and I like it, I can't do much with it, we have only seen the basics of it, but I find it great to program in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">VB is a great language to get to know how to program windows. You learn the API functions, which is really what Win32 programming all about. .NET in many ways is just a re-organisation of accessing the same API functions, albeit in a better organised fashion (Windows API is a MESS), almost like how Sun have organised Java. But forget .NET for now...
<br/>
<br/>
When you move to C++, the main difference apart from syntax is that you get better control over what your doing. You understand the messaging system better for example. But essentially, your still accessing the same API functions just using different syntax.
<br/>
<br/>
So starting with VB is actually not a bad way, but you will never learn Windows programming on a low enough level to understand how things work. Subclassing the message system for example is not recommended in VB, yet is common practice in a C++ Win32 application.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the DS, learn C/C++ you won't regret jumping in the deep end since the fact it's harder to read the syntax is because it's all about simplification, and making coding easier, not making reading the code easier. VB is about making the transition from english to coding easier, but it's really limited - wait for bit shifting, subclassing and pointers - and you will get what I mean. Since bit shifting and pointers is practically essential in programming the DS, forget VB, it can't do it without making it *harder* to read than C/C++.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you learn C/C++ you can read it like any language. And to someone who can read both VB and C as easy as English, it's really alot sexier to code in C anyway.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
