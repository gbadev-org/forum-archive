    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I seem to have a problem with my touch screen in DSPaint and WinS.
<br/>
The touchscreen seems to not be reading touches near the edges and when I go all the way around the screen in DSPaint its like theres a small bounding box of some sort thats more twards the inside of the screen than it should be.
<br/>
The touch screen works perfect though in non-homebrew games.
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone else has this problem?
<br/>
<br/>
I have WiFiMe and FlashMe, not PassMe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
