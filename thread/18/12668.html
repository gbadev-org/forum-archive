    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm trying to use the newest wifi-lib (0.3d , CVS updated today)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using wifi-example1 as base of my wifi-code.
<br/>
The initialization seems to work, but when I try to connect via Wifi_AutoConnect, the associate-status stays at "searching".
<br/>
<br/>
I can't evenget the unchanged wifi_example1 to connect.
<br/>
Any idea what's wrong ?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : I just tried to compile the regular wifi_lib_test, with the same results.
<br/>
No matter which mode (manual connect, connect using wfc-data, etc) I choose, It always stays at searching. :(</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by qw3rty on Sat Mar 10, 2007 8:29 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I solved my problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I was transfering the binary with wifitransfer, and directly booted the bin from wifitransfer.
<br/>
It seems that the hardware isn't properly reset by wifitransfer, and hence the wifilib didn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
So it was my fault, not the libs :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
