You have any evidence to support that statement?
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen more cheap, unreliable knockoffs of other cards than R4/M3 - some even going as far as writing firmware to disable the clones. As far as I can tell all this R4 fake/clone rumour mongering appears to be little more than scare tactics from the other manufacturers intended to get people to buy something else instead.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I've had more trouble with other cards falling apart and/or failing within a few months.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Some of these use the R4 firmware.  Some use their own specialty firmware.  Some are compatible with the DSi but only pre-1.4 firmware, some are upgradeable to make them work with firmware 1.4, some were not user-upgradeable and so they released an entirely new device just for 1.4 compatibility, and some (like the original) won't work on any DSi at all no matter what firmware version.  Some are clones of each other.  At least one (Hyper R4i) is a clone of the EZ-Vi (which is why it was one of the first to be compatible with 1.4, right after the EZ-Vi released an update to fix it), while others make use of the Acekard R.P.G. interface.  
<br/>
<br/>
The "original" R4 is probably still a safe bet for homebrew purposes if you can guarantee you're getting an authentic one.  You'd still be limited to 2 GB though since there's no SDHC support (an issue if you use Moonshell for media listening/viewing), and I'm not entirely sure where you'd find an original one nowadays anyway.  The "R4 RTS" by the M3 Team is also probably decent (though WHY they chose to use the R4 name is beyond me, after the clones have given the brand such a bad name).
<br/>
<br/>
I generally just say to avoid the name R4 to avoid confusion.  Invariably someone would go out, buy a clone by mistake, and be stuck with an inferior (or unsupported, or confusing, etc) device for no reason.  Honestly I don't have any clue as to the DLDI compatibility for any of these, save the original.
<br/>
<br/>
The TTDS (or DSTT) is another one to look out for in terms of clones, especially from DealExtreme, but it's not nearly as bad as the R4 situation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">didn't the r4 team stopped a long time ago because they got into some legal trouble? the latest firmware release is more than a year ago, so at least they aren't active anymore. and seeing that there are alot of clones around that may or may not work, you might just as well go with an other card that is just as well or even better than r4.

the acecard 2i seems to be a populair choice for the dsi.<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:

well, take the opensource Acekard2i and roll your own homebrew oriented firmware, since it's the only cards (all the acekards) I'm aware of that have opensource firmware...

it would be the nearest "realist" thing to do to have your own devkitPro dev cards...

Another option would be the EzFlash Vi card, all you need to do to make it homebrew only is to rename the homebrew launcher app to ez5sys.bin after you pre-dldi patch the binary for your SD card type, this is the card I'm using and it's very easy to setup for homebrew only use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
