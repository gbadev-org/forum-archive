    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I just recently recieved a Nintendo DS Lite for my birthday. Since I finally have one now, I would like to know of course what methods have been developed for homebrew on the DS. I want to start off by getting some demos on it to see if the process works before coding anything of my own, as no emulator is good enough yet to emulate the real thing. 
<br/>
<br/>
What methods are used to send code over? I know a type of flash cart adapter exists allowing a GBA flashcart to be used, but is there a way to do it over DS download play? This would be a lot easier. Can someone fill me in on the homebrewing basics for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance. (Or I suppose DS would be more appropriate now?)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The simple answer is, you will need to use a GBA-Slot product, as the method of sending applications over WiFi requries the application to be RSA signed.(Until you have your DS flashed.)

Here's a good wiki on running homebrew on the DS:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Simple answer: You can send your code via Download Play only if you install FlashMe and have a compatible wireless card. You can also use a hacked Download Play stub as a virtual PassMe on firmware V1 through V3, but this still requires a compatible card. Either way you'll still need a GBA-slot adapter to run FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
