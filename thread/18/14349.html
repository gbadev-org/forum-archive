    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey All,
<br/>
we are a music house that is just breaking into writing and creating music for the DS.  I know all about the structure and use of Nitro-tracker, and using smf for the music.  However, when it comes to actually producing the sounds i'm at a bit of a loss.  I understand that the Sound banks are created using samples that are then pitch changed to match the midi notes being triggered.  My question is, where do these samples come from?  As a music house the owns many libraries, my understanding is that we cannot use these libraries to create sound banks due to licensing issues.  So, where can we get samples for the sound banks?

If we are going to be writing big band style music, is there a GM library that could be used?  or do we have to record a sample of each instrument and create a bank out of it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your music house owns the sample library then why can't you use them in the music you create? The licenses probably prohibit the creation libraries for redistribution using their samples, however for your purpose it wouldn't seem like a violation. If you compiled it into an mp3 you get the same result, so I'd hardly call it a grey area unless the company explicitely said that you could not use it for this "purpose" - i.e. for tracked transfer of your music.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.modplug.com/modplug/tutorial/alltrax/step0.html" target="_blank">modplug tutorial</a> recommends using "8bitdls.exe" aka "gm.dls" which is Microsoft's sound bank. I don't know what the licensing is though.

That's how sound bank vendors make sound banks. Or you could learn Nyquist and code your own sound bank using subtractive synthesis (filters), wave shaping synthesis (e.g. phase modulation or distortion), waveguide synthesis (essentially a glorified echo filter), or a combination thereof (e.g. an electric guitar is a waveguide followed by a waveshape).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
