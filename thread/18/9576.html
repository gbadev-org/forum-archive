    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
I've written a simple HTTP library, I thought someone here might find it useful for integrating into DS apps.
<br/>
I originally wrote it to help implement an online highscore table for a game of mine.
<br/>
<br/>
More information and download link here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.scumways.com/happyhttp/happyhttp.html" target="_blank">http://www.scumways.com/happyhttp/happyhttp.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It uses standard Berkley-style sockets - I seem to recall that there is some existing DS wifi code which has a sockets-compatability layer, so maybe it'll compile without too much trouble... Even if not, it'd be easy enough to replace the sockets code with something else.
<br/>
<br/>
Features:
<br/>
<ul><li> Simple to integrate - just drop in the .h and .cpp files
<br/>
</li><li> Easy-to-use interface
<br/>
</li><li> Non-blocking operation, suitable for use in game update loops
<br/>
</li><li> Supports pipelining. You can issue multiple requests without waiting for responses.
<br/>
</li><li> Licensed under the zlib/libpng license.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
Hope someone finds it useful!
<br/>
(Selfish motive: I'm just hoping someone implements a launcher for booting homebrew apps from a web server :- )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which is correct,right?:D
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how usable this is for WiFi games...:P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, assuming the socket-emulation side of it is feasible, it should work fine for wifi games. It does use some C++isms that you wouldn't usually want to use on a small platform like the DS: some STL (used internally to store response headers, for example) and exceptions for error handling. But unless your game is _really_ suffering from memory fragmentation I don't think it'd be a big deal. And replacing that stuff with more vanilla C-like code wouldn't be too hard if it came to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
