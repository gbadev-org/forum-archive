Become head of a computer science department, it sounds like ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Although considering what I've heared about the official gba devkit, I'm happy with the unofficial stuff I'm using now.  You know that a lot of those official console devkits use CodeWarrior as their IDE? Ick!

<br/>
But, at the same time...mmm...official dev kits...drool... ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are two devkits afaik. Nintendos and SN Systems. CodeWarrior is an "enhancement" to the Nintendo kit wheres SN Systems is compiler aswell as hardware stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I actually like the official stuff, but that's probably because of the fond memories of when I first used one, some three-four years ago, rather than because it's so wonderfull to work with. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I only want the official devkit because of the extremely cool gray cartridge-emulator hooked up to an SP. (Unless it's TS2 boards they give away for free :) I think most emulators with their tile viewers and what-not is a much better development tool, but still.... Drool! =)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, with the GBA devkits being "free" now, either Nintendo is pulling all the stops it can on the DS or it has something else in the works in the <span style="font-weight: bold">near</span> future.

I wonder why Xbox dev kits are so cheap compared to the other 2 systems. And it's not exactly a good that that Nintendo's devkit for the GCN is the most expensive of the 3 systems...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
