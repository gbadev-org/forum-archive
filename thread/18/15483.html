    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">short answer: no.
<br/>
<br/>
slightly less short answer: forget about it. as simon pointed out, this has be discussed back and forth and we all agree that it's likely nobody will even *try* to do it, as it is pointless! even if someone succeeds in emulating the n64, it would be *VERY* slow.
<br/>
both systems may have somewhat simmilar capabilities (i say, in general, nds &gt;= n64), but the architectures are fundamentally different (even the 360 and the ps3 have more in common!)
<br/>
<br/>
hence: forget about it.
<br/>
<br/>
the following is adressed to a more general audience, not to you, sniper (109).
<br/>
<br/>
this community is quite some years old and every now and then some "specialsist" come by and ask the same questions over and over again... 
<br/>
do they really think that NOBODY else in this (?) four / five (?)-year-old (talking nds) community has already thought of it?
<br/>
<br/>
general rule of thumb: if you just had a "cool" idea that is like "has this been ported to nds?" and the like, please, use the SEARCH function FIRST!
<br/>
<br/>
thank you!
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i wonder how much HDD space is wasted by threads about n64 emulation?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

@ tepples: you're absolutely right. but if one doesn't have slot2 hw, then there's still vba, which is accurate and fast enough for playing, although notportable. let's face it, how many peeps out there would use a slot1 "emu" for hb? ;^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At least within 5 feet of your AP the transfer rate is safely around 40KB/s, maybe some people who are good at math can figure out the maximums for streaming MPEG-1 and sound.

I'm looking at libmpeg2 now but there aren't too many detailed examples.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually a "generic 3D client" on the DS that can receive drawing calls via wifi would be an interesting experiment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
