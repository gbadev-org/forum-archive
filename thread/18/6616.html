    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know cause it is based on a (VERY)modified "Wolfenstein 3D" engine.
<br/>
Here are some interesting details of the engine:

<br/>
<br/>
Multi level orthogonally based levels. 
<br/>
Room over room (sort of). 
<br/>
Transparency. 
<br/>
Textured Floors and Ceilings. 
<br/>
Dynamic Lighting. 
<br/>
FLIC support (although we never had any in the game). 
<br/>
CINEMATIC engine (also never used. The ending sequence is scripted but doesn't utilize the cool shit developed before hand). 
<br/>
11 player network support. 
<br/>
Masked Walls (Textures with holes in them). 
<br/>
Moving Walls. 
<br/>
Stairs (sort of)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

but I guess it shouldn't be a prob.(when you look at DoomDS or Yeti-engine for example)

Had a sense of humor that up until then had been missing from FPS games.

A DS port would be sweet...if I recall, the level editor was incredbly simple, since it was after all a Wolf3D-like engine. I wonder if there'd be a way to do that on the DS. Storage space is the only problem I immediately see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Though I don't remember ROTT was so great when it came out..  Well we live in a different region so I can only speak for me.
<br/>
Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior was one of my top games when I grew up, would be great to see it on the nds.
<br/>
BTW the Duke Nukem GBA version sux. Shoot-em-up is meant to be played with a mouse, or something like it...Would be cool if someone could do a remake of it it to the nds with controls like GoldenEye - Rogue Agent.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There were different ways you can control Goldeneye. I used the Stylus control scheme. Anyway, something I'd personally like to see would be DoomDS. Yeah, I know it's already in the works, but I'd REALLY like a port of the old Doom, rather than a new version. Whatever the outcome, I hope that any homebrew FPSs will allow for custom level-making.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
