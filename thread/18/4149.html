This could really open up alot of possibilities for the nitro/ds/third pillar
<br/>
and for nintendo in general. It also fits in well with not so recent rumors that resulted from some interviews where nintendo wanted to offer something different in online gaming. It would also make the third pillar concept more sensible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like very hopeful fan noise to me. I don't think Nintendo have the infrastructure to make it work... Even if it is true, it'll be a toy that never takes off (like GBA-GC linking). Sorry, but I don't have any confidence at all in Nintendo's online strategies, even if they are employing some US company to work on it.
<br/>
<br/>
The hardware on the other hand will be very nice. But I can't see a nationwide network coming together with virtually no previous experience, a "secret" project that the dev's aren't even being made aware of, and the whole thing being masterminded by a couple of guys who are thousands of miles away from where the main DS development is taking place...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">??There are some quotes and other info which by no means conclusive suggests whatever project warp pipe is working on has been seen by some 3rd party companies. I think this generation of portables, in general, have been much more secretive though and that combined with the fact that no one technology is going to be used by every developer could be why we have heard nothing from the interested 3rd parties (not everyone cares to make their game online capable or even wireless). You must remember that with the gba we had alot of info before any hardware hit the US. The DS is supposedly going to launch this year. 
<br/>
??I have lots of faith in nintendo and will admit I am just a hopeless fanboy. I do want to know why it is someone with a new idea can't have the right idea. They have no experience with the current online gaming market and that I'll agree with. I do, however, believe that current online games are stale and boring. Noone wants the beavis factor (cheaters/pkers/do it because I can mentality) to ruin their game so to avoid it they will limit the ability to interact (no killing, no stealing, no politics, or the occasional alternative where these things are allowed on a special server where everyone is a total dick) but chatting is ok so what we basically have is a one player or noncompetitive game with chat. I wouldn't call any of this revolutionary. It is also not what we were promised either. The question now is what is Nintendo doing differently. I don't know but anything different would be good for the market and Nintendo was once known for influencing change and by the looks of the DS could be again. Is it too hopeful to think they can solve all the problems? Yes, but anything could help. I'm personally tired of seeing these online addicts play the same boring beat a monster level up game and say online rocks when we were promised worlds that constantly evolve, interaction never before possible, and politics between characters.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like to make clear that my rant above is about online gaming in general not just the speculation of this new warp pipe project. I realize that there will be several limitations on the ds that will make this project by warp pipe a bit restricted but I could still alot of promise if the speculation was true.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, this would actually be a good idea as Nintendo doesn't have to spend any money in order for a WarpPipe type application to work. And the hardware for this kind of multiplayer is already built into the system, unlike the Playstation 2 and GameCube.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
