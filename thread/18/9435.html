<br/>
1) Are you running Windows XP?
<br/>
<br/>
2) If you compile something and then quickly re-compile it, does it go at normal speed?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not sure if this is helpful at all, but I've sometimes had the same problem after the laptop's been either hibernated or without a power supply before. This with Windows XP on a pretty fast configuration (1.7GHz mobile Pentium / 1Gb etc.) so it's not the hardware that's slowing things down. Often just rebooting solves the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I turned out to be an application in the system tray that was causing my problems.
<br/>
There's not much chance of it being the same application since it's a bit 'specialist' but try ending systemtray apps and see what happens.
<br/>
Just a suggestion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Spaces in paths are bad, mkay.
<br/>
<br/>
There are several things which could be causing slowdown
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Available memory is low - this can be exacerbated by large arrays in your source code.
<br/>
</li><li>The power management on your laptop reducing the processor speed due to overheating. 
<br/>
</li><li>A virus scanner which checks all executables before allowing them to run. 
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">for the spaces, if you place quotes before and after the path it works just fine, XP loves folders with spaces 
<br/>
<br/>
Checked the memory at the time, only 256MB was used out of the 512
<br/>
<br/>
doubt it was the heat because it was slow on a fresh start up, plus other applications ran fine,  CPU tests were still showing 1.8ghz
<br/>
<br/>
virus scanner, maybe, but i use the same one on my PC and that never gave me problems
<br/>
<br/>
After I did a defrag and fiddled with the system tray it magically picked up speed, I think its my mouse touch pad that was affecting the program to tell you the truth<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

Spaces are a standard delimiter between arguments for command line applications. Quoting paths only works up to a point when using tools which autogenerate dependendencies and manipulate the paths in various ways.
<br/>
<br/>
Generally I've found that allowing spaces in paths creates more problems than it's worth. I don't understand why people feel the need.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Because a lot of users are not administrators and are permitted to write only to, say, "C:\Documents and Settings\Pinocchio Poppins\" and nowhere else on the disc.
