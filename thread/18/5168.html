Im fairly sure its because for all intents and purposes, a USA version should be played only in the USA (or other retail countries in that same area, like Canada and Mexico), and European versions will only be played there. Thats in a perfect world. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, as you said, less bugs and all. But thats not really what would keep them from communicating (thats like saying older versions of web browsers cant view webpages published today... of course they can). Its more likely they changed the code (read optimized), or changed the way the games communicate with each other. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, correct everything I just said, because I am just guessing here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The real problem with that is that it requires constant signals to be sent to and from your DS, completely wasting battery life for no apparent reason. Your DS also wouldn't be able to be used in any place that bans cell phone usable (such as airplanes), so it does little good if such a feature existed anyway. Wireless communications on the DS are limited to 100 feet anyway, so more likely than not, you will see someone playing a DS before your DS would receive any signal that another DS is in the vicinity.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if Nintendo were to implement a GPS addon which tells you the location of the nearest person with a DS (also with a GPS addon), that would be completely different. You can turn it off whever you don't feel like playing, but when it is on, you can EASILY find other people, and not just randomly walk by them.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's the main point I was trying to make, it is pretty much a waste of battery life. A GPS add-on would make things much easier and better. Heck, you could easily locate people who have GBA's, Gamecube's, DS's, just about anything.

Also, there's no reason that a particular region's DS hardware would be incompatible with another - different versions of the software for different regions are different versions of the software; it's up to the game developers whether they want to preserve compatibility or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So is it like this?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hardware</span></span>
<br/>
<br/>
JPN, USA, AUS and EUR DS's are basically the same!  They will link up no problem providing the sofware allows it?
<br/>
<br/>
I know that EUR, USA and JPN games are compatible with a JPN DS as I have a JPN DS with 2 USA games, and 1 each JPN and EUR, so that is a not a problem!  
<br/>
<br/>
But now onto.....
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Software</span></span>
<br/>
<br/>
I assume that you can play multiplayer with ANY DS and any game providing it has Single Cart Multiplayer, because the Downloading DS has no game in its slot to reference the region to, and will blindly Download and play the software?
<br/>
<br/>
However, if the Game has Multiple carts needed for multiplayer, playing between regions may or may not be possible depending on how the manufacturer has coded the game?
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any websites dedicated to testing and posting results for the multiplayer games?
<br/>
<br/>
I have the know how to make a website if there is demand for it, but it will be basic!  And it may not be updated as often as I'd like, so if anyone else fancied it............
<br/>
<br/>
And finally onto......
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Online</span></span>
<br/>
<br/>
I am based in the UK at the moment, so if I buy Animal Crossing when it comes out in the US (before the UK) and try and link it up to play online with someone else, do you think it recognise that I was in the UK and I had imported the game and wouldn't let me play it online?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post but I hope it was informative and someone could give some insight into my questions!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't they hardcode which server you will play on in the game code itself? If you are from the UK, Nintendo just might decide to check your IP address to see where in the world you are and block you from accessing their US servers. It's not likely to happen, but it is a possibility.

In any case, it doesn't really matter which region's DS you are playing from. There is no real difference between them except for the sticker on the back of the system.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

According to Darkfader the board number and touch-screen controller brand are different. The crystal oscillator is also different and the displays might be better in the USA version too. Guess the same applies to a JAP version.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo has probably found ways to produce the DS cheaper.

If the crystal is different, then the clock rate might be subtly different. Has anybody listened closely to the pitch of the BIOS chime on more than one region's DS?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Back to the Pictochat wake feature the main reason I would like this is as follows (poeple seem to be getting the wrong end of the stick)
<br/>
<br/>
I could put pictochat on and put the DS to sleep (which lasts days) then go out wandering, and as soon as another DS on sleep or awake is in range it bleeps therefore not exiting any games and not really wasting much battery. If this was implemented then I think everyone would get in the habit of A: carrying their DS switched on and B: checking pictochat when turning on the system. Interestingly when using Pictochat when you enter it says "entering Room A" and if you sleep then resume there is not further message. If however you sleep, break comms and then resume you get a "Leaving" and "entering" message. This might indicate that sleep mode doesn't break comms.

I have a UK version btw so would also be interested to hear if there is a difference in screen quality</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yoshi Touch &amp; Go pretty much has the same feature if you enable it. The only problem is that it constantly drains the battery as WiFi is turned on, even when you are in sleep mode. It says so in the game's manual.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
