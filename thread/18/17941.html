    <div class="postbody">Sometimes it happens to me to download homebrew games/apps that doesn't work on my R4/DS Lite for no apparent reason (for instance I found some <a class="postlink" href="http://pdroms.de/files/nintendods/">here</a>).<br/>
I then realized these homebrew are quite old, so I was wondering if there's something that changed from one moment on... I was thinking about DLDI, but also manually DLDI-patching didn't work.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions? Is it somehow possible to hack them to bring them back to life? ;)</div>

    <div class="postbody">I think pre-dldi used gbfs to access data through the gba rom address space. So, I think these games do not support slot-1 cards like the R4. I think modifying the source code and recompiling is the only way to make them work.</div>
