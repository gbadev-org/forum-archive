I question that method.  It's all up to you on what process you want to take, but when you start developing on the DS, most "veteran" GBA Devs will send you to GBA tutorials.  That's fine if you want to get a general understanding of GBA programming, but useless if you really want to program ONLY for the DS.  There are enough differences (like modes and the fact that the DS has a few more) that unless you plan on releaseing GBA programs, I personally think you'd be wasting your time.  But, that is just one mans opinion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suggest learning the GBA before the DS for the same reason I suggest learning the Allegro library before the GBA. Fact is, for people who are entirely new to programming for a game console or handheld device, the GBA is currently a much more forgiving environment than the Nintendo DS for several reasons: <ol type="1"><li>The GBA has a much larger library of working example code. </li><li>A single GBA flash cart can hold more than one GBA game, so you can play-test multiple projects in actual road situations without having to return to your PC. This doesn't yet work with PassMe. </li><li>The GBA, GBA SP, and Game Boy Player have wired multiboot; DS wireless isn't cracked yet. </li><li>Unlike on the GBA, where there are multiple publicly available mixers and music replayers, Nintendo DS sound is not cracked yet at all. </li><li>The GBA has accurate PC-hosted emulators to the point where (except for some instruction timings) if your code runs on hardware, with &gt;95% probability it'll run on VBA and vice versa. Dualis, on the other hand, is nowhere near this point yet. </li><li>The standard of production for DS games includes a 3D engine, which is a relatively advanced topic to many people. On the other hand, a 2D project on the GBA can still look respectable. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
