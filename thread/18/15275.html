    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
Bit of a noob to DS homebrew (but not to coding!) and am having a problem trying to get a PNG with transparency to display on screen properly.
<br/>
<br/>
I just dont know what I should be putting into my .grit file to tell it what colour the transparency is. The flag -gT{n} seems to be what I am looking for but I am not sure what to put in the {n} part :(
<br/>
<br/>
I have had a search through these forums as well as the wider 'net through Google to no avail.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The best choice is probably to use the 6-figure hex-code for the color. This is formatted as RRGGBB. Examples : 
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">FF0000 : red
<br/>
00FF00 : green
<br/>
0000FF : blue
<br/>
FF00FF : magenta (the default transparent color)
<br/>
808080 : gray
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This does require that you know what your transparency color is, of course.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cheers Cearn, I will give that a try later on and see how it goes.
<br/>
<br/>
As you say, I do need to know what colour my transparency is set to which means I may have rely less on gimp setting the alpha value of the PNG and instead, colour the parts I want to be transparent with a unique colour.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
