    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having some trouble building the examples that come with ndslib. I've got the latest devkitarm (v12), the new ndslib and after that, I run the build.bat of the example "hello_world".
<br/>
<br/>
I get the following error:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">c:\devkitarm\bin\..\lib\gcc\arm-elf\3.4.4\..\..\..\..\arm-elf\bin\ld.exe: cannot find -lnds9"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
I have no idea what this -lnds9 is. Is this some kind of argument given to ld.exe? Does anyone know what the problem here is, and more importantly, how to solve it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>
Dark Knight ez.

edit:
<br/>
Never mind. I overlooked the Install.bat of ndslib. I'm stupid like that. Great to finally get it to work though. I had trouble getting to build an nds file all day long.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To the GNU linker, the argument -lsomething (dash lowercase-L followed by something) is a command to look for an installed code library called libsomething.a in the library folder. For example, -lnds9 would refer to libnds9.a. And you're correct that a missing library means you haven't installed things properly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
