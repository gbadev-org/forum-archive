    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using DSMidiWifi to communicate with Cubase LE6 to remotely control my Zoom R24 usb audio interface, set up to be a wifi midi controlled 8 input 2 output audio console. I have also installed loopmidi and loopBE1 on my laptop. My operating system is Windows 10, on a HP Pavilion Hexacore 2 GHz with 8 GB of ram. Because I wanted to be independent of any wifi at any venue, I am also using a portable Iogear Netshair Nano usb wifi dongle hotspot, which is connected to my Pavilion laptop. Everything works. After programming parameters such a faders, solo, mute, pan, and EQ using the learn function, my 10.1 inch Android Tablet with the Netshair Nano software and Wireless Mixer installed communicates. When I pull down a fader (or EQ, etc.) in the Wireless Mixer app on the Android tablet, the appropriate fader moves down, and the audio level of that fader (or EQ, etc.) changes correctly.
<br/>
However, there are times that Windows won't allow me to use port 9000, and DSMidiwifi will hang and I have to stop the program. I have found that doing a warm re-boot won't reset the DSMidiwifi ports, but if I shut down and wait 10 seconds, and then re-boot, DSMidiwifi can then be used again.
<br/>
Is it possible to change the programming in DSMidiwifi so that the midi ports are completely reset, without a cold re-boot? Or can you make an utility that can reset the midi ports in Windows 10?
<br/>
Thanks for a very useful DSMidiwifi. I am just wondering if we can make it better!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
