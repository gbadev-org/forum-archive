<br/>
bear with me because i have little to no idea what i'm talking about... i've just been following the homebrew/ni-fi developments as they come...
<br/>
<br/>
is this RSA encryption stuff what is preventing people from being able to easily work with the ni-fi/802.11b?   or am i way off base in assuming that?  all of this stuff has got me searching around for crap i don't even understand heh it's all very exciting.
<br/>
<br/>
there's some SDK thing to download?  "developer solutions download server"?   is this anything?
<br/>
<br/>
i apologize in advance if this has been covered before... and/or if it's entirely offbase and retarded.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
the problem is being able to send personalized control and management frames to the DS, the ones that it is expecting, wich is a real pain on most hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
the encryption (or lack thereof) is mentioned in the 20+ page thread about nifi hacking.  try reading that<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That always seemed the most logical explanation.
<br/>
<br/>
If Nintendo really intends to use WiFi as viable option for DS owners to connect to the internet, they would have to include support for at <span style="font-style: italic">least</span> WEP, if not WPA as well. Otherwise there would be a lot of very pissed off DS owners when it came time to connect the DS to their wireless network.

<br/>
The simplest answer is sometimes the best.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most schools use either something like Nocat or a Windows-based application for authentication.

Mmm... do you smell that? It's the lack of standards. 802.11 was totally rushed out.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, if the DS doesn't grok WEP/WPA it can't connect to secured networks (which almost all of them should be) and therefore the people who shelled out for a DS with the promise of wireless multiplayer using their router will be rather angry at Nintendo for not supporting theirs.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that some users don't have control over their wireless network's settings; I set my grandmother up with a WPA-secured wireless router and never gave her the credentials or information on how to access and modify it. Regardless, it doesn't make sense to drop your security and expose your other computers to packet-sniffing script kiddies just so you can play some DS games.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Was this ever mentioned by Nintendo?  As far as I knew, the DS was said to be INCOMPATIBLE with WiFi (official line, of course).  It was only once people got them in their hands that it was found to be WiFi.
<br/>
<br/>
Even so, it is NOT full-spec WiFi, and many routers won't talk to it (Short Preamble).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yea, but so are the two I mentioned are under BSD-style licenses too. Also I'd be surprised of FreeBSD's IP stack ran in under a few hundred bytes of memory.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
There is probably nothing stopping other developers to set it to standard preamble when talking 802.11b + TCP/IP.
<br/>
<br/>
I imagine it can do more than 2Mbit/s as well, if the developer wishes to.
<br/>
But for normal gameplay there would be little reason to... It would only decrease communication distance and increase battery drain.
<br/>
<br/>
While uIP is a nice stack (I have implemented it on a ARM7 based system before), I think lwIP would be more suited for the DS.
<br/>
uIP can only handle one packet at a time, resulting in not-that-high performance. lwIP is a full-performance TCP/IP stack, but still compact enough for the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
