    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For a static keyboard, a combination of the two might be best. Load an image of a blank keyboard, and draw the characters over each key. That way you can implement different languages quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
It all depends on wether or not you want to allow the user to pick between different layouts and orientations, inwhich case dynamically generating the entire keyboard would be better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the image way is best, for me anyway. i'm not to fussed about multi languages now.

<br/>
I just wish i was better at C++ :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
