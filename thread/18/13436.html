    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone managed to get textures and fifo to work together here? i can both to work, but not when the other one is present, so i can have fifo without textures and textures but fifo stops working.
<br/>
<br/>
After commenting out code, i found that it appears to be glTexImage2D that is the culprit, or that could just be a coincidence.

EDIT: No matter, found a way around it, I just call an IRQ Sync request after waiting for the vblank on the arm9, and then on the arm7 when the irq sync happens, reinit the irqs for fifo and vblank/vcount and it unstuck the arm7</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
