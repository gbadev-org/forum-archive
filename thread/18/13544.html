Are you looking into porting any other emulators?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds good Dwedit!  Are you planning to release the GBA version as well at some point?
<br/>
<br/>
Mrshlee, the first step to porting those emulators appears to be getting them to compile with GCC.  If you look in the "coding" section of GBAdev here, you'll see some of Dwedit's efforts.  I don't know how those turned out however.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  nvm, just saw the builds you released on your forums.  Sweet job man, it's working perfect.  Considering the speed of the TI-85 emulator for the DS, I'm astounded you got the TI-83 working so fast on the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree, honestly I think these all have more demand than a TI-83 emulator. But since I don't code anything at all on the DS I guess I should keep my mouth shut and lets the devs do what they want as I worship at their feet.

<br/>
Tried it out BTW, works great :)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There really isn't as much need for DS ports of PocketNES and the like except to support 1. SLOT-1 cards and 2. light gun games. The TI-83, on the other hand, has a 40-key keyboard, the proper emulation of which needs the touch screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Back when I was in highschool, we made extensive use of the TI-83 (and I've continued to use it since then).
<br/>
<br/>
As such, this would be a truly awesome thing. Having a TI-83 calculator to carry around with me would be really handy, for the odd time that I need a calculator and didn't have one handy.
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than my cell phone's calculator ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is a late reply, but I wanted to mention that you don't have to downgrade the firmware to use QPC saving.  Just reboot into GBA mode instead of DS mode and you'll find that it works fine.  You could also use the DumpSRAM program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
