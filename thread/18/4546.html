You are not quite up to date, right?
<br/>
The header is pretty much the only thing on the cards that is unencrypted.
<br/>
The header was first dumped some time ago by sg I think. The process has since been repeated by myself and others as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can you send a link to the command set for the cart ROM?  I have been following several of the threads and no one has stated what it is, yet I see mentions of dumps as well...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You kinda answered your own question there.  The dumps show encrypted data, and are different each time you dump the same code.  So no command sets for anything available yet!   Except for the ARM processor, you can go to ARM's website and download the documentation and it will tell you about thier op codes for the processor.  But thats it, nothing else is known yet....... I dont think</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then how are people dumping the header out of the DS ROM?  Its not a standard ROM, you need to issue commands to even get it into a state to be read, so what are these commands?  Thats what I was talking about...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Someone might need to correct me on this, but as I understand people are just sniffing the traffic between the DS and the cart and have obseved it to work like this: the first few commands are unencrypted, then there's a "set encryption" command, and then the rest beyond that is what is encrypted and differs every time it's dumped.
