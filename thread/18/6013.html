    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I want to make a DS rom out of family pictures. I'm not good at programming, but I get the idea of it. I want both screens to display pictures. And maybe later on I want to make a slideshow if possible. My question is: how do I do this? I hope someone can answer my question. To be more precisely: I think you need to use a converter, and then place the code in the rom, am I right about that? Also can someone maybe show me an example of the source coude and the rom? I thank you for your time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just use the GBA jpg viewer, it works incredibly well and while it doesnt support both screens, its infinetly easier than writing your own code..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally, I think the most easy sollution is to convert the pictures to a picture with the resolution of the ds. And then make a c array out of it, and use some basic dma instructions to put them on the screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I said, I was kinda noobish when it comes to programming. So if I may ask: how do I make a c array of the pictures? And if I have it, how do I put it in the code with the DMA instructions..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try scaling the pictures and converting them to PCX files. This is easy enough with ImageMagick's <span style="font-style: italic">convert</span> utility:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">convert picture -geometry 256x192! picture.pcx</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Then, use something like DecodePCX in libgba to draw the pictures. It's made for GBA Mode 4, but 256-color extended rotation backgrounds on the DS are like Mode 4 on the GBA. devkitARM come with an example program called PCXView that may help you get your feet wet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you for your help crossraleigh, I managed to get the first part. The pics are now .pcx files and are 256*192 pixels. I downloaded libgba-0.1.0, but i'm kinda confused after that... How do I draw em?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
