    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In <a class="postlink" href="http://bugeyeds.blogspot.com/2004/01/chad-interview.html" target="_blank">this interview</a> with Chad of WarPipe and DS update, Chad, indirectly, reveals many of our questions with demasked.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://bugeyeds.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">DS update</a> has always been an excellent source for DS news but now, it definitely tops my list because of the interview.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really feel like posting the whole interview on the forum, but here are couple good parts that deem pointing out: 
<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Update: Now earlier in the week one of the Warp Pipe members claimed that Microsoft will be your competition for DS Online is this true?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Chad: In a question regarding tunneling competition, I made a note that no longer will any tunneling application be considered competition for Warp Pipe Technologies, as tunneling is no longer our core competency. One of our many competitors is indeed Microsoft. For what product or service? I am not at liberty to say.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DS Update: When can we expect an announcement on Demasked? Earlier you specified 2005, can you be more specific?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Chad: I cannot be specific, but I wouldn't expect to hear anything before E3.
<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
So, to me, he's saying this "Demasked is very similar to Xbox live and will be announced this upcoming E3." That may seem a bit radical, but it could be reality.
<br/>
<br/>
Also in the interview, Chad pointed out why Demasked is perfect for commercial use, verses tunneling which requires some medium level computer knowledge. 
<br/>
<br/>
So this leaves us with some assuming to do. When I put this all together, I get these questions; Will we have to pay monthly for Demasked? Will we see some "Demasked Compatible" games in the future? Or rather than that, will Demasked be some kind of side perhiperal used with the GBA port on the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
express your ideas on this situatilon, maybe I could somehow pull together a situation where we could arrange an interview with chad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is xbox live a secret? Nintendo seem to have been pointing to some free alternative to online gaming for a while now. The truth is I'm not sure exactly what this demasked project will become but I do expect something somewhat unique. A portable, mass marketed, wireless system has many possibilities. I see many new game ideas coming from this. We'll see though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which makes me glad that I have a Paneras nearby. Truly free wireless, BUT it does require you enter a password using the browser redirect interface.

<br/>
right.  people keep asking why dont all DS games support a TCP stack, and this is a big reason.  public login systems of hotspots arent all that standardized, plus there is an ever growing number of wifi encryption methods.  every game to support internet play would require a mini web browser, SSL for the browser login, WEP and WAP (plus others) for the wireless encryption.  there are countless amounts of wireless security techniques out there.  i'm sure this is the largest reason why we only DS to DS communication right now and not DS to Hotspot.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
Chad said that Demasked won't require a wireless router, so maybe if demasked ends up being a GBA cart that you use while playing a game, the cart would have a dongle thing for regular ethernet cables.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I was just informed by someone that Chad also said that the Demasked service would be free, so that leaves me asking "How are you getting your money out of this?", and I think the answer is that they will sell seperate Demasked packages (like Xbox live) that will include a headset, demasked GBA cart, and ethernet dongle for those that don't have wireless networks.
<br/>
<br/>
So pretty much you would be paying a one time fee and getting all that for probably around $30-$50.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that demasked will work with all games that offer any sort of multiplayer, but as it seems, you will have to look for the warpipe logo, so you will be limited to certain games that offer the service. 
<br/>
<br/>
Those are the only things that I could come up with, from what Chad told us, which are:
<br/>
<br/>
-Free service
<br/>
-No need for wireless router
<br/>
-similar to Xbox live
<br/>
-look for the warpipe logo
<br/>
-not a tunneling program
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has any reasonable ideas that fit within those limits, please let us know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A lack of public disclosure has very little, if anything, to do with publicity.  They have a contract to develop something with/for Nintendo, it's not done yet, not officially announced by Nintendo yet, etc.  Chances are (well, more than just a chance, I'm sure) there's confidentiality sections in that contract that they would be in breach of if they said anything more.  Standard business procedure.  The little bit of talking they are doing, they're doing just because people want to know, and it won't get them into trouble.  Taking secrecy as an indication that there's something big going on is just overanalysis.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It smells to me like they're coming out and saying "WOW, this is our new product Demasked! You'll want like six! Buy some for your pets! It vaguely involves online gaming!" and then when you ask them what the hell Demasked <span style="font-style: italic">is</span>, they have nothing to show you.
<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of that behaviour in the videogame industry, actually, and it's disheartening to see a former indie group that finally got what it wanted acting like that.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this wasn't their intent, that they just wanted to go "Well, hey, we're working on a fabulous new project and as soon as Daddy Nintendo will let us talk about it, we'll spill the beans".<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think "DemaSked" is just a wireless content delivery deal where certain games -like Animal Crossing- have a special serverside and homeside companion program that corresponds with it. You subscribe to the DemaSked service and -when you are in a WiFi area- you can access the DemaSked site and download things from it. You could probably also download a small " companion island" onto your computer from the DemaSked site. This would be for modifying items on your computer or completeing small mini-game tasks for bells. Then transmitting that data from your computer back to the server side and from the server side to your DS. Thus you could -say- import a musical song from your MP3 playlist onto the "island" program on your computer. Then send it to the "DemaSked" site for transfering it to the DS. Or you could design a photo for your Animal Crossing house with a photo from your computer. Then send that to the site which would then allow you to send it to your DS. Most likely, in order to get the DS to recognize the DemaSked software, you would need to transmit another small program from your computers wifi or from the website to your DS first. This would unlock the option in the Animal Crossing DS game card. Then again, I'm just speculating. *yawns* 10PM.. it's late.
