    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I use the raw files that are supplied with nds-examples, they sound fine. When I replace them with some 8-bit, mono 11025 samples they sound distorted. I tried reducing the volume of the samples but they are still the same. I tried reducing the volume in the amr7 code... still distorted. I am using sound forge for creating basic wavs, then sox to make them raw.

<br/>
Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I said the raw files for the examples work OK, but my wavs are distorted... even when the volume is reduced and the -s switch is used....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
