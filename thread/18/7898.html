    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As we all know,the DS game size becomes bigger and bigger.However,when analyzing the header of the game,we can get ARM9 code size and ARM7 code size. Of course, these sizes are much smaller and the DS game file also contains many icons and so on.The VRAM of NDS is only 4MByte(or 8Mbyte),the game size is much bigger and the GBA slot has only 24 address signals(Addr[23..0]) and 16 data signals[15..0].<span style="font-weight: bold">My problem is that ,when loader loads a game into VRAM, how does the game load other resources of the game,such as icons,wavs and so on.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS Game Card is a block device containing a file system, as are CompactFlash and Secure Digital memory cards in your typical SuperCard adapter. Nintendo DS programs load other assets from storage into RAM using the equivalent of fopen() and friends.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
