<br/>
Do we know if the DS touchscreen detect two points at once?  Is there any way to check?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, at least Pictochat can't.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I've experienced so far from DS software, no. Also I don't know this for a fact but I assume the way Touch screens work on a grid doesn't easily allow you to capture two locations at once.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try pressing two points at once in PictoChat.  The point that is picked up is in between the two points you pressed.  Of course, it will be biased towards one point or the other depending on how hard you press it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think what is happening, is that it's not really detecting how hard you press, but what is really affecting it is the area of your finger making contact with the screen. Pressing harder squishes your finger more against the screen, making the area of contact larger.
<br/>
Clever programmers could use this for pressure sensitivity, but i think it will only work with your finger, not with a stylus.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've noticed that there is no way to play Metroid Prime: Hunters with your thumb, only the stylus.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, the effect is only present when you press two points simultanelously. There is no way to detect pressure or pressed area when only one point is pressed.
<br/>
<br/>
Touchscreens determine the pressed point by means of a simple voltage divider. A standard touchscreen consists of two resistive films. A voltage is applied over one of the films, and the film only make contact with the other film where your stylus is, so the voltage present at the second film will be proportional to the position pressed.
<br/>
This is then repeated to determine the second coordinate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup, you got it right, ampz.  I work at a place that develops touch-sensitive screens and there's no physical way to detect two points.  We've got some optical-based stuff that can sort of detect two contact points, but even then it's iffy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
