Sure, I'd learn new stuff, but ultimately if we just want to move data packets in and out of the WiFi port do we need to sniff at this level?

heh, i'm working on it.  the DS pumps out 500+ packets a second while idling in pictochat... this is a real pain to sort out.  im trying to get a way to seperate messages that are "hey, im a host, look at me, and here are the addys of the other units" from "oh hey, im a picture, look at me!"  :)

<br/>
plus with it being 3am in the morning, my brain isnt being 100% functional, and im trying to get some other software downloaded to help this process out.  i'll prob just have to sleep on it... heh  (gotta keep ya all waiting.  ;)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is really great news! (The fact that pictochat data is sent as uncompressed, unencrypted 4bit per pixel bitmaps)
<br/>
Should be fairly straightforward to write a pictochat client for PC.
<br/>
This PC client could then easily be extended to a pictochat&lt;-&gt;IRC gateway.
<br/>
Imagine the possibilities, chatting in #dsdev or #gbadev wireless on a DS :-)
<br/>
<br/>
And this can be done NOW, no need to wait for DS flash cards.
<br/>
<br/>
You could even write a simple game that uses pictochat as input and output, but in reality runs on the PC.
<br/>
Not very useful, but it would kind-of be the first homebrewed DS game :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Nah, OCR is only required for scanned text where the text is not perfect.
<br/>
Pictochat text is entered on a virtual keyboard, right? So pictochat text will be perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
It is very easy to recognize perfect letters with a known font. You just look at a bunch of "key pixels". A certain combination of thoose pixels will only happen for a specific letter, so you just create a reverse-lookup table where you can get the ascii code given a specific combination of key pixels.
<br/>
Or, you can make a copy of the entire pictochat font, and compare the text to each of the letters in the pictochat font. Only one letter in the font will match perfectly.
<br/>
The second option is not as efficient as the first, but perhaps it is a little easier to understand and implement. (no need to find a set of key pixels)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there is also the thing of drawing on the screen tho.
<br/>
<br/>
but ya, a font matching would work best, key pixels wouldnt work too well.  remember, there are 7 unique font sets in pictochat. (upper, lower, accented, hiragana, katakana, characters, and symbols), and the fact you could draw.  key pixels would have a large chance of failure because of that.
<br/>
<br/>
but first, before we even get into that, its a matter of finding the byte order of the data.  gotta convert 11 sets of 128 bytes into a visual bitmap pattern.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <h4>#29856 - gladius - Fri Nov 26, 2004 4:45 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I've taken a little look at the packets and so far have managed to gather this somewhat useless data :).
<br/>
<br/>
// Packet desc:
<br/>
// First 4 bytes - Header ID?
<br/>
// Next 2 - Unit ID?
<br/>
// Next 4: total number of bytes sent in this message?
<br/>
// 160 bytes, payload
<br/>
// next 2, sequence number
<br/>
<br/>
Now, given 160 bytes x 11 data packets, that gives us 1,760 bytes, or 3,520 pixels.  Going off a screen capture from pictochat the closest approximation to that I can find is 220x16 pixels per line.  However, it does not appear to be stored in linear fashion (horizontal or vertical).  Decoding vertically does give better results than horizontally though.  Anyhow, I'll keep working on it unless someone beats me to the punch :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually, about an hour or two ago, i managed to decode it.  there is only 128 bytes of data per packet.  it is sent in 8x8 blocks, exactly the same fashon used in GBA VRAM for tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
tile 0 
<br/>
bytes 0-3 are row 0 pixels 0-7
<br/>
bytes 4-7 are row 1 pixels 0-7
<br/>
bytes 8-11 are row 2 pixels 0-7
<br/>
bytes 12-15 are row 2 pixels 0-7
<br/>
bytes 16-19 are row 2 pixels 0-7
<br/>
bytes 20-13 are row 2 pixels 0-7
<br/>
bytes 24-17 are row 2 pixels 0-7
<br/>
bytes 28-31 are row 2 pixels 0-7
<br/>
<br/>
and then it moves to tile 1 row 0 and repeates
<br/>
bytes 32-35 are row 0 pixels 0-7
<br/>
...
<br/>
and so on from there.
<br/>
<br/>
there is some problems ive ran across working on the second row of tiles tho, so there may be a little buffer range somewhere that i might be missing later on.  i'll continue to work on it.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
remember, the binary information i posted was just for the first row of text, as pictochat truncates its... and the first row is shorter then the rest, and the data being sent does adhear correctly to the smaller bitmap area size.
<br/>
<br/>
so, if you take away the amount of space that the name area takes up... how many pixels is left over?  possibly aprox 176? 176/8=22.  22=11*2.  (number of packets * 2), and then there is 2 tile rows per line... and a total of 4 blocks per packet... getting all this?  each packet holds 4 block * 11 packets = 44 blocks.  /2 cause there are 2 rows, and its 22.
<br/>
<br/>
so, out of 11 data packets, the first 5.5 is the first row of tiles, and the second 5.5 is the second row of tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
i think my prob w/ rendering the second row of tiles is that i was trying to align it to either the 5th or 6th packet, when in fact, it is half way inbetween.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

However, there is still 3,520 pixels being sent across the wire (well, across the air here ;).  If we assume that the line is 176 pixels long, there will be 22 * 8 * 8 pixels per line = 1,408 * 2 = 2,816 pixels.  So there are a bunch of extras floating around somewhere.  Maybe control information, or palette stuff?

2 things:  1, look at the "full" binary file... each packet has only 128bits of picture data in them.  therefor the calculation is 100% right on.  there is some extra room in the headers that is just 0's

everything but the button 1-3 scan lines was completely full.

hmm, looking at full again, packet 4... correct... it *does* appear to be 160 bytes per packet.  
<br/>
<br/>
and the thing is w/ adding a second line, is that its going to be hard to tell where the first line ends, and the second one begins, because all the the data is just thrown together in a long string.. maybe a bit later tonight, i'll try to capture some more stuff.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

well, i switched over to 160 bytes of data and 10 bytes of header instead of 128 bytes of data and 42 bytes of data... and without fixing the first scanline issue, this is what i got (i truncated the extra stuff to the right that is just all 0's):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice work guys.  So basically even the text you type into pictochat is transferred as part of the bitmap?  This seems to make sense since after you've sent even just one line of text and then "download" it back to re-edit it, the editor won't let you modify the text proper.  All text you type in just overlays on top of the grabbed image.  This is too bad as the idea for hooking into IRC won't work.  Looks like it would still be trivial to set up a client listening on the PC side though to display and send bitmaps back to a DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm looking at both your hello and full binaries. A few questions...
<br/>
<br/>
According to what you've said, your "full" picture that you logged basically had almost all lines filled except the last? Here is how I've interpreted it:
<br/>
<br/>
Just like you said, the first two mac bursts are pretty much blank, then about 15% into the third burst appears to start the bitmap data. For the next 4.5 chunks it appears to be basically filled in. Then I see almost two bursts of blank data, and then more fill continues.
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my question is this: when you sent that data, did you send two seperate messages or just one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

no, that is a buffer range im guessing..
<br/>
<br/>
any time you send a message on a single line, it is a total of 13 packets always.  but, 13 packets holds more information than what can be displayed.  my estimate right now is that there are 7 pixels of buffer on the left margin, not sure about right and botttom margins.  there doesnt appear to be any margin on the top.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

the DS using a wireless router is game specific... it is up to the developers... pictochat is about the only 802.11 thing we have to work off of right now, and it registers its own access point, and wont connect to anything other then its own custom AP.  from what i can tell, mario and metroid both use the proprietary protocol of the DS for wireless communication, so we cant even see that with the laptop setups we are running off of (unless someone else has managed to figure it out in the past 24 hours w/0 telling me of such)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">right on, I'm sure you noticed that the first byte of the headers appear to increment by one bit per burst. I was taking a dive off the deep end by guessing the order in which you sent these because the counter information was as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
full's first packet header's counter started at 11h
<br/>
hello's first packet header's counter started at 1Fh
<br/>
line's first packet header's counter started at EDh
<br/>
<br/>
of course, the counter could possibly only be one byte in length, and reset itself after FFh. There fore it would make total sense if you actually sent line first.

hence why i mentioned the GBA style tilemap above.  why bother converting a format, when the format is already native to your system?  :)

hence why i mentioned the GBA style tilemap above.  why bother converting a format, when the format is already native to your system?  :)

it looks like it just uses the GBA's 16-bolour tile mode.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
with the current menthod, its aprox 3kb of information for 1 line... and at most 13kb for an entire screen.... and its transfering on a 2mbps network... so, about 100,000 bits out of 2,000,000 every second.  that only limits you to streaming a 20fps movie like that.  ;)  i dont think chatting is that much of a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
also remember the overhead... there is a decent amount of overhead, so reducing the binary data is only marginally improving the over-all amount of data required to be send.
<br/>
<br/>
but then, you increase the encoding and decoding speeds by making the data compressed to its smallest form, and also prevent any sort of fordward compat w/ a possible *Pictochat COLOUR* ( unless they made that send out bolth a B/W and colour image, wich would then make it "slower" ;) )<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

Eh, transfer speed doesn't seem that important to me, there's not much data getting sent and the network is ~11Mpbs (assuming it follows the 802.11b standard).

The 802.11b standard allows for 1Mbps/2Mbps/5.5Mbps/11Mbps speeds. It is standard 802.11b, just slow standard 802.11b.

<br/>
Also, Mario 64 DS appears to send out 802.11 beacon frames on channel 6 while waiting for a multiplayer game to start. I don't have another DS to see if there's any traffic while actually playing, but could this mean Mario 64 is using 802.11b somewhere?

From what I've played of Metroid Prime Hunters First Hunt in Wal-Mart, the Nintendo DS uses the same square pixel aspect ratio as the Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and Game Boy Advance SP. The NES, Super NES, and Super Game Boy use rectangular pixels sized 40:33 (<span style="font-style: italic">not</span> 40:30 as PocketNES assumes), and the Sega Genesis and Apple II use rectangular pixels sized 10:11.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

on mine, i just kept in that extra header, and just moved the extra row of bytes down... i guess either way can work.

a) i only have access to 1 DS at the moment (i usually only get the second at night time while family is asleep)

Yeah, there have been some people complaining that the DS takes out their wireless for some reason. What kind of router are you using? I'll bet that it's a D-Link.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

on another note why are we trying to
<br/>
get pictochat online why not just come

up with some app that send a signal to

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Because even if we do figure out how to send things to it, we then still need to figure out how to build the packages.
<br/>
<br/>
The first step to knowing how to send packages to the DS.. is to know how to send anything. And that's where the Pictochat dissection is coming in handy right now. We can get a big ol' codebase built up and work from there on more complicated projects. You have to walk before you can run.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, D-Link makes crap that pretty much only plays nice with Windows-based computers. I've never seen their routers work 100% with anything else, even established standards like DHCP.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So the deal with the routers probably is, the DS thinks it's another DS, starts spamming it with "HI! I'M A DS! WHAT'S YOUR NAME?" packets and the router gets confused, starts screaming inside, and locks up without a fight. Wonder if there will be firmware patches.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

because the DS uses 2 protocols, not 1... and one of those two, we cannot access... and that one that we cannot access is the one that the multiboot download uses... if it DID use the 802.11 for multi-boot download, that would be my top priority, so that way we could all start on our 3rd party projects.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

This is similar to what I was saying earlier, the DS may be effectively in promiscuous mode in multi boot mode, and it's simply waiting for a beacon to start talking with another DS.

Hmm, I hope you just missed it on other channels. Mario has always been on channel 6 for me, and just hosting a game outputs about 40 packets a minute sniffing with AirSnort. They all appear to be standard 802.11b access point beacon frames though, no data, but I'm thinking this is simply because I haven't been able to try it with another DS in range.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A wireless router should work with the DS, but only for games desiged to use a wireless router.

i've been considering this... but ive also been trying to figure out what this custom protocol is... my theory is that it still runs at the same freqs as 802.11b, but doesnt use MAC headers for its packets, hence why i cant see the messages.  this is just a *theory* tho, considering that the becon packets are still being sent at the exact same time, so instead of adjusting the freq of the transmitter, it may be something as simple as sending a header that isnt a MAC packet... wich could also explain why some routers start to skrew up from the DS being around, as they may not probably hande non-mac-packets being received.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

inside that zip is the file saved by AiroPeek NX.  that is the data that i believe to be the Mario 64 multi-boot version.  maybe someone can peice together a binary file by stripping out all of the header information, and attempt to disassemble the code and data for the game?<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

as mentioned several times thru-out the thread... the software we are using to sniff the packets uses a special driver, and the driver is designed for *some* 802.11b cards.  also, if you only have 1 DS unit, it doesnt help too much either, because all you will see is the beacon.  there has to be at least 2 DSs for actual data to be transmitted.  i am on a 802.11b realtek PCMCIA card and have 2 DSs to work with, as well as 2 copies of the mario game, metroid game, and 1 copy of feel the magic (which doesnt count since it is single player only)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

There is an unencrypted ds arm9 binary inside that 802.11 dump but some packets are missing which makes it impossible to extract a complete binary needed for emulation purposes.

Thanks, but I was actually referring to lost packets, not filtered ones. About 2% of your ds packets are not seen by your wireless adapter. Maybe you can improve the quality somehow? (move ds closer to pc/laptop, give more cpu% to AiroPeek, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I was able to extract a complete header, icon?, arm9 and arm7 binary by combining both dumps. Looks like I will be spending the weekend figuring out the wireless protocol while waiting for my ds to arrive :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Indeed, it is not encrypted but mostly compressed. When running the arm9 binary on a DS emulator the code unpacks itself and all of the text becomes readable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also for the first line, are you taking into account that you cannot draw or type over your user name?  So the first line has less DATA space.  And the reason for the larger size of the first line is for the color data and the name of the DS, as it highlights usernames in the color set.

Do you guys know how to read other users profiles in pictochat yet?  I do not have two DS's but does it create tabs of other users names that you can click to type privately to them, and also read their profile?  I have no clue.  Would the profile data give us anymore info about direct DS to DS communication rather than full room communication, as reading someone elses profile would only be sent to your specific DS.

yus, there are tabs at the top of the screen where you can read others profiles.  from what i can tell, i think the profile info is sent over the same time the "i've entered the chat room" message is sent over, and then stored on the local system.  and no, you cannot have private conversations between 2 DSs.  i would love to get a 3rd DS to try this sort of stuff out further, but that just isnt possible for me at this time.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

great!  and i just wanted to say thanx for all the help you have provided.

<br/>
ive been sorting thru my mario dump 2 a bit... checking out packets 8370 and on... getting some interesting strings.  it appears that the packets are 512 bytes in size, 14 bytes header, 498 data.  byte 11 increments with each packet being sent.  the maching reciving the data sends back an acknowledgement packet that is 10 bytes in size, with the 7th byte being the same incremented ID. in both examples, the following 3 bytes after the incremented ID are 0's, so its possible it may be a 16-bit or 32-bit number.

Pictochat does not emit anything while in sleep mode. Metroid emits the same thing awake or asleep on the server screen. Mario also emits the same thing awake or asleep.
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is emitted by a client DS waiting for a server to show up as far as I can tell. I think it's merely listening for a probe from a server DS, and when it recieves that it starts negotiating with the server DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
if two units are in pictochat, and the client goes into sleep mode, it sends out a MAC Deauth packet.  it seems to have a friendly shutdown, not an instant cut off.
<br/>
<br/>
if the server goes into sleep mode, no packets are sent from it at all.
<br/>
<br/>
when you resume from sleep mode, no packets are sent at all until you select "yes" from resume communications prompt.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

One thing you could look into with just the beacons is to see if there's a way to make a PC WiFi card look like another DS to a real DS. I've been trying to do this, but have made very little progress.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Room B, then have one DS in Room A, the other in Room B.  Then have a program on the PC that will connect to both rooms, and have it relay the messages back and forth to eachother, logging what activity occurs.  At which point, you can then to a slight modification to the program to say inverse the colors, try different numbers to see of color messages can be sent, and then start sending various messages.  Before long, one would learn the DS protocol and be able to make an application for it (this is pretty much the same way I learned the IRC protocol).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I've been wondering about how to send raw 802.11b packets. I'm already using Linux, the linux-wlan-ng drivers, and the hostap drivers, but I've yet to figure out how to transmit some raw packet data.

That's a nice resource, thanks.  And thanks also to Darkain for all the work on getting this stuff rolling, nice page there too :).
<br/>
<br/>
For sending raw 802.11b packets in Linux you can use AirJack, <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/airjack/" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/airjack/</a> which is unfortunately only compatible with a few chipsets, prism2 mainly.  Or, just hack the driver up to add a userland hook that accepts a raw packet and forwards it onto the hardware.  It's non-trivial, that's for sure, unless someone discovers a different way :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm, I'm not really up on my kernel level C, so I'll give AirJack a try. I've alreadly got several prism2.5 cards since those used to be the only things that Linux worked well with.

In a way, the linux driver does send the firmware image to the device at initilization but this firmware is just the Amtel coded firmware.

<br/>
so, i was watching the mario 64 beacon data before starting a game up.  it appears to be sending 10 consecutive packets in a row, with 40 byte headers and 96 bytes of data.  byte 32 appears to be the incrementing counter byte, ranging from 0 to 9 in each packet.
<br/>
<br/>
in this dump, i've stripped out all of the MAC header information, so we can look directly at the DS info.  the packets where all sent as beacon packets, and this is the data contained in the "WPA" section of the packets.  if my memory serves me correctly, isnt WPA encryption... but the DS is using this part of the message as data... could *this* be how Ni-Fi defer from Wi-Fi?
<br/>
<br/>
if you look in the binary, you will see the strings for the game name, game description, and the host's DS's name.  the name of the host for this game is "Darkain(tm)", with the (tm) being the actual TM character.  the (tm) appears as "! or 0x22 0x21.  i'm not too familiar w/ unicode or UTF-16, but i dont think this is either of those.  the seperation between normal characters in the Nin format is a 0x00, and i dont think any PC standard text format uses those, do they?
<br/>
<br/>
anyways, hopefully this is good info for anyone that wants to try to re-create the process of downloading a ROM to their DS, as the first step would be broadcasting that a download server is available.
<br/>

ya, like i said, there is DS header information in there... that segment should appear 10 times (since there are 10 packets), and be slightly different each time.
<br/>
<br/>
if i remember correctly (i dont have the hex editor open right now), the first 6 bytes are the MAC address of the unit, and i havent have a chance to figure out the rest of the header other then the incremented id.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

i might look into multi-lined dumps a bit later, but right now, im playing around w/ some multi-boot dumps.  i wanna be able to transmit code to the DS ASAP, this way we can start the home-brew dev scene. now, i dont want anyone to get their hopes up yet about this idea, im just mentioning to say that this is what i'm currently looking into, so i may not have any dumps again for a bit (unless someone specifically requests something they want)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

hey, wait a minutes... i was just looking at your images... remember, the first line of text (first 2 rows of tiles) are pushed over to the right to make room for the name... so just move the bitmap bits over to the right by 48 pixels for all tile rows, and add in blank space as a filler on the first line where the name would appear.  this should fix up your alighment issue.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's my breakdown of Mario 64 probing with more dumps of the multiboot probes to play with.
<br/>
<br/>
1 packet is sent out when you start the probing. This contains a normal 80 byte long 802.11 management frame. The management frame tags each contain normal 802.11 data, except tag 221 which contains the information the DS is sending out. This first frame tag 221 consists of
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and it's 802.11 sequence number is 0. I seem to be missing a lot of packets though, as I get sequence number 7 next, then 8, then 10, and it jumps around by 6 or so for most of the log. I'm in a really bad spot for low level wireless hacking, there's sometimes 6 or 7 wifi networks active here. My pcap files confirm what Darkain said about there being 10 192 byte packets.
<br/>
<br/>
I've put together a file containing the 221 tags from what I believe is one of each of the 10 packets.
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://projects.spicious.com/ds/downloads/10packets.txt" target="_blank">http://projects.spicious.com/ds/downloads/10packets.txt</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the first pcap file that's from.
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://projects.spicious.com/ds/downloads/mario64probes.pcap" target="_blank">http://projects.spicious.com/ds/downloads/mario64probes.pcap</a>
<br/>
Here's the second pcap file, the 4th packet is the only one from this one.
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://projects.spicious.com/ds/downloads/mario64probes-4.pcap" target="_blank">http://projects.spicious.com/ds/downloads/mario64probes-4.pcap</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's those 10 packets as a binary instead of the hex codes with 24 bytes  of EFEFEF seperating them.
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://projects.spicious.com/ds/downloads/10packets.bin" target="_blank">http://projects.spicious.com/ds/downloads/10packets.bin</a>
<br/>
<br/>
My name is a little more difficult than Darkain's to find in the packets, as it's written in hiragana. ちず is 0x3061 0x305A. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on making AirJack work with a 2.6 linux kernel to rebroadcast these packets to see if the DS finds them. I still think it's possible to do without AirJack though, by finding a way to load up the 221 tag in the hostap drivers management frames.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was thinking about this in the shower today, actually (where everyone does their best thinking, duh). Because of the US export laws they can't possibly make a DS with any kind of crypto solution with &gt; 64-bit keys, unless they were to ensure that the DS is never exported outside of the US; but this can't really be ensured thanks to sites like lik-sang and playasia.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

a friend of mine came up w/ the idea of possibly using the linksys router that has the open-source firmware, and thus had linux ported to it.
<br/>
<br/>
reasons?
<br/>
1) it already runs linux
<br/>
2) it is already designed to broadcast control messages
<br/>
<br/>
thing is, i dunno how hard it would be to code for the router, and constantly reflashing it would become tedious and annoying... so this may be a project saved for later after packet sending is perfected, and we want to setup a dedicated ds server...  i dunno, i'm just rambling at this point.   *goes back to decoding packets*<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
right.  i think gladius has helped out greatly in decoding packets.  and there are many others i am working with as well.  who evers name appears isnt the important thing here tho, its the fact that we *NEED* to keep pushing forward.
<br/>
<br/>
because of the slashdotting, many developers have come forward to me with similar projects and vasts amounts of ideas.  we have the pictochat image decoding going on here, we also have members here trying to decode the ARM9 binary code from the mario dump.  outside of these forums, i know of at least 3 teams working on trying to tunnel the wireless multiplayer gameplay.  and at this point, i'm focusing completely on wireless multi-boot download from a pc.  there are countless amounts of other projects going on right now as well.
<br/>
<br/>
things are coming along smoothly at this point, much faster then anyone could even have imagined.  we all have our own agenda, but we also have to try to keep this a team effort as much as possible.  i, personally, have been trying my best to not hold anything back.  the second i make a discovery, i post.  yes, i have been wrong a few times because i have rushed information, but later corrected it.
<br/>
<br/>
i've been hearing a some teams talking about keeping information on the DS secret for the time being, and some have even requested that i do the same.  i simply wont.  i want information available to as many people as possible, this way, someone that has an idea or the knowledge for the task at hand can help out.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

I think its great you've taken this attitude. This was discussed briefly on #dsdev on efnet last night. Unfortunately the one area I would like to have a hand in is pouring over the mariods mb rom, but to do that requires access to an arm9 emu, which apparently someone has written (anon) and has decided to keep private. Going through the mario mb rom will help to shed light on the issues being discussed in phantom-inker's thread on VIDEO and CPU/MEM masking.
<br/>
<br/>
its becoming apparent that while the homebrew hacking efforts are moving speedily, they are probably not moving as fast as they could and that is in large part due to the secrecy by those with the tools and hardware (and info).
<br/>
<br/>
So props for being so open about it. I am not sure what the motivation is behind keeping things secret, perhaps certain groups want to spring a significant ammount of progress on the scene and reap the credit and legacy. I have no time for that kind of stuff, I am purely interested in getting my code up and running on the DS.

wont work.  it cannot send control signals, only data packets.  from the looks of it right now, we are gonna need a linux box with the right wireless card to be able to transmit the needed packets to the DS.  i've been in contact w/ some developers that are more familiar with linux than i, and we will probably be trying out some test enviornments in the next week or two.

Linksys' website has the firmware source code to all their linux-based products, and their firmware revisions.

<br/>
Linksys has been compliant to the GPL for some time now, releasing the source code of their Linux embedded products, nice and all. This, of course, has spurred development of interesting projects like OpenWRT.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the GPL'd parts of the source code currently don't include the binary-only drivers for the Broadcom chipsets. That means that, while the operating system can be tailored to do almost anything, the current wireless drivers impose a limit on how to use the hardware and this could severely affect the development of such a custom DS-compatible hotspot/router.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure since I haven't read much on how exactly and to what extent is the hardware exposed by those drivers, but I've seen them causing bugs that were very hard to tackle because of their closed state.<br/>_________________<br/>Otaku no naka no otaku, Otaking da!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

control packets,  such as beacons, auth, deauth, ack... things like those.  data packets would be like the ones that contain the pictochat images.  the drivers and api for airopeek does *not* allow for sending of control packets.  i think the api also prevents you from sending data packets w/ 0 bytes of data (in other words, just the MAC header).  this too, is a problem, as the DS sends out a decent amount of emtpy data packets, i'm asuming so it can monitor signal strengths on those packets.

MAC cloning is usually quite trivial. XP has an option to edit it built right in the OS, and most routers have the same capability. I'm pretty sure Linux and OS X do too, but I've never had a reason to try it out there.

<br/>
my theory is this right now....
<br/>
<br/>
the DS is fully IEEE 802.11b compliant, running at 0.5, 1, 2mbps speeds.  for things like wireless multiplayer download or pictochat, one unit acts as an access point, and sends out beacons, just like a PC AP would.  the difference between WiFi and NiFi? none!  WiFi (IEEE 802.11) uses radio waves to send binary data back and forth at a specific set of frequencies (identified by channels), and in this binary data, we have MAC (Media Access Control) packets.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/usail/network/nfs/network_layers.html" target="_blank">http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/usail/network/nfs/network_layers.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
the IEEE 802.11b standard does not require an IP layer to be present to be compliant.  everyone asumes that because current DS software does not have an IP stack, and pull an IP addy from their router, that it therefor isnt IEEE 802.11b.  this is un-true.  it mearly means that it is exposing layers 3 thru 7 with a different protocol..... think of it this way:  remember back in the days of NetBEUI, IPX/SPX, and AppleTalk networks?  TCP/IP (IPv4 and IPv6) are the two most commonly used data communication protocols out there nowdays.
<br/>
<br/>
i believe that "NiFi" is mearly an alternative to TCP/IP for the DS.  see, the TCP/IP protocol is actually a bit complex in terms of what all it can support, hence why it is used for general internet communcations.  to create a more basic sollution, it appears as tho nintendo came up with their own alternative to TCP/IP.  now, this doesnt mean that they wont use TCP/IP in future games (they already said there will eventually be internet based games, wich TCP/IP is a requirement for), but this is on a per-game basis, and nothing out there right now uses such a protocol yet.
<br/>
<br/>
the reason why we are able to capture packets from the DS right now is because we are doing this at Layer 2 (like a MAC dump), not Layer 3 (like a TCP dump).  this bypasses any sort of protocol translations, and gives us raw binary data to work with.
<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
so, in short, "NiFi" is an alternative to TCP (Layer 3), not an alternative to WiFi (802.11, Layer 2)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

Nintendo has said that it is possible for the kiosks to be built to allow DS demos when in range, so it may not be verifying the presence of a DS per se. if we could circumvent the entire handshake process that would be great. also could the two alternating signals be 1)  a main madden server, and  2) a general mac address for all DSs?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is very, very similar to what Metroid does. I think those are a type of broadcast address, perhaps some sort of MAC subnetting? Anyone with more knowledge MAC address assignment than "first 6 bytes are the manufacturer, last 6 bytes are the individual device" know what that address is?

libnet does do quite a bit of what we want to do (might over manage some stuff), but the problem with using it is finding drivers able to broadcast the packets it generates. Currently the AirJack drivers look like they're the only drivers able to broadcast raw layer 2 802.11b traffic. I've been trying to port these drivers to 2.6 for the last day or so with little progress as I lack the experience to work quickly with kernel level code (or any advanced C really). I'm basically stuck reading up on linux kernel programming, so I might just break down and compile up a 2.4 kernel to test some of this stuff with AirJack.
<br/>

And rasz, I share your frustration with broadcom. They have created some of the least useful wireless technology I've had to deal with in the past, but Darkain makes a very good point about this not being the place to flame a company.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

this isnt the first time this has happened to this laptop.  the backlighting went out once before, and was fixed.  sadly tho, i was unable to fix it this time around.  so, for now, my current project is simply to figure out how to get back into the swing of things around here.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I know exactly what you are talking about.  The backlight of my LCD screen went out once, so I sent it in under warrenty and they fixed it.  Then, it started to flicker out again, but it seemed that if you pressed that little peg down that is normally pressed by the screen itself when you close the laptop, the screen would come back on.  Now, the backlight is gone completely again, so I have it hooked to a monitor (although a rather cheep monitor).<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

remember reading about FCC class IDs on the back of every electronic device ever made basically?  i believe it was class 15 of the FCC.  the device must accept any interfearance that it receives.  the DS's LCD unit apparently is on aprox the same freq as that of a TV tuner.   things like this happen all the time, actually... such as the TV that produced the signal for the emergancy distress system not too long ago.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

notice the replies at the bottom, it appears the inserting a flash cart gives you an optional pak sometimes at boot, can we fool the DS into using all the hardware? wireless link, dual processors, 4mb ram, etc but running the majority of its data off the GBA port? also it looks like it may open the doors for custom user created mods for a handheld, let alone a internet capable  console.

if you insert a gameshark, it does the same thing.  prob w/ an "option pak" is that it isnt a selectable option from the menu.  it just displays it, and wont let you do anything with it.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
i just updated the page.  i posted the Ni-Fi theory, much like i did here.  i also added in another FAQ question, because i'm tired of people saying "The DS is masking its SSID!!11!"
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why can't I see the SSID for my DS? Is is masked?
<br/>
A: NO! the DS appears to be using a BSSID instead of a SSID. SSID at Wikipedia.org - "Ad-hoc wireless networks that consist of client machines without an access point use the BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier)." Some people have reported strange "MAC Addresses" in the headers of the binary files posted above. The BSSID addresses that the DS appears to use is either the MAC address of the unit, or a slightly modified version of the MAC address for the unit, such as the first of the 6 octets being different. 
<br/>
<br/>
i've also added the note that you may be able to use Kismet and the Linksys WRT54G router to sniff packets.  I will be personally trying this out here in the next couple of days to see how well it works for me.
<br/>
<br/>
if there is anything else you think i should throw into the FAQ?  i'm all ears right now.  until i get a laptop replacement, im sorta stuck twiddling my thumbs on this project... heh...<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
So, from what I've read here, the only cards that could be used to simulate a DS under GNU/Linux would be the cards based on prism2/2.5/3, prism54, or atheros chipsets, as they are working great either in client and access point mode, and their driver is (nearly completely) free software.
<br/>
<br/>
from what i've read on the madwifi  site (driver for atheros), the closed source part of the driver is just a wrapper that prevents the user to input a wrong (according to FCC) frequency or emitting power... so i assume there are 99% chances that we'll be able to forge our own packets, even at MAC level.
<br/>
<br/>
now, about the prism based cards : as these use a more complete firmware (whereas the atheros does everything in software) there are chances we won't be able to modify the MAC packets... On the other hand, I guess the prism can be used as an access point only thanks to some logics in the driver, so it sounds also possible that they accept anything at the MAC layer.
<br/>
<br/>
But I haven't read any source code yet, so I really don't know what can or can't be done with these...
<br/>
<br/>
Does someone has any suggestions or comments?
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I live in France, and I will only get my DS this week end, from a friend that lives in Japan... Told him to get me a second one, but I don't think that there are still some un-preordered units available in this country ;) .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Haven't managed to get the DS to respond to anything yet, but that will hopefully come in time.

However, I've run into the old problem whereby it looks like the broadcasting DS knows about the client DS without an 802.11b signal being sent.

This google group[/url] thread talks about it.  I just haven't tried putting anything together.  For simplicity sake, I just wanted to send out the same beacons that the DS sends out in pictochat with of course a slightly different mac source and see if the ds will see this and send anything else.  I only have 1 ds so all I see are beacons currently.  If that will work, then maybe the rest would be downhill.  Also, has somebody with 2 ds's tried seeing what the results were when 2 ds's had the same nick, just curious about the result.
<br/>
<br/>
I had thought libnet might help but someone else stated that it wouldn't do right and I haven't even tried to prove them right or wrong yet.  I'm guessing the main problem is that most drivers try to prevent you from sending out packets that are malformed with incorrect source MAC, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Giving an incomplete method to people isn't exactly a good idea as many people will rush out to buy the equipment they used for tunneling. Besides, the app they used is still probably in an early alpha. However, since they are claiming it CAN be done, then that gives new hope to us who are trying to send data to the DS.

Crazyc,
<br/>
Yes, the captures have beacons, but from what I remember they are missing an initial authentication step.  Try just putting a DS into pictochat and broadcasting the packet a-auth from the sniffer download on my site to see if you can get a response as well.  I'm not sure if your card does CRC automatically, mine does, so I just send the first 30 bytes of the packet.  If not, send the full 34, the CRC is correct.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, here is a rough outline of the mario beacon packets (and I'm assuming multi-boot packets in general).  The CRC appears to only be applied to data after the CRC, as modifying anything there causes mario to not be detected.  However, I was able to modify some values before the CRC element and it would still succesfully detect mario available.  All packets seem to be neccesary.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I got the mario beacon file up.  The format is very simple, 4 byte integer denoting the size of the packet, then that many bytes (the packet), then another length, etc, till EOF.  Anyone that wants to take a crack at figuring out the CRC algorithm is more than welcome :).
<br/>
<br/>
// Packet description:
<br/>
// First 24 bytes, 802.11B header.  0x14 = packet sequence # (2 bytes?)
<br/>
// Next 12 bytes, fixed parameters, first 8 bytes, timestamp
<br/>
// 50 bytes in, beginning of custom tag.  should be 0xDD (custom)
<br/>
// next byte, length of tag, 0x88 for mario beacon packets
<br/>
<br/>
// From offset 52 from now on:
<br/>
// 0x00: 28 bytes - unknown (fixed for mario)
<br/>
// 0x1C: 1 byte - 0x02 on final packet, 0 otherwise
<br/>
// 0x1D: 2 bytes - unknown
<br/>
// 0x20: 1 byte - packet seq. number
<br/>
// 0x21: 2 bytes - CRC
<br/>
// 0x23: 1 byte - packet seq. number, but when 9, it's 1???
<br/>
// 0x24: 1 byte - total number of packets in message
<br/>
// 0x25: 2 bytes - length of data segment?

// 0x27: x bytes - packet data

Unless it somehow *did* prevent booting sniffed multiboot images, I'd really bet against it.  I don't see why they would bother doing something that prevents homebrew if it does nothing to prevent piracy.  Piracy is their main concern.  As far as I've seen, everything they've done that hinders homebrew has just been a side-effect of piracy-prevention measures.  And I'd have to agree with what someone else suggested earlier: that even if there is a digital signature, it may only be optional.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think so.  I received the packets with another machine in monitor mode and they seem to be exactly what should have been transmitted.

ok, i played around w/ my drivers some more, and i can force it into 2mbps short preamble mode (this was actually quite easy, and i was just blind before).  my problem now is that every time i send a packet, it isnt sending, but rather, is saying it is a "TX Error" packet, and my router replys w/ a ReSend.

I have written my own driver for a specific wireless adapter, due to the lack of an existing driver/sdk/whatever that allows such kind of hardware access from within Windows. (linux is not an option)

The packets are only modified slightly by hardware. The hardware automatically adds the seq. number and the frame crc.

the people going around saying it isnt possible are the ones that are either a) people that love linux and hate microsoft (yus, ive dealt with alot of this in the past week or three) or b) people that try and give up too easily.
<br/>
<br/>
i personally do beleive that it was successful from windows.  we spent the entire day in the irc channel discussing this, and at first, it wasnt working.  gladius offered some suggestions, such as forced 2mbps tx rate, short preamble, and ~200ms delay between packets, and then it started to work.
<br/>

i can understand being skeptical about any sort of announcement made.  i am, too.  i've been trying to pick apart each and every dev group out there to get as much information as possible from each, to see if they are legit or not.

I see you are using one of those cheap usb-wifi adapters. I was also planning to buy one of those, so it's good to see you have been working with that on the ds.

Maybe it's even possible to write some sort of unified DS driver for this?

No, not Atmel based. I am using a Sweex 802.11g USB stick. It has a (very rare) ZyDAS ZD1211 chipset combined with a (very common) RFMD2958 RF chip.

However, there is another device, the D-Link DWL-122 802.11b USB stick, which is much much much more easier to get, and it has a Prism chipset, which, at first sight, is very good "documented" (read: open source linux driver). Maybe someone else can write the necessary win32 code for sending/receiving raw 802.11 frames using this device? Or maybe someone cares to donate me such device, so I could give it a go?

Best to wait until something is definately working.  As far as which card to get, in theory, any card should work; however, this is just theory.  So far, in practice, my Linksys PCMCIA Wireless Adaptor (WPC11 ver 3) is not able to even detect the presense of my Nintendo DS, while my Belkin USB Wireless Adaptor (F5D6050) is able to see the Nintendo DS, but is neither able to connect to it, nor is ethereal under Windows able to pick up packets (not even beacon packets).
<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to buy a card, I'd say to wait until someone succeeds in fully communitcating with the Nintendo DS.  If you just wanted something for the Nintendo DS, that Linksys Router that is discussed earlier seems promising, as the people working are writing firmware for it so one can simply send UDP packets to it, and it will process the contents and send raw packets based on the data.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

The reason why I think that the DWL-122 could also be used to communicate with the DS without driver is because 1) it's also USB and 2) it has *a* Prism chipset, which supposedly is documented very good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or you can order two brand spanking new ones for $30 (which is roughly $37 CDN) and that includes shipping... if you get your bid in at the right time!  :)  *Smiles evily 'cause even if it doesn't work with the DS he can sell one of them locally and make up the price and end up with a FREE DWL-122 USB Wireless Adapter*

<br/>
First of all, I'd like to thank all of you for all the work and the efforts you're putting on the way to the DS homebrew development.
<br/>
I've got 2 DS (US and Japanese), one copy of Mario DS, another one of Mr Driller, and yesterday I finally found a card (D-Link DWL-610, Realtek driver) that allow me to get packets. If I'm right the next step is to send a multiboot game to a DS from a computer. I think I'm gonna work on some wireless drivers for windows. Don't know If I will be able to make it, but well If you don't give it a try.... you know the rest. I'm open to any suggestions, so if any of you prefer me to help in another way just tell me.<br/>_________________<br/>Everyone in the world is my psy.

<br/>
You're right. It effectively uses the Realtek 8180 chipset. BTW the installation of these drivers to make Airopeek works with the card was a little tricky. I had to modify the .inf file drivers. Anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
I took a quick look on some packets from Mario DS and Mr Driller. It seems that the beacons that say "I'm a DS and I have a game available for download" are managed the same way by the 2 games (guess it's the same structure for all game that manage multiplayer game with only one game pak). As you noticed it when you worked on Mario DS Beacons, threre's a serie of 10 packets. each packet size is 136 bytes. Here's what I found for now :
<br/>
<br/>
Header	Total: 38 bytes
<br/>
	28 bytes=&gt; ? (MAC adress and other stuff I don't know)
<br/>
	1  byte =&gt; Flag that tell if this is the last packet
<br/>
	2  byte =&gt; ?. For mario it's 2 and for Mr driller it's 4.
<br/>
	1  byte =&gt; packet id (To be detected by a DS, 10 packets 0-9, seems to be needed)
<br/>
	2  byte =&gt; seems to be the CRC like gladius said it.
<br/>
	1  byte =&gt; Seems to be linked to the packetID byte. this byte have always the same value as packetID, 
<br/>
		   except when packetID= 9, this byte equal 1.
<br/>
	1  byte =&gt; Seems to be always 9, well that what I noticed in Mario and Mr Driller.
<br/>
	2  byte =&gt; Length of the data that follow (often 0x62)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Data         Total: 98 bytes
<br/>
<br/>
Depending of the packet, here what we can find in the data part:
<br/>
<br/>
Packet 6:     The name of DS that Host the game =&gt; 20 Bytes
<br/>
Packet 6-7:  The game title =&gt; 96 bytes
<br/>
Packet 7-9:  The description of the game =&gt; 128 Bytes (To be honnest I'l not really sure yet)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess that the icon of the game is on the firsts packets. But well this is just assumption.<br/>_________________<br/>Everyone in the world is my psy.

We're cleaning up our WRT54G relaying code - and I was wondering if it would be any use to you guys as far as hacking goes - because - the WRT firmware we're making would relay *all* the control and data frames to a PC app - encspaulating them in UDP.

If anyone's interested - I'll send you our stuff as soon as it's finished :)

Also, do you plan on making your work public, Tim? I know a lot of people who would be extremely happy to only need to buy a USB memory stick to play online - instead of a router :)

It's a 32x32 image in 16 colors. It's not compressed and it's composed of 16 8x8 pixel blocks (character mode in GBA). So the First 6 packet contain the palette (32 bytes, 16 bit colors) and the image data (512 bytes). The last bytes of the image is the beginning of the 6th packet. I'm gonna put some file on my temporary website so that everybody could take a look at it.

Presumably it would be hell to get up and running, but presumably it would be possible.
<br/>
Of course, you would have already sniffed the various packets from letter 'a' and 'b' etc. so that you could just compare the two (sent and stored) and see what it was.
<br/>
Mildly insane, but perhaps mildly possible.

There are already text adventure interpreters for the GBA (GBAFrotz, among others) - but they are very unwieldy. I do see opportunity for them on the DS using both the keyboard and "scrollable" word lists)... also interesting would be a MUD interpreter at one point in time.

I made a new dump of Mario, where I start to host a game and then a few second later a player is connecting to the host. I noticed that beetween the two dumps, stuff2[2] change a little. In fact It seems that the second byte of stuff2 is actually the number of player that are connected  to the game.
<br/>
The first byte of stuff2 is initializated  randomly when you start to host a game either Mr Driller or Mario (1, 0, 2  or 4. Never saw other numbers). It could be a nintendo channel for a DS that host a game (which could make sense since you can be in a room where more than one game is hosted).
<br/>
<br/>
An other thing is that in the dump where a player is connected, the last packet contain the name of the DS connected. I assume that this packet contain all the name of the connected player. But what's weird is that the size is limited (98 bytes, remember). Since there can be 16 DS connected I doubt that this last packet can hold the all names by itself. Hence the utility of the flagLastPacket, which could mean that there can be more that 10 packets according to the number of bytes needed to hold all the names of the players.  But well this is all asssumption as usual. I have to see a friend by friday (an other programmer) who have a DS too. We will do some test whith 3 DS connected. From there I could have confirmation of some stuff.

It depends on your OS. I'm on a Mac, and the best resource looks to be the KisMac source code from <a class="postlink" href="http://binaervarianz.de/projekte/programmieren/kismac/" target="_blank">KisMac homepage</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're on Linux it seems to be <a class="postlink" href="http://www.kismetwireless.net" target="_blank">Kismet</a> or 
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://802.11ninja.net" target="_blank">airJack</a> (might be down or gone, should be available elsewhere.) Most of the guys here are using Linux, so that's probably easiest.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about Windows, but there should be a port of Kismet. You could also try <a class="postlink" href="http://ethereal.com/development.html" target="_blank">ethereal</a> but I couldn't get it to see the ds in the very short time I tried it.
<br/>
<br/>
In general my understanding of how usb communication works is you just fill out an appropriate header (defined with the driver you're using) and dump that to the pipe you've opened (by knowing the usb id of the device, or just where the thing is mapped.) That's how the usb gba flash equipment works anyway.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a little status update, in a rather unfortunate twist it appears to be easier to connect to a DS  that is advertising a game then it is to make a DS believe a game is available for download.  I've been able to get Mario to think I have connected to it, and have gotten as far as sending my own name for my virtual DS across.  I mostly did that to test my theories on the protocol, which seem to be mostly correct.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the state of getting a DS to start multibooting, I can keep the DS from sending the deauth now, by simply still sending out the beacon packets 5 times per second.  But I can't seem to get it to believe my association response.  It sends back an ACK, but then simply ACKS all packets I send from there on in, which makes me think that it's not authenticated yet.  It's quite possible there is something in the beacons that is tripping me up, and you can't just blindy replay those, so that's the next area to explore.

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.darkain.com/reference.php?refname=wmb" target="_blank">WMB</a> Beacon Packets are now almost fully decoded... (i think?).  we have the image decoded, as well as the blatently obvious unicode strings that you can see with even a basic text editor like notepad.  i wish there where some more games out there to help verify some of the other theories we have about the NDS WMB packet header information.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://ds.darkain.com/wmb.zip" target="_blank">http://ds.darkain.com/wmb.zip</a> (11kb) - this zip file contains the win32 console app, source code, and bin files used for converting from WMB beacons to a 32x32 bitmap image of the icon.  since the text locations are also known about, i may shove those into the next build as well.
<br/>
<br/>
the image is 4 tiles by 4 tiles.  tiles are 8x8 pixels, 4bpp (16 color).
<br/>
<br/>
wmb packets are 136 bytes in length (plus a MAC header that i stripped out).  this can be further broken down to 38 bytes of NDS header followed by 98 bytes of data per packet.  my first thought that it was 96 bytes per packet, which would allow for perfect alignment of 32byte tiles, but this is wrong.  the tiles are NOT packet aligned, like they where in pictochat (hence why it took me longer to figure out what the hell my alignment problem was)
<br/>
<br/>
i shoved all of the "data" sections of the 10 packets into an array w/ all MAC and NDS headers stripped, and then parsed the data from there.  the first 32 bytes are pallete information.  16 unique 15-bit enteries.  directly after the colors comes the tile data.  from the looks of the mario icon, entry 0x0 represents transparent.  this falls in perfectly with GBA sprites and backgrounds, much like pictochat tiles do.
<br/>
<br/>
because i was working with one packet dump format (that included the NDS header, but stripped the MAC header), and then was later given some more dumps (both MAC and NSD headers stripped), the conversion app supports a command line switch to handle the two format.  i'll add a third for ones that include the MAC header as well in the next build.  currently, no extra options means packet w/ NSD w/o MAC headers, the -s option is for "small", or packets w/o NDS/MAC headers.  i'll use -m for w/ MAC/NSD headers later on.
<br/>
<br/>
now that i got basic data from the WMB packets figured out, i'm gonna start working on a WMB builder app... that is, one that takes in a BMP file and some sort of a text/ini/xml file (not sure which yet) and build a set of WMB beacons packets.  and of course, this is moving along with what others are doing to shove this data into the unit.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

Thanks tim. Yeah of course it's treating it as a u8. I made a mistake when I posted the stucture of the packet. nbMaxplayer is a u8 and the the next byte is unknown yet. But thanks to your test it's effectively seems that the u8 is linked to the nbMaxPlayer, but I must have forgotten something since when the byte is 0xFF the resulting value is "1/55". I'm gonna think about it in the following days even if I'm gonna have less time (XChristmas, ... well you know). Ho, by the way. Remember that ?

i shoved all of the "data" sections of the 10 packets into an array w/ all MAC and NDS headers stripped, and then parsed the data from there. the first 32 bytes are pallete information. 16 unique 15-bit enteries. directly after the colors comes the tile data. from the looks of the mario icon, entry 0x0 represents transparent. this falls in perfectly with GBA sprites and backgrounds, much like pictochat tiles do. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

The two last bytes (u16?) of stuff1 seems to be used by the DS to keep beacons from different games apart. At first my app was only sending the Mario 64 beacons, so only one game showed up on the DS. Then I added the Mr. Driller beacons to my app but using the "stuff1" data from Mario 64 which had a weird side-effect, the DS was combining beacons from both games into a single merged game. By changing either one bit (haven't tested all possible combinations) in byte [26] or [27] of stuff1, the DS will display two seperate games available for download and not the merged one.
<br/>
<br/>
Mario 64 = 0x0040 (u16)
<br/>
Mr. Driller = 0x0000 (u16)
<br/>
<br/>
So for example, if you that 0x0040 from Mario 64 into 0x0000, then the DS will no longer be able to distinguish Mario 64 and Mr. Driller and will display a very funny merged game :)
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, that value actually also seems to be mirrored in 2 other places in "stuff1" but it has no effect on the effect described here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I recently just picked up a DWL-122 and it does work, at least for capturing packets &amp; seeing the MAC in Netstumbler.  The only thing I had to do is change the preamble mode strictly to short. (I did this in Windows XP).  I'm now going to try the DWL-122 in Fedora Core 3, so hopefully I'll post some results.

I have a Zydas based adapter on my linux box. It has a very simple one source file driver that is easy to modify. I'd like to get up to where you guys are.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What needs to be modified is highly hardware/driver dependent.  The way I went about it, which is a terrible hack, is to take any packets that are sent to the network interface, and put them directly on the wire.
<br/>
<br/>
Normally, 802.11 drivers encapsulate the packet in a data packet type, but this is not what we want for the DS.  We need to be able to send management packets as well.  If you can figure out how to add an ioctl() or similar that just puts packets directly on the wire, that would be great as well.
<br/>
<br/>
The best situation would be getting the hardware to think it is associated with the DS so it can send out hardware ACK's and retries.  This requires technical documentation on the chipset unfortunately, as the protocol the DS uses has a few little extensions from the normal 802.11 connection process.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the atheros chipset I use seems to overwrite key values of the sent packets with it's own hardware calculated values.  I ordered a new wifi stick to try and figure out which values are modified, and the e-bay seller sent me one with a different chipset than the one I want (prism2).

That doesn't sound good. I just got a atheros card and was going to try to help out with the multiboot decoding.

Could it be that the closed source HAL conponent of the madwifi driver is altering your data? If that's the case you might be able to talk to one of the developers.

Should I bother setting up the atheros card or is it a lost cause?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
i'm new here and got this link through the xlink forum. Since i'ts practically forbidden to open your mouth over there, i thought i'd come here. I've got some info and a question.
<br/>
<br/>
First, i have 4 wifi enabled pc's at my place; three of them found a signal sent by my DS (only have one). One of them was a Sweex pci card (802.11B realtek), another one was a Medion USb nic (802.11G), and the last one was a US robotics pci 802.11G card. My laptop didn't find anything (Toshiba portege 802.11B). I used netstumbler.
<br/>
<br/>
The two PCI cards found my DS while waiting for other players in SM64 VS play, these signals were the most clear. My USB nic didn't find anything here. All three did find my DS AFTER entering a chatroom in pictochat. None of them found anything using the download option in the main menu of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time my the DS was sending 2 Mbit per second, except for the US robotics pci card that received 3.5 instead of 2. This card also 'thought' to be able to see the DS AFTER i shut it down. It was also the only card that didn't give a channel number, and didn't have a green dot next to the mac adres, but a 'network'-kind of icon.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this may be usefull to some of you that are putting together a compatibility list, i don't know.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for my question: IF the DS gets tunneled, may i assume i'm pretty safe with the wifi cards i have? I mean, at least ONE should work; right?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks...

Sure, setting it up would definitely not hurt!  It might be you have a different chipset and it will magically work.  Not likely, but who knows :).
<br/>
<br/>
Afaik, the HAL doesn't do any modification of packet data.  That is right from the developers mouth, so unless that has changed recently, it's the hardware.  I'm unsure as to which values it is modifying, and the values may be dependent on the packet type that is set when sending the packet.  So I'm still quite hopeful it will work - I just need to find out what bytes the chipset is really putting onto the wire.  Hence the ordering of wireless card #2.  Now it looks like I'm going to be getting wireless card #3 :).
<br/>
<br/>
It might be possible to get the one I ordered into promisc. mode, but the linux drivers are completely borked, so it's pretty much useless from a dev standpoint.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The reason why I think that the DWL-122 could also be used to communicate with the DS without driver is because 1) it's also USB and 2) it has *a* Prism chipset, which supposedly is documented very good.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I recently just picked up a DWL-122 and it does work, at least for capturing packets &amp; seeing the MAC in Netstumbler.  The only thing I had to do is change the preamble mode strictly to short. (I did this in Windows XP).  I'm now going to try the DWL-122 in Fedora Core 3, so hopefully I'll post some results. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the packet dump, it was while running SMB64DS, using Etheral in WindowsXP.  It showed basic information like the DS usernames, but I'm still working on getting more information out of it.  Any ideas?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

how do I setup short in xp?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Okay in XP first make sure you installed the drivers that came with the DWL-122 (on the CD).  I don't think hacked drivers will work with this, but who knows.  Anyways, then bring up Network Connections and then right click on the wireless network connection and go to properties.  
<br/>
<br/>
Inside of there, click 'Configure' for your WiFi NIC.  Then go to the tab that says "Advanced".  Inside of there you should see an option for Preamble mode.  Change it to Short.
<br/>
<br/>
That should setup the DWL-122 for short preamble mode in XP. 
<br/>
<br/>
Fire up netstumbler and it <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> see the DS.  Also Ethereal, the WinXP build, works great.  No special drivers needed.  So far I have dumped both of my DS's playing Metriod Prime together for roughly 10 minutes.  I have also done SMB64DS with both DS's as well.  Parts of the dumps show, in plain text, the name of the DS and a few other things.  If I was infront of my laptop I would post the findings, but I'm currently at work.  I will try to do this asap for anyone who is interested.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I noticed this and maybe someone else has.  When using Pictochat between two DS's, and sniffing with Ethereal, I was unable to pick up certain chat rooms.  For instance, if I used the first chat room I could not see any packets at all using the DWL-122.  But if I used the 3rd Chat Room, I would capture roughly 700+ packets/s.  Anyone else see this?  I am assuming that this is probably because of the channels that the rooms use.
<br/>
<br/>
As for using the DWL-122 in Fedora Core 3, the lights come on at first so the device does get power through the USB.  Then using NDISwrapper to install the drivers works, and FC3 can see the device and it will notice once the device is unplugged.  But doing a modprobe ndiswrapper either sits there for ever and then freezes the entire system or dumps a random error.  After dumping the error, doing a modprobe again then freezes the system.  Interesting, eh?
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is it important to be in monitor mode when sending the packets? My card doesn't seem work well after changing the driver to allow it to transmit in monitor mode.

Is it important to be in Master (ap) mode? I would think that we would want the card sending out its own management packets, so I would guess we shouldn't be in Master mode.

Check those packets with another computer.  Orinoco clone (the zd1201 appears to be one) firmwares seem to like to mangle packets.  Newer Prism2 firmwares don't corrupt beacons any more, but still "fix" sequence numbers, timestamps and will silently send retries if not explicitly told not to.  It's probably not a big deal, but it's still annoying that the frames I want transmitted are being modified.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't seem to be able to see beacon packets though. I'm using kismet for packet capture. Is there any special trick required to capture DS beacon packets?
<br/>
<br/>
When I do a multiboot transfer with Mario, Kismet detects the first packet only after I hit the "Touch to start" button on the sender DS.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't updated the programs on the site in a while, so I'm not sure what is happening with crccalc.c, but 3 seconds sounds about right for the client DS to assume the host is messed up after getting all the beacons, and then having the host fail to associate with the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The program right below will attempt to associate with the DS (and fails on my card).  Give that one a try.
<br/>
<br/>
To see the beacon packets, you'll need to be in monitor mode, and listening on the appropriate channel.  Sometimes Mario is on different channels other than 1.  Other than that I'm not sure why you wouldn't be seeing them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for the tip MadHarvey. Ethereal works nicely. I can see the beacons now.

I think Kismet is trying to throw out bad or miss-read packets. It might be getting confused with DS packet data.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the good news is that it is managing to authenticate with your chipset as well.  So that's good.  However, the bad news is that it fails at the same point mine does, in the Assoc. response.  The client DS doesn't actually send a specific message back after an Assoc. response, it just sends a normal small ACK.  However, it also sends a normal small ACK to packets it doesn't understand, but are addressed to it.  So your chipset is having the same problem that mine does.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have another wireless card that can sniff the traffic, sniffing the attempt to set up would be very useful so we can find out what the Atheros is mangling.  I'm about to get wireless card #3 for that purpose :).
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I've uploaded the new version of the code that I'm currently using.  Feel free to give that a try.  The DS won't disconnect now during the send process, but it still won't boot.  There is also code in there for connecting to a DS that it advertising a multiboot game (only tested with mario so far).  This works intermittently on my card, about 5% of the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DWL-122 I just got works great as a sniffer, and the Atheros only modifies the sequence number of the packet it sends.

Wow - that's some serious kit. So... everyone who's trying to crack DS wireless, what info would be useful to you from this sort of kit? If you ask iball nicely you might get a trove of information posted here!<br/>_________________<br/>---

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, just what is missing from the info gathered in this thread so far?
<br/>
And my work is in the info-sec field anyway, so this is pretty much standard kit for me to find unauthorized APs and walk them down.
<br/>
What I'll do is just capture all the traffic between both DS's since the Fluke can "lock-in" on which stations (DS's in this case) you wish to capture the traffic.  I'll probably just save it all in a raw packet dump everyone can open in Ethereal or something.  Plan to run Ridge Racer in multiplayer one-cart mode to try to capture the entire download to another DS.  Of course, since the carts themselves are using RSA encryption (look at the back of the DS) I don't know if the RSA chips are embedded in the DS itself or just the cart so that the entire download is also encrypted and decrypted on the fly on the guest DS itself. Good way to find out I guess.
<br/>
Also played around with pictochat a little and found that when sending anything (tap "SEND") it DOES toss it out over the air, but I didn't have enough time to do a proper capture and decode session.
<br/>
More to follow after I start working on it this weekend.
<br/>
Now, what do people want me to capture?  I mave SM 64, Ridge Racer, Asphalt, and the Metroid demo of course.  But I'm first starting with the Ridge Racer download capture.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any single cart downloads are great, as would be a complete login, message back and forth, logout sequence in pictoChat. Several people are close on sending Mario and pictoChat, but knowing the captures were totally complete would be nice. I've personally mostly looked at pictoChat, and haven't been able to catch it "logging in" to the room, so I don't know how it identifies the user names (it keeps track of the joined MACs, but doesn't seem to resend the text names.)

I was playing around with your dsmultiboot.c app. I added a small function that logs all packets sent/received into a pcap file.

This works well in itself but causes the DS handshaking to fail most of the time.

Yes the code is currently quite time critical.  In fact, that is the reason I think it is not connecting properly to the DS'es right now.  The timing when I see two DS'es locally connect is very similar every time.  And now that I updated the drivers, I can finally get past the assoc. request.  But it connects very infrequently again, and then loses connection after a few hundred packets usually.  I'm wondering if the code won't have to be in the driver itself, so it can be much more time exact.  Currently I'm noticing some rather large delays when sending data to the Atheros driver.
<br/>

I'll put up the new stuff when I have time to go into Linux.  I've been quite busy in the past week, and don't anticipate I'll have much time to work on this for a few weeks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm starting to look into the DS multiboot handshaking sequence. I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on what the last four bytes in each DS packet are for?

If you want to capture traffic then sure. Check out <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=34337#34337" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=34337#34337</a>

If you want to broadcast traffic to the DS you're going to need to write your own code. It'd be great if you took the KisMAC source and altered it to work as a tool to send DS traffic. I'm pretty sure the needed functions are there to send raw 802.11 frames.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing around with Gladius's multiboot.c program over the weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
I can get past the Association request/response but get stuck on the beginnings of the data transfer.
<br/>
<br/>
I've modified the program to insert the frame crc after each packet and that seems to work fine.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I'm having is when I send the data + CF Poll packet I only get an ack back from the DS not the Data + Ack which I see when sniffing the two DS's talking together.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the data packet I'm sending and the ack I get back.
<br/>
<br/>
Data packet:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Ack packet:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The DS will ack these data packets for a while but eventually it will stop responding.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the packet dump from auth to lack of response. It's in ethereal libpcap format.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://nuvie.sourceforge.net/temp/multiboot_sample.data" target="_blank">http://nuvie.sourceforge.net/temp/multiboot_sample.data</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This was just reconstructed from packets I think I'm sending. I haven't got a second wireless card yet so I can't see what the atheros card is really sending to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts or suggestions?

Thanks that did it (after downgrading two revs on the aironet card).  Now on my powerbook I can capture DS packets and analyze with ethereal.  Very nice.  Now to do this programmatically.  If anyone has ANY code snippets that work on MacOS please post them or a link.

I'm stuck after the assoc response handshake too. I think in my case I'm not calculating the correct crc for the Data + CF-Poll packet. I don't have a second wireless card to sniff my connection at the moment so my progress is rather slow. The DS responds to my packs with a small ack. Not the data + ack that is required. :(
<br/>
<br/>
I might see if I can turn off the sequence number logic in the mad_wifi driver. Another option might be to get the driver to append the correct crc32 value before the packet goes on the wire. I'm calculating the crc in userspace ATM which will be incorrect if the driver changes any info in the packet before sending.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, good to hear people are still banging away on this.  eric, the atheros hardware automatically adds the crc to the packets from what i've seen.  If you are adding your own crc, you are simply putting an extra 4 bytes of bad data on the end of the packet.  Try taking the CRC calculation out.  Also, the sequence number is hardware controlled, I haven't been able to find a hardware switch for it either.
<br/>
<br/>
I've finally gotten around to posting my source for connecting to the DS (along with the modified drivers).  Unfortunately, as I stated before it is very flaky and appears to be quite timing dependent, I haven't been able to get past a few hundred packets exchanged.  And most of those are retries.  Have at it though, and good luck :).
<br/>
<br/>
The modified madwifi drivers do not modify anything except for the sequence number, and this is controlled by hardware, but this appears to not matter (it might of course, but as I've been able to connect without fixing it, I'm ignoring it for now).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have disabled hardware retry/acks in the new driver when sending packets, which is what allowed the progress to be made.

I tried your modified driver and source code. I still seem to be getting plain short acks back from the DS after the association response is sent. I'm planning to get another wifi card soon so I can see what's going on. I borrowed an old atmel based USB wifi device from a friend but it doesn't support permiscuous mode. :(

from here, the srv starts a layer 3 handshaking process that doesnt seem to work w/ my card :(  about 10-15 packets into it, the two unit exchange names and other peices of information about themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
also, make sure you keep sending the beacons, this way the DS doesnt drop your connection.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

I have a dwl-122 too. I tried to get it  sniffing on my G5 powermac. Using Kismac I only seem to get every other packet. It looks like I'm capturing under 50% of the traffic. :-(
<br/>
<br/>
I switched back to linux on an old celeron 600Mhz machine and got a near perfect capture.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any trick to getting kismac to capture cleanly?
<br/>
<br/>
I did notice that it kept trying to set the channel hop freq to 0.25 seconds. I only selected channel 1 so it shouldn't try to hop but I have a feeling this value might be causing my packet loss.

<br/>
Of the games I have I've only ever seen my DS broadcast on channels 1, 7, and 13 so you can set KisMAC to only hop between those channels in the Drivers Prefs window. Once you've found which channel the DS is using then tell KisMAC to only use that channel.

I have been working on trying to figure out what makes it so unreliable, there has just been no new progress.  Besides, even if I did get it working, it would be with one specific type of chipset on linux to boot.  I don't see a huge number of people using that, so it would be more for the technical achievement than anything.  It'll probably end up being cheaper and faster to build/buy a passthrough than use the wireless.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If I had the knowledge to do this I'd be doing it as well.  I think if we got a few DSs together and put them through some network exersizes that we'd have a bit more insight into what's happening.  If it takes getting it working on just one chipset on just one platform, then do it.  someone will do what they can to port it over.

This is the end of the Multiboot Initiation

Multiple Multiboot Initiations can be sent as the DS will not attempt to connect until the user has selected a game. The DS now sends a download request and waits for another transmission, the Multiboot Game is now sent in a similar format.

Now that things on the ds homebrew development front seem to be calming down I have decided to switch to wifi dev again. However, instead of writing a Windows driver for hardware that might not even be suited for what I want to do, I have decided to take the Linux route seeing that the rtl8180-sa2400 open source driver now recently also supports the GCT RF chip used by my card. So far I managed to compile/install the driver and associcate with my neighbour's unprotected wireless router. Tomorrow I will perform some tests by modifying the driver source code to see which fields of an outgoing 802.11 frame are modified by the hardware.

Well, suppose that's true. You'd still have to find a way to signal the DS first, in "RAW" mode, to enable this supposed hidden feature. And that can't be done with the use of a "router" as they claim, a standard router plainly doesn't know how to communicate with the DS natively.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, however, these people claim two things;
<br/>
- You don't need a NIC, only a router, to use their software.
<br/>
- Their software works with all routers, impossible as you'd need to hack the firmware of each and every model on the market seperately.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1) I think this is the wrong thread to be asking that.
<br/>
2) Why didn't you look it up for yourself. It's clear in the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=19" target="_blank">DS Flash Equipment board</a>, in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5430" target="_blank">Tim's WifiMe thread</a>, that if your card isn't a PCI/PCMCIA card listed on the <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">Compatibility page</a>, then it won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
If everyone keeps asking if their card works then we'd have to search and answer their question every day for months.
<br/>
<br/>
Think I'm being rude? On the contrary, to humor you I looked your card up in case it's a new version of the compatible Asus card. I downloaded the drivers and peeked at the .inf file. It doesn't look like a RT2560-based chipset. Look at the black microchip on your card and tell me what it says though (the big square one).
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok so I started reading this thread a few days ago, and only after I got passed the 3rd of december did I realize that this thing was a year old. I was so excited about the effort and the hopes that people would create the possibility to upload game demos to the DS or to tunnel local-only multiplayer to Net multiplayer that I didn't notice the discrepency in the year.
<br/>
<br/>
Not that I want to revive past failures (if it is one), but what's up with just letting this go? I realize that there were difficulties with the dropped signal, but I can't beleive a whole community would just leave everything be, forget about the whole story, and move on.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that Nintendo has actually released their WiFi network (which I've tried with MK:DS), wouldn't there be more to learn from it? Can't more analyse be done in order to complement what was already acheived and revive the effort?
<br/>
<br/>
It's too bad I have no clue how wireless works (I'm just your run-of-the-mill php programmer), or I'd work on this day and night as Darkdain has done... :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, and the recent tests work fantasticaly.
<br/>
I can detect 6 Wi-Fi connections with it from where I am sitting (4 of which are unsecured ;p)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
