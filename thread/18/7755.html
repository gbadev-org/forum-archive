    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if anyone wants some DS ready models so play with, I can supply so long as you give me instructions on how you want the data (and keep me informed etc)
<br/>
<br/>
I can't satisfy a large number of requests but would rather prefer to work one on one with a team or anyone doing thier own fair bit of homebrew development.
<br/>
<br/>
Email me if you're interested. (info@dadako.com -&gt; requires varification)
<br/>
<br/>
a small selection of my models are on my homepage, but this would be custom modelling (a 200 poly animated fish, and so on. Nothing complex)
<br/>
<br/>
All models supplied would be copyright free and can also be linked here for other developers to play with.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://hawken.dadako.com" target="_blank">hawken.dadako</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
