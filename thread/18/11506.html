    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've searched to forum, and I've found a little bit of information on this, but it was all pretty low level. I'm hoping there's some easy way (like part of a library) to create a sprite larger than the default sizes? Like, if I wanted to create a sprite that was 128x128? It looks like the standard way to do this is by creating 4 64x64 sprites, but has someone already created a simple library that will load a file, then treat it as multiple sprites automatically? Would it be better just to use a background instead? 
<br/>

I'm trying to create a game that will have layered components, like there will be a circle on the top which you have to do something with (maybe move it with the stylus), then below that, a large square which you have to trace, something like that. So basically, I need to be able to manipulate all of these components, like you can with sprites.
