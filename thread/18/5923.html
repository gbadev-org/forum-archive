    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on an exporter for generating boned animations similar to those used by Metroid from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.misfitcode.com/misfitmodel3d/" target="_blank">Misfit Model 3D</a> It is like a less polished version of Milkshape (including MS3D import/export) but open source and has versions for Linux, Windows and (as soon as my changes are integrated) OS X.

None of my stuff will be ready for a couple of weeks, but if anybody who has been using display lists has any strong, informed opinions about how to do things feel free to speak up. It would also be great if anybody wanted to start playing with MM3D and make a model with some animations or volunteer for testing once the code is working.
<br/>

Finally, has anyone successfully displayed Samus from the Metroid dump? I can't get all of her pieces to line up, even though it seems like the transform stack stuff should be pretty simple. I'm using the wrong matrix for the parent or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
