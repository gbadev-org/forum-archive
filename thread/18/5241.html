<br/>
The N64
<br/>
<br/>
The CPU is a MIPS 64bit RISC at 93.75 MHz (Customized R4300 Series).
<br/>
<br/>
The memory type is, Rambus 36 MBits = 4.5 MB?s of 9-bit DRAM with a maximum transfer speed of 4,500 MBits/sec = 562.5 MB/s to the CPU, GPU and DSP. There is an additional 4 MB card to boost the memory to 8.5 MB?s. So therefore the bandwidth is doubled.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a Co-Processor, which includes a built in sound processor, graphics processor, and pixel drawing processor running at 62.5 MHz
<br/>
<br/>
Resolution is 256 x 224 and max of 640 x 480 dots with flicker free interlace mode support
<br/>
<br/>
Colour is 32-bit RGBA pixel color frame buffer support, 21-bit color video output
<br/>
<br/>
The Graphics Performance features
<br/>
1. Anti-aliasing which smoothes out jagged edges
<br/>
2. Microcode-Custom CPU control instructions optimized for audio, lighting, graphic details
<br/>
3. Texture Mapping puts a bitmap picture, or texture onto a surface
<br/>
4. Trilinear MIP-map interpolation-Subtly blends colors and patterns of texture maps to make objects more realistic, even as they move closer to you
<br/>
5. Z-Buffer-Keeps stuff in the right place even if you?re moving quickly. Objects maintain their true special relationships
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The DS
<br/>
CPU 1 = ARM9 at 67 MHz which is very close to the specs of the ARM920T
<br/>
CPU2 = ARM7 at 33 MHz which is very close to the specs of the ARM720T
<br/>
<br/>
Both have 32-bit addresses, and are more powerful than the N64?s CPU. Though the Co-Processor of N64 does beat it in frequency speeds, if the DS?s CPU?s work by themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
The Main Memory is 4 MB, and is more than enough because the screen is only 3? and is big enough to have a clear image of 256x192, because of the screen size. Plus the 2 screens are LCD?s which is a bonus.
<br/>
The DS can output way more colours than the N64, where theoretically the n64 can do 16.7 Million/sec, it can only do average 32 000. The DS can go up to 260 000/sec and can output as many as 200 000 Polys/sec, which is around the same as the N64, though I think its more by 50 000. The N64 has to share its video memory with the main memory, but the DS does have an extra 656 KB of video memory.
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, this is why the DS is better technically, and much better the way you play your games </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
