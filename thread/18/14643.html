<br/>
Doing 3D on two screens is something that is a little involved. Look up 'capture' with the search function and I'm sure you'll turn up loads of "3D on two screens" posts.
<br/>
If you just want 3D on one screen and want to choose which screen it is, set the main graphics controller to use 3D as you've done and then use either lcdMainOnTop() or lcdMainOnBottom() to choose which physical screen it's on.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
