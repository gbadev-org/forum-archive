<br/>
<br/>
Yes, GBA skins differ from the NDS skins. That's an entirely different issue, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Before you go about doing this, you should be using some image editing software. Photoshop is preferrable, though free stuff like IrfanView work, too.
<br/>
<br/>
For NDS themes, you need to first decide on what you want to use for the following backgrounds:
<br/>
- Main menu
<br/>
- e-Book
<br/>
- Music
<br/>
- File list
<br/>
<br/>
These backgrounds should be 256x192 24-bit BMPs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then there's the icons:
<br/>
- Movies
<br/>
- Photos
<br/>
- Music
<br/>
- Games
<br/>
- eBooks
<br/>
- Settings
<br/>
<br/>
Which should be 64x64 24-bit BMPs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And of course there's the two folder icons:
<br/>
- Directory
<br/>
- Up-one Directory
<br/>
<br/>
Which should be 16x16 24-bit BMPs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Positioning the icons:
<br/>
The skinning software uses a grid-coordinate system to place icons (X and Y axes, or horizontal and vertical values)
<br/>
<br/>
Now obviously since the screen resolution is 256x192, your icons will go horizontally from 0 to 256 and vertically from 0 to 192.
<br/>
<br/>
The original locations of the icons are set as default values in the main app. Typically, the first row of icons is set at a Y value of 42 and the icons are spaced out equally by a difference of 40 in X-terms.
<br/>
<br/>
The second row is also spaced out by 40 in X-terms, but are level at 110 on the Y-axis.
<br/>
<br/>
I really don't know if that helps in the least. I may have confused you further, but I tend to do that.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e", 
<br/>
7 is not a "t", 
<br/>
1 is not an "l",
<br/>
