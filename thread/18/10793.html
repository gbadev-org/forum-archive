    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a big fan of the High Voltage Sids Collection, I was wondering if anyone is in the process of, or considering porting over Sidplay2. I've not found any information on a DS port, but I'm hoping someone might give it a go. (Wish I had the skills, but sadly do not.)

There was a Sid player on the GBA, but it had tunes in the rom, and no method to build your own. The prospect of using the DS and having the entire collection on a flash cart is something I really hope someone can pull off... 
<br/>
<br/>
If they could manage to pull the STIL info as well and display it, I'd probably just collapse in a giggling, quivering heap.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
