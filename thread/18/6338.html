    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guys im looking for advice on how to revert back to the original ds firmware i.e. remove the unsigned code firmware that was flashed previously.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there an easy way to go about this? What do i need? and has anyone successfully achieved this?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Read to the end of the text where you will find the noflashme.ds.gba which you can execute in the same manner as the modified firmware. It will revert back to the old firmware.

Also i'm slightly concerned by the note following this which reads 
<br/>
<br/>
"Note: not recommended!
<br/>
DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL OLDER VERSIONS !"
<br/>
<br/>
Is this said with reference to the un-installer?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's not recommended because the uninstall process will not write the recovery code like the modified firmware does. So if the flash process fails at any given stage, the DS will become useless.
<br/>
<br/>
"DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL OLDER VERSIONS !" means you should not install an older version of the modified firmware if you already have a newer modified firmware on your DS.

You won't need passme or wifime to run homebrew code from your gba card once you flased the custom firmware onto your ds.
<br/>
In addition to that, you will also be able to run unsigned multiboot code on your DS via the download play function. To do so you need a wireless PCI or PCMCIA Card with an RT25xx Chipset and the Wireless Multiboot Application and custom drivers from <a class="postlink" href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/download.htm" target="_blank">firefly</a>.
<br/>
Another nice feature is that the health care screen at the beginning was taken out.
<br/>
<br/>
You will of course need Wifime or Passme once to actually flash the firmware.

I have done this before...had to do it to my old NDS.  The L Button was acting wacky for some reason, had to send it in for repairs (using Nintendo's program where they send you a new DS, you send them the bad one)...apparently I was entirely successful as I've not been charged 150 dollars for a new Nintendo DS yet. ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
