    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello
<br/>
Ive some questions about the 3D hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Are primitives outside the viewing frustrum automatically removed?
<br/>
or do Ive do remove them myself (do they count as the 2000 primitives that can be drawn, if they are outside)?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Just want to make sure, it doesnt exist a hardware far and near clippi plane, huh?
<br/>
<br/>
3. What is GFX_VERTEX10, is it like GFX_VERTEX16 but with another format? The name sounds like it is 6:10 fixed but I tried and got funky output so what is it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
