    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What languages can I use as a base to make a simple point and click game on NDS?
<br/>
Can I use Visual Studio, Visual C++?
<br/>
I've almost completed a version using AGS, and would like to port it to NDS. I wouldn't be able to use the scripting from AGS would I?  Haven't looked at it yet.
<br/>
Sorry if it has been asked but have a 3 month old and don't have alot of time to look!
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, basically DS coding involves mainly a lot of raw C/C++ without much of the usual stuff that Windows coding loads onto you...
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get up and running quickly then PALib is a good place to look...
<br/>
<br/>
I've actually been thinking of looking into porting and OSS Adventure Game engine to the DS, but haven't had much time to do anything other than investigate what's available...
<br/>
<br/>
I take it by AGS you are referring to the Adventure Game Studio, eh?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks.
<br/>
I'll try a few of those suggestions.
<br/>
I actually have a diploma in programming its just been 4 years since I've used any of it and am not too familiar with C++.
<br/>
I wish there was a program for point and click games for DS as there is for PSP.
<br/>
I think it would boom the DS homebrew even further.
<br/>
And yes, I am referring to Adventure game studio.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While you can run existing ScummVM games on the DS, making new ones is not an option.
<br/>
<br/>
Hence, the easiest solution might be to port an existing adventure game toolkit...
<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at MAD from SourceForge. It's got it's pluses and minuses. Development on it ceased back in 2003, so the source is fairly stable, I think (Latest version is 2.0 beta though...). However, it uses Allegro, so that would need to be re-worked. It's also likely the graphics code would need to be reworked and the input code as well...
<br/>
<br/>
Probably quite a job, although I think some people would appreciare it :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
