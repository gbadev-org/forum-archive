    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
Im busy for a long time to use my own sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
I first started with the smantouch demo, i tried to make my own sprites. But when i got my own sprites in it it is scrambled.
<br/>
<br/>
So after that i tried alot, but now i saw someone who also had a scrambled sprite.
<br/>
<br/>
He posted his code and he used gfx2gba the a .raw and a .pal file cames out of it. But his code gives an error on display_spr_1d because he doesn't know this function. when i edit this to display_spr_1d_layout it still doesnt works on hardware. I only get 2 white screens...
<br/>
<br/>
So now i still have'n't used my own sprites!!!! ARRggg
<br/>
<br/>
Does someone has a code running on hardware too, wich shows one sprites that is made with gfx2gba???
<br/>
<br/>
HELP please!!!
<br/>
<br/>
thank you in advance!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
