    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been reading everything I can about the new DS. I even read about the other systems (PSP, TapWave, Gizmondo, N-Gage) when I run out of new material (which is everyday right now!).
<br/>
<br/>
I have realized that I am probably sufferring from mild to moderate anxiety waiting for the DS to arrive - <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">DS STRESS!</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">(pronouced DiS STRESS).</span>
<br/>
I also realized that I am probably not the only one. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, I have a solution for this - <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">DS STRESS</span></span>. If we all join together we can put pressure on Nintendo to release <span style="font-style: italic">discount vouchers </span>as a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">compensation</span></span> for our <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">DS STRESS</span></span>, say maybe 10% or 20% off the purchase price, or maybe a free game or something. 
<br/>
<br/>
AHHHHHH.... maybe I'm just dreaming again..... just another sympton of <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">DS STRESS! </span></span>:)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll go back to studying my C programming and try to take my mind off the DS...........................  <span style="font-style: italic">NINTENDO YOU ARE EVIL!</span> ;)<span style="color: darkred"></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suppose, but the problem still exists for baseball games, where the batter to pitcher frame is still too small to properly portray the flight of the ball between the mound and the plate. Its still too cramped. The 2nd screen would not help in this situation. The screens really should have been just a tad bigger, like say another inch :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Is the screen size really that big of a deal!? In fact I think the two screens together will be equal or more than the PSP. (this statement is made without actually checking - so don't bash me on it.) 
<br/>
<br/>
This actually allows for many more options such as Full Screen Views, First Person and Overhead Views Simultaneously, Maps, ect....
<br/>
Only the Developers imaginations will limit us. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think the DS <span style="font-style: italic">and the PSP </span>are both pushing the limits for <span style="text-decoration: underline">size</span> as far as handhelds go. Lets face it the SP is sweeeet! It is so small you can literally stash it anywhere and I really don't ever remember anyone complaining about screen size on the SP.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes I agree that we don't want it being too big, I'm just saying an inch or even a half inch would have made it a more pleasant experience. Even though there are two, you won't (likely) be able to render 3d on both simultaneously, and at any given point you're still looking (i.e. squinting) at one of those small screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I'm not suggesting it should be like the PSP, just that it should have been a more meaningful difference in size than the GBA's screen.. Its probably the only area I'm dissapointed on, aside from the DS' tenuous ugliness.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just curious if EB's policies are the same across the country (CANADA)
<br/>
I asked about the DS on Saturday at an EB store in the Toronto area. They said they required a min. $10 down and the current list price for the DS is $349 (surely will be lower, but that's what they have to cover their butts right now). Also, currently I have seen no stores with any posters, advertizement or listings of any kind, in the store (<span style="font-style: italic">DS or PSP</span>). Is it the same out west?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#23711 - mymateo - Mon Jul 19, 2004 8:43 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm...
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn't see any posters of any kind for ANY of the upcoming new systems.  I don't know what the minimum payment is, but when I said I wanted to pre-order the guy said "Sure, if you want you can pay something like $50 now and the rest when you get it, or you can pay for it all now." so it might be $50.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the cost of the unit, it's $299.99 plus taxes, and since BC has a total tax (GST and PST combined) of 14.5%, the total came out to $343.49.  And of course, the same rule applies.  This is just their high-end estimate, the price may drop and if it does, then I get a credit for everything I paid extra.
<br/>
<br/>
On top of that, the receipt says "NEW RELEASE PRODUCTS WILL BE HELD FOR 48 HOURS AFTER RELEASE" - so this means that since the DS is supposed to come out on Nov 30 (could be changed - WAS the 29th at one point I believe), that means I won't get it until December 2nd.  But that's okay, I couldn't handle working the tuesday whilest my beloved DS waits at home for my loving caress - er, maybe I should rephrase that.. Heh heh heh, naw!  So thursday is perfect since I get thursday off.  I won't be getting much sleep, I'll be like a child on Christmas Eve, in line first thing AM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would like to see where you found this information.  Wal-mart (www.walmart.com) and EB (www.ebgames.com) both agree on the release date within a day of eachother, placing it at the end of November.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have not heard of a release date being moved up.  It's usually pushed back if anything.  Like Tales of Symphonia.  It was supposed to be released back in February or something (I forget when, but it was in Q1), but was instead released in mid-july (nearly the end of Q2).
<br/>
<br/>
And I have a forboding feeling...
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone heard of ANY games for the DS being released WITH the DS?  So far, I have found a bunch being released in March 2005, and the same ones on another site posted to be released in June 2005.
<br/>
<br/>
Who wants to bet that if ANYthing, the DS gets pushed to March 2005 with its games, of that the games get pushed back to November 2004, and that the DS won't come out a single day sooner than November 29th?
<br/>
<br/>

Retailers pull release dates out of their asses, it's just the way they do business.  Anytime you see a retailer state a release data, you can safely ignore it.

I'm pretty sure that Pokemon one was going to be an actual game (I want it :) ).  I think that mario sidescroller and the mario 64x4 were as well.  I certainly hope that mario sidescroller gets released, I've been wanting another one ever since I finished Mario World (And Yoshi's Island doesn't count).  The 3D mario games are great, but they still don't compare to that 2D gaming goodness.

News surfaced recently of a Nintendo DS launch date and pricing revelation, purportedly from Japanese retail sources. According to the rumors, Nintendo's upcoming handheld will be launched in Japan on November 4th at 19,000 Yen ($175), followed by <span style="font-style: italic">a U.S. debut November 11th at $179.95</span>. The report further claims that the console will launch along with <span style="font-style: italic">five to six software titles</span>, with eleven titles planned by the end of 2004. 
<br/>
Although the pricing and launch seems reasonable enough, no Japanese retail sites nor gaming sites have confirmed nor supported the rumor--interestingly, Japanese gaming sites have been linking to U.S. gaming sites for the source of the report supposedly originating in Japan--making the "Japanese retail sources" suspect. Nintendo has neither denied nor commented on the rumors.</span>
<br/>

I would be particularly interested if you can dig up the Miyamoto link.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the poll is a great idea! I have one request though, when stating prices could it be clarified as to the currency - eg. US dollars. This would make the poll clearer to those of us who are Canadian. I also think it would make the poll more accurate. For example - had I not checked where you were posting from, I might have picked #3 $129.99 - $149.99. However seeing that you are from Texas you clearly mean US dollars, in which case I would pick #2 $99.99 - $129.99, which would place the price at about $125 - $165 for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would SERIOUSLY LOVE IT if the prices were as low as roughly $170 CDN.  I have paid $300 <span style="font-style: italic">plus tax</span> for my DS and I am pretty broke because of it (I mean, not to say I could find the money to buy every DS game at release, but I'm thinking of eating... ever...).  So if I could get about $130 of credit towards games unexpectedly, I would seriously have to sit down.
<br/>

Sadly, I highly doubt that the prices will be that low.  BUT that's what the poll will be for, right? :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm posting to this old topic since I'm sure the level of DS Stress has risen for many of us.
<br/>
<br/>
To recap:
<br/>
<br/>
The Nindendo will launch in North America on November 21st.  
<br/>
In the United States, the DS will cost $149.99 USD, games starting at $29.99
<br/>
In Canada, the DS will cost $199.99 USD, games starting price unofficial at $39.99 with exchange rate, more likely $49.99 (that's the pre-order price for games that cost $29.99 USD in the States)
<br/>
<br/>
The fated day is only 13 days away counting today, 12.5 if you account for the time to wait for stores to open and don't count today, or 12 days an 2 hours (for western Canada/USA, adjust for your time zone) if you don't count today or the time it'll take for stores to open.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going crazy!  I want my DS.  I've got my DS, 1 year full "accidental" damage coverage (if I 'accidentally' run over it, that's covered!!), Super Mario 64 DS and Feel the Magic: XY/XX all pre-ordered and paid for.  I'll get Feel the Magic nice and early 'cause the release date is November 15.  I don't know if that'll help my DS Stress at all 'cause staring at the game and reading the book will only make me want to play it on the DS even more!
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else getting as impatient as I am??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking through the old posts many of us in Canada were really hoping the DS would come in around the $150-$170 price range. However, knowing now what is packaged with the DS (pictochat, Metroid demo) and knowing now more of the details of all the great features of the DS, $199.98 or whatever is still a great price for what you are getting.
<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone would agree - No!?
<br/>
<br/>
Someone told me that on the weekend at a local EB Games, the DS Tour came in for people to try the DS, They brought an alotment of 150 DS's to be sold on the 21st - they were all spoken for (prepaid - new orders) within the first hour!<br/>_________________<br/>Age is only in your mind!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Holy guacamole!  My local EB has only pre-sold 4 DS units...  Hey everyone, EB Penticton will have extra DS's if you want one!!!
<br/>
<br/>
But, anyways... Yeah, two hundred smackers and tax is nothing compared to what you get!  Let's look, shall we?
<br/>
<br/>
GameBoy Advance - Price just dropped to $99.99 CDN
<br/>
1 screen
<br/>
1 CPU at 16 MHz
<br/>
1 Speaker
<br/>
6 buttons + D-Pad
<br/>
1 Game slot
<br/>
1 Peripheral connector
<br/>
1 Headphone jack (GBA) / 1 Power+Headphone jack (needs adapter, GBASP)
<br/>
Needs 2xAA (GBA) / Li-Ion w/ 10 hr life with light on (GBASP)
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS - Price recently "dropped" to $199.99 CDN
<br/>
2 Screens
<br/>
2 CPU - 1x33 HMz 1x66 MHz
<br/>
2 Speakers
<br/>
8 Buttons + D-Pad
<br/>
2 Game slots
<br/>
0 Peripheral connector - more or less
<br/>
1 Headphone jack
<br/>
1 Headset jack (Speculated, may or may not be official, I'm not 100%)
<br/>
1 Power connector (Headphone if adapter used??  Probably not...)
<br/>
Li-Ion battery w/ 6-10 hour life, depending on use
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so it looks like you're getting basically double the hardware for double the price, some cases the hardware is a little better than double (well, CPU is anyways).  But wait!  Did I forget something??  :) *smiles evily*
<br/>
<br/>
Let's not forget the DS has...
<br/>
-Touch screen
<br/>
-Microphone (Meh... we'll see how much fun THAT is...)
<br/>
-16 channel audio (GBA had 2... TWO!  Plus 4 channels for GB legacy support... even then, only 6 total!!)
<br/>
-Did I mention <span style="text-decoration: underline">touch</span> screen?  *drool*  One touch screen is worth mentioning twice!!
<br/>
-Speaking of screens, anyone else notice the DS has <span style="font-weight: bold">back</span>lit screens?  Not an afterthought-<span style="font-weight: bold">front</span>-lit-screen-a-la-GBASP
<br/>
-Wireless... can we say EXTRA FUN AT NO EXTRA COST?  MUA HA HA!
<br/>
-Let's not forget 260,000 colors (versus... what, 32,000 before?)
<br/>
-And 3D.  No modern console is complete without 3D these days.  120G Polys/second.  Poly wanna cracker?
<br/>
-And poly ain't squaking after we mention built-in software!  That hasn't been done for a LONG time... (truxton last time I looked into it... which was never, to be honest...)
<br/>
<br/>
And throw on top of that the fact that Nintendo is also including Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt with the DS for a limited time (which probably means a couple months after the full game is released).
<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone who thinks that the DS is expensive has an excuse to buy one now!  Especially if you bought your GBASP before the price drop, when it was $139.99 CDN, like I did.  Now that you skeptics see that Nintendo is giving you MORE than twice the bang for your buck - and that's a NEW system versus an OLD system - you should go out and pre-order your DS!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  Forgot to mention DS has higher resolution... 256x192 vs. 240x160</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You forgot homebrew. DS homebrew is through flash cards only, cannot use extra buttons, can use only 16.8 MHz CPU, cannot use the faster CPU, the bottom screen, the mic, the wireless, the X and Y buttons, or any of the other new features. Unless and until the HK pirates crack the DS media, the biggest advantage of the DS over the SP is the second built-in speaker, which should help convince GBA sound developers to use stereo sound. I know that at least I'm going to be rewriting my GBA mixer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Although I agree that comparing the DS to the Game King (which I have only just heard of yesterday), I still think tepples makes some valid points.
<br/>
<br/>
However, those points being:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Current homebrew only benefits from an extra speaker
<br/>
2) Sound isn't better... in regards to current homebrew capabilities
<br/>
3) Video isn't better... in regards to current homebrew capabilities
<br/>
<br/>
All of those valid points are nullified when you consider that once we can develop for the DS we'll have access to all the buttons, all the extra hardware, 16 HARDWARE sound channels, both CPU's at full speed, and all that beautiful colorful video.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, some people CAN "tell the difference between 256 color gameplay and 16x16 color gameplay, or between a 256 color title screen and a 32K color title screen...".  And I'm willing to bet that a picture in full 262,144 colors looks much nicer than the same picture dithered down to 32,768 colors.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the Game King, I'm going to be too busy with my DS to notice when/if it gets released in North America.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only thing I can do is pre-order a couple more games, get further in debt, and want my DS even more!!!  ARGH!  THERE IS NO CURE!!!</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Heh, Well I guess it's not so much of a cure as it is a preventative measure ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a little easier for me to wait since I know I'm not getting one anytime soon. *sigh*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And if you can't find any place nearby to get one (pre-sold out or something), PM me 'cause like I said before my local EB, last time I checked about a week ago, only had 4 DS pre-orders, so they'll probably have some <span style="font-style: italic">on the shelf</span> for a few days after launch!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can't wait until the DS has been figured out, and flash cards are made.  Ooh, there are so many things I could make this puppy do... if only...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd love to take the credit, but me being me, I must confess I took this offa some guy on the Nintendo forums... he probably got it from someone else, who probably got it from someone else... or hey, I might have even stole it from the original creator.  Heh, but it IS pretty awesome...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
