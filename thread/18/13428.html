I have sent a few emails and have received no reply. I could see a couple days for a turnaround but this is getting ridiculous.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, this is a huge problem. If noone trust the ordering-mechanism, no sales are generated - and if no sales are generated, chances are development interests in the project are lost. Personally, I'd like to purchase a copy, but reports of poor sales-support has led me to believe I could waste a lot of time or money on it. Too bad, since I really hate ******** something I can afford (and want to purchase), simply because I can't trust the dealer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am currently supplying martin with whatever info possible, for the nintendo e-reader and that stuff.  (I even supplied him the actual e-reader, all the cards that came with it, and a few printed homebrew demos.)
