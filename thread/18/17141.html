    <h4>#172854 - ritz - Mon Mar 08, 2010 5:16 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am in agreement with wintermute's lastest posts about ARGV, filesystems, etc. that I'm sure most of you have read as well. Perhaps users here reading this could go to their particular card's forum and post a suggestion or bug report in regards to ARGV support and exit-to-menu support missing. I would suggest linking here: <a href="http://wiki.devkitpro.org/index.php/Homebrew_Menu" target="_blank">http://wiki.devkitpro.org/index.php/Homebrew_Menu</a> for the firmware guys to refer to. Also, in your homebrew projects, how about a text/splash screen describing the problem when ARGV isn't found and to report this to the card's firmware support? And yea, we should drop abandoned libraries (EFS). This will cause grief in the future (well, and now too).
<br/>
<br/>
I currently run libfat 1.0.4 with EFS for performance reasons and for card compatibility. I do check for ARGV first and use that if exists, but do the EFS card searching thing if that fails (I've never liked that).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">However</span>, I'm going to move to the toolchain supplied libfat version, drop EFS and go to libfilesystem. I'm not very good with low level type stuff but I'll try to figure out a "patch-submittable" way to optionally not use the new caching in libfat introduced in 1.0.5 (this really slows things down for me). I'll add the splash screen about ARGV too. No more card searching with abandoned code.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if some *significant* homebrew were to do the ARGV text/splash screen we would see some early success with most cards.
<br/>
<br/>
My two cents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Initially I'd say the hb auther for not testing with a working hbmenu, since this is the way that we want all future hb code to run, I'd say that if the code does not work with the hbmenu then it needs to be looked at by the hb dev to see why it fails.

Cool idea, but I'm wondering if sending people to a page called "hbmenu" after telling them their firmware seems a little bit illogical. Perhaps a page called "devkitpro.org/firmware" would be easier to understand/remember for people who doesn't know the issue in advance?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I like the image, but I think the message is unclear. why would somebody ask for an update just because a program supports argv. the problem isn't that the program supports argv, but that the cards firmware <span style="font-style: italic">doesn't</span> support it. it also doesn't mention homebrewmenu anywhere, but still links to a page about it. I would also suggest people to use the homebrewmenu, since that is easier for them. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think that this would be a better message:
<br/>
"Your flashcards firmware doesn't support the argv protocol. Please use the homebrewmenu or contact your flashcard manufacturer for an update. For more information, see <a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/hbmenu" target="_blank">www.devkitpro.org/hbmenu</a> ."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would also help to at least email some card manufacturers. if 1 or 2 starts supporting it, the rest should follow soon to not stay behind.<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:

Please forgive me for being a bit harsh yesterday, but I think the answer to sverx' original question is that currently no carts ships with argv-support in their native firmware (but I do not know for sure, as I haven't researched a lot of carts).
<br/>
<br/>
That Acecard promotes a replacement firmware that does is very good, and surely makes Acecard one of the best options.
<br/>
<br/>
But it wasn't what the question was about (AFAICT), and I suspect that just asking the user to upgrade his firmware (as headspin's suggested warning-screen did) would make a lot of people try the latest OFFICIAL firmware, and not AKAIO. Surely, more information could be put on the devkitpro-wiki, but there being a link on the warning-screen doesn't mean that everyone will try it. Users are notoriously bad at reading error-messages, especially after reading the first line ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think they need an incentive bigger than "it implements unknown standard x" to throw money and development resources at it... like some popular-enough DS software requiring it. It's kind of a chicken-and-egg problem; who bothers to spend a lot of time writing some solid software that might not be runnable at any decent card (and that they can't test)? AKAIO and Hbmenu are clearly the solution to that, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not like they actually have to throw money &amp; development resources at it ( and I'm pretty sure they have a *lot* of the former - one of the UK retailers who got jailed recently had 26K R4 cards in stock).

<br/>
Hbmenu is open source, it works on the cards I've managed to find a means to replace the menu on and it implements the argv &amp; exit functionality. Obviously it'll be a little more attractive once we get the akaio gui in there but I'm really not sure what else we can do.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Every change costs money and development resources, even if the code is already written. You still have to do integration, QA and packaging - which can often amount to a lot more than the coding.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, having a lot of money doesn't mean that one wants to spend it on thing that doesn't clearly increase the market-value of their product. Especially if what you said about 90% of all DS-owners holds true; there's certainly not anywhere near 90% of the DS-owners that run home-brew software (my guess would be in the 5-10% range), so it'd most likely be money out the window from a marketing point of view.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Something to consider though ... adding support for homebrew applications improves the legal position of their product.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
