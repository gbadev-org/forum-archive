    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For several days now, I've been thinking that the new DS game Zoo Keeper seems oddly familiar. As it turns out, Zoo Keeper has been available on the web for several years in a nearly identical format. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/zookeeper.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to play it for yourself.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, man. There's a million games that play just like that.  Bejewled is one of the most well-known. IMO, they're highly overrated games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you check out the link? It's not another bejeweled clone that <span style="font-style: italic">plays</span> like Zoo Keeper. It <span style="font-weight: bold">IS</span> Zoo Keeper, graphics and all. Identical to the DS incarnation except for the second screen. You may want to look again.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, well there's the extra element of having to match a certain number of each type (And the wildcard - not sure if that's in Bejewled or not), but Zoo Keeper and Bejeweled seem to be both based on the same general gameplay mechanic of swapping two adjacent items to match three or more in a row. Although, I'm always hesitant to call anything a "Bejeweled-clone", I'd be suprised if that really was the first one.

I don't really mean to complain, it certainly looks good (and I definately like the graphic style and general "feel" to Zoo Keeper better).  I'm just not into that style of game.  If you're thinking, "Well then why did he even post if he's not into it?", then...well...you've got a good point ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
