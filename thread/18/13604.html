    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) you don't need to write anything yourself to get tiny C++ output.
<br/>
2) that cxa pure virtual they use is illegal.  see <a href="http://sc.tri-bit.com/DsOut" target="_blank">http://sc.tri-bit.com/DsOut</a> for details.
<br/>
3) that page says very little about reducing the size of code.
<br/>
4) take advice from neimod about c++, i dare you
<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot more to turn off than RTTI and exceptions.  Try getting a compiler manual.  Stripping a C++ compiler down isn't easy.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as "no extra overhead," well, that's only if you're willing to go to the effort of swapping out newlib for a smaller runtime.  (Doubtless neimod will claim this is what he meant by "writing it yourself," which is why vague things make some people think they sound smart.)  Unfortunately, writing a C or C++ runtime is neither quick nor easy (which is why people shouldn't give advice about things they've never done,) and with all due respect, if those are the only two things you turned off in your compiler, you're not ready to write a runtime.
<br/>
<br/>
You can trim DKP C++ with newlib in standard config down to about 56k.  If you want to go smaller than that, you have to start getting familiar with the tools under the surface.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe more importantly - why are you worried about the space?  Does it really matter?<br/>_________________<br/>Quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum Sonatur

I ported Quake from C to C++ and the size went right up, however after using -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti (as you said) the binary popped out the same size in the end.

If you are in fact getting bigger output (how much bigger?), you could try building it twice - once in C and once again in C++ (assuming you can), stripping the two sets of object files and then comparing them to see which object files are bigger. Once you can see which files are bigger, it's not too hard to step in there with nm and objdump to see what exactly is getting done in your files!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not those that are causing the space increase; indeed, in such cases, all four of those members will point to the same empty stub function, which in the GCC CPPRT are called __cxa_non_virtual(...) or __cxa_pure_virtual(...) depending on how you have RTTI set up.
<br/>
<br/>
The space increase comes from the C++ runtime library.  In a weird way, Simon Hall is kinda-sorta-correct: he's passing C to g++, and getting the same size as passing it to gcc.  This is relatively amusing, because g++ is just a wrapper to gcc which passes in some information along the lines of "if you see c++ or a specific set of file extensions, start compiling as C++ instead."  If Simon would take the time to look into his ELF map, he'd discover that the reason his binary is the same size as a compiled C binary is because he made a compiled C binary; he's not making the comparison he thinks he's making.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a fundamental size increase to C++ over C that you cannot eliminate.  Just how big that size increase is depends on the library implementations and the runtime implementations you use; the C++ runtime in GHOC is about 1.4k larger than their C runtime when everything but RTTI and exceptions are turned on, and that's the smallest change I'm aware of.  I believe that the current set of libraries and design choices in DKP make the number something closer to 33k, though Wintermute is likely to know for certain.
<br/>
<br/>
That size increase is pretty plain: it's the code that calls the constructors on globals, that performs cleanup in C atexit(), that handles static allocation, that manages the placement delete segments, that contains the extra behavior for new above malloc, and so on and so forth.  I mean, there are just more things that the C++ runtime does than the C runtime does, in order to support those tools in C++ that do not exist in C; the binary size increase you're seeing is (in part) about that.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, it could be smaller.  If you want it to be smaller, you'll need to replace newlib, like I was saying before.  Newlib is the specific choice of C++ runtime (sorta) that DKP is using, and it's partially responsible for that increase in code size.
<br/>
<br/>
That all said, look, HyperHacker wanted to know how to suppress type conflict warnings in his comparisons.  He doesn't know about <span style="font-weight: bold">casting</span>.  He's not really going to write a firmware replacement, and frankly I don't think anyone would even do that in C.  There are, maybe, five people in this community who could actually pull a project like that off, and that's only after a serious amount of reading; I don't think any of us could do it from a cold start, and <span style="font-weight: bold">I've done it before</span>, so when I say I couldn't do it from a cold start, you need to hear how difficult that means this is.
<br/>
<br/>
And besides, the idea that it should be done with the C or C++ runtimes in place shows a dangerous level of naivete: the firmware has to be hard realtime, and neither the C nor C++ runtimes in DKP are; this risks stack faults, which could have literally any behavior, and it's not tremendously unlikely that such a flaw, since it's in firmware, would end up bricking the console.

I don't mean it to be disrespectful; we were all noobs at one point, and more than half of us still are.  That said, look, you need to face the truth: you do dangerously incorrect things, and you fail to understand basic principles of the language.  You really, <span style="font-weight: bold">really</span> need to follow the advice you got from everyone speaking when you were on IRC, and pick up an intro to C++ book.  I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm trying to get you past a personal inhibition and to move you towards progress.
<br/>
<br/>
You have shocking misconceptions about the language.  You're doing things that are provably incorrect.  There's undefined behavior all over your code.  You would not pass a CS 110 class.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to accept that you're a novice, and to start working on fixing that, instead of to continue to charge blindly ahead.  People who insist on doing it the way they taught themselves, instead of learning to do it right, turn into Tepples.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you really want to be a Tepples-style engineer?

Wow, this is quite some thread. These pages and pages of text do not at all help out our friend here who has big binaries. It's nice linking in books - and I'm sure that they may help in the long run - but pissing about with your DS is also a valid way of learning, as you get the practical knowledge you wouldn't get if you were just reading a book.

There were some posts about the difference between class and struct in C++ and the lack of such a difference under common practices, peppered with misunderstandings on possibly both our sides. I split them out to the C/C++ forum, where I guess that language esoterica stuff that doesn't relate specifically to the DS belongs.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway: Each feature of C++ has overhead. Some features have more overhead than others, and a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/language-lawyer.html" target="_blank">language attorney</a> licensed to practice in your jurisdiction will give you a more reliable answer.

Let me just put those few quotes together, as well as keep in mind the next quote too.
<br/>
I'm not saying you're wrong in any of this technical C stuff, neither am I saying that tepples is right. Just to please keep consistent in things you say, and stop interpreting things people say in a way to deliberately create the opportunity to bash someone else. (I'm refering to how you interpreted 'the same as') I think we can all agree to keep to the facts and lose the unnecessary flaming. We all know by now of your dislike of tepples, which I daresay is off-topic to this thread, section, and entire forum.

<br/>
Obviously I'm assuming you mean for HyperHacker to not want to become like tepples, and for him to have scorn for his "engineering style". As far as I know, HyperHacker respects tepples. Yet, I also don't think he wants to idolize him.
<br/>
<br/>
StoneCypher: I took a little look at this book (ISBN 9780201703535) and the editorial review mentions it's good even if you don't know any or minimal C. Would you recommend it to me, who's first programming was TI-83 BASIC in 8th grade? I've since learned  intermediate q-BASIC (and freeBASIC, open-source, win32 clone of QB), a small chunk of pHp, nothing with mySQL yet though, and a small bit of javascript.
<br/>
I basically know nothing of pointers, memory addresses, assembly, hexadecimal coding, etc. Though I do well in math, I'll be in calculus next year as a senior in high school. (If you reference that as evidence of my maturity level then this will continue to be a flame war.) So anyway, would you recommend that book as an introduction to C/C++? Or would a beginning C book be more appropriate?<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Still, many C++ books really are to the point where one can skip C. Reading the review of the book at Amazon leads me to believe that it should be appropriate for your skill level if you want to take up C++. If you want a C book, such as if you will be programming for a platform such as the GBA or the DS ARM7 that can't tolerate the overhead of a lot of C++'s features, get a C book.

He gets this because he earns it.  He's a clueless hack who pushes bad code on a regular basis and pretends to be a hell of a lot better than he actually is.

As far as whether I'd want this kind of treatment, you're dead wrong.  I went to IRC channels specifically to get people to tell me what was wrong with my code, and that's just how you get treated on IRC.  So please, don't speak for me until you know me.

No.  If tepples gives people bad advice with undefined behavior, I'm going to warn them, even if you don't like it.  You have an interesting idea of not passing judgement, when following through with lines like "I'm just interested in why whenever I see posts by you they're always negative."

Simon, I was active on this board before you even heard of it.  My old account got deleted for *age* before you ever even heard of me.  I don't really care what you think of how I speak.  I'm here because I have friends here who are being given extremely bad advice.

Why does Tepples piss me off?  Don't worry - when you've been around for some significant amount of time, you'll start to get it too.  If you really can't put together why it's all the people who've been around since more than the last 20 minutes who are saying bad things about Tepples, well, that's really not my problem.

Every time you ask me this, I tell you no.  I already gave you an extensive list of flaws in various posts.  You're just asking this to look like the aggrieved party; you spend so little time reading what's said to you that you neither realize that you've already received this nor that I've told you "no, no more."
<br/>
<br/>
Your attitude is too abrasive.  I will not help you further than I already have.  If you want to see the flaws, go read what I already said.  There are <span style="font-weight: bold">seventeen</span> flaws listed, and you didn't even notice.
<br/>
<br/>
What amazes me is that anyone is ever fooled by your on-the-cross act.<br/>_________________<br/>Quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum Sonatur

<br/>
In that case, it might be a better idea to use the new syntax for loop counters, which C added in 1999<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99#C99" target="_blank">[1]</a> and C++ before that:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; nFiles; ++i) {
<br/>
  // do stuff
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This way, the variable i is scoped to the for loop and nowhere else.

<br/>
Good coding practices dictate that you shouldn't be using a temporary variable in multiple places in your code.  That i should be scoped, as tepples said, for the loop only.  If it really is just a menial loop, i is fine, but if i is actually an index into a list of files, you might consider naming it to something more useful like fileIndex.  Having a temporary variable pop up all over a function is a good sign you aren't 100% sure what you want.  I know from personal experience too that modifying code like this can be extremely difficult.  Don't be afraid to give descriptive names to your variables and type them appropriately.
<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, check out "Code Complete" as it is an extremely good guide to creating proper software that I wish I had known about before starting my projects.  It will explain to you exactly why you don't want this i floating around and why you shouldn't get that error.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

For various reasons that I don't completely understand, the latest version of the MinGW toolchain still uses GCC 3.4. C99 behavior was not the default in GCC 3.4.
