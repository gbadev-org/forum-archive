We don't default to -mhard-float, we actually default to soft float libraries but the resulting object files are marked as hard float for various historical reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
This is actually a long standing problem with the marking of arm elfs and one that's difficult to address without breaking compatibility with various libraries. 
<br/>
<br/>
devkitARM is in use by some official developers in conjunction with the official libraries which are marked this way. Defaulting devkitARM to mark objects as soft-float would remove the ability to work with all of the licensed libraries which are available for GBA or require them to provide another set built with devkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
Since the official toolchain and all other toolchains provided for the GBA ( HAM, devkit advance etc) use hard float marked object files it would be counter productive to make devkitARM behave differently.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
