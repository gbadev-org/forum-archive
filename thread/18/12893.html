<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy programming and I have achieved really high marks at University in several programming based modules so I was wondering if we have a GUI based development tools for NDS i.e. Flash/VB.NET/Dreamweaver etc?
<br/>
<br/>
Best place to start for a noob?

If someone makes a DS Flash player, capable of script execution, your game will <span style="font-weight: bold">still</span> be a Flash game which also happens to play on the DS, not a DS game. In the end of the day, you learned <span style="font-weight: bold">nothing</span> about doing a game on the DS hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
It might seem "unfair" that only those who know C/C++ can have the "pleasure" of seeing their work running on a different platform other than a PC or a Mac, but consider this: if you have the skill, you can either use it for your own projects and be proud on your own creations, or you can spend it all creating a tool for allowing tons of people with supposedly less skill can start bragging all over the net about how they can make DS games, when it was actually you who did the "DS" part. (Not to mention the insane amount of shit you'd need to put up with people constantly asking for features, complaining about bugs, etcetera, etcetera.)
<br/>
<br/>
It would take an amount of altruism and self-sacrifice not available on the majority of human beings.
<br/>
<br/>
Wanna see your stuff on a console/handheld? Learn how to do it. Nobody is going to do all the work plus a nice UI for you for free, sorry. No company would do it commercially either, for many reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it sounds harsh, but this kind of stuff gets asked too many times.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of course we have GUI-based tools. Ever head of Visual Studio? You can use that to write DS code. KDevelop also works well. I've used Netbeans with the C/C++ plugin as well, and also played with Eclipse + CDT. Plain 'ol text editors work fine as well though.
<br/>
<br/>
What are you actually asking?
<br/>
<br/>
Do we have GUI-based tools for RAD on the DS? The answer to that is no and shall probably remain so. RAD-style development doesn't really apply in this environment.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Like I said Khan, there is no Quick-And-Easy way to make games for the DS. The same is true of games dev in general. Did you really imagine that games were produced with RAD-style tools? 
<br/>
<br/>
With regards to Visual Studio, there are instructions on the devkitPro website for using Visual Studio to develop DS homebrew software. Works pretty well, from what I recall, just a little more tricky to setup than using makefiles plain...
<br/>
<br/>
I afraid that if you are under the general impression that coding (In any field, not just games and homebrew dev) is 90% drag-n-drop and 10% coding then you are in for a shock.
<br/>
<br/>
Development is hard work, and DS dev is no different.
<br/>
<br/>

Whatchu talkin' bout?! I though all DS stuff was done with RAD tools! I haven't written a line of code whilst programming for the DS!
<br/>
&lt;/sarky&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, really there's nothing that comes to mind regarding drag-and-drop game creation. I've found DS development to be pretty hit and miss! It's all about programming with baby steps - change something slightly, build it, run it, see what happens.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">*lmao* that was a good one!
<br/>
<br/>
but seriously:
<br/>
<br/>
1) you should better get to the point with what you mean to write, "gui tools" are too general. though, from what i read, i understand you mean flash-like rad tools, not programming environments or "extended" text editors.
<br/>
<br/>
2) </span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">How do guys can make homebrew games/app on the DS and place graphics exactly where they want? by GUI-based I meant so I could simply drag n drop 2d sprites/backgrounds onto the screen etc... w/o any guess work.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
ouch! *-500HP* that hurts!
<br/>
as simonjhall pointed out, it's exactly that what makes you a developper, rather than a designer ("hey, let's paint a game!" [copyright by me ;^p]).
<br/>
programming also means trial-and-error. a better programmer will find a better and faster solution to any given problem than a more average one, but he/she still needs to try things out (even if the first try is a hit - and even that doesn't have to be the best and final solution!).
<br/>
placing sprites in a scene is about the last thing a programmer needs to worry (and even think) about - that would be the work of a level designer anyway (using some sort of level editor - could also be just a text editor in the worst case). but in general one has a pretty good guess of where to place stuff in the first place. simply use the *power of imagination!* *+9999 HP (melody playing)*. i'm being childish, i know. ;^p
<br/>
<br/>
finally, if you ultimately want to stay in flash land, don't bother with the nds, but if you want to get dirty and into the console, learn c/c++, game programming (rather than configuring) and get your hands on the devkit. that even comes with an editor! (though i don't use it.)
<br/>
<br/>
happy coding!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Clickteam and Agetec products give people that impression. To set up collision detection in Clickteam's The Games Factory, all the user does is click an object, click another object, choose "Objects begin to overlap", and then choose one or more actions to take from menus.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
I made a large generalisation there, sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, I somehow doubt Tetris DS was thrown together using a click-team product.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying constrained systems are always bad. You need only look at the large variety of Warcraft 3 mod maps out there to realise that a constrained system can be very flexible.
<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, they do have their limitations. In Warcraft 3, actually adding in a brand new skills that are not variants on old ones isn't really possible without hacking the EXE, last time I checked anyway...
