Here is a wikipedia article about the trilogy: <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_Trilogy" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_Trilogy</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They have a new open-source engine (Aleph One) which can play all original Marathon scenarios and is multi platform. 
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not sure how much resources it requires, but I suppose the original games' assets can fit on the DS RAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know, I just started wondering about this what with all the other old FPS games coming out. According to what I've found, these were the hardware requirements for Marathon Trilogy:
<br/>
<br/>
68040 or faster (the fastest of which used in the Macs was 40MHz)
<br/>
8bit monitor (256 color)
<br/>
System 7 or later
<br/>
4MB RAM
<br/>
CD drive
<br/>
<br/>
So in theory, it should be possible to make it run on the DS. Being that the source and games have been made free to the public by Bungie, it sounds like this could be a really cool port.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

It also takes a long time to do a proper port, look at how long Quake took and wolf3d has taken over a year and I'm still not done.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Come to think of it, how would you really do the controls, anyway? It seems like the controls would be awfully complicated and awkward to try and implement on the DS. These seem like they would be the primary controls to focus on:
<br/>
<br/>
Walk forward
<br/>
Walk backward
<br/>
Turn left
<br/>
Turn right
<br/>
Sidestep left
<br/>
Sidestep right
<br/>
Look up
<br/>
Look down
<br/>
Fire primary
<br/>
Fire secondary
<br/>
Select previous weapon
<br/>
Select next weapon
<br/>
Action
<br/>
Walk slowly/swim
<br/>
<br/>
Just by the numbers, it would require virtual buttons on the touch screen. It would also make things quite difficult to implement touch screen aiming and still be able to fire both weapons at the same time. This is what I've come up with:
<br/>
<br/>
Up = Walk forward
<br/>
Down = Walk backward
<br/>
Left = Sidestep left
<br/>
Right = Sidestep right
<br/>
Y = Turn left
<br/>
A = Turn right
<br/>
X = Look up
<br/>
B = Look down
<br/>
R = Fire primary
<br/>
L = Fire secondary
<br/>
<br/>
Touch screen buttons:
<br/>
Select previous weapon
<br/>
Select next weapon
<br/>
Action (could also be combined with a "Look" button to center view and quick look left and right when used with Y and A)
<br/>
Walk slowly/swim (this could be a toggle button and swimming may be able to be done automatically depending on how it's done in the game)
<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I've only once played Marathon and that was ages ago, so I don't really remember how a lot of the controls were handled. I just remember that there were a lot of them and it felt very convoluted playing on a keyboard.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

LOL, I considered porting it, and discovered I attempted to last Febuary, seems like I got it compiled but it seems to only display an error on the screen, too busy right now to debug it and not sure why I stopped working on it before.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quake only took so long (according to scrolls thru the Quake, Yeah topic) because he had to redo almost the entire game to optimise it for the 4mb of memory the DS has. If marathon only REQUIRES 4mb, it should be considerably easier. 
<br/>
<br/>
Although Quake was a more popular game and thus had more editing tools available for the engine so it could go either way. 
<br/>
<br/>
It all depends on IF someone is willing to devote their time.<br/>_________________<br/>NDSL: M3Real, EZ4 Lite Deluxe, 2x Kingston 1GB Micro SD, 1x Kingston 4GB Micro HCSD 1x Kingston 8GB Micro HCSD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
