    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Take a look at some of the videos in commercial DS games encoded using the ActImagine codec Lynx. Those are high quality.
<br/>
<br/>
This is in part because many of them are well done. The few I've seen that are are bad are not bad due to the codec.
<br/>
<br/>
The video quality itself is very good, which would seem to indicate that the ActImagine codec actually does a good job of compressing video for the DS and does a similarly good job of decompressing it on the fly.
<br/>
<br/>
The key point would be that non-commercial video on the DS does not automatically have to look bad. Given the codecs available, however, they tend to...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally think that the best way to do it would be with a text map - and make a compressor that optimizes the movie to a 8x8 pixel tile grid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#111372 - Firon - Tue Dec 05, 2006 11:37 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently, the easiest way to improve the video quality is to optimize the MPEG decoder such that it's fast enough to do dithering in realtime, as well as use higher framerates. That would do a LOT for video quality (and don't encode with dpgenc, use BatchDPG).
<br/>
It's easy to see that the quality of DPG is actually pretty good by playing them back on the PC with DPGPlay. The color depth of the DS's screen is really what hurts it.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, optimizing the MP2 decoder so you can use higher bitrates without skipping, as well as do 4x oversampling, instead of the 1x that it's doing right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, being able to use something more advanced than MPEG-1 would give you the possibility of having smaller files, and probably somewhat better video quality. A more advanced audio codec would be nice too (Vorbis with tremor in low accuracy mode would be great!), but I'm not sure what you can pull off with the ARM7's limited power. This would be much, much more complicated to pull off though.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We really would need dedicated coders that could code well and optimize stuff heavily enough for this to be possible. It is not impossible, it's just that no one's really tried (not including the two commercial codecs).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, cool. I didn't know Bink was offering their codec too. They like to release tools for free, so maybe we can get 'em to release something for us... :)
