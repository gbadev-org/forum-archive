    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, this is just a general topic following on from the "3D on both screens" topic (which I still haven't managed to get going).
<br/>
<br/>
Basically I'm looking at how to capture a frame and then display what's been captured on the next frame (3D and all). I know that there's the SetRegCapture but I can't get that to work, though I am wondering if it's the emulator (Dualis - I can't get iDeaS or DeSmuMU working on my system, they both crash when I try to load anything).
<br/>
<br/>
I think my code does capture into the REG_CAPTURE as it does call the SetRegCapture, but I've no idea how to display the stuff that's in REG_CAPTURE. Any help would be greatly appreciated, as this is driving me round the bend (and indeed up the wall, and wherever else things that send people mad tend to drive people, though how they get cars to drive up walls is beyond me).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT - or, if it's at all possible, if there's a short way to get it simply to output what was on the last frame if there's a way around the capturing process.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ho-hum. It looks acceptable for the moment using the lcdSwap with the frame limiter turned off in Dualis. Guess that'll have to do for now.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks anyway - I'll try the existing code from the other thread hopefully on the proper thing (by the way, the other demos - twopass and dual-screen 3D - also don't seem to work on Dualis or any of the other emulators I use - iDeaS and DeSmume).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
