    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a basic project template that I created a couple weeks ago that gives me a makefile and a main.c with a bit of "hello world" action.
<br/>
<br/>
I can use intellisense to tell me what a touchPosition is and what irqInit() is and such...but if i press f12 (basically a lookup) on something like BG0_CR or iprintf() or consoleInit() i get an error saying  "Symbol 'iprintf' cannot be found."
<br/>
<br/>
Makes it kind of hard when I'm just learning how ndslib works.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what's up with this...is this as good as my intellisense will get?  I'd sure like to be able to start typing "consoleInit" and then ctrl+space to see what the params are...or if it's a macro then f12-ing it would be nice so I could atleast see what the macro does.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've added the libnds include and lib file to visual studio's paths...as well as the devkitARM's lib and include folders...
<br/>
<br/>
i'm assuming i've included the correct paths. :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I will take a look at just what f12 is looking for and see about getting support for that into the wizard as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Just did a quick check and pressing f12 with the cursor on consoleDemoInit() it took me to the header file which defines it....
<br/>
Have you tried this on 2k8 (an upgrade well worth the download) ?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is the 2k5 to 2k8 upgrade free?  lol..i'm just a poor student living off of student loans.  unfortunately i don't have much extra cash to spend. :(
<br/>
<br/>
also...dovoto.  I have tried to use your VS integration setup on this machine but it doesn't seem to work.  Again, I'm using Visual Studio 2k5...XP Pro.  Not sure why it didn't work..it just failed to make the project for some reason. :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The express version is free...and its better than any non free version prior (and really just as good as pro or team of 2k8 unless you need some of the more advanced features of those versions)
<br/>
<br/>
Once you install the the express version the wizard will work on 2k5 (or you can change one line in the file as per the forum post to make it work on 2k5 stand alone).
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure getting the wizard to work will have any effect on your current problem but pressing f12 on 2k8 works as expected.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this was of some help.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What irks me is that compiling for Windows Mobile is one of those advanced features.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
