I just wanted to invite everyone to try out my game Flux.  It's an action-oriented puzzle game of the falling block variety (like Tetris but with original gameplay).  Since it was designed with the neoflash comp in mind, I paid particular attention to gameplay and also to creating a well rounded playable demo.  As far as I know, it's entirely bug free and quite enjoyable if you take to the gameplay.  I certainly enjoy playing it!

Just skip to the bottom to find the downloads if you like (doesn't work on emus, sorry).  Brief instructions can be found in the game (tap the question mark on the title screen) so you don't have to waste time reading the formal presentation.  There is a wifi version, a small version with no music and a large version with some music attached (that was sort of a last minute hack so the implementation isn't optimal).
<br/>
<br/>
I'll likely release a post competition version in a few weaks with some refinements based on the suggestions and experience of those who try the demo out.  Please feel free to offer any criticisms below.

And if you enjoy the game, I would appreciate a vote in the neoflash poll. But most of all, I'm interested in opinions on the game design.  Thanks!

Now, just one question, will it work on a GBAMP, or is a wifi card or flash cart required?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry I couldn't get it working on emu's, it wasn't for lack of trying!  it almost works on ideas if the sound code isn't in place, but not quite
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure about GBAMP, but I'm sure at least one of the versions will work on it.  If not, I could probably find out what's wrong and fix it with a bit of help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I'd *really* appreciate some votes in the comp if my game is enjoyable to you!  No one can play my game on emulators so it is hard for me to get votes!
