    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a feeling that it has something to do with with an external microphone attachment, since it is right next to the headphone jack. They could easily make an accessory which is a headset with 2 attachments at the end (like the Logitech Headset that came with UT 2004 Special Edition), except that that microphone attachment is changed to use that port.

Hey, I've got an idea. I know the SP is capable of taking one of its ports and having either an AC adapter or headphones (or both) hooked into it. Do you think, just maybe, some adapter could be made and some configuration of the hardware be set so that that port could be used to hook the GBA link cable into?
<br/>
<br/>
It's just a long shot, since it's been said that the DS is not meant to be the next GameBoy, therefore complete compatibility with all GBA features woudn't be available on it. But a few extra bucks for an adapter for those wanting to have GBA multiplayer would be nice.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The following report may eliviate questions on the subject of the "mystery port".
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Last week Cube-Europe?s handheld team posted some interesting pictures of the E3 Nintendo DS without its case. After rampant speculation over the recent official word of a still-undiscussed port on the system, the European site dug into its secret documentation, supported by slides of the E3 presentation, to convincingly show that the port is designed for an external microphone. 
<br/>
<br/>
The apparently planned headset microphone comes as no surprise: things can get noisy on the road, and headset microphones are much better at picking up voices. Nintendo has been questioned about such an accessory in the past, but never provided a firm response.</span><br/>_________________<br/>Age is only in your mind!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They might as well use the wireless connection so that you can make moves like spins without getting tangled in the cords.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only way to link to a PC is through wireless, or some crazy scientist's idea of a link cable that plugs into the GBA slot.  Otherwise, we're left with opening the thing up to plug directly into the circuit board with stripped twist ties and crazy glue, or wires and solder for you fancy types.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's in Japanese, so you'll have to translate it.  For some reason, babblefish doesn't open the page properly for me, all I get is the top little part and that's it.  But, it's a spec sheet that will tell you what every component on the DS is, so hopefully it's helpful to solving this mystery!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  Found a site that translated it properly (more or less) for me.  Number 10, the line pointing to the headphone jack area, says this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">10 Headphone/microphone connected terminal
<br/>
<br/>
The game boy series private stereo headphone (selling separately) and the stereo headphone of marketing is connected.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't say anything anywhere about connecting a PC.
