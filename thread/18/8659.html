And if you want to access an M3 SD card, try using an older version of Chishm's FAT library - the current version isn't working with the M3 SD, but older versions did, I believe:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suggest you download the source code to
<br/>
MoonShell or MP3Play and use the FAT library
<br/>
provided there. It works great with M3SD and
<br/>
most other devices and is a simple drop-in
<br/>
replacement of the original FAT library. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
