How about a small and inexpensive passthrough?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as I can tell, the passthroughs have to piggyback a DS cart.  Maybe somebody will figure out a way around that and make a boot card.

Because a boot card wouln't require another DS card, and would be the same size as a normal card.

Does anyone know whether the passthrough needs to stay in the DS?<br/>_________________<br/>I can't be bothered now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

im pretty sure the only reason passthrough units currently use a GBA flash card is because there is no DS flash card
<br/>
<br/>
the game needs to be started from the DS slot because it needs to load the DS bios
<br/>
<br/>
but i might be wrong i dont own a passthrough (how bout a guide to making one guys?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The reson it has to piggyback a existing cart is it needs encrypteded information sent to boot the DS. This is why it is important for people like DF to break the encryption so we may make a flashable DS card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, making a boot card would still be a viable option for those of use who still have a GBA flash cart lying around.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

of couse, i would deffinatly like to see two models, out. One that is a nonprogramable forwarder card to the gba port and one that is a flashable card itself (for homebrewers who would like to use the gba port in their programs).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
