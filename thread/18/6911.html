i'm going to write a ds sudoku game...

<br/>
i'm wondering if somebody has an algorithm that creates random sudokus, maybye with different levels of difficulty, as i can see in many others sudoku programs...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Right now it uses the whole height of the touch-screen (mode5) and have a simple board-selection-thingie at the start. The boards are stored in a simple and almost as small as possible db.
<br/>
<br/>
Will need a weeks work before I can release something, and I don't think I'll be able to put in time on this in a while because of school =/
<br/>
It's in between source-cleanup right now =)
<br/>
<br/>
I've been looking for a good source of boards, since the computer-generated ones generally aren't that fun to solve.

I agree, the graying out is not very good. I play your game by unmarking all except for the one I want.
<br/>
<br/>
It is super cool, I really like it, but that thing is really not necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is cool, but it would be best if we only needed to select the number we want.

<br/>
PS. Sorry Bojangles I'm going to hold on to this code for now... I am curious to know what sorts of sound effects you thought would go well. If you [url=mailto:zapf@zapfbandit.com]email me [/url] any wavs that you think would work I could put them in. As for the timer and victory I was intending to put those in. Also a save game and suspend when the ds is shut were on my list. Any other ideas would be very much appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment I am making Chinese Checkers and am keen to get this playable before I revist Sudoku.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a preview (AI only at the moment - think of it as a screensaver ;-)

About Sudoku - it's still not working as I would expect. Nothing has changed since the last release as I see it. Eight clicks still won't give me a big number.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Eight clicks would mean that it could be any of the eight selected.
<br/>
<br/>
The new setup starts blank and you select any numbers it could be.
<br/>
<br/>
Clicking on any of these numbers again removes it from the list.
<br/>
<br/>
Once there is only one number left (i.e. it has to be this) it becomes big.
<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, it makes sense. I just liked how it was the other way around in the first version. Clicking on the numbers it could not be, instead of clicking the numbers it could be. Less clicking and less thinking :-)

<br/>
<br/>
I think that is why people like it better this way. It was actually more clicking but definitely less thinking. I must admit I prefer the new setup, I found the other way was a bit brainless. At least this keeps me thinking.
<br/>
<br/>
Since this seems to be a bit of a contentious issue I will try and make my next release have an startup screen where a difficulty level and game setup (either start empty or start full) can be selected.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else got any ideas what else I should put on this startup menu?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This game is great, i play it for at least 1-2 hours a night.
<br/>
<br/>
One bug I found is when you hold down a box on the top row the 9 digits show up, nothing big.
<br/>
<br/>
Also not having the machine say "You Win" makes me recheck all my boxes to see if they are right, having it say "You Win" would be a great feature.
<br/>
<br/>
As for some suggestions of how the game should look and play I suggest taking a look at this Soduku game for the Palm:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.astraware.com/all/default/sudoku" target="_blank">http://www.astraware.com/all/default/sudoku</a>
<br/>
The highlighting is really nice looking and it plays quite well.

<br/>
Is this program open source?  I couldn't find the source anywhere.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another idea is to reveal a semi-transparent image when a box is filled. And make a row less transparent when it's correct and reveal totally then everything is solved.
<br/>
Or mix up gfx (rotate/mirror) of a wrong filled box.
<br/>
It might be just a distraction though.
<br/>
Or what about a 9-player cooperative mode (each get one or more 3x3 boxes) and record the total time to think (when a possible move can be made) and number of mistakes over a few puzzle sessions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
