    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing around with the ndslib 3d samples. In particular i tried to use my own binary display list with the toon shading sample (of the statue). I created the display list with <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14947" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14947</a> (which is really very nice and works well).  The thing is, when i load up the sample on the nds, the model is completely white.  Why could this be? (i'm guessing something is missing from the display list but i have no idea what)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're probably missing normals. They're required for toon shading to work. Also, if this exporter you're using adds poly format or light commands into the display lists they might not work as intended.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First test your display list on a demo without toon shading first (that teapot display list example would do), using no lights whatsoever and without textures to check if the list contains embedded light commands and if the normals are OK.
<br/>
<br/>
If there are light commands... well, I think you could parse the binary file and strip them, but if you get to that point you got half the knowledge required to build your own exporter/converter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
