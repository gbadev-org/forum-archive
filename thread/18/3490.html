    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">can both screens have 3d simultaneously, anyone who saw it at e3 have any idea? all the demos I saw confused me.  for instance the pikachu one had pikachu run from the top screen to the bottom screen but he was never on both at once, but pac 'n roll appeared to have a simple 3d object on the bottom screen (which appeared to act as a trackball with the touch screen), while the top screen had a full 3d environment. all the other games I saw (just in movie files I have not seen it in person) had at most sprite scaling/rotation on one screen and full 3d on the other.

CONFIRMED: The GBA side's CPU runs at double speed. SPECULATION: Nintendo has added more RAM to the GBA side. Imagine 128 KB of IWRAM, rendering 3D in IWRAM, and copying it to VRAM on vblank. Or imagine double the VRAM for double-buffered mode 3 without scaling.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

True, he is not on both screens simultaneously so there can be some sort of swapping that swaps the 3d-acceleration between the screens. But the background remains the same, so unless its a simple bitmap (it looks rendered, but it could be a trick i guess) there must be support for 3D on both screens at the same time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As much as I'd like to see and play games using 2 screens for a unique experience, there will probably be some developers who (for a particular game) may not need the special features like the 2nd screen or the touch screen, but by turning off one screen and using both CPUs to process data, and displaying everything on one screen. It would make the DS act more like a much more powerful GBA with 3D acceleration, however. Still, those developers who think that the DS being less visually appealing than the PSP could maybe use this method to help a little, though it still won't match it by comparison of specs. Then again, one less used screen means more battery life.

I don't think Nintendo would go as far as to deliberately ban games. This is going to be a very open-ended system, banning games wouldn't help them to gain recognition that the DS is just as good as any Game Boy they could have made instead. Sony however, is greedy, and could care less if 2D games go to the X-Box.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

in mario 64ds some of the extra minigames and the intro screen have 3d on both screens simultaneous.  (try the one with the 3 marios that you have to keep bouncing up to hit the three red flying thingies)

I haven't played Mario 64DS, but the two tricks that seem the most obvious to me would be:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Like you said, just pre-rendered sprites.
<br/>
2. One of the screens could use software 3D.
<br/>
<br/>
Some other people have made mention about the possibility of more esoteric tricks like changing certain registers on an HBlank, which doesn't seem too unrealistic given how well the GBA lends itself to such tricks.  But, I think we'd probably need some kind of DS equivilant to the CowBite GBA specs to really speculate any further.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
