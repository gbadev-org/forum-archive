    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I've had the DSi for little more than a week, and already I can't resist opening it up in an attempt to help the cause of DSi homebrew. I'm new to the DSi homebrew community, so I'm not entirely sure what the state of the art is.. but as far as I can tell, very little of the differences between DS and DSi hardware are documented, and nobody has publicly posted information about dumping the ROM from a DSi.
<br/>
<br/>
So I thought I'd make an attempt to dump the NAND flash. As far as I can tell, it's the only nonvolatile memory on the board. Besides all of the downloaded DSiware and saved games/settings, it must also have the firmware and the DSi menu. It might also be what the DSi boots from- though it's also possible there's a mask ROM in the CPU that bootstraps from the NAND flash. If we're really unlucky, the CPU or the boot ROM may decrypt code from the NAND before running it. But, whether we're lucky or not, it still seems useful to have a dump of the NAND flash.
<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned on <a href="http://www.dsibrew.org/wiki/Hardware," target="_blank">http://www.dsibrew.org/wiki/Hardware,</a> the NAND flash is a Samsung KMAPF0000M-S998. This is Samsung's "moviNAND" series, a mobile NAND flash chip which combines an MMC controller in the same package:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/products/fusionmemory/Products_MoviNAND.html" target="_blank">http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/products/fusionmemory/Products_MoviNAND.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
There's also a part number decoder on Samsung's site. The part is 256 MByte (2Gbits * 1), 3.3v, and otherwise seems pretty unremarkable. The package is FBGA, and it appears to follow the JEDEC standard eMMC pinout. See the eMMC spec:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.jedec.org/download/search/JESD84-C43.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.jedec.org/download/search/JESD84-C43.pdf</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the DSi mainboard is just covered in tasty testpoints with nice hacker-friendly labels. It seems reasonable to speculate that the NAND flash is hooked up to the system's SPI bus, especially given that there are SPI test points directly under the NAND flash chip.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I (carefully) disassembled my DSi, and tried to see if I could get any info from these test points. The first problem I ran into is that the DSi's mainboard doesn't want to do much unless all of its peripheral boards are attached, and you can't mechanically plug them in while retaining any access to the test points. As soon as you unplug the camera or either LCD, the DSi will hang during boot. You can't turn the DSi on if the power board is unplugged, and it won't run off of AC power if the battery is missing.
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to run the board stand-alone by hooking the battery test points (BT+, BT-) up to a benchtop power supply at 3.6V, and momentarily shorting the "PWSW" testpoint to ground. The DSi will hang during boot, and the only way you can even tell it's on is with a current meter.. but nevertheless I figured it should be possible to observe it bootstrapping off of the NAND flash.
<br/>
<br/>
I scoped out the SPI bus, and it appeared to be transmitting a single byte in an infinite loop. Ok, so I figured it was initializing some hardware and stuck in an infinite retry loop. I figured I should still see some different packets right after poweron, if it is indeed bootstrapping over SPI- but no luck. The very first byte is the same as every other.
<br/>
<br/>
To get some more evidence, I wired up an external connector that would provide access to the SPI bus while the DSi is fully assembled. I reassembled it, verified that it worked, then looked at the SPI bus activity with an oscilloscope while doing different things. There is good news and bad news:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The good news:</span> The DSi cameras appear to be controlled over SPI. I haven't confirmed yet, but there is an additional chipselect line that was not present on the DS's SPI bus, and I see bursts of SPI traffic when initializing or switching cameras.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The bad news:</span> The camera data isn't going over SPI. This is unfortunate- if the cameras were purely an SPI device, we could use them pretty easily in DS compatibility mode. I'm sure this was done for performance reasons. The DSi's SPI bus still runs at only 4MHz.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">More bad news:</span> Unlike the DS, it appears that the DSi doesn't keep its firmware on the system's SPI bus. In times when I would have expected NAND reads/writes (boot, loading and saving images in the gallery) there was little or no SPI activity. This makes sense, unfortunately. 4MHz is also a bit slow for their NAND flash, and they probably also want to make it impossible for DS-mode software to read or write NAND.
<br/>
<br/>
I took some pictures of the test setup:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/micahdowty/tags/dsi20090705/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/micahdowty/tags/dsi20090705/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd still like to do a proper SPI trace and see what's different between the DS and DSi, and especially take a closer look at the traffic that I think is camera-related. But it also seems that this won't help us get any closer to a firmware dump.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the next step might be to desolder the NAND flash and build either a passive sniffer or a standalone reader. Since it's electrically compatible with MMC, it might even be possible to solder the NAND flash onto an SD/MMC card reader, and solder an SD/MMC socket onto the DSi. Has anyone tried this yet?
<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a pretty invasive operation.. and FBGA doesn't seem like a lot of fun.. but if it works (and especially if the NAND isn't encrypted) it could be big step toward reverse engineering the DSi-specific hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
If nobody else has tried it yet, I might try and work up the courage to do this to my new DSi :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After posting this, I realized: If all of the signals for the NAND flash are buried, how do they program the NAND flash at the factory?
<br/>
<br/>
I can think of a few possible answers:<ul><li>The NAND flash is not factory programmed at all. Instead, there is a mask ROM elsewhere (like in the CPU package) which contains the initial firmware image. This seems unlikely, since it would be very expensive for Nintendo to start shipping a newer default firmware image.
<br/>
</li><li>There is a bootloader contained in a mask ROM in the CPU, and they factory program the NAND via some other port. This seems a bit roundabout, but it's concievable that Nintendo did this just to make it more difficult to access the NAND flash. It could also be that they're using the flash in parallel (MMC, not SPI) mode, and they wanted a way to program it using fewer pins.
<br/>
</li><li>There are test points for the NAND flash, I just need to look closer :)</li></ul>
<br/>
It would be really cool if someone had X-ray photos of the DSi mainboard...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I personally don't own a DSi, but i would just start by reading out the flash with the functions we have already for it.

Sounds like nobody has a NAND flash dump of the DSi yet. I'm going to practice BGA rework a bit first, but then I think I'll try desoldering the flash chip and wiring it up to an SD/MMC card reader.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll let you know how it goes...

Thanks for the link! This is pretty cool, and definitely a step forward. But I'm still really interested in learning more about the DSi's boot process. A dump of the NAND flash would be useful, but I'm actually even more interested in getting a trace of the reads made from the NAND flash during boot.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.. I was busy with Real Life for the last few weeks, but I finally had time to revisit the DSi today :)
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to desolder the NAND flash, and get some PCB scans with the flash removed. It turns out that all of the interesting signals are in fact available on nearby components or vias. Here's a false-color image showing the top and bottom PCB layers near the flash chip:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/micahdowty/3732858713/in/set-72157621023570420/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/micahdowty/3732858713/in/set-72157621023570420/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The four signals along the top are data bits (this is eMMC, and the DSi is using it in 4-bit mode). The clock is available via a test point on the back (SD11_CLK), and CMD is available from a resistor nearby.
<br/>
<br/>
So, as fun as it was to get the flash off, I figured I'd put it back on and build a passive sniffer that can log all of the traffic between the DSi's CPU and the flash. It was a pretty nerve-wracking process, but I did manage to get the flash back on without frying it =D
<br/>
<br/>
I did find out what the DSi does when you try to boot it without the flash chip installed:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/micahdowty/3732858859/in/set-72157621023570420/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/micahdowty/3732858859/in/set-72157621023570420/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This would seem to confirm that there's a real boot ROM in the same package as the CPU, and they aren't just reading the SPI flash in hardware. (A hardware bootloader wouldn't be smart enough to display an error message like that.) Presumably this bootloader is also what they would use at the factory to program the NAND flash.
<br/>
<br/>
I also measured the clock frequency at SD11_CLK while the DSi is running. In very early boot, it runs at only 250 kHz.. but most of the time, it's running at a much more sensible 16.7 MHz.
<br/>
<br/>
Next step: Use an FPGA to build a protocol sniffer. I'd like to stream all of the reads/writes back to my PC over USB 2.0. This would be enough data to reconstruct the portions of the NAND flash that are actually being read during boot, and it would let us know what order the firmware is read in.
<br/>
<br/>
For future reference, it should also be possible to electrically separate the flash memory and the CPU without desoldering, just by cutting a few traces. Once we know more about the format of the NAND flash, it could be interesting to try installing alternate firmware by attaching an MMC card socket.
<br/>
<br/>

    <h4>#169506 - scanlime - Sun Jul 19, 2009 9:59 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is really really rough still, but I think I have the first dump of the DSi's NAND flash reads during boot.
<br/>
<br/>
The MMC commands aren't decoded much yet. The "tb=1 CMD18" lines indicate that a multi-block read is starting. "arg" is the address, in bytes. So you can see that the first thing the ROM does is to load the second 512-byte block out of flash. That block is some kind of header, hopefully with some useful addresses/flags in it. The second half of that block is a bit uglier, but still looks somewhat structured. Maybe it's thumb code? I haven't tried disassembling any of this yet.
<br/>
<br/>
After that first block read, there is a much longer read starting at byte 0x26E00. This is probably the actual firmware image, and it looks to be compressed and/or encrypted.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that this log shows each block as 0x208 bytes long. Ignore those last 8 bytes, they're just the MMC protocol's CRC.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just including a snippet below. I need to clean this up a lot more before posting the full log. (The biggest problem is that my hardware buffer keeps filling up, so there are some missing pieces later on ;)

The values at 0x220 are definitely offsets to other areas on the card. The firmware image that the bootloader starts reading immediately after this block is at 0x26e00, and you can see that address appear at 0x230.
<br/>
<br/>
As for how the rest of the card is encoded.. your guess is as good as mine ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why not? It would be completely crazy to go to the trouble of encrypting the NAND and then making it easy to break.
<br/>
<br/>
See the encryption used on the Wii for instance.
<br/>
<br/>
As for Twiizers, still not entirely sure how Blasty exploiting the games becomes them being the be all &amp; end all of homebrew hacking. I have my own exploits for both games too &amp; work is in progress to get libnds code running.

<br/>
Because i don't think the purpose of it is to encrypt it, but to safe space.
<br/>
I think so, because it would be half-hearted to leave things like data indizes unencrypted and to have it guarding a system that does not allow native execution of encrypted code to protect it beeing simply read from injected parts.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention that the simple things are easier to check first ;-)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, I didn't see that before hand. The topic at hackmii.com was fresh in my mind since I follow it and the news was posted a few days earlier. Team Twiizers mentioned they were able to dump the RAM and scanlime was trying to dump the NAND, so I thought there might be something that both sides could learn from each other. He had also mentioned dsibrew.org for the hardware write up they had, so I also thought it would be a good place to add his findings to for all to benefit.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Given that Nintendo have blocked the DSi flashcarts with their first firmware update it's likely they'll be doing as much as they can to prevent unauthorised software being installed on the NAND. I already have code running via both of the Ubisoft hybrid games, from there we hope to have a bootstrap from the internal SD.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Not really sure why you think that. Once we bootstrap to a menu there's no need to reboot the DSi - we can install a soft reset handler which just reloads the menu from SD rather than going back to the DSi menu.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Reading the NAND flash was a fun exercise, but I was doing it mostly on the (slim) chance that part of the bootloader was unencrypted. At this point, I agree with WinterMute- I don't think the homebrew scene has anything to gain from accessing the NAND flash, and it would certainly muddy the waters legally if we ended up basing our homebrew on some exploit that could also be used to pirate DSIware games.
<br/>
<br/>
@MechaBouncer: I can dump the RAM too now ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Lately I've been working on a different reverse engineering strategy. I have a save game exploit for Cooking Coach which bootstraps some C code (using a limited subset of libnds) onto the ARM9, running out of unused system RAM. That C code can dump/load memory, poke at registers, and install hooks in the Cooking Coach code. When it returns, the game resumes executing nearly where it left off.
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to use this as a debugging and reverse engineering tool, to help understand more about how Cooking Coach is using the DSi's hardware. This probably means understanding how it communicates with the ARM7, so we can either take control of the ARM7 as well or at least talk to it using the same protocol that the game uses.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been running my exploit off of a homebrew SPI EEPROM emulator that I finished earlier this week. It has 1MB of SRAM that's accessible simultaneously by the DS and a PC. It emulates normal save game memory out of the first 64KB, and the rest is accessible using custom SPI commands. So I can use it to very quickly load the exploit itself, plus it serves as extra memory for the C-language code that gets injected, plus it can be used as a communication buffer to send debug info back to the PC. This could probably even be used to inject a GDB stub into the game.

<br/>
As far as I know, there isn't a way to make a legal DSi flash card. The game's headers are signed- so unless you can somehow find Nintendo's private keys, the flash card would have to bootstrap itself using a commercial game.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point it definitely seems like a save game hack plus an SD card bootloader is the best goal for launching homebrew on the DSi. With the Cooking Coach hack, the exploit can take control immediately after the Ubisoft splash screen. Installation would just involve running some DS-mode program that can overwrite the save file on your Cooking Coach cartridge. Now you've transformed this high-quality game into a homebrew bootloader. No need to break any of the system's encryption.
<br/>
<br/>
There are still a few big hurdles to get over before this is really useful:<ul><li>Most of the interesting hardware appears to be on the ARM7 (Camera, SD card, maybe DSP..)
<br/>
</li><li>The save game exploits only run code on the ARM9. Another step is necessary to take control of the ARM7. (This is what I'm working on now.)
<br/>
</li><li>Either we'd need to reverse engineer the SD card control registers and access them from the ARM7, or figure out how to access them from the ARM9 via Nintendo's default ARM7 firmware.

I suppose it's still a bit off, but is certainly possible. Although no NAND access is disappointing because I was hoping for a dedicated Homebrew Channel like the one for the Wii. That way we wouldn't have to have a card of any sort in the DS slot (or just have a different game in there). Ah well. A hacked save game couldn't be any worse than using a flashcart like we do now. Although it makes me wonder if Nintendo might find a way to patch against this as well like they did with the Twilight Hack on the Wii.

Seems like a good little free program to find holes in (need firmware 1.4 though, I believe, for the DSiShop to get it). Would be nicer than having to use a commercial cart for an exploit and uploading sav files and whatnot.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what about fiddling with the formatting of an SD card in general. Like the disk geometry table stuff or the FAT filesystem structure? On boot up, the DSi would read and puke on init'ing the SD port? Or some app trying to read the SD port/card? The loader that would start from this would know the weird SD structure and init a different partition or something.

Sure, but nothing's precluding them from coming out with Flipnote 3 (and they might!), using continued access to Hatena as a carrot to update... basicallly, taking away a feature from people who would need to continue using an old version.
<br/>
<br/>
Whereas if you have a game card, there's no possibility of such an update.  All they could do is scan for "bad" saves... and there's a limit to how much of that can be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

savsender or my own in-progress TFTP server will remove the slot-2 requirement, running entirely off one of the rather ubiquitous slot-1 cards.  You do still need an original DS or Lite (apparently the appropriate functions don't work on an Acekard? really need to get around to verifying that someday), though they don't need to be FlashMe'd.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, both routes are still advantageous to pursue.  Never can have too many tools in one's arsenal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But it would be silly to discount any option at all. A comm cart exploit would be very welcome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Slight problem with that, you need a fair bit of space to do anything useful, and most of the current DS/DSi games have limited save space (&lt;1k). I've seen some proof of concept code to run software from the SD card, but IIRC it's still a while before it will be released due to the complexities of getting the exploit working consistantly on all DSi's.
<br/>
<br/>
Using the DSi only games is going to be problematic as well since you can not access the save game area of those games without taking them out of the DS card slot, if you can't access them from a normal DS / DSl then you are going to face a huge problem trying to get the save game exploit onto the card in the first place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Couldn't you install a DSi-mode Homebrew by using the same method as HyperGTS? (Which would mean making a DNS Server on computer, change DNS on DSi to the computer's DNS server, access DSi Shop, get HomeBrew Channel!)
<br/>
<br/>
Would this be feasible?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, would it be possible to have this as a channel -- no bootstrapping required? That way you would have no chance of bricking the device (as far as I can tell), as well as being able to delete it at any time, without having to format the device.<br/>_________________<br/>This is a guest account.
