    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been getting right into the homebrew DS scene lately but can't get any of the Wifi programs to connect for some reason. Commercial games work fine, Opera browser also fine. 
<br/>
<br/>
My wireless router is using WEP , the code is key is only 5 digits long. I don't suppose that anything to do with anything does it? I've tried entering it in ASCII and the HEX equivilant, though the DS didn't accept the HEX 
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried manual settings, using the Nintendo WFC settings but haven't had any success ... yet. I'm really looking forward to trying two particular pieces of homebrew software: DSMidiWifi and DS2Key. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you had any luck with the wardriving DSWifi demo application? That allows you to connect using the built in Nintendo WFC settings or by hand editing the settings. You can scan for APs too, to check if homebrew sees your router. You can download it from sgstair's site <a href="http://akkit.org/dswifi/" target="_blank">http://akkit.org/dswifi/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I used the wardriving application that comes with DS2Key. It sees my router. says that WEP is on, I get 70% signal strength. When I try connecting using the Nintendo WFC settings, it doesn't connect, no matter which way I try I always get  "ASSOCSTATUS_SEARCHING" ... forever it seems. Hmm... tricky 
<br/>
I will download the version of wardriving demo you told me about and see if it can solve anything. Thanks so much for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can see my router and whole bunch of others with the Wardriving program, but still I can't connect to anything. Really not sure how to solve this. Even with WEP turned off, it still won't connect! I know this a tricky one, but is there anything I could be doing wrong. I've triple quad checked that all the settings are right, WEP, SSID, IP, Gateway etc.. , I really don't know what it is. If anyone has any idea what could be stopping my unit connect it would be great if you let me know. Thanks so much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can verify this by dumping the first 512bytes of your firmware and checking it against the dswifi documentation. The baseband and rf chip setup tables are different on the newest dslites.

Nintendo's wifi stuff works cause they propperly handle all the information there. Homebrew doesn't work cause sgstair didn't do something, and noone is quite sure yet what that is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Argh!

I tried to use homebrew stuff like beup during the Christmas break (I don't have a WLAN here, but my parents do, so it seemed a good opportunity), but it didn't work for me either. Mariokart and Metroid were running fine, though. I guess that explains it, thanks for the info!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've confirmed it to work now with the patch. I also applied the patch to linux and had success.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So my wife and I both have a DS now, her's is white, mine's black.  I've been having a lot of trouble with wifi on mine (trouble connecting, then trouble keeping a connection or actually using it) and so I tried the wifi_lib_test on her's.  It seemed to be much quicker in picked up the AP, and even picked up a number of them I didn't know existed around my neighbourhood. :)
<br/>
<br/>
But I can't really check the firmware can I, since I flashed it... is there any way to tell if it's a new chipset or if it's a crap chipset?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you say "patch", what are you referring to?  I need to patch DSLinux to work with the newer hardware, but I have no idea how to go about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently running a DS Lite that is only a few months old, and I can't get anything that uses the wifi lib to work. It won't even pull up data stored in the first WFC slot.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried the latest wifi lib test (0.3a built on 01-10-2007), and I get nothing there, either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
