<br/>
My scheme would be:
<br/>
<ul>Capture all polies for scene sorted by scanline.</ul>
<br/>
<ul>On HBlanks transfer new polies, potentially flushing the buffer of old ones first when it is full</ul>
<br/>
<ul>Double Buffer this list so you have one frame's worth of polies being sucked  into hardware on Hblanks while a new frame's worth of polies is being generated over several VBlanks.</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Where it possibly breaks down is on the question of how polies get into the rasterizer's internal buffer. If polies have to go through the normal command &amp; data streams and that is limited to ~120,000 polies per second, then you have the same limitations. If the xform &amp; command stream happens to be unbalanced so it could pump significantly more than 120,000 polies/sec you might have some joy.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.btinternet.com/~ahcox/GBA/" target="_blank">3D on GBA</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
