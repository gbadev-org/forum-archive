Lowering their products price as soon as their competitor's release theirs? That's so un-Nintendo-like. 
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I can't remember the last time Nintendo had it's product out before the competition's. This really will be a battle to remember. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Price drops have been a big part of the Nintendo strategy for the Gamecube, it would only be logical that they carry it over to DS. Seeing as Nintendo admited the DS will be overpriced compaired to their traditional pricing, it would make perfect sense if they dropped it to a more "traditional" level once the PSP came out. Imagine this, you go to the store to get a PSP, as your going by you see the DS. Would you rather get a $400 PSP, or a DS for $120 and get some games while your at it? Lowering the price right when the PSP came out would totaly undercut the PSP - especialy if Nintendo also included bundled games with that $120 pricetag. I think its very Nintendo - remember the Metroid Prime bundle anyone? That did a good job of taking some sales from Xbox [Live] that season.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The launch date has been set to November 21st, though poor saps like myself who pre-ordered from places like EB have to wait 2 days as there is a 2-day hold on all pre-ordered merchandise.  Of course, I kinda know Brendan (not you sgeos, unless your ARE the Brendan who works at EB in Penticton) and he might be able to expedite the process for me...

No, I'm not.  Years ago I applied to the EB in Scarborough Towne Centre (Toronto, Ontario).  They didn't hire me.  Come to think of it, I also applied to the EB here in Madison, WI (I moved from Canada).  They didn't hire me either.  I guess... EB is just too happening for me? =P

I'm totally convinced that that is why Sony *supposedly* has such a high market share.  Whatever number of PS2's it is now that they are claiming to have sold, I guarantee the number of PS2 owners is no where even close to that.  I think their figures are inflated because most people who have PS2's, like you, have had to replace them one or twice and I'm certain that many (most?) don't bother with Sony's "repair service".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
