    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before you all flame but I personally feel that DS should see more EMUs especially that well within reach of DS's power.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not here to moan about not seeing CPS1 EMU yet because I know for a fact that programming is not easy but EMUs i.e. Wonderswan/NG Pocket/PC Engine should have been on DS by now.

<br/>
What do you guys think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah... let them time, they'll port anything they feel is easy to do.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we could do is list opensource emus here so they *could* have a look into them if they have free time. No more to say here.[/quote]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know about these but these were discontinued before they reached a stable status.

Hopefully someone will make these EMUs for DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah i wish these emus were improved. i've tested most of them and most arem't that stable or usable.
<br/>
<br/>
DSO has a wonderswan plugin, i think it might have been based on dualSwan , but  it's slow and doesn't play anything over 2mbytes.

then again, i can't really request anything because i'm not contributing anything myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd rather see existing emulators improved. For example, more than one save state and not turning off the backlight on a DS Lite in NesDS, rewind/actual menu/non-crappy button layout in Lameboy, better compatibility in SnesDS/SnemulDS. While it's nice to have emulators for a bunch of different systems, let's face it, few people care about most of those systems. &gt;_&gt;<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really like SnemulDS, NesDS, Lameboy DS, DrSMS and jEnesisDS but EMUs that I have mentioned should have been worked on, it's not like authors were unable to because of DS limitatio. I mean games are not even playable. We had PC Engine on GBA at full speed afaik and we also saw Wonderswan and NGPocket although not very good but at least they were better than DS iterations.
<br/>
<br/>
NGPC, PC Engine and Wonderswan color could easily be made for DS but sadly nobody wants to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the people capable of developing emulators are likely to feel uneasy discussing emulator development on this forum. The rule against discussion of methods of copyright infringement is stronger here than on some other domains, and frankly there wasn't much of a homebrew scene on a lot of the platforms being emulated.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could imagine the people making these emulators feeling like they are getting "pushed" into continuing them, and the project gets moved from the person wanted to make it to other people wanting that person to make it, with all the bickering that comes along with it. Like any other project, if it becomes more of a chore and you aren't happy working on it, why continue? It becomes less of "I do this for fun", and more of "such and such keeps bugging me about it".<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too would like to see existing emulators worked on. There are age-old problems with NesDS, like Startropics 2 not booting, and it seems the developer releases an update every 6 months... But I guess he's got a life :P. I was happy for the DLDI update, since with old libfat, every 1 in 5 save states became corrupted.
<br/>
<br/>
My absolute dream with emulation on the DS would be the SA-1 chip for SNES. Kirby Superstar is such an amazing game. And then to go along with that, multiplayer, even with a local server running on a PC, would be amazing.

Eh, pipe dreams...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
