I'am trying to figure out if I should order it from some asian webshop, or buy it right here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I'm sure you could import the DS as you suggested. I don't remember where I read it but I remember hearing something like the Nintendo DS will have a worldwide launch date. It would probably include Europe, Japan and North America. I think Nintendo will announce a release date within the next month.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm fairly convinced it will launch on Nov 11.  Originally, most places you could pre-order would tell you to expect Nov 30, but that's changed.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, that's my two cents.  I hope I'm terribly wrong.  I hope they say "Sorry, we meant August 11!  It's in stores NOW!" ... but then again, I also hope to win the lottery... twice... in a row... tomorrow...  Same chances!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does Europe have an overcommercialized Giftmas season the same way the US does? In the States, it's important that toy launches be in early to mid Q4 if the maker wants to have any sales.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The same applies in europe too. Q4 launches are good for business. But I do think it is a little bit less extreme here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
