    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have seen that no$gba also emulates wifi. So I have tried to start a simple wifi enabled hb, but it does not connect "out of the box". 
<br/>
Does anyone know, whether it is possible to develop a wifi enabled homebrew with no$gba or another emulator, or how one can use wifi with no$gba?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.vonloesch.de/dschess" target="_blank">DSChess</a> - A chess game for the Nintendo DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I can tell, no$gba's wifi emulation is currently under major development. (His site says something to the effect of he still has some registers to figure out.) Also, no$gba seems to only support it in the debug version, as I have the freeware and have not been able to test it at all. (It only does DS to DS atm, no Internet access or anything of the sort.)
<br/>
<br/>
As fas as I can tell, no$gba is the only emulator to have even gotten as far as wifi, although I may be wrong.

Desmume had an implementation done by mightymax early this year, but I can't tell how advanced it is, as I never checked the code.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://shashemudev.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://shashemudev.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
