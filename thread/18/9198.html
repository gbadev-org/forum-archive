    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MoonShell already does this. You can change which file it loads as the boot sound. One could even use "Guns" by Harry Gregson-Williams [1] to give the loader a more "revolutionary" feel.

[1] That's the theme song from the <a class="postlink" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2863158454693395534&amp;q=%22nintendo+on%22&amp;pl=true" target="_blank">Nintendo On hoax video</a>, or track 21 from the album <span style="font-style: italic">The Rundown Soundtrack</span>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
