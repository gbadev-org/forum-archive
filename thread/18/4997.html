    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that everyone currently believes that the touch screen is not pressure sensitive (that it can't tell how hard you are pressing).  On the NDSTech Wiki (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Main/System" target="_blank">http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Main/System</a>), I found a link to the product page for the touch screen controller (<a class="postlink" href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tsc2046.html" target="_blank">http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tsc2046.html</a>).  What is interesting about the product page, is the feature listing:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">TOUCH-PRESSURE MEASUREMENT </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't this mean that the DS <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> actually tell how hard you are pressing on the screen?  This would explain the unknown register in the NDSTech Wiki:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">TSC_MEASURE_AUX 0xE4 Measures ?, its non-zero, but I don't know what </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Everything I ever heard about these type of touch screens was that they could not detect pressure.

<br/>
But I would imagine this would be easy enough to test, anyone with a pass-through want to check that register and see what happens when you push on the screen?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The TSC can be used to get a rough idea of touch *resistance*, not pressure.  This could be used e.g. to determine whehter a finger or a stylus is used, but not how hard a stylus is being pressed.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

Perhaps it's circumstantial that this can be done, so it might as well be documented for developers so there are no surprises, and/or perhaps they might devise a usage that nobody else can.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So that you can take into account what kind of device the player is using in your code. A stylus is much more accurate that your finger, and so, movement would be much easier.  However, trying to control anything specific with your thumb is crazy.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So we <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> find out the touch resistance?  Because, according to the formula I linked to, can't that be used to find the pressure?  It says that, to find out the touch pressure, we have to know Z1, Z2, the X position and the resistance.  We already know how to get the first three of those, so if we can find out the resistance, don't we already have all we need to find out the pressure?
<br/>
<br/>
Or am I getting the wrong idea altogether about what it refers to as pressure?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i am 100% positive the touch screen is pressure sensitive, to test this go to the metroid demo "touch to start" screen and with one finger press on the right side of the screen, with the other press on the left side varying in pressure
<br/>
<br/>
you will see the highlighted "honeycomb" moves closer to the finger with more pressure
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: you can also test this with pictochat in the same way</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Um, that's just how touchscreens like this work - it can only output a single set of coordinates, and determines this point based on the average of where the voltage across it changes, which is why pushing it with your finger gives you at least some degree of accuracy (rather than some random point under your finger. The same effect can be observed with any touch-based pointer control system.
<br/>
This is also why the touchscreen can't detect two different points being pressed simultaneously.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, yes, the touchscreen is pressure-sensitive, but only in the most trivial sense - if it wasn't, it wouldn't be a touchscreen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, there is a limit to the pressure it can sense. Using the metroid demo example, you will get to a point where it doesnt matter how hard you push, the "cursor" will stay in the middle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except that, acording to what you are saying there are multiple points of reception for the electrical impulses, and physically measuring presure could simply be determined by the size of the location your pressing takes up. Being that it is a touch screen this is a perfectly reasonable idea. However if it can understand a central most point, it must be able to recognize all of the surrounding area to get to the central point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, it must not recognize the surrounding area in order to determine the central point.
<br/>
<br/>
The x and y coordinates are determined by measuring the voltage drop across each axis.
<br/>
The area pressed can be estimated by measuring the resistance between the two planes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
