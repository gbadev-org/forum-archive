    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone looked into porting phoneME (<a class="postlink" href="https://phoneme.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">https://phoneme.dev.java.net/</a>) to the DS? I'm thinking of trying this out since the source-code looks very portable. 
<br/>
<br/>
But first, does anyone have experience (or source-code) with this that they care to share?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can you give us a quick summary of what exactly it is? My guess is that it's a JVM, but I'm not sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In short, phoneME is a partial implementation of a JVM for portable devices, such as phones -- it's small and designed to be ported. It was made by Sun and is now open source.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just from the web page, it appears to be a JVM (the CLDC part) plus an implementation of the MIDlet class libraries (the MIDP part).

The page does not say one way or the other whether or not the build process can be performed with Visual Studio Express. So unless your computer is capable of running GNU/Linux, it appears you may need to purchase and install a copy of Microsoft Visual C++ 6 or Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Why would I use VS and build a windows executable? Anyhow, it uses makefiles and the command-line VC++ compiler, so the express edition should work.
<br/>
<br/>
devkitARM would be the GNU/linux environment to build in. (unfortunately, I can only find a makefile for windows, but it shouldn't be too hard to make it work).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
"phoneME Advanced MR2" has a linux makefile. Still trying to figure out the difference between "Advanced" and "Feature"...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
