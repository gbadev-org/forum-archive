<br/>
The source code is available and WinROTT (With OpenGL support to boot) has also been done...
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say grab the base source code, as well as the WinROTT code as well, and dig around to get an idea of how much work it would be :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what's the matter with this ROTT port? is it still alive? I'm interesting in this port and in duke3d/shadow warrior port also. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to found this PSP sources (for ROTT) but I only found an old binary v0.99 from middle of 2006. I think a port from this PSP version should be the easiest way ...
<br/>
<br/>
So I did a try from this linux (icculus) port. But I got a terrible number of compiler errors without changing anything (devkitpro 2.0).
<br/>
<br/>
There are many small problems like multiple typedef. 
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">typedef unsigned char byte;
<br/>
typedef byte byte8;
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Should work on every C compiler. But this one in devkitpro for nds seems to have a problem with such a construction ... 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there are some types in nds.h already defined in rott.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#137428 - Diddl - Sat Aug 11, 2007 7:36 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Today I have downloaded <span style="font-weight: bold">WinRott</span> source from birgers homepage (Birger did the fantastic WinRott port and also this new WinrottGL port).
<br/>
<br/>
This WinRott Sourcecode is for visual C-7. I only have VC-6 and so I had do change some things. After successful compiling I played WinRott for hours and I rembered again: Rott is one of the best shooter from this generation. Much better than doom and nearly as good as duke3d!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I have a compileable WinRott sourcecode from Birger (SDL based). A well working DSdoom sourcecode (also SDL based). And at last I have a ROTT sourcecode for this ARM based GP2x console.
<br/>
<br/>
I think with this 3 ports it should be possible to make our DsRott port! 
<br/>
<br/>
##
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, I'm too weak to do it alone. Maybe I make it compileable under devkitARM r20 and I add all startcode from DSdoom to my DsRott port, - how should I finish this task. Any suggestions? Any help? Any Idea?
<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to see a mini version of DSRott without music and sound. Maybe only the first level of shareware version. Only to see if it is possible form my NDS hardware. But if Quake runs, DSrott should be no problem!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Quake doesn't run, it does more of a brisk walk. And even then simon had to lift each one of its legs himself... :P<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
