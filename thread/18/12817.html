    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on publishing some WiFi code from the official Nintendo ARM7 binary in order to let everyone take a peek at what's inside and such.
<br/>
<br/>
You can read my full statement on my blog here: 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">illegal code link removed</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any legal issues that can make Nintendo sue me or such? (I live in Europe)
<br/>
<br/>
Any comments can be posted here or on my blog.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">don't get me wrong, but it sounds a bit like you would break an nda or release stolen code. though, looking at your blog (didn't look at the code - just read a couple of lines to try to clarify) it seems more like you reversed it... so what is it now? reverse engineering is legal (afaik), releasing nintendo's sources will get your ass sued - badly. nintendo's also here in europe, you know - and probably even in your country.
<br/>
<br/>
i think the last thing we want on this forum is trouble from big n. all we want is to peacefully develop our own programs for nintendo's consoles.
<br/>
<br/>
peace!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Reverse Engineering released binaries is one thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Releasing code pulled from the official toolchain is something entirely different.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
