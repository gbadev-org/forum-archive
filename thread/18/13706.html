<br/>
<br/>
I have looked for an answer in the forum but I haven't found anything related. It's a quite simple question.
<br/>
<br/>
I create my sprite graphics with photoshop: I have a transparent image in one layer and then I set a magenta background to use it in PaGFX. Since photoshops softens the borders, when I import the image to my DS game (PaLib), it shows an awful halo as it has several magenta tones on its borders.
<br/>
<br/>
How do you create your graphics to avoid that ugly effect?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my english and thanks a lot for your answer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No simple solution to the problem if you've already created a ton of graphics. But basically you need to remove the fuzzy edges. Easiest method is probarbly painting over the magenta toned edges using the pencil tool. However if your planning on making a whole bunch of sprites, I would recommend using the pencil tool (provided the sprites a pixel art based). Remember for other tools you need to avoid the aliasing effects. For example when using the text tool set the drop down aliasing menu to none. Another tip to avoid many additional tones being added to the image work in indexed colour mode. (Image&gt;Mode&gt;Indexed Colour, edit the colour table to add further colours).
<br/>
<br/>
However if you are planning on using sprites from pre-rendered 3D images for example, you need to use something like the lasoo tool with 'feathering' disabled to select the sprites, and delete the background to fill it with a solid colour (your transparent colour)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Make your sprites feather to black. It can be very effective, depending on your art style.
<br/>
<br/>
Change your magenta background by a pure black one. Then use the magic wand tool with zero tolerance and no antialiasing, and select the black area surrounding the character, and fill the selected pixels with the magenta color. 
<br/>
<br/>
That'll make whatever antialiased areas you have in your sprite fade to black instead of magenta. This works wonderfully if you have black outlines around your sprites, since the black color will be antialiased against the sprite contents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
