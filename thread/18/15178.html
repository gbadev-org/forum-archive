    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have never programmed on the DS yet. I would like to work on a client like pigdin which supports a few IM protocols.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is, would it be "easy" to port libpuple to the DS? (along with the few other libraries needed) or should I forget it?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm willing to give the time and effort needed this done if it is possible, but if not, I won't bother.
<br/>
<br/>
My original idea was to developped a Gtalk client for instant messaging and was looking to port some jabber implementation and found out about libpurple
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your input</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a look at libpurple for someone a while back. It's going to be a lot of work to port to the DS and not really something I'd recommend if you're just starting out. It depends a bit on how much experience you have of network code on other platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
Pidgin is dependent on GTK which isn't something that's likely to run well on the DS so I'd kind of avoid that aspect of it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But libpurple != Pidgin. Couldn't one easily make their own client without GTK? Finch (the commandline version of Pidgin) runs on ncurses I think, another library possible to port and use them combined?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
