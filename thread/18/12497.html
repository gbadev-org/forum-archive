    <h4>#119113 - ikaris - Mon Feb 19, 2007 9:15 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Inside my "sources" folder, I have several folders, each containing different elements, for example:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">sources\fzBase</span> (all includes)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">sources\fzAnim</span> (for animation, such as containers for animation data, etc...)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">sources\fzGfx</span> (graphics functions, mostly for rendering)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">sources\fzMath</span> (math classes)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">sources\fzMesh</span> (containing and building mesh data)
<br/>
<br/>
etc...
<br/>
<br/>
I have another folder for utilities:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">sources\fzUtils</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Inside this folder, at the moment I have two things:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">string functions (fzString.h)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
and
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">my own single linked list class (fzSLList.h)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I am using my string functions all over the place in my project, without any problems.
<br/>
<br/>
However, when I start using my list class, I get this error at compile:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
1&gt;fzBuildMesh.o: In function `fzBuildMesh(unsigned char*, fzMesh&amp;)':
<br/>
<br/>
1&gt;c:/Projects/fuze/fzEngine/sources/fzMesh/fzBuildMesh.cpp(30): undefined reference to `fzSLList&lt;fzVec3&gt;::Add(fzVec3)'

<br/>
<br/>
1&gt;c:/Projects/fuze/fzEngine/sources/fzMesh/fzBuildMesh.cpp(39): undefined reference to `fzSLList&lt;fzVec3&gt;::Add(fzVec3)'
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, it's not being found at link time.
<br/>
<br/>
Originally, I thought perhaps my sources\fzUtils folder is not in the Makefile... however, here's the line from my Makefile that has ALWAYS worked before... remember, my string stuff, which works, is in the same folder as the list:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">SOURCES      :=   sources/fzMath sources/fzUtils sources/fzMesh sources/fzMaterial sources/fzAnim sources/fzObject sources/fzPrimitives sources/fzGfx sources/fzBase sources/fzGame</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas what I could be doing wrong ?
<br/>
<br/>
This only broke when I started using the list class... before I was using vector, and I wanted to replace that with the list instead.
<br/>
<br/>
I imagine it's because my string stuff is just functions and not a class, and my list is a class... (However, I am using lots of other classes, specifically in fzMath for vectors and matrices, without any problems...)
<br/>
<br/>
I am using Visual Studio 2005.

Try taking a look in the build folder and see if you can find which objects files are not being built. That might help you start to work out what's wrong...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you for your reply,
<br/>
<br/>
it seems to me that all objects are being built... and in my build folder I do find "SLList.o" and "SLList.d" and they're not 0 kilotbytes, so there's data in there.
<br/>
<br/>
My main.o / main.d are there, all of my math classes, BuildMesh.o / BuildMesh.d are there, which is one of the first functions that the linker trips up on...
<br/>
<br/>
Should I be looking for something more specific ?
<br/>
<br/>
Anything else it could be ?
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I changed was that I started using my class instead of std::vector...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
