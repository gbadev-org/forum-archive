    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a template I can use for Internet connection? I should use a template but it has to work with libnds, non C++, and I should be able to add the stuff from my own templates as well. I also need help to use this stuff because I never did before. That is because I am making a program called MsgDraw, you draw messages on the screen and send/receive, liike e-mail.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You might want to try looking at Sgstair's example code first. You can find it here <a class="postlink" href="http://akkit.org/dswifi/index.html" target="_blank">http://akkit.org/dswifi/index.html</a>. You can then add what you need to your template. Im not sure if you have yet but you will need to download the wifi lib as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
