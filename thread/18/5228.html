    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all, I'm just getting into programming now (although I've been wanting to for 8 years) but I have one question about NDS paks.
<br/>
 Is there anyway to dump the rom from a card and save them to my hard drive?
<br/>
 If so is it also possible to format the cart and put something else on it?
<br/>
<br/>
This is not for distribution of commercial games, I know they are available as roms but unplayable at the moment, but I'm curious whether It be possible to dump things off the card as back up.
<br/>
<br/>
Also on that note, could you then hack said rom and read it's code, not to steal but to view and learn.
<br/>
<br/>
On another note, do you think it'll ever be possible to update pictochat software pre loaded onto your DS, for extra colors or add a minigame/art program into the internal memory pictochat is stored in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, but it requires a lot of existing hardware/software experience. You have to do things to the DS (stop RTC, I believe), then write code to dump data from the DS slot to a flash cart.

No.

Encryption is meant to keep you from viewing. This means you're not supposed to.

<br/>
Probably not. I'm not clear on if the firmware on the DS is using any sort of rewritable media (i.e. flash or EEPROM). Even if it is, updating such a thing by homebrewers is asking to make a brick.
<br/>
<br/>
In a similar vein to Sandymac, I'd suggest reading everything you can in the forums, not just recent stuff. Your questions suggest a lack of general knowledge that cannot be efficiently corrected in a question and answer format, which makes folks less inclined to go over minutia (as they have done time and time again).
<br/>
Time to do some reading. Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
As for dumping roms etc. I think I'll wait until it becomes a bit more public/commercialized so it invovles less building of hardware. For now I'll stick with the actually learning to code part.
<br/>
<br/>
 I personally though my questioned seem quite though out though and directed to a point of answer. Shows why I failed english....
<br/>
<br/>
As for making bricks plenty of people have done so for other systems, like the GP32. Well if the rumours are true we'll be seeing some software for the DS anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, but why would Nintendo include such a feature? Besides the fact that it would be just begging to have their system pirated, there's no reason for them to use this. Plus it would drive cart costs *way* up.

Sounds good. I think you'll fit into the discussions much better, and the questions you'll have will be able to have actual helpful replies (unlike this one :) )
<br/>
<br/>
Even when such a commercial product is available, this wouldn't be the ideal place to ask about dumping games, even if your intentions are good, for every good intention theres 100 people with negative ones (blah blah, you've heard it all before).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 To be most specific and less suspicious. The game I was on about was Ping Pals. It's awful  but I would have wanted a back up if I have screwed it up. Also I wanted to see thier keyboard, but ones been released now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
