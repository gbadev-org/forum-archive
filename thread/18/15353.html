    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok so here's my question. How do I do simple background tile graphics? I have read guides, and they tend to go way more in depth on how they work than I would like. All I want to know is how to create tiles and assign them to spots on the backround manually. I know there is a way because I have seen part of an example, but it didnt give enough to actually make my own from it. I have actually made my own sort of tiling program in BASIC once for use in a calculator game, but that is too inefficient for my liking and I would like to know how this works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This leads to me getting bored with stuff I have already seen while trying to gather what little extra bits the guide has here and there. They all organize stuff differently and teach it a bit different, leading to a mesh of my old teaching and new ways to do it. that makes life confusing, lol. btw, does anyone know how to force my computer to use the devkitpro compiler? I got a new thing for PC programs, and now whenever I try to compile using "make makefile" my computer freaks out because it uses the wrong compiler for some dumb reason. When I got the 2nd compiler, it changed all the thumbs for the main.c files too... any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
that way i have a consistent development environment and i don't need to use msys and whatnot. :^)

plus, if you make batch files that start your rom with any emulator, you can put each .bat into the projects workspace and run a .bat simply by doubleclicking it in the project file tree. :^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Alphanoob: What experience do you have with C++ on your computer, making programs for your computer (no DS involved)? There is a way to learn the above steps one at a time if you're willing to take a detour through MinGW-land.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

All I do is enter a tile's number and where I want it on the screen. It is easy enough to do in BASIC, as I have said many times. This eliminates all of that other confusing stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
lesson 3: what are if loops? ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
if/else if/else are called conditional branches. switch/case/default is somewhat similar to this.
<br/>
<br/>
while, for, do/while are loops. by nature, they have conditional execution. even if it's just a constant "true" condition. :^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oh yeah, the while loops... I never got those. If you make it while(1), when does it end? I mean, can you only have one while in a whole program? or do you make something like if(X = 7) then end?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#154223 - silent_code - Sun Apr 13, 2008 12:51 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">an infinit loop (e.g. while(true){...}) can be left with with the usual "break;" in a conditional branch.
<br/>
<br/>
of course you can have more than one loop in your program! but usually, these will be finite, e.g. while(doStuff) { ... at some point set "doStuff = false;" to quit} or any other conditional statement - note, that this reads "while(doStuff == true)" or "while(doStuff != 0)", but as doStuff has a value you can omit the "== true" or "!= 0" part.
<br/>
don't forget to set your conditional variable ("doStuff" in this case) according to the starting conditions before the loop or the loop body will not be entered in case of "doStuff == false", because "while" checks the condition BEFOREHAND in contrast to "do{...}while(doStuff)" which checks it after the first and each execution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
while(X = 1)
<br/>
doStuff
<br/>
<br/>
then I should make sure that X = 1 to start with, otherwise it is just a bunch of wasted code...
<br/>
this makes so much more sense to me now! This could be used to program in each level of a simple game
<br/>
while(level = 1)
<br/>
level one's code
<br/>
while(level = 2)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wrong!
<br/>
because, in your example you assign x the value 1 at the beginning of the loop. that's why the loop would yield the same result over and over again.
<br/>
<br/>
use "while(x == 1)" instead. ;^)

If that is the deal though, I guess its back to "Sams Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours" with me =) (that is the book I got, and it is really helpful). But a library, its just like splitting commands up into a LOT of different vars, right? like when you tell it that "held = keysHeld()" to make programming a bit more manageable? btw, u guys are sooooo helpful.

    <h4>#154306 - silent_code - Mon Apr 14, 2008 2:18 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">libs - short answer: no.
<br/>
long answer: the devkits are NOT libraries! the are DEVKITS containing compilers, linkers, as well as language standard libraries and misc. utilities.
<br/>
<br/>
these are required to compile anything for a specific platform (x86/x64, ARM, pwrPC, 68000 etc. in all variations, e.g. nds, gba, ps3, x360, ngc, win32...).
<br/>
<br/>
but to use any specific functionality/hw (like MMX, SSE on the pc, OAM on gba/nds etc.), you have to interface the platform in a specific way. this is done e.g. via writing specific values (depending on the effect you want to have on the hw) to specific memory locations (all the 0x00430434F's ;^) ) in specific ways (byte/half/word writes etc).
<br/>
<br/>
to ease the use of that hw, which is not directly addressed (you don't need to explicitly program the fpu, just use floats! ;^) ) by the language/compiler (c/c++), you define names for those memory locations (or "addresses") as well as functions to do common tasks. like a function, that uses the hw divider. it is common to define macros for addresses.
<br/>
<br/>
a library is therefore a set of supporting code. like openGL/AL are helping you to program your graphics/audio hw. you have an API in most, if not all, libraries, which can be a set of definitions (macros), functions, data structures and sometimes also data.
<br/>
<br/>
libs (like libnds - in gcc most, if not all, libs have the lib prefix and one of the following suffixes: .a, .lib and others, with those two the most common  to me) are basically compiles code, that needs to be linked to other code, that will provide a program entry point (main(...)) to create the executable. note, that the entry point can also be in a lib! but as long as you don't make a build with an executable compiler target (which links the code and yields the exe instead of just object files or libs), you can't execute the code!
<br/>
<br/>
at this stage, i don't think you "need" to write your own library. use an existing one, like libnds, to interface the hw. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
puuuh. hope that's clear (an correct) enough. make sure you check terms in wikipedia, that should give you enough information. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
happy learning!
<br/>
<br/>
ps: write as much as needed. till now, i, personally, find your post ok. those who want to learn, need to ask! ;^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want to reliably call a function in one file from a function in another file, or from a function closer to the top of the same file, you need a prototype.

<br/>
Yes. Without prototypes, the compiler won't reliably translate between integer and floating-point types or between 32-bit and 64-bit numeric types. Without prototypes, the compiler won't check to make sure that structs and pointers are specified in a way that has well-defined behavior.

fpu = floating point unit, a.k.a. math co processor - well, not really, because it's been an integrated part of the cpu in most "big" processors for many years. the gba/nds don't have one, though. that's why we use fixed point instead.
<br/>
<br/>
you only need to declare functions that either (1) are used in other .c/.cpp files (a.k.a. modules) or (2) when two functions are in the same source file, but need to call each other, you must at least declare the second one. that's because the compiler will create it's symbol table in the order you write your functions.
<br/>
<br/>
example:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
// warning: this program is absolute nonsense, HITS SI UNST!
<br/>
<br/>
int run(int woooot, int gnahl); // you can specify a parameter name, but all that's needed are the types. well, names are always better, so that you don't have to look it up in the source file (when working with bigger bunches of code)! i'm making up words, too!
<br/>
<br/>
void do(int arrrr)
<br/>
{
<br/>
    int brrr = 0;
<br/>
 // do some stuff...
<br/>
    --brrr;
<br/>
    arrr++; //yes, you can do that! arrrr is a local variable just like brrrr, but it's initial value is assigned via the function call.
<br/>
    brrrr = run(arrrr, 5); // we can call run(), even though, that the definition comes later and the compiler has no idea what it does, because we have declared it beforehand and the compiler at least can check the types and parameter count etc. it also knows that sooner or later there must be some definition, else it'll shout at you in foreign tongues!
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
int run(int waffle, int baffle)
<br/>
{
<br/>
// uh, did i just change the parameter names? makes no difference, as just the names for the definition count, because these have to be used in there! means here:
<br/>
<br/>
    int ruffle = waffle * baffle &amp; waffle;
<br/>
    int shnizzle = baffle - ruffle;
<br/>
    do(shnizzle); // do() has been already defined, so for this call, a declaration is not needed.
<br/>
    return(256 &amp; ruffle);
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>

make sure, that when you have to call a function inside another module, you either put the declaration directly into the source file (might seem noobish, i don't know) or you make a nice header file and put it there. that way, whenever you need to access do() or run(), you just have to include the header.
<br/>
<br/>
don't include source files. don't define functions inside headers, unless you make them inline (and extern for c++). but that's a topic for later.
<br/>
<br/>
now check out what you've just learned. (if that amount to &gt; 0, that is. ;^D )
<br/>
<br/>
PS: i think we might be a bit offtopic here, with all this "teaching" etc. at least that's not really nds dev related. split and move?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
btw, that was the most awesome program I have ever seen. There is only one thing that throws me off about it though (and I can guarantee that this is a very noob thing for me to not know)
<br/>
<br/>
when you say:
<br/>
"int ruffle = waffle * baffle &amp; waffle;"
<br/>
<br/>
what does the "baffle &amp; waffle" part do?
<br/>
note: I am going to go make a new post in the C++ section, so answer there =). oh, and how do you know whether a variable you declare is global or local?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
