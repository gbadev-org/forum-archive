Also, what he referred as the cpu, the metallic thing, is I think the wireless module.

I think the cpu/gpu/etc. chip is under the cartridge port: on the lik-sang pics, there's a square drawn there on the other side of the PCB with lots of capacitors (or whatever) inside, and you can manually check that the upper side of both cartridge ports of the DS aren't placed at the same height, which means the ds cartridge port isn't placed right against the PCB.

    <h4>#31728 - Alex Atkin UK - Tue Dec 14, 2004 4:11 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lets look at it from the most logical point of view.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA had a little button that was pressed when a GB/GBC cart was installed.  This switched it into GBC mode which not only switched the BIOS over and the CPU but also output a higher voltage to the cartridge port than what GBA games use.
<br/>
<br/>
I find it unlikely the DS is designed to handle greater than 3.3V to the GBA port as why would it need more?  So by that logic alone, it doesnt have the power to run a GB cart.
<br/>
<br/>
If it COULD do it so easily then there would be no point in Nintendo not including that functionality as standard as it would be a selling point.  The only logical reason NOT to include it is to save money, meaning it just cant do it period.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course it will be able to emulate a GB, even the GBA could do that, but the DS being a lot faster should plausably be able to emulate a GBC (and plenty of other old consoles) perfectly.  This still relies on a flash cart though so we are still waiting on progress for that.
<br/>
<br/>
Considering how long people have had their hands on DS hardware things are coming along quite well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

The DS is FAR more powerful, CPU-wise than the GB(C), and the DS contains quite a bit more RAM.  Plenty of CPU/RAM for the Z80 to be emulated in.  I think what's going on is there's some sort of back door that they burnt into silicon for Z80 mode (might've forgotten to remove during testing, the "hardware lock" things added right at the end of production due to this realization) and simply these quick solders fixed it.<br/>_________________<br/>Fried Chicken and Orange Soda</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that enables yellow + red, not yellow + green.  there is no old-skewl mode on the GBA.

also, there is a pic of the back of his unit with an umbroken serial number label... there is a skrew under the label.  it would require to break the label to take the thing apart.

<br/>
also, the colours on tha GBA are very noticably color.  under the default theme, ash is red and squirtle is blue.  in his pictures, it was yellow + green.  and unreachable colour combination, unless you are using something such as the Goomba emulator.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

I'm sorry, but this doesn't hold a lot of water with me.  I'm sure most other people (especially those who have gone/are going to college) would agree with me.  I have a friend who has several hundred dollars left on his credit card, has a line of credit $3,000 more than he needs for school, and STILL refuses to get a DS, even though he'd like to have one.
<br/>
<br/>
And I know you're probably thinking "Who cares about your friend, he's not me.", but I'm using this as a general example of a college student who knows school is expensive.

Well, that's my $0.02 in any case... look forward to seeing those pics!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
