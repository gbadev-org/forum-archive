    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I recently download DevKitARM v15 and the updated libnds. 
<br/>
I compiled my code, seems to work fine but now the top and bottom screens have swop [i'm running this on hardware]
<br/>
<br/>
All my code works on the principle that the sub screen is the touch screen, has this changed... hell i'm confused...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's because POWER_SWAP_LCD is set by the firmware by default.  Many coders depended on this, like you did.  All you need is a simple call to the lcdSwap() function.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I was just about to go through my code and start swapping all calls to BG_PALETTE_SUB and the like, which would not have been fun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
