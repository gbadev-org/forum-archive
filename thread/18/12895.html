<br/>
If you send him mails via a hotmail adress you are lost. It will land into spam section. Also urbans are known he goes online about one time a week with 56K modem. He really is one of the hardest to reach persons around here ;P
<br/>
<br/>
I also tried to get contact to him, since he lives in same city and my engine does't work on no$cash anymore, it would have been great to spend some hours together with him to fix that. But wasn't able to reach him neither.
<br/>
<br/>
Just forget it. His service is continuesly coding no$cash with asm. You can't expect community stuff from him. Just hope stuff will be fixed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

no$ has been invaluable for my development, but it's frustrating that it's taking so long for Martin to respond, especially if this is his sole form of income.  I realize that it's the commercial users that are bringing him the bulk of the income, but it's not exactly good advertising for his services if he's so slow to respond.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#152893 - Invertigo - Sat Mar 22, 2008 8:50 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I think I may have just lost my $15. I ordered a copy of the no$gba debugger on February 7th, and according to PayPal you have to file a complaint within 45 days. (Edit: It looks like I actually have one more day to file a claim.) I've sent Martin multiple e-mails from different addresses, and a little over a week ago I finally mailed off a letter.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want to raise an issue with PayPal because I know that using their services to support the development of an emulator is strictly against their policy. I remember when they refused to accept donations for ScummVM despite its well-established legitimacy as a project. I was afraid that if I raised attention to no$gba they might force Martin to remove the donation link from his site. Most importantly of all, I would like a copy of the debugger much more than my $15 back.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I sincerely hope nothing terrible has befallen Martin, I can't say I'd be much more pleased to find that something hasn't. Whether he wants to recognize it or not, he's running a business, and this is simply no way to treat a customer. Once you start accepting peoples' money you have an obligation to uphold your end of the bargain. This means you may have to check your e-mail now and again even if it puts a cramp in your reclusive style.
<br/>
<br/>
Would really like to get my hands on that debugger...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Invertigo on Sat Mar 22, 2008 10:50 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

You're right, it doesn't appear to be addressed in either of those pages. However, it turns out there is another page that specifically addresses <a class="postlink" href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/use/index_frame-outside&amp;ed=games_software" target="_blank">"Games Software"</a> with specific policies regarding Sony, Sega, and Nintendo. Under Nintendo, it clearly says "Software emulators that play Nintendo games without Nintendo hardware are infringing items".
<br/>
<br/>
Don't ask me how to navigate to this page from the general Acceptable Use Policy. I got the link directly from the <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/User:Ender/Paypal/response" target="_blank">e-mails sent by PayPal</a> to the ScummVM team.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it appears I was mistaken about the amount of time has passed since I made my purchase. It has in fact been only 44 days, meaning I can still open a dispute with PayPal. I guess I have a decision to make.
<br/>

If you think that's asinine, how about the <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/User:Ender/Paypal" target="_blank">final reply</a> the ScummVM team got from PayPal after pointing out that their project did not in fact violate any part of the Acceptable Use Policy:

In any case, it appears that PayPal may have already caught on, perhaps because of the person who, earlier in this thread, said they filed a claim and got their money refunded.

I mean, if you read these forums a lot, you more then likely know from other people posting about it that Martin takes a long time to respond. If you really valued that $15, then I don't think you should've ordered in light of that. I think he even has somewhere on his site about him taking a long time to respond anyway? Maybe not.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry, if this sounds a bit harsh, but he's just one man, he does it for a *living*, he's got customers who're paying nearly two THOUSAND dollars each license (just add it up for a whole site!)... in other word he's got *stuff* to do!
<br/>
<br/>
add your and all the other small debug version requests that come in on a dayly basis... what do you think?
<br/>
he's got to maintain a priority list to get things done and interrupting that proved (even though not perfect) model will bring you nothing (except your 15 $ back) and every other person who's ordered will have to wait an additional amount of time, because martin will first have to get the mess you created sorted. (this really is no personal offence to anyone specific!)
<br/>
<br/>
i know, that waiting for your software is annoying, especially when it's *that* long and that you want to start right away. be a little bit more patient and think about what he's doing:
<br/>
he's most likely making his dream come true; individual indipendence through his very own product. something most of us crave for. he's just like you and me  (i don't smoke [etc.], don't know about you ;^D ). some of you know though experience that such a dream is very fragile, especially when you actually live it!
<br/>
<br/>
let him do his thing, think about how many people have, just like you, ordered a copy, in this forum alone! until now he's been a person who can be trusted. think about giving away a LOT of money (sites) to someone on the other side of the globe, a *private* person - still, he's always held his promise to deliver the sw and that's why people trust and continue to support him! as i see it, there's no reason to think that has or will change.
<br/>
<br/>
he's done a very good job with no$ and i appreciate that so much of you support him by ordering or donating! keep it up! free as well as independend software is vital to everyone of us (mostly bedroom coders ;^p )!

Selling independant games from my own site I can say it's pretty simple to set an account up with BMT Micro (or similar).  They'll handle the payments and send the customer an email with a download link to the full version (which they'll even host).  Every month you get mailed a cheque with what you've earnt.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how they feel about selling emulator software though - I can't see anything on their site that prohibits it with digging out the T&amp;C.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I understand your point, but it seems fair that you receive the software within 3 weeks. Furthermore, the registration system was said to be automated (in the faq).
<br/>
<br/>
It is understandable that he could not have the time to serve us, small customers. If I were him, I'll outsource them to some shareware registration company. And as a amateur developpeur, I'll be happy to pay double (to cover the midle man fees) in regard of the astonishing work he did.

Stealing is never OK.  Martin Korth is the copyright holder to no$gba, and as such nobody else has the right to copy it without his explicit permission.  If your software came with a license, read it carefully.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, there are two concepts you should be aware of.  They are legal in nature, but apply to all situations involving equity:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith" target="_blank">Good Faith - Wikipedia</a>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith" target="_blank">Bad Faith - Wikipedia</a>
<br/>
I recommend you read both articles carefully.  Good faith amounts to, "I am being honest and I have no intentions of deceiving anyone or ripping them off; I am under the impression that I am doing things Right."  Bad faith is the opposite, "I am being dishonest or unethical and I have something to gain by being deceitful, dishonest, or otherwise not following proper channels; even if I have nothing to gain, there is a good chance someone else may be hurt by my actions."
<br/>
<br/>
If you just start distributing no$gba because you feel that other people should have access to it, without any other information there is no way to prove that you were not distributing no$gba in Bad Faith.  If you are later contacted and cooperative, it may become obvious that there was no ill will on your part, but that is somewhat up in the air.
<br/>
<br/>
To the extent you made this post at all, I am operating under the assumption that you are operating on Good Faith.  If you distribute no$gba as a service to people while the author is unavailable, requiring various pieces of information from people before distributing the software to them is a good idea.  This is to make sure that they are also operating on Good Faith, and also to get as far away from the grey zone as possible.  The following ought to suffice:
<br/>
<ul>A statement from the other party saying that they will pay Martin $15 for the software as soon as he becomes available.
<br/>
3 recorded attempts at contact, be these CCed/BCCed emails, or forwarded emails, or PDFed screenshots or whatnot.
<br/>
The name, address and telephone number of the party receiving the software.</ul>Keeping hard copies of everything is a good idea.  I would also print the articles on Good Faith and Bad Faith, hilight points that seem exceptionally important, print your original question and any responses that you acted on or otherwise provided useful information.  All of this information should be kept together in a safe place.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">To be completely clear, ignoring copyright and taking things into your own hands is breaking the law and I do not condone this bahavior.</span>  I am posting this information because I think someone will cross that line eventually if the author (Martin Korth) remains missing in action for long enough.  When and if that happens, I would like to see that infraction made in the least offensive manner possible, and I believe this is it.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not legal advice, just my opinion.  I am not an attorney.  If you have any specific legal concerns, please contact an attorney.  As far as I know, they generally charge $100+ an hour in the United States and rates in other jurisdictions are probably similar.

Stealing is the act of taking something from someone without their permission. That means, if you decide, for whatever reason, to send me money, you won't be able to sue me for stealing it by not giving you something in return. Well, at least outside of the US. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
So, stealing is the wrong word in this context. Btw: People have the possibility to undo their monetary transactions.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's assume, the entity you send the money to does not exist anymore (could be an online store etc.)... do they steal from you? No, because they don't exist anymore and you just send your money to nobody. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
But stealing IS giving away things, that the creators charge for to be able to guarantee further development of the product.
<br/>

(@ Holland: Not a personal attack!):
<br/>
Developpers (especially "workers") may not receive a lot of money from sales, but sales are what enable development of new games. If nobody bought a game from company X, they would have a lot trouble finding funding (and a publisher) for their next project. Sales secure jobs. So, if you like it, you buy it, even if that means waiting until the product gets thrown out for 10 ? or something.
<br/>
<br/>
By not buying the games (or any other product, it doesn't matter) from legitimate sources, (talking in general, not to any specific person -&gt;) YOU PERSONALLY are responsible for the demise of studios (only taking poor sales into account here, there are also other reasons why studios have to shut down) that make the games you enjoy playing so much - from which YOU steal. No matter how "big" the publisher or developer is. Anything else is just smug BS.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Maxxie wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Take the chance to improve open source emulators with your missing features or bugfixes.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
No matter how you look at it, no$gba is unique. There is no single other emulator that is as reliable as no$gba, at least none of those I tried. I guess none of us would want it's development stopped, because it's simply too valuable for development. Other emulators would need a major rewrite to become as good as no$gba is.
<br/>
And I'm not writing this with disrespect to those who work on those emulators: it's the opposite, I have deep respect for anyone that tries to make and improve publicly and freely available software that helps others! I'm just telling the truth: no$gba is the only free, commercial quality NDS emulator I know of, with unmatched speed, precision and emulation feature set. EDIT: Improve the situation and "make 'better' emulators" (as if that was that easy, I know ;^) ), in case no$ vanishes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Something I forgot to write about: I guess (although I don't know for sure), the more sales a published makes, the more likely it gets they will publish projects by small, new development studios, which is risky,  as well as new game ideas - the industry is missing innovation, although there's plenty of it available! Guess why?
<br/>
<br/>
Then, a lot of you guys want to get into the "games industry", which is more likely to happen when joining a small team. So, what about that moral point of view? (You have to answer that for and to yourself.)
<br/>
<br/>
So, if you're tired of even more of the same old stuff and want innovation, support developpers and publishers by buying your favorite products. Don't rely on the rest of the world to buy a game, just so you can "get it for free." There's already too much of that thinking going and it's getting harder to explore new gaming grounds with the high financial risks involved.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

atleast if it were open source other people could contribute and we wouldn't be having this issue of sending money to a deadend and having to go through the troubles of getting our money back.
<br/>
<br/>
@sgeos:  thanks for that response.  I would hope that if anyone did acquire a free copy of no$ that they would have full intentions of paying Martin as soon as he comes back.  Hell...I have no problem sending Martin cash just send him cash for his efforts...but the fact remains, he's MIA.
<br/>
<br/>
And again...I didn't mean to offend anyone or make people think that I was all about pirating software.
<br/>
<br/>
@silent_code: I didn't take any offense whatsoever...no worries.  And in response:  Do I download games?  Yes.  Do I buy the games that I like?  YES!!!!  Of course I do!  To me, downloading a game is on par with renting the game...and I'm lazy!  Why drive to the rental place when I can stay in my boxers and get it from home? :D
<br/>
<br/>
I'm most certainly not about pirating software...I'm just a DS homebrew guy that is DYING for some quality debugging...haha.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just looked at it as a textbook ethical dilemma relevant to issues I deal with and tried to deal with it objectively.  Frankly, I'm ambivalent toward the situation for all the reasons that have been stated.
<br/>
<br/>
In so far as "stealing" goes, it may have been the wrong word, but I think I got the idea across.  Receipt of unlicensed copywritten is stealing.  Distribution is aiding theft, and remaining aware but silent is abiding.
<br/>
<br/>
I also hope Martin is OK.  Projects carried out by one person face a high probability discontinuation if life throws something wild at the army of one.

We are open to people collaborating and sending patches or giving them repository access. I've been working on a branch for quite some time now, that has speed up to no$gba/Ideas, so speed isn't an issue. The problem is that compatibility is still and issue, for example, there're several homebrew programs/features that don't work as they should:
<br/>
<br/>
-"Volumetric Shadow Demo"
<br/>
- sonic.ds (I can't remember the author, sorry)
<br/>
- Wifi support
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is a bit off-topic, just saying that if you want a proper tool for debugging/development, and you prefer it open-source, it's not gonna happen without some help of the community, which we don't have atm.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://shashemudev.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://shashemudev.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A decent (16Mb) phone and internet flatrate cost like less than 30? / month here in Germany. It's not a big problem.

I guess he simply refuses to upgrade, be cause he doesn't need to. Dial up can soon exceed 30?, but at least he has full control over the amount he pays for inet. I bet that way (only going online so often in a month) he can keep his bill as low as 5 or 10 ?. ;^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

The law in the USA says otherwise, but people disagree with the law all the time.  Technically, "unauthorized reproduction" would be a better term than stealing, although the concept is similar.

If someone has the copyright to something that has been "abandon", they can appear out of nowhere and sue you for unauthorized distribution.

<br/>
Sorry about that.  The reply was hastily written on little sleep.  =P
<br/>
<br/>
If you distribute abandonware, the copyright holder can appear out of nowhere and sue you for unauthorized distribution.  Would they, probably not, but they could.  Would you need to pay damages?  Who knows.  (There is one way to find out, though.  =)  Would you need to cease distribution, most certainly.  They could probably even be aware of your activities for a while before they actively try to stop your operation.
<br/>
<br/>
My point is that it does not matter if the software has been abandon or not from a legal perspective.  Just because something has been abandon does not mean that the copyright holder is going to be happy about people distributing it.  One could imagine a huge number of scenarios where the copyright holder believes they have something to gain by stopping unauthorized distribution.
<br/>
<br/>
On a more practical note, I do not believe that no$gba has been abandon.  If anything, Martin is just unable to support it at the moment.  This is very different from having abandon something.

<br/>
So far, I have only found a handful of features that don't work correctly (usually they don't even have to, as long as the result convincingly resembles what is going on when running software on hardware) or at all. It's really just like between five and ten things. Other emulators I have tried so far are very slow ("unplayable") most of the time and the feature set is much more restricted.
<br/>
That's unfortunate, though. :^c
<br/>
I even find no$gba better for development than other, commercial emulators.

I was the last active coder of the core (emulation core, I mean) on the official branch, and now I've stopped doing any work on it for reasons that I won't explain. There's another coder working on a different branch, who is not very interested on making it official, so I guess it won't catch up.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://shashemudev.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://shashemudev.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What made no$gba so special was, that is was commercially motivated and made by a very talented and dedicated single person (although one man "programming armies" are usually not that successful!).
<br/>
That kept it up and has driven the project to be the best NDS emulator out there.
<br/>
But what we are experiencing now, is the downside. There should have been at least one other (backup) person handling customer contact and that knew what's going on in real live.

Damn. ("Green turtle!")

Yes.  I'm at an annoying point where my game works in desmume, but fails in NO$GBA (non-debug version) and on hardware.  But without debugging facilities, it's driving me crazy trying to figure out what's going on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I paid the $15 for a home use license of the debugger-enabled version of no$gba before it was widely noticed that Martin had gone "missing". Even when it became rather obvious that I wouldn't be receiving anything for a while, I decided not to ask PayPal for my money back. Obviously, my situation hasn't changed since then, and for several months I've been without a debugger.

This whole ordeal is getting increasingly silly and someone should really put and end to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it simply be possible to define a certain group of people who could be deemed as generally trustworthy, who could continue selling copies of NO$GBA on Martin's behalf until he shows up? He surely would have no objections to having a pile of cash waiting for him once he reappers from wherever he is.
<br/>
<br/>
This would benefit everyone; Martin would get money when/if he shows up, people would get their NO$GBA copies and nobody would have to be called a warez dealer again. My 15$ are waiting.<br/>_________________<br/>--

Rather than leaving Martin as the point of contact, leave the contact side to a small group of trust worthy volunteers (offering minimal time since it's just a matter of checking a mailbox). If anything important comes up then they can contact him directly (like this sort of news); they could also deal with some of the more urgent purchase requests (in the thousands).

But I wouldn't think doing it without permission is a good idea; and going by the image he gives, I would suspect that losing his paypal account would have been the last straw to either canning nocash, or doing something really really silly!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Pardon me, but I think there is a bit more to it than that. To most people, it's just the 15$ they would be happy to exchange for a fine piece of software. But judging from the thread, there are people who are genuinely worried about this whole ordeal, and for them it would be about helping their friend. Or his relatives, if he turns out dead - which would appear a bit unlikely, if it's true that he announced beforehand that he'd be gone for an unknown time. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, at least I'd do it if I'd consider myself to be in that position. I don't ,however, so I'll just step off my soap box now and hope someone swallows the catch ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>--

<br/>
So my opinion is that we should find a way to do both things: 1) find a place where we could <span style="font-style: italic">get the software</span> and 2) find a place where we could <span style="font-style: italic">put the money</span> for the program. Of course then -when Martin comes back- he should receive the keys of the box.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't see this happening in any reasonable way, guys. This is not how things work in the real world. That's why people keep writing, that handling it in such a way is no good and shouldn't be done (because there's no legal way to do it).
<br/>
<br/>
After all, no$ was his sole income (as far as we know it) and there are no relieable people - that's a fact. You can say you are relieable, but how will I know? I can't. So, let's just stop talking about it.
<br/>
<br/>
IF he said, he'll be gone for an undisclosed amount of time (IF! - I yet have to see such a statement - PLEASE! &lt;- Hint.), then he'll be back and everybody will get his / her debugger.
<br/>
I'm waiting, too, and I'm willing to wait even longer.
<br/>
<br/>
I think nobody should give away their copies, for any reason. That it my strong belief and your's may differ, but in the end none of it is really of interest, but what Martin thinks.
<br/>
He should have taken care of it beforehand, now the comunity has to go through it as it is. Bummer, but whatever. There are alternatives.
<br/>
<br/>
So, again, why not visit him? I mean, people are willing to obtain illegal copies (this doesn't fall under abandon ware, yet), but nobody is willing to check if he's ok?

    <h4>#162832 - Invertigo - Sat Sep 13, 2008 8:58 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having a hard time with the holier-than-thou attitudes in this thread. To address the two main "arguments" brought up as a result...
<br/>
<br/>
1) Martin could be dead, and you are a terrible person for only caring about how you can get a copy of his software.
<br/>
<br/>
I have sad news for you folks. People die and go missing every day of the week. For most of us, Martin is someone we know of, but not someone we know personally. I sincerely hope than nothing awful has befallen him. However, even if the worst turns out to be true, I won't grieve for Martin for the same reason you wouldn't grieve if my best friend died in a car accident tomorrow.
<br/>
<br/>
Also important is the fact that nobody has known Martin's whereabouts for over half a year. Those of you who are still seriously concerned about him should be aiding people like silent_code in locating him. Snapping at people for not sharing your great concern (which has so far amounted to nothing being done) isn't helping anyone.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Nobody should be sharing copies of Martin's software, since it would be illegal to do so.
<br/>
<br/>
Rather than legality, I think the real issue is that nobody wants to see Martin cheated out of money in his absence. Well, it's too late for that. I can't say this with certainty, but it seems to me that the majority of donations Martin receives are for the basic ($2.50) version of his emulator. Copies of said version can be found in a dozen different places with a simple Google search. I'm afraid there's really no way put an end to this; as long as Martin's PayPal account remains inactive, it will continue.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the idea of setting up a "seller" for Martin in his absence, I think this is generally a pretty shady proposition. You wouldn't have my trust unless it was run by someone who has been in the scene at least as long as Martin. Even then, all people are capable of selfish things, often to the great surprise of others...
<br/>
<br/>
I'll end this rant by saying that what bothers me the most is the way developers are behaving toward one another. I'm not here because I want to debug my pokemans. Who are you helping by being dismissive and uncooperative toward people who are developing games or applications for the GBA or NDS? What is your intent, throwing about the word "warez" when people have already paid money for copies of this software? Must I remind you that <a class="postlink" href="http://byuu.cinnamonpirate.com/articles/emuethics/" target="_blank">some would argue</a> that it's unethical to even charge for an emulator?
<br/>
<br/>
I know that saying this won't change things, but I just had to get this tl;dr post off my chest.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
This is the thing I never quite got with geeks - instant and absolute incapacitation when it comes to doing anything that involves activities beyond typing on a keyboard. C'mon, it's already been concluded that there are people here who are in Germany? How hard can it be to track down either Martin or his closest relatives, and have it arranged that people can feel safe buying his software?
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
It took me less than 30 minutes after some rather worrying lines on IRC to get the police break the front door of an old net friend, whom I've never met and only know name of.. I might've felt myself a little silly back there, trying to explain the situation to the police of a foreign country, if it wasn't for the fact that doing so actually saved his life. 
<br/>
<br/>
Why am I telling this? Well, I just got a little deja vu from the "perhaps we should do something" attitude of everyone else who were witnessing the said occasion..<br/>_________________<br/>--
