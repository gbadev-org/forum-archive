Is there a sure way to have it look exactly like the original ?

Ah, thanks a lot ! It solved the problem. It was making me crazy :)

Since I'm still waiting for my 3DS (screw you CDiscount !) I couldn't test it on an actual DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Homebrew on the 3DS "in DS mode". My homebrew stuff works fine on a 3DS with SCDS2.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not yet, though they will probably release something along those lines in the future (for the 3DS).  I personally have no info on this topic.  For DS homebrew?  No idea.  My perspective is from the commercial side of things so I have no experience with the homebrew side of things and have to be very, very careful in general about what I say :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
