    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">(This is edited from a <a class="postlink" href="http://gglob.ath.cx/2005/10/12/nintendo-wifi-extension/" target="_blank">post</a> in my <a class="postlink" href="http://gglob.ath.cx" target="_blank">blog</a>.)
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to make something like Xlink Kai for the X-box and Kali for the PC - a tool to emulate local area gaming over the internet - for the DS? I would really like to be able to play Advance Wars DS and Meteos with friends around the world. (Without waiting for Intelligent Systems to make a WWW-enabled version...)
<br/>
<br/>
This might be tougher to make for the DS than it?s X-box counterpart due to the nature of local area connectivity on the two. Microsoft?s console utilizes TCP/IP and wired networks for this, while the DS uses a secret protocol - on the 802.11g-series of bands though. Enter a dedicated wireless network card as a bridge between good old fashioned network and the DS-net. With the right drivers one has been able to wirelessly connect certain types of hardware to the DS and send demos and firmware updates to it, so this can be done.
<br/>
<br/>
Let?s just hope it will. :) (Maybe even Nintendo has this planned?)
<br/>
<br/>
Another problem all together is how well the games support lag and latency in the net as they are (or might have been) constructed for play with more direct connection. Both Advance Wars and Meteos should be safe there, though. Advance Wars being turn based and Meteos? interaction between players is just "sporadic" (and not extremely time critical) when sending meteos to the other(s)?

<br/>
Any thoughts? Anyone already working on it?<br/>_________________<br/>-mortenjohs
