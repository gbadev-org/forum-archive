    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello,
<br/>
<br/>
seeing as pretty much all cards firmware auto-patch the homebrew games, and to use the homebrewmenu as the default menu you need the dldi patch, I decided to try and create an dldi patch extractor. or has one already been created?
<br/>
<br/>
now if I understand correctly from reading the source code of dlditool and homebrew menu, the patch should be in main memory, start with magic string "\xED\xA5\x8D\xBF Chishm" (4 byte number, 7 byte string and 1 byte terminating null character), is DO_driverSize long with a maximum of 32KB (DO_driverSize is the pointer to the magic string + 0x0D). is this right?
<br/>
<br/>
then I can just copy all of it to a file, right? is there anything else I would need to do?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">not sure I see the point... don't most of the launchers already read the dldi from a file before patching? so wouldn't you are ready have the file?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know about other cards menus, but I couldn't find it in my cards menu. and you would need to have the patch if you want to use an other menu as standard menu, like the homebrewmenu. 
<br/>
<br/>
but apparantly wintermute created an dldi patch extractor when I wasn't looking.
