    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi ive some questions about the memory layout!
<br/>
<br/>
1.
<br/>
Is arm9 code forced to be in main memory and arm7 code in the exclusive iwram?
<br/>
if no: why is it like so by default, and is it any good reason?
<br/>
if yes: is the memory copied from the ROM data or is there special memory in the cart?
<br/>
<br/>
2.
<br/>
What kind of sections do really exist? in GBA it was so easy  you just could write section iwram/ewram/rodata and the code/data was putted there, why isnt it like that for DS?
<br/>
<br/>
3.
<br/>
I looked at the makefile for tutorial 6 when the program cat was runned, what is it doing?
<br/>
<br/>
4.
<br/>
How is memory allocation functions written? is it a global pointer to the free memory or something? how is it usually done?
<br/>
for example if I do like this:
<br/>
<br/>
u32 *a = alloc(1024);
<br/>
u32 *b = alloc(2048);
<br/>
<br/>
free(a);
<br/>
<br/>
u32 *c = alloc(512);
<br/>
u32 *d = alloc(1024);
<br/>
<br/>
free(b);
<br/>
<br/>
free(c);
<br/>
free(d);
<br/>
<br/>
what should an ultimate allocation routine look like?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can answer any of my questions;)
<br/>
any help is very welcomed cause iam really confused!
<br/>
Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The nds file contains both arm7 and arm9 binaries. The start addresses and lengths of each are also specified in the header. The loaders copy these binaries to the specified places.

The DS doesn't have read only memory, all code is run from RAM. The equivalent of iwram on the ARM9 side of the DS would be itcm &amp; dtcm, the ARM7 exclusive RAM is the equivalent on ARM7 but the devkitARM crtls place all ARM7 code and data there by default.

Because not everybody has a GBA flash card. On the DS, ROM is considered a block device, in the form of a DS Game Card (if you're a licensed developer) or a CF or SD card (in a GBAMP, SuperCard, or M3). These block devices resemble a traditional disk drive much more than they resemble GBA ROM.

<br/>
Because if your storage is a block device, your program structure is going to be much more like a GBAMP CF multiboot program (such as Dwedit's PocketNES) than like a GBA ROM for the purposes of accessing assets.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you want to get a job with a licensed developer, then you are going to have to learn how to make your programs run the way official DS games run. Distributing a program as both a DS card and a GBA ROM will make the program twice as expensive to replicate, and Nintendo is not likely to approve it either.

You do realise most of that stuff isn't actually <span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span> for homebrew development? I mean, sure, if you <span style="font-style: italic">want</span> to spend that much...if you really want to inflate costs, after buying a GP2X you'd need to buy a lifetime supply of AA batteries! And hey, a computer would be good, and now I'll <a class="postlink" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/08/25" target="_blank">need a house</a> to live in while I'm coding...
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, what you actually NEED to develop on the DS would look rather like this:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Nintendo DS (you may already own one of these)
<br/>
</li><li>Ralink wifi card (if you weren't fortunate enough to own one already)
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Note at this point you've spent less than the cost of a GP2X even if you bought a new wifi card. You need a Passme2 and a game <span style="font-style: italic">if</span> you have the new firmware <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> don't know a friend who can flash it for you <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> can't or won't attend a flashme meetup. You can sell both the Passme2 and the game afterwards if you're really short on cash. I always thought the point of DS development over GP2X development was that millions of us, literally, own a DS already (unlike the GP*) so the cost of homebrewing is the cost of a wifi card, in my case, and nothing else. If you want a console only for homebrew, why buy a console at all? Just develop GBA games on an emulator for free.
<br/>
<br/>
...on the other topic: the reason so few people run code from ROM is because as tepples said, not everybody has a GBA flash card. If your game <span style="font-style: italic">requires</span> a flash card to run, you've greatly reduced the number of people who will run it.
<br/>
<br/>
For maximum portability, write it to stream assets in at runtime via a variety of methods, and when running on a flashcart, your generic code (it IS all written generically, right?) will just be reading it from cart ROM rather than CF or whatever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You would need to have your DS flashed already before you could run unsigned code (aka Homebrew) by sending it directly from a Ralink card.

Even if you do manage to find a used DS with firmware v1-v3 at a pawn shop, WMB still gives a corrupted logo and WiFiMe still needs GBA flash equipment. If the DS is your first handheld, how do you flash a DS without GBA flash equipment and without someone else on the Flash Equipment Meetups page who lives in your town?

And as for nesdev, the NES is out of patent so anybody can make and sell a famiclone without breaking the law as long as only homebrew ROMs are included if any.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
