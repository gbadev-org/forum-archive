    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm going to just throw this out there, as I think I already know the answer:
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone written code, either C or assembly, that can write to a M3SD?
<br/>
<br/>
The answer is probably no, but I wanted to make sure before I start development of my own code.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: If anyone wants to post links here with M3SD reference, such as register definitions, etc., go ahead</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Download the sdk. In the specs folder you have a detailed description of ms3d and milkshape ascii format. Are you going to do a ms3d editor?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
