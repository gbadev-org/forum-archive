    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was reading around about WPA and I found that<ul>
<br/>
<li>WPA should be able to run on WEP hardware with very little modification
<br/>
</li><li>WPA can be done entirely through software</li></ul>
<br/>
Now, I know next to nothing about Wi-Fi and encryption. Is there some technical limitation as to not having WPA for the DS? (not WPA2)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The hardware used in the DS doesn't support WPA. It may require little modification, but on a fixed hardware platform any modification at all is too much.
<br/>
<br/>
The DSi *does* have WPA, but is not backwards compatible with DS games. I imagine that this is the minor hardware modification + software support that you have read about in action.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
