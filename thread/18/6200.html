Looks great, and designed for practicality as well (tile based). Graphic designers often forget practicalities, limitations or hardware considerations of the system. It was designed by a programmer, so it follows these principles.

We need a simple ndslib example with keyboard so people can easily integrate one. Why do I say that... hmm I need one for my app and I don't really want to write my own keyboard app.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Headspin, I added a keyboard in PA_lib, made from pictochat's (if someone has an original new design, I'm open ! I don't like taking other people's designs...), you can check/be inspired/copy the code if you like, it's free to use :)  It has all the basic stuff, with numbers, upper and lower case, etc...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No offence, but I prefer to use ndslib. Your work with PA looks really great, but it looks like a headache to integrate into my current source (based on an ndslib example). Thanks for your offer though. Nice use of the Picto-Chat graphics, and assortment of gems.

Lol, that was why I was asking if anyone had another design they could 'lend'...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't talking about using PA on that one, I know you don't want, but the code remains available to use... That's what I was talking about</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry Mollusk, I was just referring to the Pictochat keyboard rip I did, and was assuming you used them graphics, which is what there for, but I was just teasing sorry ;)

<br/>
BTW Your doing a great thing with PA, so don't worry about my silly humour ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
