    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to compile and inject code to be put in a WMB .nds. But, I'm stuck. How do I setup a Makfile/project so it compiles c/c++/asm, and injects the code in the main function, to a specified location in the .nds?(This location would be at the end of the header)(Modding bytes at that location doesn't void RSA)
<br/>
<br/>
I do not want the whole 56K code injected. I ONLY want the code contained in main to be copied. So, if a=b would be in main, only a=b would be injected.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, each processor executing this code would jump to wherever to would have started from the beginning, when it's done with everything else.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
