    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since about two weeks I am struggeling to get the DLDI-enables filesystem running, thinking that I tried everything. The most simple examples did not work (using PAlib, everyone in the forum exept me seem to get this thing working thread: <a href="http://palib.info/forum/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2632&amp;post_id=20170#forumpost20170" target="_blank">http://palib.info/forum/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2632&amp;post_id=20170#forumpost20170</a>) I installed the latest card-firmware and the latest DevKitARM r20 and the latest PAlib. Nothing works, I even tried patching with other DLDI-files - nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
I use the M3 lite (micro)SD and there a lots of homebrew that can be patched without problems running smoothly. Even the DLDI_tester (http://dldi.drunkencoders.com/uploads/5/5c/Dldi_tester.zip) was running seamlessy with the M3-DLDI patch.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I am asking if it would be possible to release the source-code of the DLDI-tester. This would even me help to figure out the problem/error. The hardware is able to run DLDI-patched homebrew, but somewhere between code, compile, patch and running on the DS must be an source of error. 
<br/>
<br/>
The source-files of the DLDI-tester to try-out and compile for myself would be an remarkable help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The other thing would be (if chishm won't be sharing his code) to write a 100% proof simple template to share.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about the PAlib examples?  Do they not work either?  If you are unable to compile and use them, then I would think there is something wrong with your dev environment.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks a lot Diddl. I succesfully compiled and patched the test and a first own r/w test. It works! Now I can figure out the error. The first thing I can think of is the line 
<br/>
<br/>
sysSetBusOwners(1,1); 
<br/>
<br/>
which I have no clue what it does. Nevertheless now I can build upon that template. Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
