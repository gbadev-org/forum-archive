This is my first DS based project regarding modelling.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basing on Nintendo specification, DS can handle 120,000 polygons per second. If you want to have 60 FPS, there are only 2000 polygons per frame :( 
<br/>
<br/>
In 30 FPS there will be about 4000 polygons per frame.
<br/>
<br/>
You must choose polycount of all scene, that DS can handle, basing on those values.

Do my models need to be converted to triangle's?

Use quads as much as possible. The DS has a hard limit on the number of polygons it can draw per scene (either 2048 or 4096, I forget which) and I *think* that a quad counts as one poly, not two. So if everything's quads, you can draw twice as much as if you convert everything to tris.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When my model is finished (i use lightwave) too what kind of format i should export the model? And what about the texture's attached to a model?

I'll be doing the code to display the models but I haven't the time yet to check the ndslib or PA lib to see what's supported. A quick piece of advice for him will be appreciated by both of us.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not quite true, I've tested it, and although you can get 2048 triangles on the screen at a time, you can only get 1536 quads at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
This makes sense when you think of it in terms of vertices, since in both cases the DS has to compute 6114 verts. So it is useful to use quads, but the advantage isn't so great that you will necessarily want to sacrifice quality by merging triangles into quads.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the last thing you want to do is split all your quads into a planar set of triangles =P<br/>_________________<br/>If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, why the heck do you care?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats good to know, LunarCrisis-
<br/>
<br/>
Makes me wonder though, if its a vertex processing limit, shouldn't we be able to get upto 6142 triangles out of these verts if they were sent as a single triangle strip?
<br/>
<br/>
I did some experiments with tristrips a few weeks ago, &amp; 2048 tris sounds about right as the limit I was seeing.  Maybe the verts are transformed and stored unstripped in a 6144 vert buffer for some later scanline processing.
<br/>
<br/>
I?m working on merging tris to quads now... getting up to 50% more detail sounds worthwhile.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've also done a couple of tests with strips, and as far as I could tell I was getting one _less_ triangle when I used strips (128 tris each) then when I gave them individually, which doesn't make much sense. When I used quads, I got an increase in the number of quads, but only by about 15% or so, which is much less than I expected.<br/>_________________<br/>If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, why the heck do you care?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
