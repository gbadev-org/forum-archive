    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a "saver" folder on my card and any game stores a 262144b file in it. My homebrew does the same. I do nothing specific to make this file, but I'd like to write something in it, as soon as it exists. Maybe someone here knows how to use this space?

I haven't succeded in writing files the same way I read them, and this seems to be logical, because readable files are packed into .srl file, and it has nothing to do with this "saver".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
