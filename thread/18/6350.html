    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I currently thought about these thing, I know some people thought about them too but they have not/have been discussed:
<br/>
<br/>
1- Why cannot they just use the metroid demo that came witht the ds to try and copy games on it?
<br/>
<br/>
2- Can't the people who are hacking the wifi system of the ds ask gamespot for some code? 
<br/>
<br/>
3- Why can't groups like nitro/darkain/etc just team up and work out their ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
4- I think that if the ds software may be edited to load the gba cartridge on both screen. What I am saying is, like pc coding, when you click on a button and i t opens two windows you can also change that button to open one window no?
<br/>
<br/>
5- I own only a supercard for now , and I thought that it could be used along with wifi, so that the wifi system stores files on the flash cart, and then uses it to load files etc. It is not necessary to load everything from the supercard, the pc is there too!!
<br/>
<br/>
Think about what I said here, I think some of these ideas are good, but maybe others think they are too complicated or that they are nonsense, but I am free to say my opinion NO.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No need for flames about this, but there still might be. It just seems you've underestimated the homebrew community just a tad, that's all
<br/>
<br/>
What's obvious has been tried. There's a lot of smart people at work and they've exhausted a lot of possibilities, and they're STILL coming up with better hacks every day. The pace of improvement was faster around late Spring, but these guys are still at it.

GameSpot has no code. All they will get is specs for the WiFi station hardware, at most, and I doubt they even get that. They probably won't even get that until next year. Even if they did have code, they'd violate some legal agreements in sharing it. You'd get more help by asking Nintendo for code, as in none whatsoever.

<br/>
Sorry, I'm not familiar with nitro, but nitro also refers to the official Nintendo SDK equipment. For legal reasons we steer clear of Nintendo SDK info. As for groups working together, there's a lot of people working together. Just because a lot of work has been closed source (while most has been open) doesn't mean that it's exclusive to one person. As for working out people's ideas together, you're being a bit idealist; it's not that easy to just make stuff happen. More people on the same problem should mean multiple approaches rather than some magical collaboration that will make it all work.

<br/>
Homebrew already uses both screens. If you're referring to GBA games on both screens, well they actually do show up on both, just one at a time. It's a bit impractical to hack it to use both screens even if it is possible, you'd lower both battery life and LCD life unnecessarilly.

<br/>
I may be off on this but I suspect that GBA cart through the DS is limited in space, and you can't use the entire cart because there are differences between all the different carts. So it's not like you can just use WiFi with the DS as a cart writer, and there's little reason to when you have a cable/writer for the cart to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
We can already load some assets through WiFi and others from the cart, and if you wanted to, from both for the same game/app. WiFi hasn't been figured out enough to load data any other time than DS Download Play, that's all.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

5 would also be interesting when WiFi is cracked, although it sacrifices portablility and such.

It would be cool to have it load huge levels from the computer though, and not having to worry about size. Still, you can fit alot on a 1gigibite flash cart.

<br/>
1 is simply not possible.

2 won't work either, even licensed nintendo developers wouldn't be able to help us with this, as they have no idea about how wifi really works. They can only access it through library routines written by nintendo.

I know about the driver thing, actually, you posted it after a previous rant of mine :P (I don't know if it was to shut me up or completely unrelated though).

What about a Linux version for another card? Would you port that? And how about releasing your driver's source? I think having that source would make it much easier to write a Linux driver.

And no, this stuff isn't meant as a personal attack at you, but rather as a plea to release the code. I see so many advantages and no disadvantages.

But, the final decision is of course up to you, and I don't think my screaming will make you want to release the code more, so I'll try to write less personal attacks and more arguments.

You see, the problem there, is that it's Ping Pals.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I totally agree, but i meant that the file is much smaller, and simpler

and the one file has both master and slave communications</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't have much productive to add here, but I need to note that made me laugh out loud.
<br/>
<br/>
The probability does seem low that someone would both have ping pals, two or more DSes, and the necessary equipment to dump it.
<br/>
<br/>
If only because of the criteria Sausage Boy mentioned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So what specific changes would need to be made to the Linux rt25xx driver for TCP/IP to make a Linux rt25xx driver for Nintendo DS?

I would like to know that too. Btw, the driver doesn't have to do any DS specific things, that is all handled by the wmb app in user mode.

Hmmmm. I suppose by that viewpoint, someone who can dump (and therefore kind of sane) can borrow the game (and kinda have it) would meet all the necessary criteria. Kind of.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
