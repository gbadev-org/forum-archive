    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a mesh that I have made from a few hundred triangles. I have been using the textured cube demo and have got most of it working except textures...
<br/>
<br/>
The demo does a texture on each triangle, how do I apply a texture to my whole mesh? You know, cover it like a blanket ofver the whole thing...
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers for your help,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Both... I am playing around on the emu but always test stuff on the hardware... but the code I have for textures is from the cube demo, so I want to know how to modify it.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You apply a texture to a mesh by applying a seperate piece of the texture to each face, which is a pain to do manually. If you are doing anything more complicated than a cube (which it appears you are), then you are going to want to use a 3d modelling tool to make a "UV mapping" for it, which is, as you said, taking a texture and wrapping it around the mesh like a blanket. Unfortunately, I don't know of any thing to export from these programs into something the DS can read.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on an export script for blender that will export mesh/uv data/textures from blender, but it's nowhere near ready for release yet.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have written a somple conversion program that takes a lwo from,ightwave and views it using a modified version of the cube demo. I don't know how to modify the code to make a UV map... the cube demo just uses an array of four points for each vector and has some sort of texture pack for each point. Does the UV map bear any resemblance to the ormals for each poly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
