    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello again everyone, I've been trying to add an SGF file parser to the Go program I've been working on, and I wanted to use the Boost::Spirit library. It seemed to compile fine, but right now, I have no way of parsing the file. 
<br/>
<br/>
Boost::Spirit either parses from a string (and I don't want to store a huge text file in a string), or from a file_iterator, which is defined in Boost::Spirit. However, I cannot use file_iterator, because it uses standard i/o functions (like fopen and fseek), which as far as I know, are not available--I'm using Chism's FAT library.
<br/>
<br/>
In some other threads here, I noticed some people making reference to Boost, so I thought someone might have already tried using Spirit with a DS game. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to make a file iterator that works with both a Supercard and Spirit? 
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to make a new thread instead of bumping my old one because I'd love to hear Boost+libnds discussion/success stories in general, whether related to my problem or not. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On my last project, I mostly used boost::bind and smart pointers.

Oh man, now I feel dumb for not looking for other libraries. Thanks. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Then how will the user be able to select an SGF file? As I understand it, it is impossible to make a file chooser with libfat unless the user connects the memory card to the PC, does dir /s /b I:\ &gt; I:\dir.txt to list all files on the card to a text file, and does not create or delete any file on the card without updating the text file that contains the file list.
<br/>
<br/>
Or has libfat been changed? If so, where is libfat's homepage? Chishm's site on drunkencoders seems to describe only gba_nds_fat.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
But I can make a file chooser with Chism's library, and then just use libfat for actually reading the file, right? Do I understand this right, or is there something preventing me from using both? Is this unsafe? Or possibly just bad practice?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
