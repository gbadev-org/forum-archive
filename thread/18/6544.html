    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there.. I just noticed in the NDS software package, it contains two holders one for the NDS-sized cart, the other for GBA sized cart. A question came to mind that whether the DS can use both cart slots at the same time. Does anyone have information regarding this possibility? Whether it's sensible to do it is another question, but I can imagine using the GBA cart as an additional data storage, or, the ability to interact with GBA software.. the newly announced Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon Blue Rescue Force (DS) and Red Rescue Force (GBA) may be it..

I know that several games check the header of the game in the GBA slot and unlock stuff accordingly.  I also remember reading of an expansion of Band Brothers that is going to be released containing additional songs.  It's on a GBA cart so you need the DS card to play of course.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally can't wait for an adventure game with additional dungeons or other content stored on GBA carts. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Rumble pack is easy to make yourself though ;)
<br/>
Connect some data line of GBA slot to a MOSFET. Connect the MOSFET to a pager motor. Then write some game to "excite" that data line...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, I think the Table Hockey Tech Demo from e3 can apparently use WarioWare: Twisted! as a rumble pak.   I haven't tried this myself but I remember several people saying this so it's probably true. :P<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PS. wasn't there a rumored "gyroscopic" controller pack for the GBA slot? or was that something else...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It isn't rumor, "Wario Ware Twisted' and "Yoshi's Universal Gravitation" both use it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would it actually add "performance" to the console? (I'm not familiar with the IO performance on the DS..) I think what I was trying to discern is whether it's a gimmick or it has a real application.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
