While this news was lightly touched on at e3, development sources who wish to remain anonymous have reported that it is indeed true. The Nintendo DS software can retrieve data from the GBA slot, opening up lots of possibilties, such as a huge memory card, storage place for FMV or some sort of expansion pack. This news also guarantees that the Nintendo DS will be able to use the unique features the GBA has, such as motion sensors.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, DS games probably won't use the GBA slot as a "massive memory card" because Nintendo's anti-piracy goons want to pull <a class="postlink" href="http://www.e2city.com/" target="_blank">the existing massive GBA format memory cards</a> out of circulation.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA does not have motion sensors. In fact, the only Game Boy game I know of that uses a motion sensor in the Game Pak is Kirby Tilt n Tumble for GBC, which doesn't work right on the SP (inverted controls) or the Game Boy Player (do <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> tilt a console with rotating parts).
<br/>
<br/>
More interesting question is is it the other way around? Can the GBA talk to the DS side such that GBA games can be "DS enhanced" or have "DS extras" in the same way that some Game Boy mono games had extras for Super Game Boy?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Nintendo has their idea of the DS being "the third pillar" so much that such things like DS-enhanced GBA games would pull way from their concept of the unit. There had been "enhancements" like the Super GameBoy, and even the more recent GBC Zeldas with a hint of GBA "enhancement", which would give people an idea with the DS, with it's 2x ARM7 CPU and other things. Heck, giving GBA games the DS treatment would certainly raise sales for the DS. However, Nintendo wants to keep these systems separate, therefore the whole "third pillar" idea, and most likely no DS-enhanced GBA games.
<br/>
<br/>
Why Nintendo added GBA support to a system that is meant to not be on the same lines of the GameBoy is beyond me. They might as well call it the "next gameboy", and add link cable support to it for complete compatibility. They should just make an external link adapter that attaches to the speaker jack on the side of the headphone jack, something like with the SP being able to have both the headphones and AC adapter attached at the same time in one port. I don't remember ever seeing the back end of the new DS design (or the underside), so could there be a chance?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They put in GBA functionality so that people who play their GBA won't have to carry around both their GBA and DS. It's also a way to tap into a already proven market. If someone who hasn't bought a GBA buys a DS, they are more likely to take a serious look at GBA games as they will soon become cheaper in price. It becomes a win-win situation for both systems.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, that is true, but that still doesn't explain Nintendo's whole idea of the DS being on a different line from a GBA, because now it is a 2-in-1 game system, excluding the GBA hardware link. Don't get me wrong, I actually like the GBA functionality on the DS. I just don't like Nintendo's whole "third pillar" idea. Not one bit.
<br/>
<br/>
As for tepples idea again, I guess it all depends on how much and what kind of an "enhancement" to a GBA game they want to make. If anything, I don't think they'd want the "enhancement" to interfere with how the GBA game is played directly on either system. I could see some DS-enhanced GBA game displaying better visuals on the DS than the GBA, though you play the game exactly the same way on both. Additional areas only available on the DS, I would think, may stress it a little, but it is just my opinion. We'll just have to see what Nintendo wants to do with it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If GBA programs would be able to access the DS cart it would probably be able to access most of the DS features, so why would I then want to flash something to the DS cart?
<br/>
Anyway, if Nintendo wants to be nice to us (the dev community) and sneaky to the pirates, they might let GBA programs access most if not all of the new features of the DS (faster ARM7, more memory etc.), it would mean that homebrew apps could make use of the DS without using a DS flashcart. And thus the only reason for a real DS flashcart would be to pirate games (which Nintendo probably will point out).

I think calling it a "third pillar" is a mistake. The DS is not going to be competing with the GBA in any way. 
<br/>
Big N has stated that the next incarnation of the Gameboy is in development. While this is certainly true, I think it will be several years before this project actually makes it to market. Since Nintendo can't just sit around and let the PSP outshine the GBA, they release the DS.
<br/>
So why not just call it the next GB and forget this "third pillar" nonsense? Because Nintendo prides itself on it's famed backwards compatibility. If N called the DS a successor to the GBA, it would never be able to ditch the two-screen touchpad format in any future GB consoles. Hence they call it a "third pillar" to avoid painting themselves into a corner.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers.
