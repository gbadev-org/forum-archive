Well, at least 1 of those 2 things wen through. I try to make regular and informative updates to the DSDev.org news page. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think Simon will make a new forum or at least new sections when there are actual concrete tutorials out about how to program for the DS. At the moment, all we have is how to setup our development environments. A few of us are experimenting with what the system can do, but it's better to take things slowly than to rush it.

<br/>
I think adding more DS sections is probably better than starting a whole new forum. Or?
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for initial additional DS sections? I dont think we should open many of them...but start slow and add more as the scene evolves.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guys, you need to realize, this community is way too small for too many more categories. If any more are added, they should probably be (at most):
<br/>
<br/>
News (in this section the people working on, for example, the firmware update would make their own thread and post updates into it, but others wouldn't post in it)
<br/>
General Development Discussion (this is where we would talk about the different things going on in the news, discuss ways around problems, figure out stuff, ask for help)
<br/>
Demos (duh.)
<br/>
<br/>
We definitely don't need an off topic section. 
<br/>
We don't want it to be too big. Also, I suggest sub-categories rather then whole new categories. (So then we have General Discussion have two sub categories, Demos, and News) That way we could easily see if there any new posts in those sub-categories</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, at this point I think the best splitup would just be 3 sections: passme/wifi/hardware, announcements (demos/lib updates/etc), and coding. 
<br/>
Possibly a seperate one for game design too, for idle chitchat about cool stuff to do with the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Then add specific sections on graphics/audio/anything else once the coding section gets too busy.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

The GBA game design forum is not especially active.  I think GBA and DS can share game design.  In general, where should questions relating to tools development (software- programming, design) be posted?

The terms "forum", "section", and "topic" might confuse. I'll attempt to clarify:
<br/>
<br/>
At the root level is a phpBB instance, in this case <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Each instance contains one or more Categories. As of today, the Categories on forum.gbadev.org are <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/index.php?c=5" target="_blank">News</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/index.php?c=4" target="_blank">Coding</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/index.php?c=6" target="_blank">Multimedia and Design</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/index.php?c=3" target="_blank">Hardware</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/index.php?c=2" target="_blank">Offtopic</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/index.php?c=7" target="_blank">Vocation</a>, and <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/index.php?c=8" target="_blank">Nintendo DS</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Each Category contains one or more Forums. The Forums in the Nintendo DS Category are <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=18" target="_blank">DS development</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=19" target="_blank">DS Flash Equipment</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Each Forum contains zero or more topics.
<br/>
<br/>
Each topic contains one or more posts.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">I don't think that most of us ever go out of this section, and if the DS Development doesn't have their own forums, they should at least be seperated from the GBA ones in that way.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Currently, they are set apart. Just bookmark the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/index.php?c=8" target="_blank">Nintendo DS</a> Category rather than the DS development Forum.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
