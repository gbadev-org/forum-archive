    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been a bit confused. I just recently installed the most recent version of the devKit on my laptop here, and I want to put file loading/saving support in an application I'm working on. It would seem, however, that libfat is not installed with the devKit. That, or I just can't find it.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me what I need to do to get libfat up and running quick? Basically, I just need the ability to read/write files in the normal binary mode, nothing too fancy, I can do the rest from there.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance. ^_^ Oh, and it's good to be back, I finally found some time to develop again.

<br/>

<br/>
I was being silly, and looking for "libfat.h" and not "fat.h". Problem solved, but thanks anyway!
