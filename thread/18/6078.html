    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had nothing better to do with my time... Quite sad, really.
<br/>
And I found two things of interest on the components list.
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, for the description of slot 2, it says precisely this: "Game Pak Slot- For Game Boy Advance Game Paks or Nintendo DS accessories." 
<br/>
This proves that Nintendo is, in fact, planning to use that slot for system expandability.
<br/>
<br/>
The port to which the battery charger plugs in is referred to as the "External Extension Connector." The description is as follows: "Allows connection of the NDS AC Adatpter for recharging the battery or operation of the DS using household power. The GBA Headphone Adapter can also be connected.
<br/>
Thus arises the question: What the heck does <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gameessentials.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=43" target="_blank">this</a> have to do with the AC adapter?! Thus: What else will that slot do?
<br/>
(PS: I am aware that that thing has existed since the SP, so my question is is probably answered).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
The AC adaptor CHarges the DS (as everyone knows) and they are just simple saying it can be run on household power (not worrying about battery)
<br/>
<br/>
Its funny how everyone (including me) have thought or are thinking that there are some many secrets to this system (ports, gadgets, gizmo's, whatever) but it is JUST a Power Port with sound, Thats all..... ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Although, if the power port can output data, I wonder how fast it could go? Perhaps enough to write to a compact flash card writer?
<br/>

Wait for the GBA Movie Player to be fully cracked, boot the DS with *Me, and then Pak-Swap to the GBA Movie Player so that you can read the CF card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
