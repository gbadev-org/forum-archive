<br/>
My thoughts:
<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the GBA, which executes the code in place, the code for the DS is copied to RAM.  This means that they can use fancy software compression and possibly additional encryption across the cartridge interface.  The keyword being software -- they can do this without increasing the bill of materials.  
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo is the sole title distributor.  This means that any complexity in getting the code into memory doesn't need to be understood by the software developer.  
<br/>
<br/>
Like the GBA, the DS is a single-chip design.  This makes understanding what is going on by probing the pins more difficult.  
<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts -- I hope I'm wrong...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
