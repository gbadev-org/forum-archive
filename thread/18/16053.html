    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I have coded a texture converted wich supports most of  DS formats. I know it is not the first one, but if you are looking for something like that maybe you will like it.
<br/>
<br/>
It has avery basic GUI and I have also released the source code in case you want to improve it (compressed format for example is not supported yet)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's some neat stuff you have going on there. I especially like the idea of a texture format, do you plan to release a DS loader for .zmp? As a side note, I had to drag the DevIL .dll files from the source .rar into the directory of the executable to run it, might want to take a look at that.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way: Megaman 9 is the coolest thing that happened to the megaman series since Megaman 2!! ;)<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ops, you are right. Thanks for telling me. I have moved the dlls now .If someone wants to compile the project I guess that he'll know what to do.
<br/>
<br/>
And, well, I wasn't planning to release a Loader. But if anyone is interested I'll do. Anyway, it is really easy. Even more than reading a BMP :P
<br/>
<br/>
And... best megaman ever is Megaman AND Bass :P (and for me that will me Megaman 9, forever)<br/>_________________<br/>-----
