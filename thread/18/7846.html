    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I told myself that when I hadsome code finished that could be of some interest I would release it (because I think a comunity like this needs to be as open as possible to advance faster). It has a lot of garbage but I am not going to clean it (if I begin with "when I had done..." then I'll never release it).  
<br/>
<br/>
I hope it helps someone and feel free to change whatever you want (I would apreciate if you could improve it and post it!).
<br/>
<br/>
Some things that you should know
<br/>
<br/>
-Md2 textures have to be rotated (the file). If someone fix this or knows  why I have to do this tell me!!
<br/>
-Camera movement with stylus is a bit... well it works at least. It needs improvement.
<br/>
-I could not use libnds glulookat. I have to change it. If it is a bug or not I don't know (the same camera works ok in opengl)
<br/>
-Normals are not loaded beacuse I still need to play a little with lights. Next time.
<br/>
<br/>

It seems it is because the S and T (U and V whatever) coordinates are the wrong way round, this held true with older versions with ndslib not sure about now, maybe i should test that... and you should feel proud of your handsome code</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know this has been posted ages ago, but now it's nearly impossible to find this example on the web. All of the files are dead links, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Does somebody still have this piece of code somewhere so that I could download it or he could send it to me by email ? 
<br/>
<br/>
I would really appreciate.
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah that's what I am doing now. Catching on on the last 3 years of Dev on the DS. Lots of disseminated information all around. Piecing the puzzle together, but now seems OK since I've found the major information sources.

<br/>
I apologize for bringing back this post from the dead.

<br/>
Thanks to those that replied.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't call a .md2 loader NDS development. That's genereal programming and not everybody uses .md2 (at least I don't, because it's too restrictive and too generic for the hardware.)
<br/>
And I find all the info I need for homebrew in <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">gbatek</a>. No puzzle (well, maybe except for some details I haven't come across, yet).
