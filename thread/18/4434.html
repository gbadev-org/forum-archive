The way it is, you run into the edge of the screen constantly and have to re-click to be able to run full speed again.

Metroid Prime is still only a demo. But you should submit that idea to NST so that they can implement it before the game ships (I read somewhere that it will be 5/08/05).<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
One thing I just thought up that could help with games like this would be to have an attachment that hooks onto the touch-screen, with the bottom-left area having a circular barrier, so that games like Mario64DS won't have the problem of having to re-adjust. With this, they'll never move out of the circle, preventing the movement circle on the touchscreen to be dragged around. This would also require another thumb attachment that is more precise, smaller, and at least as tall as the height of the touch-screen attachment.

Juts a thought.

Although I have gotten somewhat familiar with it's current use of the touch-screen, I have done a whole lot better with just the D-Pad/Y-Button setup. Sure, it isn't nearly as accurate, but most of the time you are just moving forward. It just seems easier, for me anyways.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I find the controls in M64 DS abismal... I have only used the touch pad for walking slowly past the sleeping plants, maybe that's my problem... but the D-pad for movement just sucks... if you didn't have to hold the run button down to run it would be light years better... you run FAR more than you walk slowly.
<br/>
<br/>
I find the whole thing terribly frustrating... An analog control on the DS would have helped leaps and bounds.

I'll try just using the touch screen for control and see if I like it better...  but it's not looking good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#29703 - DekuTree64 - Wed Nov 24, 2004 2:11 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually I agree with N's decision on using a digital control pad instead of an analog pad. The reason being that it's shaped very similar to the A/B/X/Y set, so you can use left/right handed controls in games (very important when you have a touch screen). Surely developers will learn to better use the touch pad for analog control in the future, it really could be every bit as user-friendly as a control stick if done right.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, making you hold Y to run is also very cruel because then you can't reach A to attack while running without stretching your pointer finger around to it.
<br/>
I've also found it much more difficult to do a side-flip jump (one of my favorite moves) than it was in the original version, with the touch controls and even moreso with the pad, because it tends to make you run in a circle rather than turn straight around (also irritating because that circle you run in often happens to go right over the edge of the platform you're standing on...)<br/>_________________<br/>___________

I think they should add a button that locks the circle in place.  so if you like touching on the lower corner you can do that or the top corner instead.

This IS NOT supposed to happen on a console game. It's frustrating and it worries me. Usually Nintendo's QA is solid. From a developer's perspective, it's probably some minor bug that future DS releases will recognize and avoid. From a player's perspective, it SUCKS. It's questionable whether I'll spend more of my time on a game that might freeze at any moment.

There was maybe one door related crash, all of the other ones were elevator lock-ups.  
<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you, it really made me super tense about playing that game.  It was always a case of, if you do anything that needs to be saved or would be a hassle to redo, find a save point (even if out of the way) before taking an elevator.  That's just bad stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as you suggest, I'm pretty sure it has to do with dynamic background loading of new areas.  Possibly a memory fragmentation issue due to a purely software bug.  
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, not everyone had the problem - I've heard some very skeptical people saying  us 'crashers' were exaggerating the problem because they never had a single crash.  So maybe there was a hardware or media related component to the crashing as well...

If you haven't already tried touch mode, i suggest you do, though i am completely happy with the standard mode.  Controlling with the dpad is perfect for me.  Doing side flips is sometimes hard, but it was the same with the n64.  I just did 15 perfect sideflips in a row with the dpad.
<br/>
<br/>
For attacking while running holding Y  use the the other part of your thumb.  see you hold Y and your thumb is centered over B, but you just rotate it slightly and its pressing A now...so you can actually press them all at the same time, or one after the other very easily.  Everygame has a slight control learning curve...and the number of moves these acrobats can do increases it.  Just give it some time.  I have no complaints on the controls.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS speakers do distort audio when used at lower volumes.  It does it to PocketNES and GBA games as well (I posted a comment in the official PocketNES forums when I first noticed it while playing The Legend of Zelda).  Evidently all DS systems do this, and it wasn't just mine or my imagination afterall.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the controls for Mario 64 DS, I have been making the argument since I got the DS that the touchscreen is an improvement over the old N64 joystick.
<br/>
<br/>
At this writing, I have 135 stars.  Therefore I have already navigated the most difficult parts of the game, including beating Bowser all three times.  From jumping across platforms on the Rainbow Ride, to speeding down the ice and Princess' slides, I've had better success with the touchscreen than I ever did with the joystick.
<br/>
<br/>
The virtual joystick is remarkably responsive and very natural, despite what anybody says.  I think the complaints against it can be explained by taking a few simple things into consideration:
<br/>
<br/>
All the reviews of Mario 64 DS were rushed in order to get them published as soon as possible, and I would safely bet that not a single reviewer had played the game for very long before jotting their comments down.  Therefore they never had the opportunity to adjust their mentality to a non joystick control scheme.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously any new method of control takes a bit of getting used to.  Mario 64 DS is going to be the very first game for most people using this new touchscreen method, and I don't think they're differentiating their difficulty in getting used to these new controls from the specific game.
<br/>
<br/>
Any gamer who is familiar with joystick controls is going to have a tendency to approach the virtual joystick as if it were one, when it's quite obviously not.  When you use a joystick you have to maintain pressure or it snaps back into center position.  Not so with the virtual joystick, where you can rest your thumb comfortably and maintain that velocity.  I believe this accounts for people who complain of constantly hitting the edges of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I did the same when I first picked it up, but by modifying my way of thinking and concentrating on the fact that when my character is moving at the desired velocity I don't have to continue moving my finger, I became used to it within the first few levels.  That made it much easier during the later levels, and now I can't imagine playing Mario 64 any other way.
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody who fails to become accustomed to the thumb stylus is going to miss out on the best controls for Mario 64, which is a problem that will only get worse as consecutive games are released to the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not just the speakers, it's the DS in general.  Even when using headphones, a low volume setting causes distortion.  I was worried that it might be only my unit, but thankfully (I guess?) it's not.  I've found that changing the game's sound setting to headphones (a feature that at least Nintendo tends to offer on their own games) will alleviate the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem I had was when the use of the reverb effect did not get turned off when it should have, resulting in the continued gameplay to have audio reverb when it shouldn't. I have yet to have that problem again to try out a simple solution of setting the DS into sleep mode and waking it up again to fix the problem (if it works).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
