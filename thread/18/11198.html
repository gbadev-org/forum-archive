    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there currently a way of creating a listening server on the ds.  I have created a game for the DS and I'd like to include multiplayer support but I would have to be able to start a server on one DS so that other people can connect to it and play together.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes it's possible. (In fact, DSFTP2.0 is a working example of it!)
