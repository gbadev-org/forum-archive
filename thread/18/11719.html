<br/>
<br/>
I've had this idea for a while, now I finally implemented it. This is a tool with which you can quickly change the boot application of your GBAMP. Holding B while booting brings up a menu in which you can select the application that is launched on boot. I find this useful for switching between wifi loaders and launchers/media players.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Good job so far!</span> It will make musical CF cards (or Wi-Fi booting) much more bearable. Now here's the constructive criticism:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>0xtob wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Holding B while booting</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Is there a reason that it was B? Normally the firmware uses B to skip booting the DS card when both a DS card and a GBA card are present.
<br/>
<br/>
+Control Pad does nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Double-tapping a name does nothing. A lot of licensed games, as well as DSOrganize, use tap to select (highlight), tap again to choose (use default action).
<br/>
<br/>
There are scrolling artifacts if any name at the bottom of a scrolling list has a descender (e.g. "dsftp.nds", "dsorganize gray.nds").
<br/>
<br/>
This part of the manual is confusing:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">It does not work on my M3/SuperCard/G6/DS-X/EZ4/Flashcart!
<br/>
<br/>
  Read the name of the program out loud :-)
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Isn't the M3 branded as a <a class="postlink" href="http://m3adapter.com/" target="_blank">GBA Movie Player v3</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be hard to write a message like the following to one screen while it boots?
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">loading moonshell.nds...

<br/>
<br/>
Have you used <span style="font-weight: bold">nm -n arm9.elf</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">nm -n arm7.elf</span> to investigate why the program takes 150 KB? I took a brief look at it in a hex editor, and I see a few zeroed out areas as well as symbol names of C++ exception handlers. In a tile editor, I saw the default libnds console font (which doesn't appear to be used).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't know, but when I first had the idea of this program I thought: "You must hold B to enter the menu. It cannot be anything else." But since B is already taken, I have completely re-thought the key idea of the program and changed the button to Y :-)

Yes, and there's terrible flickering when scrolling. You will have to live with this ugliness for now :-)

You're right. Made that clear.

I added a message. It's displayed for 30 VBlanks, so boot time is increased a little.

That's quite an interesting command, didn't know about it before. The file size is mostly due to my GUI toolkit, which is from my early days of DS coding, where I still thought using STL would be a good idea (which it is on platforms where size doesn't matter). I thought the debug symbols were stripped by devkitPro's linker scripts. Removing "-g" from the Makefiles did not have any effect on the file size. Anyway, I saved a few KB by removing all drivers except for the GBAMP one from gba_nds_fat.
