The flash linkers engage in a "secret handshake" with each flash cart to detect whether the cart is writable or whether it's an official GBA Game Pak. If the DS's GBA subsystem performs each well-known flash cart's secret handshake, it can detect whether you're using an official Game Pak or a flash cart, and it can exit back to DS-DOS if you're using a flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But wouldn't that only apply to the ones that have their own writer and not the ones like the EZF Advance that just use the GBA? Without the link port, I can see how you wouldn't be able to write to those in the DS, but as far as playing them (after writing one on a GBA), I don't see why they they would need a handshake.  If the software on the flash cart is being run, then it knows it's a writable flash cart - no need to check, hence no need for a handshake, hence no way for the DS to know.  Only thing I can think of is if the DS were to attempt to write to the cart and see if the write succeeds or fails, but I'd bet that could crash a lot of commercial GBA carts (and be a heck of a lot of work to get such an effect).
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, just thought of this: even though the DS doesn't have the link port, could the DS just detect that the cart is attempting to use a known handshake through the link port (as opposed to the regular cartridge port)? Or is that what you meant in the first place? The problem I see with that, though, is that there could be the possibility of false positives.  Although, maybe that's one of things that's meant by "compatble with *most* GBA games".
<br/>
<br/>
I think wombatman has a point, too. Any of these things would take a lot of effort to implement.  I can see the reasons for a company considering them to be worth it, but I think Nintendo is by far the *least* likely of all the console manufacturers to bother with this sort of thing. First, we all know how little emphasis they tend to place on regional lockouts: oftentimes just a plastic tab, or sometimes no lockout at all as in the case of the GBA (and likely the DS as well, judging by the presence of Japanese Hiragana and Katakana in the North American PicoChat). Second, the extra work the DS would have to do would take up extra silicon in the chips, and we all know how big Nintendo is (particularly compared to Sony and MS) on minimizing hardware costs.

Actually, last time I checked, the F2A and EZFA linkers multibooted with Select+Start, so that even if you write a single ROM to the whole cart (as one would do in PogoShell), the writing software is in EWRAM. The only cart with the writing software stored on the cart is EFA, which has a USB port at the top that becomes active when the cart is removed from the system. However, there's another handshake that the DS could intercept: the handshake to change the program bank when launching one of multiple proprietary programs stored on one cart.

Is that the case? Only flash carts have the possibility of crashing on random writes to the data area.

That has been a widely known method now for GBA, and not a single GBA game uses this technique. Ofcourse, software hackers might circumvent this, and neutralise the protection. However, I see no reason why DS would use this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All modern consoles "suffer" from piracy, except the GameCube (ok, there is some GC piracy, but it is highly inconvenient and far from widespread). I would say Nintendo protect their console fairly well compared to Sony and MS.
