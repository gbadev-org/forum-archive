    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i made a darkstar thing with multiple .nds files, including homebrew 2 player tetris, nibbles, etc. and all of those worked.  I also added the demos from E3,  which i couldn't get to boot.  I know it's possible because i have played them off my flashcart for a while, using darkstar with the multirom from this site <a href="http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/," target="_blank">http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/,</a> any help with this would be appreciated..
