    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have there been any updates to playing sounds on the DS?  Is it possible to play sounds without using with GBFS?
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I have this 22.055kHz Raw sound file (8 Megs...is that too big?) and I'd like to get it to start playing and just constantly loop.  Forgive the noobish posting, I'm just so exhausted.
<br/>
<br/>
I looked over DoubleC's Sound Tutorials including the GBFS section, but it seems like so much just to get sounds to play....I also looked through the devkitpro sound example, but I appear to be missing the tool to get a header that references the raw sound files.
<br/>
<br/>
so tired...but it will all be worth it...very soon...thank you very much guys<br/>_________________<br/>Codax

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In order to play a sound that's larger than RAM, you'll have to stream it from the CF card (if you're using a GBAMP) or use an appended data structure such as GBFS (if you're using a traditional GBA card). SuperCard and M3 can use both methods.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, so if I get it [the sound file] much smaller (about 1 Meg should leave plenty of room for the program) how do I get a header from the raw waveform?  The comments in the devkitPro example said something about bin2o, but I'm not sure where to get it or how to use it.<br/>_________________<br/>Codax

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">can't seem to generate a .raw.o file properly, the code works fine with other peoples sound samples i.e. the demo sounds but not with mine... What exactly do i need to do to create this elusive file?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
