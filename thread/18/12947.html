I get that error the first time I try to connect as well.  I think it is a time out problem while it's starting up the WiFi hardware in the DS.  Once the WiFi is started, if you try to connect it should prompt you for a password.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's likely that they read an undocumented block of data from an undocumented part of the DS firmware and write it to an undocumented register on the Wi-Fi chipset, where the firmware version is paired with a particular version of the Wi-Fi chipset.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does that even make sense?
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, how can Nintendo even know what hardware they might use in 3 years to produce NDSs at that time.  And, how can a game produced today (like MarioKart I own today) be able to handle that hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
Most likely, the "new" hardware is fully compatible with the "old" hardware, and if it does stop working with homebrew, it would be because we aren't initializing it correctly and the "new" hardware is just more sensitive to the proper initialization.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That, or the proper initialization depends on values found in a part of firmware that homebrewers know little about.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given how unstable just about every wifi app is even on my V1 DS Phat, I'd say there's something wrong with initialization. Even moreso since when it doesn't work, doing a connection test in an NWFC game tends to get it working.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
