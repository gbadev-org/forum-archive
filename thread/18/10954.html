    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone would like to work together on a little alpha demo. Something original or perhaps an existing character but a new game for that character. I am an artist myself and I know nothing about programing.
<br/>
<br/>
 I was thinking of a game which is 2d with 3d elements thrown in. If you are interested that would be awesome. Ive seen alot of programming demos and ports of existing games but not much in the way of playable new games. 
<br/>
<br/>
Ive just finished shool for game art and as im looking for work I figured this would be a good way to keep in practice and hone my skills. Ive also worked in a production pipeline modding for the hl2 engine so I have experience working on games.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see my demo reel its all hi poly models but I can do low poly as well you can go to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.trenttrombley.com" target="_blank">www.trenttrombley.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
and you can go to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.blackoutmod.com" target="_blank">www.blackoutmod.com</a> to see the work I did on the mod. All of the vehicles and a few of the static meshes were modelled by me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">:D you certainly can model well, right down to their genitals! it would be good to see programmers paired off with artist/designers on here actually. i'm an artist/animator myself too.
<br/>
might be fun?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PSA: For all people, like me, who after reading daninsky's post thought of 3D virtual porn... DON'T. It's not that :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I didn't see any low-poly models, I'd love to see those in about 100 faces :D<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You don't need that much detail, if you do it will just unnecesarily fill up the space and make it slow.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Those models are for movie production detail they wouldn't be for game production unless they were used for normal mapping. For my demo reel I like to show that I can do alot of detail. I will be making a low poly demo reel in the future as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just wanted to apologize incase my post came off too abrasive. Sometimes people may think that I am looking for a programmer to do a game that I am working on with no feedback or input from the other members of the team. If people are interested we will all decide what type of game we want to work on. I know alot of the programmers on this forum have personal projects they are already working on. So I understand if you are busy at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
