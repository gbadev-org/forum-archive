    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i don't think i can help you much, because i'm not that familiar with yeti3d (used to play around with it the other day. that's quite long ago...). maybe you'd have to check if the original sources (i assume it's dovotos nds version) compile ok with the new libraries. then there might be some bug in a header or some other source file that's included into the main.c. sometimes the compiler &amp; co. report, well let's call it "error chains", that is the error back to front. shitty explanation, i know. i don't know how experienced you are, so i have to guess.
<br/>
<br/>
it would help if you posted some error output here or the relevant part of the sources, so others familiar with yeti3d could help you better.
<br/>
<br/>
hope you'll be able to fix it.
