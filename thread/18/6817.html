i was tryng to use those 3 functions, which are included in ndslib, but as far as i can see, they are not present on libnds (i've never understood the difference...)

is there a way to implement them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

libnds &amp; ndslib have always been largely identical. libnds was originally created when ndslib was going to be moving to devkitpro CVS and is just a cleaned up version which has been tested on all 3 supported host platforms. All development work has now moved to the devkitPro CVS and ndslib should be considered obsolete.
<br/>
<br/>
The main difference in terms of user code is that &lt;nds.h&gt; should be used rather than &lt;nds/nds.h&gt; and all headers are lower case. Windows is not case sensitive but it should be noted that linux and OS X are.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I strongly recommend you to use a better value than 360.
<br/>
Use 256 or 512 entries instead so you simply can get around without having to use %
<br/>
<br/>
I aint sure about the ndslib but probably its 1:12 fixed or 1:8 reaching from 4096 to -4096 or 256 to -256.
<br/>
<br/>
And here is what entry 0,128,256.. is in degrees
<br/>
<br/>
0 = 0 degrees 
<br/>
128 = 90 degrees
<br/>
256 = 180 degrees
<br/>
384 = 270 degrees
<br/>
512 = 360 degrees
<br/>

hope you got it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The libnds tables are 512 entries wide each to complete a full circle.  This means that each unit is 2*pi/512 radians, or 360/512 degrees.  They are in 4.12 format, suitable for the v16 format (I think), because it is used throughout the 3D code much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#81369 - Chris Holmes - Fri Apr 28, 2006 7:54 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so libnds includes three lookup tables, sin, cos, and tan.
<br/>
<br/>
It would have been immensely helpful if there had been either functions or #defined functions for sin, cos, and tan.  The trig_lut header is just 
<br/>
<br/>
And while I'm on it, there is no point in having a sin and a cosine table.  You only need one table and can refence it for both.  A nice sin function built for 360 degrees looks like:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">inline v16 sin( int degrees ) { 
<br/>
  return( SIN_TABLE[ (degrees%360) &gt;= 0 ? (degrees%360) : (degrees%360 + 360 ) ] );
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
if you want to use radians instead:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">#define DEG2RAD floattof32(360.0f / 3.14159f)
<br/>
<br/>
inline v16 sin( f32 radians ) {
<br/>
  return( sin( f32toint(radians * DEG2RAD)));
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sin and Cosine are generally accepted to be slow functions anyway, so making them take a slight performance hit should not be a big deal.
<br/>
<br/>
Cosine is of course built off the sin table.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">inline cos( int degrees ) { return sin( 90 - degrees ); }
<br/>
<br/>
#define PI_OVER_2 floattof32( 3.14159f / 2.0f )
<br/>
inline cos( f32 radians ) { return sin( PI_OVER_2 - radians ); }</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The tangent table should be redefined to cover the range from -pi/2 to pi/2 as it is periodic at that point as well.  The table should be defined this way so the range of the table is -infinity to infinity.  Most importantly, this puts the elements in sorted order for a binary search.  The current implementation, from what I can see, covers the range from 0 to 360 degrees.
<br/>
<br/>
Given this new tangent lookup table, implementing atan (tangent inverse) becomes as simple as identifying the quadrant, dividing y/x, and running a binary search over the elements of the tangent lookup table.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll finish cleaning my implementation up and submit it to libnds.

Which is why there is a look up table for them. Everything above is fine, but don't use 360 degrees, leave it at 512. Use a macro if you want 360 instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm..  well, I thought that doing 512 entries would mangle all the "common" angles like 45, 90, 180, but in reality, that ends up working out pretty alright.
<br/>
<br/>
So, converting from angles to the 512 entry is as easy as 
<br/>
  ( degrees * 512 / 360 ) which factors down to (degrees * 64 / 45 )
<br/>
<br/>
  or
<br/>
<br/>
#define DEG2INDEX(n) (((n)&lt;&lt;6)/45)
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that division.  But if you really care about those angles in between 360,  that's fine.

<br/>
My libraries take up less space, provide f32's for tangent values instead of v16's (v16's can't cover the range of tangent nearly well enough), and I provide the ability to use the functions in direct mode (lookup directly from the table, degrees mode, and radians mode.  I also provide the inverse sin,cos, and tan functions.

<br/>
There are three testing screens (press A to skip to the next one).

The first one compares the current look up tables in libnds to my computed values.  libnds ones are displayed 4 pixels higher and in a darker color.  The second screen tests my functions in degree mode from -360 to 720 degrees.  The third screen tests my inverse functions by computing the values over the inverse allowed range (-90 to 90, or 0 to 180) and then using the inverse functions to drive the functions again to make sure they return the same values.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm replacing the math library.  Further, I'm replacing the math library in such a way that it's guaranteed to break the examples.  Because the original code provided no clean interface to the sin/cos/tan tables, providing a clean interface to my solution (removing the sin table) cannot be provided.  
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I can't provide you with a clean patch for CVS that has no side effects.  Therefore, I provided my working code complete with a test suite (how much code gets submitted with a test suite to validate it, really?).  Integrating my changes can potentially break existing code.  That's a Big Change and it's not as simple a thing as a CVS patch.  Someone has to decide whether or not to include it at all, whether to include it on top of the existing infastructure, or whether to replace the existing infastructure.  
<br/>
<br/>
I knew full well that the code would have to be modified at least slightly before inclusion to begin with.  I don't care if it gets included or not.  I found a feature missing that I wanted that other people could potentially be interested in, so I published the whole thing in the forums where anyone who wanted it could have it.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of being rude to me and flaming me for trying to contribute something, why don't you (wintermute) and anyone else reading this on the devkitpro team decide if you want my contribution and if so, tell me what you would like me to do to make it easier for you to integrate it.
<br/>
And if you don't want it, why not just say, "Thanks, but we don't want/need it."  If you really don't want it, that's all you have to say.  And anyone who does want it now has access to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Really, I had no idea the community was so damned mean spirited.  Is it really so hard to be nice to people?  I think it's a pretty easy thing.  For example, I think that the work done on devkitpro is absolutely amazing and I thank everyone involved for their time, effort, and creativity.  You people all did a great job!

Can you implement an API compatible with the old solution as a wrapper around your new solution so that the examples still build?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Not really rocket science, eh. :) 
<br/>
<br/>
Trigonometry has never been any kind of bottleneck for me when developing for the DS, but just a quick points for both sides of the conversation: If Chris' proposed lookups provide better accurancy than the current one, also in smaller size (well, sin and cosine tables are basicly the one and same thing - can't see why you'd need to duplicate those tables anyways), updating the dev. environment sounds reasonable if done in a way not breaking the current trigonometric implementation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes you can, the examples are all in CVS too.
<br/>
<br/>
You also mailed this code asking how you get write access to the repository.
<br/>
<br/>
The response you got was a test. You failed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are several criteria we use for write access.
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li> Can you modify your coding style to fit in with the project?
<br/>
</li><li> Are you capable of finding cases where your code breaks the existing examples?
<br/>
</li><li> Will you fix those cases which break or modify your contribution so that those cases don't break?
<br/>
</li><li> Will you take it personally if someone reports problems with your contribution in a terse manner?
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
In short, what I'm looking for is people whose contributions do not need vetted, critiqued in detail or create more work for other team members.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

The problem is actually that the examples do it like this:
<br/>
<br/>
SinTable[ value ]
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not entirely sure that #define allows [ in it, and that's the problem.  I could easily change the Cos table to point to the new one, but the Sin table requires a modification exactly like you posted.  But because the original directly accesses it like an array, I'm pretty sure that
<br/>
<br/>
#define SIN[n] SinTable[n]  
<br/>
<br/>
is very much not valid.  Hence the problem.  If the original had used some accessor function like Sin(), then it would be easy to drop in a replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm...

Seriously dude, calm down.  I asked for write access because if you said that yes, you wanted it, I was going to download the full source, integrate my changes, and then submit them to the project through CVS.  It sounds like there's a way to generate a patch file through CVS instead of just checking files in.  I'm sorry that I'm not a CVS expert.  I don't like CVS at all and do all my work in subversion or another repository solution.
<br/>
<br/>
My point, as I explained and explained even more directly to melw is that my strategy would break existing code of other people who are using devkitpro.
<br/>
<br/>
And for the record, you weren't being terse, you were being mean.  You told me privately that you felt like I was being impatient, so you went out of your way to make this a public fight and be mean to me.  Seriously, I hoped people outgrew that when they finished college.  Apparently, I was wrong.  You said my code was completely unsuitable.  Completely.  You were wrong.  5 minutes of work would make it completely suitable.  
<br/>
<br/>
You are simply being a dick.  
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I'm good.  I made a contribution and was treated very poorly for doing so.  Think of my contribution as a test of your leadership ability.  You failed at being a leader.  So I'll leave and find people who can work with others.

Almost, except you don't have 512 degrees; you have 512 half brads. In FutureBASIC (for Mac) and BASIC Stamp, the built-in trig functions use a unit called the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22256+brads%22+circle" target="_blank">brad, defined as 1/256 circle</a>. The Allegro library (SDL's main competition) also uses brads.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

On the other hand you appear to be reading a lot more into my words than is actually present.

I'm not trying to pick a fight here, merely replying to public responses in public. I had hoped for some mature discourse after asking how a C application would link to your code, I didn't get it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
