    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody !
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to make some 3D on the DS, and what I'v understood,
<br/>
displaylists is the way to go.
<br/>
<br/>
So I'v spent some time googling and searching and well, the thing
<br/>
that's I'm missing is more something like, how do you actually
<br/>
create the list and with what ?
<br/>
<br/>
In the opengl part I bet it's quite straight forward (push Matrices and
<br/>
dump the list somewhere right ?) but I don't have a clue on how the
<br/>
displaylist itself could be created (how do I do a MATRIX_RESTORE
<br/>
and how to store vertexes etc. what kind of format is this in anyway ?)...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if any nice soul out there has any informations (or a link :-) I'd
<br/>
greatly appreciate !
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time

#define GFX_FIFO              (*(vuint32*) 0x04000400)  
<br/>
<br/>
use (def in video.h) GFX_FIFO=a_command
<br/>
repeatedly is the way to do it ?
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I dont really get what kind of commands
<br/>
(or how to use them) there are...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I understand a display list is basically a list of u32's, each u32 is part of a command, and the basic format is:
<br/>
<br/>
u32 - Command options (start, vertex, colour info etc, 1 byte per command)
<br/>
u32 for command 1
<br/>
u32 for command 2
<br/>
u32 for command 3
<br/>
u32 for command 4
<br/>
u32 commands options
<br/>
u32 for command 1
<br/>
u32 for command 2
<br/>
u32 for command 3
<br/>
u32 for command 4
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
repeated (well that's what it looks like in the teapot example).  I am currently still slowly working though the teapot data file, and looking at the FIFO registers, but at this moment in time I think I could create an obj - display list converter, that used only very basic parts of the display list format.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes SteveH, that's almost true. But beware, some commands use 2 u32's, and some use none. The vertex coordinate command, for example, uses 2 afaik, and the NOP command uses none.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&gt;each u32 is part of a command
<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it the other way around, a command is a part of a u32 ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I have understood looking at the example is that
<br/>
there are two sorts of data ;
<br/>
one that tells what kind of data is coming (the next 4)
<br/>
and the data itself which is variable sized.
<br/>
<br/>
[EDIT] uh, or exactly what Sausage Boy said :p[/EDIT]
<br/>
<br/>
in the example :
<br/>
<br/>
GL_TRIANGLE (to tell we want to draw tris) is a byte and goes with FIFO_BEGIN
<br/>
RGB15() is, well, 16bits so 2 bytes and goes with FIFO_COLOR
<br/>
VERTEX_PACK two times is 4 bytes and goes with FIFO_VERTEX16
<br/>
etc...
<br/>
<br/>
so basically it should be quite easy to create those lists (except that
<br/>
they dont run ok in Dualis :p) and after gl-setup, just set a texture, the
<br/>
right matrix and write the list to draw textured meshes, right ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, if thats roughly how it's works, then I'v got another question :)
<br/>
I'v read that you can push/pop matrices (read/store command ?) in
<br/>
a displaylist, this could be nice for skeletal animation where you
<br/>
need to calculate the matrices at runtime (and pre-push them
<br/>
onto the matrix stack before flushing the displaylist).
<br/>
<br/>
I'v read somewhere that the DS doesn't use indexed vertexlists,
<br/>
so how can you set different matrices to for example the 3 vertexes
<br/>
in a triangle (without a whole load of matrix stack operations) ?
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you can't (as far as I have understood) set a matrix, flush
<br/>
a bunch of vertexes, set another matrix, flush more vertexes, then flush
<br/>
triangles using any of these vertexes...
<br/>
<br/>
Or can you ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It doesn't store the vertices, you have to submit them as part of a triangle (or quad). Other than that your description is basically right.
