<br/>
The latest verion of dualis has been working quite well for me with the exception of infuriating periodic temporary stalls in execution.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried a LOT of things including graphic card driver updates, stripping out all sorts of extraneous services, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I came across a web page that discussed similar issues in older PC games.  Turns out that hyperthreading was the culprit.
<br/>
<br/>
Since I see benefits in performance when I use hyperthreading in my graphics work, I didn't want to disable it entirely, so I ended up running a utility called <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">imagecfg</span></span> on the dualis executable, and after that, no more stalls.

<br/>
<br/>
after you install imagecfg.exe to the windows\system32 folder, the system command to change the dualis .exe would look something like:
<br/>
<br/>
imagecfg -a 0x1 c:\path\to\dualis.exe<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
