    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well right now the exchange rate would make it 189.99, up $10 since when I checked as soon as the US price was announced. I think it might be 189.99 since stores can sell it at that price according to the exchange rate.  Could be  like you said 199.99 just to make it a simple number and get the little bit of extra money.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Generally, prices in the US and Canada are simmilar when compared to the exchange rate. But since the exchange puts it close to the $199 mark, Nintendo may decide to "bump it up" to a nice "round" number. The Canadian loon is quite strong right now,  it's currently at 79.4 cents US ? is expected to rise to 80 cents US by the end of this year.
<br/>
Selling the DS for $189 makes sense given Canada's positive economic future. Although if the MSRP <span style="font-style: italic">has</span> been announced, then this whole topic is moot. I'd like to see that article, Gramps, because if it's true then it may be cheaper to hop across the border to the US and pick one up there. :(<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers.

Especially if you consider sales tax. (Although, I'd be more than happy to pay gigantic salex taxes if that meant not having to bother with this dang income tax every year. yuck! Sales tax is sooo much easier :) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Same thing in sweden.
<br/>
But we have 25% sales tax on most stuff (like electronics). Lower sales tax on stuff like food and books, and even higher tax om stuff that's bad for you and everyone else (alcohol for example).
<br/>
Our currency is also going strong. (As are all currencies when compared to the USD... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#27300 - Mr. Ploppy - Fri Oct 08, 2004 8:56 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">25% sales tax seems kind of high. The way it works in Canada is there is a 7% <span style="font-style: italic">Government Sales Tax</span>, or GST, put on every item everywhere in the country, except for basic living requirements like food. The revenue from that tax goes to the federal government. 
<br/>
The rest of the tax is <span style="font-style: italic">Provincial Sales Tax</span>, or PST, that goes to the provincial government. PST rates vary by province, here in BC the PST is 7.5%, the rate in most provinces is usually between 6-8%, although in Alberta there is no PST. 
<br/>
Of course, some items such as gasoline, alcohol, and tobacco, are taxed at much higher rates, although this cost is hidden from the consumer, and the goods are sold at a higher price.
<br/>
Also, don't get the impression that there is no income tax. The government generally tries to claw back about half a person's income through various taxes and "contributions".
<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, even after that big rant, there's no place I'd rather live than Canada. :)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers. Cluck, cluck, gibber, gibber, "my old man's a mushroom", et cetera.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Swedish income tax is about 30% (varying somewhat depending on where you live).
<br/>
Sales tax is allways "hidden" in sweden.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind high taxes. There are lots of advantages in a system with high taxes. (like free education and health care for everyone, smaller class differences, and few poor people).
<br/>
What I pay in tax people living in countries with low taxes have to pay for insurances.
<br/>
In the end there is no difference. It's only about how fairly you distribute wealth between people.

Hmm, this thread is going kind of off topic.. But the real topic of this thread is already dealt with anway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
In Washington State, USA.
<br/>
<br/>
No State Income Tax (woo!)
<br/>
Sales tax on normal items of 8.+% (bleh - double tax) Assume you spend 50% of your income on items that have this tax for 4%.
<br/>
Gas Tax Above that
<br/>
Property Tax of roughly 1% of property value.  Assume your house is worth 5x what you make in a year so it becomes a 5% tax (but not double taxed).
<br/>
Income Tax of anywhere from 2% to 35% depending on how willing you are to pay a CPA for tax prep (and hwo many kids/companies you have/own)
<br/>
Social Security of 13% of which 6.5% is paid by emploer (this is a double tax - and you pay all this if self employed)
<br/>
Labor and Industry tax of 1.9% - double tax
<br/>
<br/>
Gross then:
<br/>
4% Sales/Gas
<br/>
5% property (this can go to 0 with a good renter)
<br/>
13% - SS Tax (this can go to 0 with a company)
<br/>
1.9% - L&amp;I (this can go to 0 with a company)
<br/>
2%-35% - Fed. Income Tax (this can go to 0 with a company)
<br/>
----------
<br/>
26% - 59% of income is gone
<br/>
<br/>
And this is with a big tax cut by Bush.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, by double tax I mean that that particular item is subject to both Fed. Income tax and that catagories tax.  
<br/>
<br/>
Add in Insurance premiums of 10-20% of income (depending on coverage types like home, auto, life, medical, volcano) and it's a wonder we're able to buy/save anything in our "free" economy unless you own a company.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
