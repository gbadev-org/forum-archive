    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys.
<br/>
<br/>
I finally got sprites loaded on the DS in framebuffer mode (some of u may remember my other threads!!)
<br/>
I had to create my own image format which basically stored the image data in a file in the pixel format for the DS. I've written a converter and a viewer for the PC too, which i'll upload soon as i get time.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back on topic... I now want to animate sprites, and was wondering which is the best way to go about this. How about having a front buffer and backbuffer, in memory, and then alternate copying them into VRAM_A?
<br/>
<br/>

And you probably could have avoided writing your own converter, there are quite a few already ^^<br/>_________________<br/>PAlib official forum : <a class="postlink" href="http://www.palib.info" target="_blank">http://www.palib.info</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It will work, it's just slow, and more work than is necessary optimizing the drawing routines (not always a bad thing for learning purposes).

<br/>
If you really want to do software sprites, you'd probably be best double buffering between VRAM A and B, to avoid the time consuming copy from a main RAM buffer.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
