    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been trying to flash my daughter's NDS with flasme.
<br/>
But having trouble converting the flashme.nds file to flashme.nds.gba so I can load it to our flash advance cartridge.
<br/>
DS is version 1 and we are using passme card.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to install flashme because I fear that the passme card will get damage easily.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried using NDS Patcher v.1 using the drag and drop method with no luck. I even double clicked the application and can't get it to run.
<br/>
<br/>
I also ran Loadme to convert the flashme.nds file and it just gave me an error message after I click apply.
<br/>
<br/>
Please help me with the conversion or maybe someone can show me where to get the flashme.nds.gba file so I can just load it to our flash advance cartridge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I went to the official site &gt; <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
But I can't find the file containing <span style="font-weight: bold">flashme.nds.gba</span>??
<br/>
or are talking about the necessary files and program to convert the .nds to .gba? I believe I already have everything I need to convert but I am just having a lot of problem accomplishing it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What do you mean by NDS mode?
<br/>
<br/>
I use Littlewriter <span style="font-weight: bold">Warez URL removed by MOD</span> or Flash Advance writer <span style="font-weight: bold">Warez URL removed by MOD</span> and from what I understand the file has to be in .gba mode for it to run and work .

My flash advance cartridge in an old 128mb one that plugs in via printer port.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

and I have to use Little writer or Flash Advance. But both programs will only detect .gba files. I don't think it will let me put .nds files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, if you don't have that or want to do it the only slightly more difficult way, go get ndsmall.bin from here (http://darkfader.net/ds/) and open a Command prompt.

I also want to say that I have a Flash Advance, and it will work perfectly fine for DS homebrew.  I'm can't remember if Littlewriter lets you write the NDS file straight to the card, but make sure you turn off it's plug-in that fixes the GBA header (the NDS has no GBA header and so this would courrupt the file).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
