    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
 Some of you may know that I've been writing a filesystem in my free time. Well, I've got it to a point where I'm happy to release it, so here is!
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.geocities.com/codefiend.geo/DSFilesystemR1.zip" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/codefiend.geo/DSFilesystemR1.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Included is the source for the filesystem generation tool, and a simple demo program that uses it.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that it doesn't run on any emulator that I've tried, only on real hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Its pretty easy to use, since I've modelled the interface on the stdio one.
<br/>
<br/>
All data is loaded straight from the GBA cart, so no longer does your program's data have to be linked into the binary and copied into RAM on startup!
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry but can you tell me what a filesystem is? Because i still dont have a passme!!

Is this a file browser for nds?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#40227 - FeaRog - Sat Apr 16, 2005 12:15 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The NDS has no native fileIO, so up until now everyone has been linking their data directly into the executable. This results in a maximum code+data size for any demo of 4MB, makes the load times horrendous, and means that a full recompile needs to be done every time you change your data. It also means that the programmers need to manage a bunch of magic variable names all through the code, and means that artists need to have a full development environment to test any art they're working on.
<br/>
<br/>
The filesystem is a binary file that has basically a "directory" at the start, and all the file data at the end. It is not part of the executable, it is appended to the executable just prior to putting it on your flash cart. Due to this, it doesn't need to be copied into RAM on startup, speeding up loading times heaps. Then, from code, you can open and close the "files" in the filesystem and read from them, just like you would on a PC. It makes integrating art and audio assets into your demos MUCH easier and neater, and means that artists won't need a full development environment to work on their contributions to projects.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, theres the provision for version information in the format, and the code is all GPL'd, so we could develop this further in the future.. I'm keen on the idea of getting it included with NDSLib, as I think everyone would be keen to have this functionality..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ndstool allready supports inclusion of files as well as the FAT generation (you just give it a directory and it does the rest).  No code has been included in ndslib as of yet to access this file system but it will soon.  There are also plans to integrate it into devkitarm so fopen and its kin work like expected (ie fopen("nds:\data\blah")).<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i'm curious about this, because i want some sort of read+write access in dsPaint (as well as other applications im developing), this way they can do more then what is available within a single session.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples - it allows you to do your file loading seamlessly from the arm9 side. These are blocking loads, but could easily be made asynchronous.
<br/>
<br/>
dovoto - since I hadn't heard of this "ndstool" until now, thats not terribly helpful now is it. Whats the point of having features unless people know about them? Also - a binary scan of every file on my hard drive shows no trace of the string "ndstool". And if its part of the NDS file format, thats hardly built in. I have *working* code right here (and in that zip file I've posted also), right now, that works just like fopen and its kin. No plans. Working (theres bound to be a few bugs that need fixing though). To dismiss this with just a "although interesting" seems a little silly to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Darkain - there is no support for writing in my library as of yet - you write it once (when you flash your cart) and read from it when you like. If you can write to the cart from arm7 code then writing could be added - its not something I've played with though. Another possibility is to add writing to the save game memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Note that with the exception of the actual locating of the file in the system (the easy part), the code in my library is pretty generic. You could easily modify it to support any different underlying file table type. The bulk of the code relates to the actual loading of data, communication between arm9 and arm7, and the fopen-style interface.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

surely the arm7 can write to the gba cart as it needs to for save games, but i think this is limited to the sram part or something.

including the read/write code along w/ the "boot sector" of the file system would actually be a nice idea.

that wont work well tho, because of the fact it is 128kb or 256kb sector size.  everything must be writen in increments of this size.

flash carts just wont work well for a linux swap partition.  in fact, the only way it could is if you implement a software based virtual memory controller, which would be painfully slow.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

And soon, there will be FAT support.

Anyway, I really think the NDS loader should support filehandling real soon or else highscores will overwrite SRAM on GBA cartridge and whatever.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

hey, i only want to do one because i want both read/write support from within the GBA/DS.  all of the filesystems out there right now seem to be designd around "write once / read many", which doesnt work at all for what i want to do.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The next release is coming along nicely... I've figured out how to read from the GBA cart from ARM9 code so it has been mostly rewritten - the portion that used to run on the ARM7 is gone, and its a bucketload faster :) Theres still a small bit of code in the bootloader, but not as big as before. There are also some bug fixes, and the filesystem creater now aligns the files to 4 byte boundaries, allowing for DMA if the receiving buffer is also 4 byte aligned. I've changed it from C++ to C. I may also change it to a BSD license....
<br/>
<br/>
Future plans (ie, for after R2):
<br/>
- Support the file system generated by NDSTool - this will be accessible using DOS style pathname "c:\" (or possibly "nds:\") and mine will be accessible using POSIX style "/" pathnames
<br/>
- Bringing the ARM7 code back and using it as a fully asynchronous file streaming system
<br/>
- Allowing reads &amp; writes to the save game memory using "/save/"
<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know what would be awesome, was if you made handwriting recognition software for it like the apple newton.  Then maybe we could write save and it would save or type hom and it would go to the top directory.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">jstart - Another cool thing would be for somebody to release a really simple touch keyboard, that would take up half of the bottom screen.  If it was open source, anyone could use it in any sort of program without having to make one themselves every single time.
<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to re-invent the wheel every time you program.  It's useful to use the tools others have already created, with the right creditation. (NDSlib anyone?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It will be cool to see an FAT filesystem on the NDS, and maybe even an OS way before nintendo even  bothers with one :p
<br/>
Maybe it would get Nintendo to make their own and stuff, kinda like the afterburner light kit convinced nintendo to add the same kinda light to their GBA SP.
<br/>
<br/>
But I guess Im getting alittle ahead of myself,
<br/>
still though, this is freakin sweat XD
<br/>
<br/>
and if there is a preprogramed screen keyboard  in NDSlib, I hope it'll be preprogramable, though I guess that goes without saying, but a premade tool is nice, but sometimes it needs a flashlight or something ductaped to it :p
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, this filesystem, wouldnt it have to be specificly patched for certain GBA flash carts? If it goes off the "write once/read many" type of system that is. Since most carts simply wont work that way, unless you know how to get the system to write to the card itself somehow, but thats still not very workable. Though the newer EZ-Flash 3 has a filesystem thing, maybe that could be used with the NDS :p
<br/>
Or maybe a new format of GBA flash carts might be helpfull.
<br/>
It'll be great to see how this turns out.
<br/>
Cool stuff :3</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Um no, I meant the AFterburnet Kit for the GBA that was completly unofficial and made by the Afterburner group who now do music it seems O_o
<br/>
Didnt know they made a Gameboy light though XD
<br/>
Acording to afterburner they said they accomplished stuff by getting nintendo to do it too. Maybe it wasnt the Afterburner that got nintendo to use the light, but the afterburner is still kick ass homebrew stuff :p er, mod, not code, but still XD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hack the Supercard to take the thicker CF type 2 cards, and you can use a Hitachi Microdrive.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
