    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using Keilid (or whatever) to convert a bmp to a gfx.bin and a 256 colour pal.bin.  How do I access the colours from the bin? It does not seem quite as easy as getting pal[0] to pal[256] - are they stored 0 to 128 but in two halves? Any help gratefully accepted.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
