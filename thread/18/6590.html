i changed over from NDS Dev Env to devkitPro just the other day, and since then pme2nds hasn't worked properly. i've tried deleting the re-extracting it with no luck still
<br/>
about the only symptom i can give is that when i run in command prompt it returns
<br/>
ERROR: Could not find AXXE signature.
<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a four-character "game code" for each title on the GBA. This needs to be in PassMe ROMs (*ds.gba) because flash cart writing software expects it there. Before FlashMe, the unofficial tools for Nintendo DS often generated "AXXE" as the game code, but FlashMe requires "PASS" so newer tools may generate this. Try using gbafix (included with devkitARM) to change the game code:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">gbafix kitten.nds.gba -cAXXE</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. pme2nds has nothing to do with devkitpro
<br/>
2. the 'PASS' is in the GBA header. 'AXXE' is in the nds header. It looks for AXXE to find the beginning of the nds file.
<br/>
3. there are some homebrew that wont work in a multiloader or via wmb. in that case, even if it convertes to .nds, it wont work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
