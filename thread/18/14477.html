    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working with a visual style similar to cell shading, but I need the outlines created by GL_OUTLINE to be thicker, is there a way to do this? 
<br/>
<br/>
If not, is there a reasonably fast way to do it without using GL_OUTLINE?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The outline rendering on the DS is more like an abuse of the anti-alisasing system. Instead of changing the blending of the boundary pixels, it paints them with a specific color, or so it seems. So no, you cannot make the lines thicker that way.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to use other techniques for drawing outlines. 
<br/>
<br/>
The most common one (which allows you to have thick lines, and even variable line width) is to have a copy of your model with fully averaged normals, with each vertex slightly displaced along it's own normal (so the model is a bit fatter than the original), painted fully black (or with your outline color) and draw with front-face culling instead of back-face.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that you'll use more polygons (probably the same amount as drawing your model without backface culling).
<br/>
<br/>
You can also do a fake outline effect using the toon shading feature and having the light always pointing in the same direction as the camera is looking to. With a cleverly made toon shading table and averaged normals, you can have the shading only affect the model's edges, creating really thick lines. 
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that you cannot use multiple lights that way (you're spending the single light you can use to create the outlines), but you probably could use a environment mapped texture to fake the outlines.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
