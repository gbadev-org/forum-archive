    <h4>#48090 - chishm - Sun Jul 17, 2005 2:54 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been playing around with loading from a CF card, and have found Wifime works, but flashme doesn't.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone explain the exact boot procedure of Flashme when it detects a PASS cart in the GBA slot.
<br/>
Also, what does Wifime do? Is it a simple header modification like Passme, or does it do something more? Does anyone have any info on the exact WMB boot procedure (what gets loaded where, how it knows where to load each binary, etc)?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
