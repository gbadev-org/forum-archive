<br/>
I assume it wouldn't be too different from ZSNES's net play feature....
<br/>
<br/>
To take it a step further, would the second DS even need the emulator/rom? Could we use download play to stream over data?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, a second DS would still need at least a DS Download Play version of the emulator because the wireless bandwidth isn't big enough to push 256x192 pixels 60 times a second, and Nintendo hasn't announced plans for a TV adapter.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldnt swear to it not being possible to stream video over wireless on the DS but it would need a very clever codec and as such still some sort of software downloaded to it.   Now if it would be possible to do that while having a low enough latency for sending controls back to the host DS is another thing.

Still, I think we will find some interesting tricks pulled on the DS once homebrew gets going.  In many ways the fact that its such a limited system means it will have more interesting uses.  The harder it is to do something the more motivation there is to do it.  I for one suspect the PSP will have very basic stuff like emulators, nothing close to the innovation the DS will get.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
