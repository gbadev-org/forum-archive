    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I'm having issues getting a grasp on grit. I've went through Patater's Tutorials on backgrounds, I've searched the forum, I've read ever line of the grit readme 3 times and I've tried running through the examples included with devKitpro, and I can't figure out how a solution or even where to continue my pursuit of a solution. I feel like if I could convert the image properly I could get it to display, but everything I've tried has resulted in horrible garbled images of random color tiles associated with the image. A point in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.

<br/>
Thanks!

P.S I read in a different topic something about checking the .grit file in all in one backgrounds example in devKitPro, but I couldn't find one there, just one in the 256 color bmp example and an example on fonts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Without knowing what the input image and output looks like, the code you use (specifically BG-type and tile/map base), the grit rules and possibly the preface grit puts in the header or conversion log, there's little we can say. You need to give use more information.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you used the correct options and code, at the moment I guess it could be two thing. One is that your map could overlap your tiles. Check the map/tile bases and the memory requirements. The other is that 1024x1024 is a very large map, and that you're simply running out of unique tiles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
