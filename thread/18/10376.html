Edge antialiasing couldn?t be easier:

glEnable(GL_ANTIALIAS);

would appear to be all you need!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Well, it is not. :( In addition to that, I have tried setting bit 4 of GFX_CONTROL which NDSTech Wiki tells should enable antialiasing. Someone told me to unset GFX_CONTROL bits 12 and 13 too (?) but this didn't have any effect either. I'd like to hear if anyone really has successfully used AA on the DS...
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I've been trying to accomplish is blending between BG0 in 3D mode and an exrot BG (for example BG2). I suppose it should be possible but the usual way to set up blending like this...

<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">BLEND_CR = BLEND_ALPHA | BLEND_DST_BG2 | BLEND_SRC_BG0;
<br/>
BLEND_AB = 0x10 | (0x10 &lt;&lt; 8);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
... just doesn't seem to be enough. Does anyone have any ideas on how to implement this? I could capture the 3D and blend the BGs in software but it seems too much of a hassle if the hardware is able to do it anyway...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Omegas on Thu Jul 27, 2006 12:54 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I found some information about this on the forum and experimented a bit. By setting the polygon id to 1 for all polys I draw I can distinguish them from the background (id 0). This seems to be enough to enable antialiasing between the polygons' edges. I also tried setting separate IDs for several 3D objects but the results were a bit weird.. I guess I have to fiddle with this once I understand it fully.
