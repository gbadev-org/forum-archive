Im really looking forward to the wireless possibilities with this machine more than anything.

When they FINALLY had displays up for the DS (about a week and a half ago, hard to tell since <span style="font-weight: bold">time is moving so freaking slowly</span>), one guy was talking to me about the cool features, and he looked at the display (probably for the firt time) and said "Oh, cool!

Erm... well, I'm sure it's lighter than the bottom (obviously... the bottom has a lot more in it than the top), but the point I was getting at is that the balance is off.  The bottom needs to weigh more.

Actually, it's not that bad for me to wait, since I have mine reserved. Besides, I have to actually wait until Monday morning (gasp!) because I've got a lot of things to get done before then, school work mainly.
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm kinda in the clear, unless for some reason they decided to sell them all and hold none of them back. They can't do that, can they? The reservation is like a contract that must be upheld on both ends, them with the unit, and me with the money. So I'm entitled to a unit when I keep my end of the bargain, right?

I doubt there will be any extra processing power given to those emulators, or any GBA game, because when the DS runs in GBA mode, I assume the hardware is set to mimic the settings/frequencies/etc of an actual GBA to maintain compatibility and hardware timing. However, I could be wrong, so whoever can give this a try, tell us about it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the DS turned on the higher clock speed automatically, it would possibly break a sizable number of existing official GBA single-player games that depend on 280896 cycles per frame, such as anything using sound. Either there's a register that can be accessed from the GBA to double the clock speed (as on the GBC), or it's available only to DS games.

Not necessarily, but I'd recommend leaving now to go shopping.  I picked mine up at a Best Buy almost an hour ago.

That thumb thing is wierd. I wonder if that was an afterthought or someone at nintendo with big hands was using the stylus.. speaking of using the thumb thingy -- I am a big person and my thumbs can not reach all corners when I have my fingers on one of the other back buttons.. maybe I'll need to do some Yoga Finger Technique.. what was that movie..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I finally got my DS today, and I really like it. Playing Mario64DS is a little odd with the thumb thingy, but I'm getting better with it.
<br/>
<br/>
It's just too bad I found a single pixel on the touch-screen burned out. Would just 1 pixel be enough to get a replacement? Also, if I were to wait a week after purchase before contacting Nintendo, would they still do the replacement? I'm seeing family for a week, so I can't do anything until afterwards.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I thought I would check up on with the DS was to see whether or not in GBA mode there were more sprite rendering cycles, but sadly there is no change.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else got an odd audio echo when playing around with Mario64DS? It happened once when I was fooling around with the drawing stuff at boot-up, and for the rest of the time in-game, the echo was still there. But, when I rebooted, it was back to normal. I wonder if Nintendo should be contacted about this?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll have to check over my DS's screen nice and carefully. I haven't noticed any dead pixels, but there could be some hiding around the edges. I'm sure you could get it replaced for having a dead pixel, but I don't know if they have any set timeline. I'd guess a week wouldn't be too long.
<br/>
<br/>
The echo sounds like a good old fashioned bug. The main menu does sound like it has some pretty heavy reverb going on, so I bet you just found some sequence of events that makes it not get turned off when leaving. Probably nothing anyone can do about it now that the game is out.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I wouldn't be too quick to judge it just yet. The DS has just been released, so the possibility of a few glitches here and there in supposed "rushed" products and other things like "dead pixels" can appear. Then again, it could just be that my particular DS and game have the problem, in which I should be able to get a replacement for defect products. If I can't, then I won't worry. I love my DS.....my...DS...........my..precciiousssss.....oops! There I go again.
<br/>
Not to pound on Sony or anything, but I wouldn't expect the PSP to be in any better condition when it is released. Nothing is perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I want to try the next time this "reverb" problem comes up again (if it does) is close the DS to put it into sleep mode and then bring it back out. This turns off things like the displays and <span style="font-weight: bold">audio</span> to conserve battery. If it completely shuts off audio, and the game itself doesn't have the settings for this reverb in memory but only in the registers, then when I re-open the DS, the audio should restart, and just maybe the reverb will be gone.

Not just you. Some people are complaining about the controls of this Mario 64DS game. And I don't really see any good or happy replies except the GBA Flash carts work.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to see a new console that has upgraded hardware that outstand the GBA. What I see from your replies is a new GBA SP with touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is if the sound is actually better than the GBA's. I really hate the quality of the GBA when it comes to sound and size of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
What about the double screen? Is it really that great so you can name a console after it? Or is it just for advertising? What happened to the Gameboy trademark?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think the controls are bad for <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario 64 DS</span>. It took a bit of time to get used to them but they work surprising me well. I don't use the touch screen for anything other than mini games because the analog stick keeps on moving on the screen. I think Nintendo would have been better off making an analog stick for the DS.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have to agree.  The controls weren't what I expected at first, so I had to un-learn the N64 handling and re-leard for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
As for sound, I personally think it's higher quality, and goes louder.  Also, with Mario 64 it has a nice surround effect which I haven't seen in ANY GBA game, even though the GBA is stereo like the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the second screen, I don't know how I did without it before!  It's SO nice to have a game that has a map that you get to see any time you want, and it isn't covering the gameplay!  Anyone who has tried to play something like Turok for N64 with the map on knows what I'm talking about -- it gets in the way.  Not to mention, having certain stats on the 2nd screen while the screen with the main gameplay only has critical stats showing.  And when the screens are small, it's nice to have extra space to see what you're doing.
<br/>
<br/>
I wish to dispell any doubts anyone may have about the DS, it is a great system.  I can't wait for more games to be released, as all my favorites are going to have to wait until as late as next September until I can get them.  The sooner I get Animal Crossing, the better!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using the "thumb shoe" on the touch-screen is a way of "emulating" an actual analog stick. Of course just like emulation, it isn't perfect. I myself prefer the D-Pad/Y-Button for Mario64DS, unless I need precision. This is just Mario64DS, whereas there will be a bunch of other games incorporating different ways of using the touch-screen, and perhaps better analog stick emulation.

It'd seem to fit the pattern. When I launch Nintendo multiboot games (ripped from GameCube games) from PogoShell, the sound bias is all wrong, as PogoShell neglects to set the bias. If I put it to sleep and back (which is hard in Panel de Pon unless you can tell what's the katakana for Suriipu-moodo), the sound is fine.

Perhaps this is because the mixer is running on a separate CPU rather than being crammed into the same 16.8 MHz CPU, where sound programmers such as the almighty JD (of AAS) limit the mixer functionality to get acceptable speed.
