I'm sorry, but i got a bit confused, it sounded like a yes, then a no, then a maybe, but it wouldn't be good....But basiclly what i am looking for is to use the power of the DS to make a game that is in ful 3d and stretches across both screens. Now I obviously do not plan on any high power gfx, just about asphalt urban gt quality, jsut instead of being shown on one screent he action is spred across the two. Is this possible? An example would be a 3d top down shooter that spreds the action across both screens. THanks for your help guys!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From my assumations, 3D on both screens are possible (I've noticed this on various Super Mario 64 DS minigames, and on Spiderman 2 screenshots), however, one of three methods are being used.  First, it could be that all of the "sprites" are prerendered, then used in 2d mode (much like in Donkey Kong Country).  This would work for the minigames, but not for Spiderman.  Second method would be to use software render 3D.  This would be a bit slower however, and possibly more power consuming.  The third method (if possible) would be to swap the 3D screen between the two every other frame, thus having two 3D screens running 30 FPS.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I've heard, the hardware acceleration only works on one screen at a time. So, if you wanted to have 3D on both screens:
<br/>
- You could get it to oscillate between the two screens every second frame and cap your framerate;
<br/>
- Or you could write a software renderer (since you aren't going for high quality, and the ARM9 is a fixed-point system, this will work fairly well).

Eclipse, you should really consider if this is even something you would want to do.  Watching two screen simultaneously is not a good idea.

I'm not quite sure but it seems diffrent to me , when the star is in the top screen from when it's flying around in the bottom screen. I'd say the star in the topscreen is a prerendered sprite.

<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, people think it can render 3d on only one screen only based on what has been deduced from the leaked register map, and because is is believed that 3d is rendered on the fly, and not in a framebuffer.
<br/>
<br/>
While I believe there may be some truth in this, there also could be features allowing to render 3d on both screen that we just don't know about.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if it allowed only to run at 30 fps, it wouldn't matter too much. 30 fps is usually good enough for 3d. A scrolling is noticeably smoother at 60 fps than at 30, but with 3d, it's much harder to tell the difference.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's been stated before that this is probably 3D in the same way that Donkey Kong Country was 3D. In other words, they're probably prerendered sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the camp that thinks that 3D is only possible on one screen at a time OR it's something so difficult to do that it'll take programmers awhile to get a handle on it.

Very clever 2D is not 3D but if it makes for a good effect anyway, why not use it? It sure looked good in Donkey Kong Country and didn't take away from the gameplay at all.

I know, you'll say that they could use pre-rendered background animations and such.

Play yacht. Advance to the point where there is a shark circling on the top screen.
<br/>
You'll agree that the yacht (on bottom screen) is real-time 3d. What about the shark ? Do you think that it would be really reasonable to have a pre-rendered animation of a circling shark ? Or even several ones (as later one, the shark is making a smaller circle ?)

What I'm saying is why rig and anim a 3D character at all when a 2D animation looks just as good? If the model is only going to be seen from a finite number of angles, it makes sense to have a team to take care of that so that you can use the system's horsepower more wisely (SNES Mario Kart, the cars were sprites instead of realtime 3D objects. They COULD have been done in 3D, but the game wouldn't have been as fast or fun)

<br/>
Yeah, I will. :) The reason being that no matter how complex the 3D effect, if it's only being seen from one angle, then it can be done just as well in 2D.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even if it's seen only from a particular angle, it's much more work.
<br/>
When you animate sprites, you have to draw each frame of each animation, for each sprite.
<br/>
<br/>
Making a new animation for a 3d character that is already modeled and rigged is much less work than making an animated sprite.
<br/>
Since both the hero and the girl have obviously been modeled and rigged (for the menus, the cut scenes, and such), I don't possibly see why they would have wasted time to make sprites, for instance for the scorpion mini-game.
<br/>
<br/>
On SNES, rendering 3d objects in real-time was probably not an option. If the system does have enough horsepower to do it, it would be foolish to waste time (and/or money) to animate 2d sprites if it's easier to do with 3d.
<br/>
Especially the mario kart example: animating a sprite is already some work, but animating it from x different angles is x times more work.
<br/>
<br/>
In 3d, you can animate things once. You can reuse animations with different models (as long as they have the same skeleton), so you have to do some generic animations (like walking and running) only once.
<br/>
Conversely, if you do a new model, it can directly use the animations that already have been done for the other characters.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Listen you, I just had enough of your nonesense, DS having almost the same arthitecture as the N64, can pull off 3D on either screen and both at same time. Jumping marios ARE NOT sprites, and they are real 3D models and no frame animation can make such marios so smooth, and not mention, the models themselves are pixelated and have rought edges which means they are indeed polygons. The shy guys move left from right, up and down, as well as the marios in several of the same mini games which uses the same 3d model.
<br/>
<br/>
If they were real sprites, why would they still have bad quality on edges? Mr driller does not use 3D, yet its animations and sprites are obviously 2d animation and do not suffer the same pixelated effects as mario mini games.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention, even in N64 GAMES, all developers did everything they could to AVOID frame animation because of losing valuable catridge space.
<br/>
<br/>
It is easier for developers to make 3d models instead of high quality frames because they take too much space.
<br/>
<br/>
You want example? N64 killer instinct gold was entirely converted from the arcade version KI2 2d animation game into 3d enviroments and models, because doing it with 2D frames would take so much space to have a smooth animation as the arcade version.  
<br/>

It would have needed a bigger cartridge which would mean, cost more for production as well as consumer. So saying that making 2d animations is more beneficial for software developers especially on cartridge based 3d consoles is asinine.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by manicdvln on Thu Dec 30, 2004 10:00 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

If you have dedicated 3d hardware and it doesn't take much of a performance hit to display on two screens instead of one, you don't gain anything by using it on only one screen, since you can't really use it for something else.
<br/>
<br/>
Flash animation is vector graphics, so unless you use the 3d hardware to render it, you're going to have a real big performance hit by rasterizing polygons in software.
<br/>
<br/>
And equations like "more work for the animator, less work for the system" don't work well in the video game development business. More work for the animator cost more money, more work for the system doesn't.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that there's good chance that displaying 3d on both screen has some kind of penalty that makes it not so desirable in a lot of cases, but I do believe it can be done, and in some of the mini games in ftm, it's a better solution, even with it's particular (and unknown) downsides.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the steering wheel example is one where you have a static, although rotating, sprite. In that case, drawing a single, non-animated sprite is indeed less work than modelling it in 3d :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are tradeoffs made all the time depending on the genre. Look at it this way, I can either fully 3D model your car plus all the cars you're racing against, OR I can fully model YOUR car, bump down the models of the other cars and pay an artist to redo the textures so that you won't notice it as much.

True, but PCs have hardware for floating point calculations. My understanding is that the DS does not. And vector graphics without an FPU is troublesome.

I was just making the point that 3D acceleration isn't needed for 2D graphics. I think it's more important as Scott said that you have a good FPU.

Your point was that using 2d would demand less on the system, and that it could well be 2d vector graphics. My point was 2d vector graphics without using the hard essentially needs as much power as rendering 3d in software, because you have to touch individual pixels with the CPU, so you'd be better off using the 3d hardware. And so, if you're going to simulate 3d using 2d vector rendered with the hard, you can aswell just render 3d.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, my point is that it wouldn't make any sense for them to have bothered to do fake 3d on one screen with some 2d techniques, instead of only rendering 3d on both screen, even with supposedly penalties to do so. It seems we strayed quite a bit from that discussion :)

Making lod for cars isn't quite as much work as drawing animated sprites that can be seen from a lot of directions. And yes, if it's necessary to make the game work (ie run at a decent speed), of course it will be done.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if it's going to be much more work to gain only a little performance, then it's not worth it. You, somewhere in that discussion, said that feel the magic could very well have used 2d to fake 3d on the second display, and that it would look just as good. I said that it was unlikely since it would require much more work and that the 3d chip of the DS was probably able to handle it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thus, by occam's razor, it's much more likely that they simply render 3d on both screens where it's needed (ex, the yacht minigame), rather than using 2d tricks that would take much more cartridge space and be much more work to come up with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If FTM IS doing 3D on both screens then the limitation may be that you must decrease your color palette and simplify your models greatly. This would be quite a quality decrease for the sake of dual3D and may be why we only see it on one title.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It all depends on how many bit you choose to use as fractional part, and integer part. By the way, I'm pretty sure that most software engines (if not all of them) used fixed point calculation, because it's usually much faster than fp calculation.

Yes, many fewer transformation calculation. However, the bulk of the work for a software 3d renderer, or a 2d one, is to draw polygons. And you need to touch individual pixels. Even if you're filling polygons with a single color and nothing fancy like texturing or shading, you have to store a lot of data in memory.
<br/>
<br/>
You don't have to transform an huge amount of vertices, especially since we're not talking about thousnads of  polygons models here.
<br/>
<br/>
The transformation of a vertex is is only a bunch of multiplications and additions (both usually have the same execution cost on modern cpus), like (on top of my head) around 15 for the multiplication of a 3*3 matrix by a 3 element vector to do homogenous 2d transformations, and around 20-25 to multiply a 4*4 matrix by a 4 element vector (for homogenous 3d transformations).
<br/>
<br/>
Add three divisions for the homogenous space to screen projection: 3d vector is not that much more total work over 2d vectors, especially as we're not talking about models with thousands of polygons here.
<br/>
<br/>
So, transformation of the vertices is an order of magnitude less work than actually drawing the polygons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If that's true, then I think I understand why Nintendo decided not to add bilinear filtering to the features of the DS. Because if only 1 screen can use the 3D hardware at a time, then the other (in order to have 3D on it too) would have to be software-based. Could you imagine trying to implement a software-based 3D engine with bilinear filtering on a 67Mhz CPU, let alone a 33Mhz CPU?

<br/>
That sorta matches up with what I've gathered from the DS wiki and other places, but I understood it as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
The DS basically has a GBA inside; ARM7 and a couple of GFX chips. When running in GBA mode this is what gets used.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the DS has an ARM9 and 3D GFX chip. When running in DS mode user code runs on the ARM9; the ARM7 deals with the touch-screen, WiFi, etc etc.
<br/>
<br/>
So in DS mode the user code running on the ARM9 would be in control of both the 3D GFX chip and the old GBA GFX chips. ie your write some tiles, maps, sprites, etc, to the GBA GFX chips' mapped memory; write some models, textures, viewpoints, etc, to the 3D GFX chip's mapped memory: and magically the GFX processors turn that stuff into cool GFX on the screens.
<br/>
<br/>
However none of this helps us work out if either of the GFX chips can access both screeens at the same time. There's no reason why either chip couldn't work at a resolution of 256x384 spanning both screens - especially given it looks like the GBA GFX chips can work at both 256x192 (DS resolution) and 240x160 (GBA screen resolution).
<br/>
<br/>
However my guess is each GFX chip gets its own screen. Seems simpler that way. Looking at Feel the Magic there are a number of times it looks like 3D on both screens (the shopping cart rolling down the hill, cleaning muck of the girl's arms), but in each case it seems that the "less 3D" of the screens could easily be faked using some scaled sprites or something.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... enough uninformed rambling from me!
<br/>

<br/>
The DS basically has a GBA inside; ARM7 and a couple of GFX chips. When running in GBA mode this is what gets used.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the DS has an ARM9 and 3D GFX chip. When running in DS mode user code runs on the ARM9; the ARM7 deals with the touch-screen, WiFi, etc etc.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I understood that it's indeed this way, but that there's an indirect way, with various downsides, to render 3d on both screens.

I'm not sure, but if the 3d is rendered for double the height of one screen, and loaded into a buffer, that would allow both screens to display the 3D image.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This might make sense, using HDMA to save every rendered scanline and then alternate which screen that is updated every other frame.

I believe:

<br/>
</li><li>Rendering to two screens at once effectively halves the quality of image that can be rendered per screen.
<br/>
</li><li>In an effort to make the DS's 3D abilities look better, Nintendo made 3D performance claims for only rendering to one screen.
<br/>
</li><li>Somewhere, someone misinterpreted this to mean the DS can only do 3D on one screen at a time.

I got 404'd as well.
<br/>
If this is an initial view where the camera has just finished whirling around the object, that's one thing. However, if you're walking along (the 3D wall only being on the bottom screen) and this thing just slides out at you from one of the sides (the lightning strike reminds me vaguely of YuGiOh) then it'd just be a well done picture.
<br/>
<br/>
That's why I'd say in most cases, I'd probably have to see the picture moving.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The data you read wouldn't contain any of the hardware-drawn 3D graphics. Assuming it's a framebufferless renderer like tepples said, it's just like reading pixels on the GBA where ever a sprite is.

That is, unless the output of the framebufferless renderer can be observed. Then just use some sort of DMA to redirect this output back into VRAM for use on the 2D screen.
