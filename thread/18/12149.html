    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's the feasability of being able to play 2 mp3's at once on the ds? I know people have written mixers before and I know there are mp3 players. Is the DS up to the task or is it not powerful enough? If it's not powerful enough what part of it is not powerful enough? Not enough memory? what?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If there is a problem, it is one of not enough CPU speed. How many MP3s can you play at once on a Pentium 66 MHz? Less sophisticated codecs such as ADPCM or GSM or MP2 might be more likely to run fast enough to allow mixing of two streams.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given the fact that MoonShell uses the ARM9 to play MP3s but uses the ARM7 to play MP2, MP2 should definitely be possible to decode two at the same time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't really see the point, as mixing normally requires the use of a second channel to tweak the second mp3 in this case so that the beats match up.  Unless you plan on playing mono mp3s and playing one mp3 out of left and 1 mp3 out of right you'll be playing both mp3s at the same time.. where does the mixing come into play?  Or, are you just asking for a fader?  cause that isn't mixing.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless the MP3 has a .sm or .dwi file to tell the mixer where the beats are.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There was a program I used years ago on linux called TerminatorX which would let you load up as many mp3 tracks as you wanted and then you could use the mouse to scratch a track like you would if you had a real turntable. It   occured to me today that this might be a fun little app for the ds since you have the stylus you could use for scratching or you finger or whatever. For a first step I think I'll probally get it working with just one mp3 put it would be neat to be able to have two mp3 tracks cued up so one could play and you could scratch the other. Sort of a pocket dj program. I just wasn't sure if the ds could handle playing two mp3's at once. It's kinda sounding like it can</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like a pretty neat idea to me. I hope you do it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
