    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just curious. Did nintendo completely drop support for it, or did they just choose not to put the port on the DS. If the answer is they just decided not to put the port on the DS, would anyone know how to wire it up?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two reasons: <ul><li>A couple of the more popular GBA flash carts go through the serial port. </li><li>If the Nintendo DS had a GBA link port, then Nintendo would have virtually no reason to sell the GBA SP anymore, given that most of the GBC games have GBA sequels nowadays. </li></ul> Most likely, the SO, SI, SC, and SD signals on the DS's ARM7 CPU aren't brought out to the package. Has anybody with a Nintendo DS and a GBA flash cart managed to tickle the serial registers on the DS in GBA mode and see if they behave as a GBA's do?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But my question is, is the link port physically removed so there are no traces of it left on the DS. Or does it actually exsist on the DS, but just needs to be wired. Because I havent seen any specific detail on this issue. All I have seen is just the fact that the link port is not there, but whats to say that the DS couldnt be rigged up with one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The link port hardware is alive and well on the ARM7, but being put to other uses.  I dunno if the lines are brought out, or if the stuff it's doing is all internal on-die, but either way, the DS will *not* boot properly if you were to interfere with the communication it's doing on the GBA-style serial port.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

I think that as soon as the DS is properly homebrewed someone will program an emulator for the older GB/GBC and possibly GBA games with the linkport over wifi, so I don't really care.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
SNES emulation was done on the GBA, which also had screen ration issues. However, the extra 32 vertical scanlines, and 8 pixels per line will make it much easier to view, scaled or unscaled.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS should be able to emulate the system at full speed barring any technical difficulties. Perhpas it would even be able to support wireless mutliplayer emulation, who knows?
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, probably just getting the basic functions of the DS working would be enough for most right now.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
