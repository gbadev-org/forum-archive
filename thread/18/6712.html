    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am also interested in that idea. What exactly did you have in mind? I was hoping for a fake-OS type of shell (like WinS or MoonShell) but with the ability to multiboot homebrew apps/games. I guess it would be similar to DarkStar, but more full featured like MoonShell. I should be able to customize it and add my own desktops, etc. Obviously the ability to play mp3/video is a must (along with a real filesystem that can read directly from the cart). I would also like a textpad and voice recorder program. I doubt we will be able to multitask, unless the applications are specifically written for that specific shell. What benifit would multitasking have since you can only use one program at once anyway?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I find this a very interesting tough. It doesn't matter if we only can multi-task programs for only one DS Environment, if the DSE's have their own windowing system (like moonshell has), we are obliged to use that, but that would only make the DSE have a more consistent look and feel. The multi-tasking would be great if we could play a mp3 and, let's say, write/read a text, or even play music and copy some text from a book to you schedule.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
