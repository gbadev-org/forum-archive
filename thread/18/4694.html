    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I figgured I'd whore myself out. I just picked up a DS today and it's made me want to put aside my xbox for a while. 
<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, I just do alot of case modding, but I'm intrested in actually rejoining the dev scene.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't coded anything since net yaroze, so My coding skills are ass,but I did graduate college with a major in graphic design, and have been using photoshop and many other apps for atleast 10 years.
<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone needs something, please ask. I'm wanting to get in and do some graphical work for any of the coming DS apps if allowed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You remember when XBOX was released? It is like that with the DS right now. People are slowly hacking into the hardware to find a way to run their own code. It takes some time, as I rememebered with XBOX, not until the special chip mods were official, people could start developing games and apps for it. I believe the DS must go through the same process.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually I flashed my bios long before chips were out, but that was an old bios that just unlocked the DVD drive to whatever media, long before the day of Dashboards.
<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I know it's early, and that not many people are involved in actually getting anything working done at the moment. since there are few people I figgured I'd at the very least offer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
