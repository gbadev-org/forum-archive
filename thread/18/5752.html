    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At the Nintendo conference, Reggie said that DS online system would be able to work through "your existing wireless router or USB connection.  You can go over to GameSpot and watch the Nintendo conference if you don't believe me.  Since the DS obviously doesn't have a USB port, it would have to be an Option Pak.  This would open new possibilities for quick code testing and debugging - a new FlashMe version could check the USB port for a connection, then load the code in from there.

I guess we just have to wait for clarification from Nintendo now.  It probably isn't worthwhile emailing them, I bet the people answering emails are 'left out of the loop' just as much as the public is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If I were Nintendo, I would more go with a special usb wifi adapter you plug into the PC. That way, the DS is left untouched and the work is done from the PC side.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">he was most likely referencing the fact that the DS's online software will more than likely work with USB Wifi sticks for PCs, enabling another way for the DS to interface with the intraweb, not for a USB port for the DS.  btw: even *IF* the DS got a USB port in this fashon... guess what?  it would be a CLIENT DEVICE, not a host controller.  this means it would be completely useless for hooking up devices to the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lol, the only thing you need is an wifi router or wifi PCI card, and that's all, there isn't any usb pak. It's just like stated ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.picfront.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">www.picfront.com [ Upload your pictures ]</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think its more for people who do not yet own a wifi device... like me (before I bought my Ralink card). If I was going to buy a device <span style="font-style: italic">just</span> for DS wifi play, I would rather buy something that was gauranteed to work, assuming the nintendo device was in the same price range.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the Nintendo device will also allow wifi tunnelling? We can only hope...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I saw mention somewhere reputable that Nintendo would have an "approved list" of tested routers that can be used. The emphasis seemed to be that you can probably use existing WiFi equipment.
<br/>
<br/>
Like the XBox and PS2 networking gear though, there will certainly be $90 wireless access points with the game system trademarks and manufactured by game accessory specialists that are simply overpriced network devices.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
