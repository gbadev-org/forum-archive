    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've programmed some games with flash mx 2004, and i want to know how hard the coding is compared to flash's actionscript. Is there anyone who has experience with both programs, and could say which coding is more complex?<br/>_________________<br/>I don't know anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS is much more complicated. But if your time isn't worth <a class="postlink" href="http://cheap.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">$699.95</a>, or you want to gain experience for a job at a game studio, it might be worth it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Coding games in C/C++ is much different than using Flash. First, forget about the entire WYSIWYG editor interface, timeline, drag'n'drop and such. You have to code your way to do even the "simpliest" thing as getting a sprite moving from point A to B.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get a taste of what it's like, download something like SDL samples and look at their source code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I always found actionscript an absolute pain to try and code with, it doesn't seem to do what you tell it, never mind what you want it to do. C/C++is a bit easyer to use in my opintion, but as M3d10n said there aint no wysiwig interface, you must know what you're doing to get something done.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">... but c/c++ is the "real deal" (no offense to you flash ppl). did you ever try to code for pc? try that first, then move to nds or gba when you have enough basic game programming skills.
<br/>
<br/>
happy coding!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a reasonable amount of experience with the nds and a ton of experience with ActionScript.  AS is far easier to code for than the nds, but not because of the language itself.  Knowing only AS, you can probably understand a good portion of nds code, the major difference is that with AS, 75% of the work is done for you.
<br/>
<br/>
In flash, you would draw a picture, animate it, label the keyframes, then finally have your AS GotoAndPlay("idle").  Doing the same on the nds requires using external art programs to create each frame; then telling the nds how to load, handle, display each frame (into a consistant image). Then create structures for the [client] programmer to be able to use an easy mGotoAndPlay(ANIM_IDLE).
<br/>
<br/>
If you're new to C/C++ programming, don't let any of this discourage you.  I believe that what flash programmers have is an <span style="font-style: italic">excellent</span> sense of organization (which is required to have proper interaction between objects in Flash).
