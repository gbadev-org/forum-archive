    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to learn the C language by programming on the DS.
<br/>
There is one particular thing I want to do, and it involves running a program at the same time as a game (just like cheat devices and nitrohax/dipstar do, but the game's a ROM, not a official cart), however, I am pretty lost and I don't know what to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Would you mind to answer some questions I got here?
<br/>
<br/>
1. Is there any way to move code from its assigned location on the memory to the end of the memory? That way, it wouldn't get modified unless the game uses all of the ds's memory. Which they don't, because ARDS works.
<br/>
I have seen in rebootlib how to place code in binary at a point of the memory (chism's bin). How can I turn my code to .bin? I only get .arm9, .arm7 and .nds
<br/>
<br/>
2. How can I do it so, on the game's main loop, my code gets executed too? Would I have to overwrite the game's code? How can I do that without making it crash?
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a little complicated but since I have seen that custom cheat programs have been made, then maybe you can help me a little.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This isn't the place to ask for help running ROMs at all, even if you are running your own code at the same time.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Eh, that means you can't run ROM's with the rebootlib? Bad news for me then :(
<br/>
Anyway, any idea on how to append my own code to, say, a homebrew web browser, for example? (Without having the source of the browser)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which piece of proprietary freeware are you talking about? Links (for DSLinux) is GPL, and DSOrganize is GPL.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
