Has any one used this (for that matter is there any project on the web using it)?  I think this could be really awesome since I'm writing a PC game in Python but I can't tell if the import function works and if it'll run .pyc or just .py.  It seems to only import the stuff built into ndspython.  I did patch it for my device.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
