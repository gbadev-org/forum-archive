    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im just planning my first big project for the nintedo ds, called Hellfish DS, which will base on a 2d gui library im currently planning
<br/>
<br/>
the main problem till now is that im not into gba/nds development that much and have a lack of knowledge about low level programming, thats why this project is currently in the planning phase
<br/>
<br/>
heres a mockup
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I already made  a gui engine a while ago using SDL/OpenGL for PC, but but thats some time ago, so im doing a restart now.
<br/>
<br/>
The first thing i`ll work on will be simple drawing functions, font engine , letting the whole thing beeing editable using normal text files, so some kind of simple scripting
<br/>
<br/>
the gui library and the interface itself will be 2 different parts, so everyone can use the gui library hisself in his own project
<br/>
<br/>
as i said before, im not into programming that anymore, so if someone has some  good stuff about 2d on nds, let me know</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Besides, PALib has always seemed a bit more game-oriented to me, while this looks well suited to other stuff...
<br/>
I can't help you much, but good luck!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do NOT let palib discourage you. I really wish someone would make a palib alternative that I could actually use. (palib is full of bugs and bad coding practices and never works for me, such that it's easier to rewrite stuff myself instead of trying to solve the bugs in palib)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
