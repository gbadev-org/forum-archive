Could it be you got your screen protectors switched? Or just simply didn't use screen protectors designed for the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the brand I use are Pelican?.  Got them at gamestop in a pack with 2 color styluses for $4.99.  Mine works fine.  The bottom one is a little small but probably needs to be to allow removal (which doesn't appear to ge easy.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought "Intec" screen protectors. The top one is already incredibly "warped" looking (wavy and such), and scratched up badly, despite the fact that I've not had it for even a day yet. Definately not a good thing.  The bottom protector didn't apply evenly and had impossible to remove bubbles, though it may have been that I left it in the air too long, allowing dust to collect on to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone tried cutting up one of those slide on screen protectors for PDAs and slipping it over the touch screen? It seems to have enough space for one, and its the only screen you really need to protect since it looks like the top screen has a cover like the GBA-SP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
