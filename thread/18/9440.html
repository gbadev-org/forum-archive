    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I whipped together a sample Server List browser.  It allows you to query for game servers, and to add/remove game servers from the list.  It's pretty basic at the moment, but should be enough for a simple ip address exchange.  I'm feel like I'm rushing this out because I'm late for work... but I think I got it all in a clean package for download, if not I'll fix it tonight.
<br/>
<br/>
The source code for all the operations is included, so feel free to add it to your wifi enabled games, and to use my server to store hosted game ip addresses.  You'll just need to change the 3 instances of "TestGame" to your own game name.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find the package here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.atouchofwar.com/tools.php" target="_blank">http://www.atouchofwar.com/tools.php</a>

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, is there anything needed to be running on the server side to use it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Basically, your game server just needs to send a message to my server when the game can accept clients and another when the game can't.  That should be all it takes to let clients know your game server's IP address.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to beef it up once I(or others) start using it in a game.  Add things like removing the server from the list after a variable length of time, and storing the current number of players on the server, etc...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ahh.. Sorry for the confusion (both in posts and understanding of the game server).
<br/>
<br/>
Correct me if this is wrong:
<br/>
<br/>
-NDS1 is the game server, it sends it's IP to your site.
<br/>
<br/>
-NDS2 is a client, it connects to your site to receive a server IP list.
<br/>
<br/>
-Your site (in mysql) just collects the IPs of NDSs hosting a game.
<br/>
<br/>
-When a player selects a game server to connect to, they receive the IP information from your site, and make a direct connection to the NDS hosting the game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is that right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, that's exactly it.  I figured this kind of thing might come in handy for people that don't have access to a "matchmaking" server of any kind.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, I haven't posted it anywhere, but it's just some php querying/adding/removing records from a mysql database.  You might have noticed the gamecode was just sending http requests to my webserver and receiving html replies.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've done some initial work on this myself it would be cool to have our own centralised game browser for the ds.  I consider it to be an integral part of my plan to make wifi games easier to dev for by saving people from writing the same code in every app eg setting up, lobbys etc</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
