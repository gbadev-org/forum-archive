    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
First of all sorry for my bad english. I've been working for some time in a Dark Legions remake for the DS, i have a grid with textures for the map and a first version of the GUI (all the graphics are ripped from the original game data, I plan to add new graphics and models when i get all working), the problem comes because i render the map in 3d mode, i load all the textures and render them, but only 4 of the textures gets rendered, all the other textures are plain white, I tried to reduce the texture size from 128x128 (about 32kb) to 64x64 and 32x32 but it gets horribly rendered, the colors messed up and well, real weird. I've read in other post (dont remember where, sorry) that in the libnds the size of the textures is hardcoded to 128x128 so i cant use other sizes than that (and if i use, the textures gets... weird), is it true?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help will be appreciated!
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, i'm using PAlib but i'm planning to switch to "plain" libnds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
And I think the last reply on the post implies that you would need to go through the ndslib to change it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">YOu can use 32x32,64x64 and 128x128 (maybe e 16x16 too).
<br/>
256x256 didnt worked for me. 
<br/>
Even on 16bit mode you could load that 4 times.
<br/>
Whitetexture always means that there was no data:
<br/>
-Loaded on wrong way (cant figure out how you would do that...)
<br/>
-Not enought vram
<br/>
-No glbind was called before rendering the mesh
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps. If it still dont work you could try to contact me.
<br/>
I am sure we can get that working ;)
<br/>
(but we would parse to libnds!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
