    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I want to have 2 16bb extended rotation backgrounds that cover the whole screen on both main and sub screens. From DSWiki, I get the impression that's not possible (as there is only one 128K block, VRAM_C, that can be used as sub bg). Is that true, or am I overlooking something?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was precisely what I meant, thanks. Although I'm not sure I understand the code I found there, but I'll keep trying :-)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: No, I think that's not what I want -- am I right in assuming that sprites are continuous in sprite memory? I.e. in a 4x3 map of 16bpp 64x64 sprites, the second line from the top would start at VRAM_BASE+2*64, while in a 256x192 extended rot. background it would start at VRAM_BASE+2*256? Hmm, that limits the interchangeability somewhat.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
