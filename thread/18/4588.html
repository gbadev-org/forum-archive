it has been known for quite a long time that nintendo wants to take games to the internet... however, each game has to support it.  current software titles will not be playable online w/o the use of 3rd party tunneling, such as xlink.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

no, that is just the start from xlink.  the DS's wireless communication isnt the easiest thing in the world to work with.  check out to cracking the DS's wireless thread.  outside of the WRT routers, there is only 2 other network cards that anyone has gotten to communicate with the DS yet.  more will come in time.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
2 reasons
<br/>
<br/>
1) online support is on a game by game basis.  not the DS as a whole.  each game has to specifically be programmed to support internet play.  notice how things like PSO work online, but double dash doesnt?  
<br/>
<br/>
2) WMB.  we crack the code, we run OUR code.  this isnt just about playing multiplayer online, this is about MAKING games.  notice how this is GBA Dev and DS Dev?  that means software development for the hand held device itself, not just external hacking tools.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

What I am saying people buying new routers and update firmware, connec to pc to run application all those complications, just so they will find stars with mario is kina retarded.
<br/>
<br/>
But I am 100% supportive on developpers side in making bootloaders, custom software uplaods and even the most interesting project that ties wtih yours is mini gui linux OS.
<br/>
<br/>
That is cool and even know ppl when that indeed happen, they will buy DS just for using it as a alternative PDA. But we wont see that for quite some time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's been 3 weeks since the DS came out.  I wouldn't call that slow.  Can you name any other groups that have actually tunneled the DS yet?

<br/>
Err no I didn't think so. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways for me personally, if I can play Metroid Prime : Hunters in a few weeks over the internet -using tunneling- it will be worth the $45 for a new router, instead of waiting for both Nintendo to get its ass in gear and allow online play and to release an internet able version of metroid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You never know, they may be planning online play for the full version. Are you really going to pay $45 to play a demo online? Hey, if you want to, that's awesome, and if they don't include online play in the final version, you'd be well justified in your investment. Metroid multiplayer rocks. 
<br/>
<br/>
I must say though, a few weeks seems like an optimistic estimation of when tunneled online play will be... err... playable. Hey, we can keep our fingers crossed though :)<br/>_________________<br/>Shell Smash: 55730

i can tell you with at least 80% certainty that it will *not* work on all wireless hardware.  packets are modified by the hardware itself, and on some cards, to the point that the DS wont recognize them anymore.  this is my #1 stumbling block right now before i can further development.... i need a new wireless card.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who would claim something works on ALL hardware is either really nieve or lying.  Even when it comes to standard PC hardware you can find things that simply will not work despite the fact that technically they should do.  I have had RAM that simply does NOT work reliably in certain boards despite working perfectly in others.  Now considering that, add the fact that not all wireless cards support the same functions (theres a lot more scope for differences than in a RAM stick) then you'd be crazy to make such a claim.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

<a href="http://www.mess.be" target="_blank">http://www.mess.be</a> has som form of msn-plugin that makes you able to well "pictochat" with your friends, and they don't even need the plugin to see your images. I think is the closest thing to pictochat there is ATM.

<br/>
And then you have them java written paint-chats.

and if you read what i wrote, i specifically mention that nintendos protocol is a layer 3-7 protocol, not a layer 1-2 protocol such as WiFi.  its a layer ontop of wifi, not an alternative.

nintendo says "IEEE 802.11 and Nintendo's proprietary format"... which could be the same as saying "IEEE 802.11 and TCP/IP" for the PSP, as it uses the layer 1-2 of 802.11, and layers 3 and up from the TCP/IP spec.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

Unless you know something the US FCC doesn't, the DS is "a portable game machine with a Wireless 802.11 transceiver operating in the 2400-2483.5
<br/>
MHz band with 13 channels." See: <a href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=483389&amp;native_or_pdf=pdf" target="_blank">https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=483389&amp;native_or_pdf=pdf</a> (thanks to Darkain for the link from his website).
<br/>
<br/>
So there's only 802.11 wireless hardware in the DS. If there was another wireless system in there the US FCC would have listed it and tested it (oh... unless of course it was pigeon based <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt?number=1149" target="_blank">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt?number=1149</a>).
<br/>
<br/>
So for layers 1 &amp; 2 of the OSI protocol stack, the DS uses 802.11. 802.11 doesn't specify anything about layers 3-7, so developers are free to use any layer 3-7 protocols they desire. Nintendo have decided to go with a proprietory format, rather than the common IPv4/TCP we're used to using in our desktops &amp; laptops.
<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing to stop Nintendo, or 3rd parties (or hackers like us once we can run code on the DS) writing different layer 3-7 protocols. I'm hoping the delay in the release of Animal Crossing DS is so they can add TCP/IP comms to it so it can be player over the net out of the box.<br/>_________________<br/>---

<br/>
there isnt a power consumption difference between nintendo's high layer protocols and the TCP protocol.  the reason why it is battery saving, is that it limits RX and TX rates.  this means it can output with less power, and it has less sensitivity on receive.  the higher layer protocols such as "NiFi" and TCP have nothing to do with this.   does your laptop use any more/less power switching between IPv4, IPv6, NetBEUI, IPX?  no!  because in the end, they all translate down to basic 802.11 frames w/ accompanied data.  the 802.11 layers know no difference.
<br/>
<br/>
also, TCP is internet server irrelevent.  look at the PSP.  it uses TCP/IPv4 with a ad-hoc 802.11 connection, if i remember correctly.  this doesnt translate to "requires an internet server for multiplayer", it translates to "just another high layer protocol"<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-
