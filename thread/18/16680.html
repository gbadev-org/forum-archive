I set the sprite in positions relative to the screen always, and store the position in the stage in an object's variable. And so the sprite doesn't wrap weirdly, when the difference indicates the sprite is out of the screen, I just set it in a safe position 256,193 for example.
<br/>
<br/>
If the viewpoint is at the bg scrolled 200 pixels, you would set X in the oam for
<br/>
x = 0 to 0 - 200
<br/>
x= 300 to 300-200</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To elaborate on what Emmanuel said:
<br/>
<br/>
The position of your sprite is always it's real screen position, not scrolled.  So for your in-game characters, you should store their world position separately, and then each frame, update the sprite positions based on where the world is scrolled to.  
<br/>
<br/>
If the character is offscreen, you'd want to make sure not to show a sprite for it. (Either hide or disable the sprite, or don't have a sprite allocated for that character).
<br/>
<br/>
In general, you really need to have a separate layer for logical characters than for hardware sprites, to deal with things like this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
