here is a .nds of it, the stylus accuracy is a little problem, but i'm sure with time that will get better.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">from my lemmings gameplay experience, i'd not quite recommend the use of a laptop touchpad (but you're free to do that if you want ...)
<br/>
<br/>
Rather, i'd use direction arrows (or ABYX for the left-handed guys) to scroll a kind of 'zooming window' in the bottom area, where you'll select lemmings, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
using L+DPAD (or R+ABYX) for quickly picking the "next lemmings on the right" could be handy too for playing in less perfects environments (e.g. subway ^_^)
<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward for a playable demo of one of my favourite-ever games ...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Who said I'm further? I bet im nowhere near as far! I dont have any sprites (other than the pointer) no way to load or store levels, and vertually no engine what so ever, this was only intended as a test to see if the control method would work. However, I <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> be continuing with it and see no reason why we can't have more than one lemmings clone on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
i think it would be great if you both did your versions, but each slightly different, for instance spinalcord could work on a more direct clone, with original levels and that like in his screenshot. While knightofdragon could work on his own engine, and maybe add cusomizable levels and new abilities and stuff. I would definately play both of those.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
