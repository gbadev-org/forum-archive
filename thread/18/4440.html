    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm hoping that some company will release something that plugs into the DS's gba slot and boost the wireless strenght to something like 2 or 3 miles. I mean you can buy a pair of walkie talkies at wal-mart that have that distance for $20. It's just an idea but I hope someone does it. I live close enough to most of my friends that I wouldn't have to leave the house to play em :)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see why this wouldn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
That reminds, I've read that the DS is supposed to be able to detect other DS's. Does this mean you can have it turned off and it will detect other DS's or do you have to be in sleep mode or what?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can install a wireless ethernet PCI card (~$30USD, check eBay or your local high street electronics retailer) or a wireless ethernet USB dongle and use Windows Internet Connection Sharing to make your PC act as a router. Of course, this is not recommended, and works like crap half the time. A similar functionality exists in Linux and OS X (really super easy in OS X).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another possibility is to have signal repeaters.
<br/>
<br/>
From what I've heard, the wireless GBA adapters used on games like Pokemon (and some of the NES classics, I hear?!) act as repeaters.  If you have a staduim full of people using the adapters, you could play with someone on the other side, a quarter mile away.  It may be possible the DS does that, too...
<br/>
<br/>
But imagine having a DS signal repeater that will detect, receive, and re-broadcast DS signals over large distances, that anyone with a DS can use without having to leave your router, WNIC, and in general your home computer/network wide open?  If it gave you a nice enough range (let's say, a 1 mile radius), then the wireless multiplayer mayhem could begin!
<br/>
<br/>
Chances are, it wouldn't be overly expensive either.  You can get wireless receivers that act as a WNIC and a WAP for around $50 USD, so something that ONLY repeats the signal, and ONLY the DS signal, should cost any more than $25-$35.  Let's hear it for Nintendo!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For example, are there any devices that you could make repeat all received 2.4 GHz signals, regardless of what's in the signal? So, it would be similar to a hub in the regard (i.e., it would disregard MACs and other logical addressing).
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen some devices that can be hooked up to an existing wireless network and act as a client on the network in order to extend the range of the network, but it acts too much as a router or switch to be useful in this situation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Open the battery cover.  Look in the two little holes.  Those are microBNC connectors like the ones on a laptops internal wireless card antenna.  One is a main and one is a aux.
