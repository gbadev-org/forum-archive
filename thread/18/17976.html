    <div class="postbody">Is there any HBmenu replacement (or newer version) that supports at least Icon/Title preview? (I know its source is open, but if it already exists I would better spend my time doing something else ;) )</div>    
</div>

    <div class="postbody">OK, I'm trying to do that by my own ;)</div>

    <div class="postbody">Looks like it's working well enough. But I don't get if HBmenu licence requires me to release the sources or not. I mean, I might release them, but it's such a beta and untested version that I would like to wait a bit of feedback... is it fair?</div>    
</div>

    <h4>#178071 - sverx - Thu Sep 05, 2013 9:16 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody">Ok, I think it's better to release it anyway... someone else could enhance it further :)<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/">Here's the source</a>. It includes the program (.exe for windows) needed to encrypt the R4 bootloader, this should be placed in your devkitARM/bin dir.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people around here these days, uh? ;) :D<br/>
<br/>
edit: source now points to devkitPro on SourceForge since it is in the process of being incorporated into HBMenu.</div>

    <div class="postbody">HBmenu is released under a GPL license which means that you need to provide sources on demand to anyone who you provide a binary to.<br/>
<br/>
You've also violated the license by removing the COPYING file.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally you should provide your changes as a patch to the upstream sources. That way things improve, everyone has access to all improvements and you don't have to worry about whether or not you're violating licenses.<br/>
<br/>
Updating HBmenu to display icon/title preview has been on the TODO list for quite a while. This is something that would probably be added to the official repository fairly quickly if it was provided in a suitable format.</div>

    <div class="postbody">WOW!!! :( I'm a complete newbie about this :| I didn't even notice I removed some file!!! :(<br/>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Updating HBMenu to display icon/title preview has been on the TODO list for quite a while.</div></blockquote>

... and that's another thing I wasn't aware of, even if I was wondering why that was missing :|<br/>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This is something that would probably be added to the official repository fairly quickly if it was provided in a suitable format.</div></blockquote>

I see. Should I provide a zip file of the added/modified files only and upload that somewhere?</div>

    <div class="postbody">I'm massaging your changes to fit in with the coding standards we used for HBmenu atm. What's your full name? It's for adding to copyright notices & commit log.<br/>
<br/>
drop by IRC when you have time - we're on irc.blitzed.org in #dsdev<br/>
<br/>
I can run you through the process for creating & submitting a patch as well as some pointers on recognising code styles. It's always better to try to fit in with the style of an existing project rather than making changes in whatever style you've developed.</div>

    <div class="postbody">Thank you. I don't have any access to IRC from here unfortunately so let's see if I'll have a chance to connect later...</div>
