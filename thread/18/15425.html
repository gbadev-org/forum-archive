r20 is a devkitARM version number, libnds is the library which provides DS support. devkitARM is a generic compiler providing support for several ARM based devices.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

<br/>
<br/>
On occasion libnds &amp; devkitARM updates will be released simultaneously, mainly when updates to the former rely on updates to the latter. This is not always the case. libnds and devkitARM are updated and maintained separately.
<br/>
<br/>
libnds has never and will never, come with any version of the toolchain.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would imagine that most people who use windows are using the devkitpro windows updater. since the program automates the toolchain and libnds installation/update it very easy to think they are the same. the devkits have release numbers. libnds does not appear to have a release number though I think there are dates associated with each release (as available by the devkitpro windows updater). In any case I feel the lack of an obvious release number on libnds in combination with the combined installer re-enforces the belief that they are the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i personally believe wm's point is absolutely valid. it is quite obvious, that you can't use the ngc gl lib for nds dev, yet you get the option to download it with devkit pro... (ok, i haven't used the updater in a century, but i was that way last i tried it, i swear! ;^p )
<br/>
also, libnds gets updated more frequently (isn't it? i count two times between r20 and r21) than devkit arm.
<br/>
<br/>
mixing this stuff up only causes confusion. so, he's totally right pointing this out from time to time. we don't want "miscommunication", do we? ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
now comes the BUT:
<br/>
<br/>
it is misguiding to have links for devkitARM and libnds, that point to the very same site! so, dear wm, talk to you admin / web dude to *maybe* change that. also note, that this does not *only* apply to devkitARM / libnds. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i always use the SF page. :^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I do understand why people lump libnds and devkitARM together but it's very confusing when they do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Which links are you referring to? News posts that mention both libnds &amp; devkitARM are tagged with both, these are usually when a libnds build is dependent on features in a particular devkitARM build.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, my bad. I always thought that you say there's a new revision (eg r21) available through the installer that the libnds that is available with it is the same until the next revision. So when you're instructing someone in how to build your code you just say "build with r21" as the libnds that became available at the same time will be fixed.

<br/>
<br/>
the links i was writing about are the ones under "cathegories" on the left hand side of the page. most of them *seem* to link to the same page.
<br/>
<br/>
maybe you should make either completely separate pages or links like devkitARM/libnds.
<br/>
<br/>
also, in order to clarify things, the menu in question could have more of a tree structure, with all the kits under devkit pro and all the libs under libs or something.
<br/>
<br/>
hope i'm clear enough about that i mean. ;^)

<br/>
ps: thanks for another toolchain release!!!! :^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
