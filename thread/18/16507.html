    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know how often this topic comes up, if at all. I've looked around here and search google a lot and found no answer to my problem and hope someone can help me out.

What I do.</span>
<br/>
I download devkitpro from devkitpro of course for windows and run the automatic installer. (This is about the 3rd time I've reinstalled it thinking something was wrong) I go to examples/nds/templates and copy the default arm9 folder to c:\ and compile with the make command in DOS. It compiles fine with no errors. 
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br/>
Problem.</span>
<br/>
I then try to run it in dualis and desemu and it crashes both emulators.
<br/>
It should be a simple hello world, I've checked the code it in it etc but I cant figure out why emulators crash regardless of what I code. Everything compiles with no errors as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I doing something wrong? A while back when I first learned about all of this I remember getting everything to work fine but it seems like somethings changed or I'm missing a step. I would really appreciate any help you can give.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IMO, if a simple "Hello world", or the default template projects fail to run in your favorite emulators, there is something fishy about these emulators. If I were you, I'd stick to no$gba... or, even better, to hardware.

But the templates shouldn't be it. Unless you are using a veeeery old version of it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">have you tried compiling it from within programmer's notepad. the "template.pnproj" file should open in programmer's notepad in windows. then do "Alt-1" to compile (or make on the tools menu).
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what you mean by "DOS". You should use the "MSys" link that the installer puts on the start menu under devkitPro.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats odd, I don't recall that emulator having any problems. I'm finally home and tried it out on my DS and in No$GBA and it worked in both of them. I had at first tried what elhobbs had said and compiled through mysys but I tried it again compiling just from file/run/cmd and it worked the same. Thanks for the quick responses, I can finally stop raging at compiling and begin to rage trying to figure out how this is programmed. I used this before and will probably start there again because it was the easiest guide to follow <a href="http://www.dev-scene.com/NDS/Tutorials" target="_blank">http://www.dev-scene.com/NDS/Tutorials</a> but he stopped writing it when he got to sprites QQ. Maybe the other guides will make more sense after I read through this one once more. It's just up to me now to read read and read some more, maybe look at some open source programs as examples.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you haven't found it yet, GBAtek is an amazing doc that lays out the specifications for the GBA/DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can wrap your head around flipping bits and testing bits and such, then you'll get a LOT of mileage out of GBAtek.
<br/>
<br/>
It lays out every memory location and what it does, among other things.  A little research and playing around will make the more difficult things, like animated sprites or parallax scrolling, seem simple.  And it's more rewarding when you find all the appropriate bits to flag and stuff to make things happen. :)  More so than using tutorial code...I feel dirty using tutorial code.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention, knowing how the hardware works will help you much more, in the long run, than using a premade library. :)  Not that I'm against using libraries( &lt;3 PAlib ) , but knowing what each function is actually doing makes for a smoother process on debuggin when problems occur.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi,i had the same problem with no$gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Delete all ini files and temp files from no$gba.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it helps</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
