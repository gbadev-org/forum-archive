    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since DS now has a bios so to speak, perhaps Nintendo can upgrade it, say like going to a store and using the wireless download feature to update your bios or geting a cart that updates the bios. I mean since the DS was so rushed maybe they could add some of the things they wanted(and we wanted, like making picochat even better). Assuming the DS has flash BIOS, which it probaly doesn't...........here's hoping it does :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Possibly. I don't see it happening anytime soon. Maybe after the initial first generation of DS units have been sold, Nintendo might decide on making improvements. Perhaps if an online system were created, that would be a valid reason to update the BIOS, as you could search the network without having to have a specific game (like how PS2 online is setup as opposed to Xbox Live 3.0).<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
