Does anyone else see the potential for the gba to aid or create new forms
<br/>
of LARP gaming? In case, some of you aren't reject enough to know LARP stands for live action role playing which is currently mostly played similiarly to table top rpgs with more focus on acting and the occasional use of rock/paper/scissors or some variant to decide results of conflict. The UK has used cellphones in the past to create live action games (like hot potato or hide and seek style games). An unusual trend that has not been seen much within the US but with the introduction of the DS (even the psp though I do see an advantage with the DS and its touchscreen and multiboot) it seems these types of games could be created and explored even further then cellphones have so far done. This is definitely a path to consider as it would be a very different form of gaming to most gamers and given the abilities of the system could possibly even result in a title that is both similiar to a traditional title and utilizes elements of these new ideas.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Absolutely. There are all sorts of possibilities. In a traditional LARP the DS could be used to handle the rules mechanics that are often so difficult to manage. (i.e. to handle skill tests, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
It also suggests new forms of LARPing, with the theoretical ability to scan for other players even amid groups of non-players. 
<br/>
<br/>
As you say, there have been some interesting experiments in Europe with cell-phone enabled games. The challenge is to convince a large group of players to invest in DSes.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and actually programming the thing. ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, this would be <span style="font-style: italic">amazing</span> and one of the few good ideas I've heard for the DS' local multiplayer yet. No doubt someone is trying to ape it this very moment.

<br/>
Even if you just use the DS as a "laser-tag" style stats module for each character it still has enormous potential for storing boring stats and doing complicated value judgements.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
