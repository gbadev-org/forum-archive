    <h4>#37227 - arog - Wed Mar 09, 2005 2:51 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all.  I need some help here.  I am trying to start working on a set of tutorials similar to the ones I created for HAM (for the GBA).
<br/>

I just started working on this yesterday and I am having some issues getting it working myself, so if you could point me in the right direction, that would be awesome!
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, if someone feels like going through the actual Day 1 tutorial (Environment Setup) to see what I am missing or what is incorrect, I would appreciate it.
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/Day1/day1.php" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/Day1/day1.php</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I think I am doing something wrong or missing something with <span style="font-weight: bold">ndslib</span>.  When I try to compile Joat's NDS template project <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/ds_project_template.zip" target="_blank">http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/ds_project_template.zip</a>, it never works.  I edited CommonMakefile.in and added my paths to devkitarm and ndslib.  
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what happens right now when I <span style="font-weight: bold">make all</span>:
<br/>
C:\devkitarm\projects\template&gt;make all
<br/>
rm -rf arm9/arm9.bin
<br/>
rm -rf arm7/arm7.bin
<br/>
make -C arm7 -I /c/devkitarm/projects/template
<br/>
make[1]: Entering directory `/c/devkitarm/projects/template/arm7'
<br/>
mv: missing file argument
<br/>
Try `mv --help' for more information.
<br/>
make[2]: [all] Error 1 (ignored)
<br/>
arm-elf-g++.exe: ds_arm7.specs: No such file or directory
<br/>
make[2]: *** [/c/devkitarm/projects/template/arm7/arm7.elf] Error 1
<br/>
make[1]: *** [build] Error 2
<br/>
make[1]: Leaving directory `/c/devkitarm/projects/template/arm7'
<br/>
make: *** [all] Error 2

<br/>
TIA,

I think what you need to do is get the 'ctrls' package and extract the contents of it to the lib folder in devkitarm. You should end up putting the file like devkitarm/arm-elf/lib/ds_arm7.specs</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I stuck a cheezy install batch into the cvs a few days back which builds the libs and the start up code then copies the crt's linkscripts and specs files to devkitarm.  Before you run this you need to edit the first line in the batch to point to were you installed devkitarm (it is not enough for it to be in the path).
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatly you can go to the command prompt or shell, navigate to your ndslib directory, and type make then copy all the .o .ld and .specs files to C:\devkitARM\arm-elf\lib (or where ever you happen to have installed devkit).  
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure after installing devkit on you machine (and minsys if you are a windows user like me from <a href="http://www.devkit.tk" target="_blank">www.devkit.tk</a> ) make sure you set your path up so it knows where to find the new stuff.  
<br/>
<br/>
That aside, i spoke to WinterMute and he said he will be putting our startup files into the next release of devkitARM which should simplify things.
<br/>
<br/>
And day one of my tutor is up which does cover environment setup (although i think Aaron's is a bit better in that regaurd).  There is also an example 2D demo as well as a zip file of ndslib which i will try to keep up to date.

<br/>
<br/>
I know this is pretty simple to point out really but these points were not covered in the tutorial since it was assuming you used exactly the same paths. So it may   be worth adding them (just in case?). FYI: I'm running on XP SP2.

I agree with you.  I just wasn't sure what I should call the main directory so I never got around to doing it the "right" way.  I'll come up with something and update the tutorial later today.

Not only did it compile ok, but after I got home, I was able to write it to a GBA Cart, and run it using PassMe!  That's the part I didn't understand.  The output of the template.ds.gba doesn't work on the emulator, and the arm9.bin doesn't either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would love to agree with you, but the real "gods" are those who are figuring out how to hack the NDS, are writing the actual code/libraries I am writing about, and the NDS dev community in general for patiently putting up with my questions and offering tons of support.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I am in the process of rewriting the Day 1 tutorial to incorporate a <span style="font-weight: bold">ndsdev</span> parent directory as <span style="font-style: italic">wintermute</span> suggested.  It's taking me longer than I had hoped.

Okay, it's done and ready for testing.  The new structure looks like:

You shouldn't compare your achievements to others' but instead take pride in what you have personally done. Your work has proven to be helpful to several community members already and I am sure there are plenty of future DS homebrewers that will read it and learn.

Ugh.  Good call.  I missed that during the update.  Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the other problem, there are a couple of things you can try.
<br/>
1) Delete the ndslib directory.  Re-check it out from CVS.  Fix the Install.bat and try again.
<br/>
2) Try <span style="font-weight: bold">make clean</span> and then <span style="font-weight: bold">make</span> once again.  Post the entire error message if it fails again.

Also, I've seen at least a few people struggling to get their Linux box setup for NDS development so I'll put together a guide for that , too, at some point.  I know that <span style="font-weight: bold">dovoto</span> is working on ndslib right now, so I'll wait until the dust settles.
