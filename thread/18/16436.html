    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I used PAlib, I had my images, and then PAlib tiled them and outputted image.pal.bin image.map.bin image.tiles.bin image.info.bin (I don't care about info)
<br/>
<br/>
What I need is either someone to tell me how to convert a normal image with grit into tiled, with grit recognizing repeated tiles, PAGfx style, and outputting the files in that way, one per variable...
<br/>
<br/>
Or someone to tell me how to.... I need to convert normal images into tiled, and load them from FAT/EFS... they will have 512x512 to 1024x1024 sizes... so, I don't think a bmp style would fit...
<br/>
<br/>
All I get is grit to output me a single image.img.bin, which I don't know how to use in tiled mode... probably I even have the grit commands wrong...
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">grit title_up.png -w3 -gTFF00FF -gB16 -ftb
<br/>
grit title_back.png -w3 -gTFF00FF -gB16 -ftb
<br/>
pause</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Those are my grit.bat commands...
<br/>
<br/>
BG will be 256 colors, perhaps multilayers, with FF00FF transparent (Magenta)... but what I need is just the map, the pal, and the tile files... or how to get them from FAT/EFS
<br/>
<br/>
Does Grit detects repeated tiles without repeating them unnecesarily?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Emmanuel on Wed Feb 11, 2009 3:53 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

yeah, already got those, thanks, but, now I'm having issues mixing this with the fade to black you told me before... If I only fade, using the bmp bg, it works. If I set the tiled bg to a certain number, it looks good, but doesn't fade... if I set it to 0, it looks weird at the start, and the end, but the start fades...
<br/>
For example
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">int bg1 = bgInit(number, BgType_Text8bpp, BgSize_T_256x256, number,number);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
When number is:
<br/>
0: it looks similar, but, the first and last rows look weird, and the first does fade in and out, as supposed...
<br/>
1: it looks perfectly OK, but doesn't fade...
<br/>
2 and 3: Just a whole screen the color of the first pixel... 
<br/>
<br/>
i'm using mode 5 2d.... anyone got any idea of the cause? so I don't post all the code...
<br/>
<br/>
nvm, fixed... my code was a little messy at first...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
