I though some of you might find this interesting, found this while googling about.  There's some neat demos here from devvers I hadn't heard of yet, some that are japanese.  Like this one called voiceclock that consists of a display of the time and date that if you touch the screen it has this cute japanese gal saying the time and date (er, I think).  And also, a DS Notetaking app...something I myself was wanting.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, some interesting stuff. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
it started out as a way to keep my bookmarks organized
<br/>
then i realized no one had anything that complete online.
<br/>
so i posted it for all to see.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm trying to keep it up to date. but it can be labourious
<br/>
link-diving your way through the depths of internet forums :-)
<br/>
<br/>
if any one wants anything added or corrected
<br/>
drop a line to machinegnome23[at]gmail[dot]com
