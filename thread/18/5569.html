    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just updated my NDSLib from the CVS, and now I can't get anything to run :(...  On hardware (via PassMe), I get two white screens, and on Dualis, the emu crashes with an access violation trying to read address 0x01035000.  (I don't know if that address is significant at all, but it couldn't hurt to post it :D) Is anyone else having problems with the latest NDSLib?<br/>_________________<br/>Yep, it's a signature.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had trouble running on the new firmware with the latest loader.bin file it prepends to the output. Just replacing that with an older version fixed it. Things seemed to still run fine with the hardware passMe, which is less picky.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have the firmware update; I'm using the hardware PassMe.  Also, the boot code I use is the one in the template project.  I found a loader.bin file in ndslib, do I just concatenate it with my arm7 and arm9 binaries to get a .ds.gba file?

Sorry to sound like an idiot; I'm pretty new to the DS development :D<br/>_________________<br/>Yep, it's a signature.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
