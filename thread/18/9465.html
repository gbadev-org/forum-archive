It is bad english.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just curious to hear, is anyone else making plug-ins for MoonShell at the moment or planning to?
<br/>
<br/>
I hope some tallented coder will make some useful plug-ins in for MoonShell. Atm only Moonlight has released plug-ins for MoonShell.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on an AAC playback plugin for moonshell.  (There's a couple of legal issues to work through, as well as technical, alas).  Handy for the iTunes users...
<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem is that there's a lack of documentation (in english) [0], so when I'm done, I'll be writing up a guide to writing a plugin.  Which, hopefully, will be of use to someone or other.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also a few oddities with the plugins as-is.  For example, all the ones I looked at have a #include&lt;NDS.h&gt;.  Whereas my install of devKitPro has the relvent file called nds.h (lower case).  I suspect it's a file system case sensitivity issue - and the original author (on Windows, by the look of things), is using a case insensitive filesystem.
<br/>
<br/>
[0] I can't work out what character set the various docs in the plugin SDK are in - I'm assuming one of the Japanese ones, but I can't get my Mac nor Linux systems to display it correctly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In ancient ndslib, nds.h was called NDS.h. It was one of the first things that changed when WinterMute turned it into libnds. It might be a relic from that time, or perhaps Moonlight doesn't care about cross platform compatibility.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
