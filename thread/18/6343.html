    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pardon me if this is a horribly newbish question, but I had a question about the different methods of getting data into the Nintendo DS.  I know that right now, as there are no DS flash carts, data is usually loaded from a GBA flash cart via PassMe or FlashMe or WifiMe.  Well what's botheringMe is: How does the transfer rate of the GBA slot compares to the transfer rate on the DS cart slot, if such a thing is known?  I realize this is really a moot point since the DS slot is as of yet unusable, but I was just curious, for my own knowledge and to get a comparison idea in my head.  Incidentally- is it known yet what the maximum addressable space / maximum storage size of a DS card is?  I guess I'm trying to understand what we miss out on by not being able to access the DS card slot yet.  Thank you all in advance.<br/>_________________<br/>This post was spawned from an Undefined Error.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
