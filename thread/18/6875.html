Hell, you might even get wolf3d to run at an _ok_ speed until someone makes a native port ( though I did get it to compile I still have quite a few unknowns about ds hardware which will slow me down a bit ).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't mention that crap. It's a port of  "Alone in the dark 4", which is comparable only with Uwe Boll movies. It's simpy awful &amp; horrible. Real Alone in the dark was 1st (and maybe 2nd) part of series. Real Lovecraft  style horror game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tooks the words right out of my mouth ;)
<br/>
<br/>
"Eternal Darkness" has more in common with the first Alone in the Dark game then "Alone in the Dark 4" has.
<br/>
(allthough I wouldnt say #4 is as bad as Uwe's dren)
<br/>
<br/>
Alone in the Dark was a real turning point in games. Not many times you can trace a whole genra to a single tittle.
<br/>
The same team also made "Little Big Adventure", incidently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
