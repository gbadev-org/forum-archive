    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've seen many source examples that are using bin files (for there pictures)
<br/>
<br/>
i've working with gfx2gba to convert a bmp file to a raw.c / pal.c file. ,
<br/>
even with gfx2ds i created a .h file.
<br/>
i've seen there is a file that's named bmp2bin.exe, but no go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My question of all is : can someone could give me a short example how i can convert a bmp(background) to bin, so i can load this bin file as background on my ds?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thx, greetz</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To use bmp2bin for DS:
<br/>
<br/>
bmp2bin -d inputfile.bmp outputfile.bin
<br/>
<br/>
This will create the Bin.
<br/>
<br/>
You'd also be good to put it into a folder like "data".
<br/>
<br/>
Then, the Makefile has to be modified to transform the Bin into a .h...
<br/>
<br/>
Then in your code, you'd have something like:
<br/>
<br/>
#include "outputfile_bin.h"
<br/>
<br/>
(Note that the .bin was replaced with _bin and a .h was added)
<br/>
<br/>
This is how all of the other examples do it.  Check out Textured_Quad, it's a good example.
<br/>
<br/>
Simply do a compare of your make file (use WinMerge or UltraEdit or something) to compare the files and add what is necessary.
