    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all, I know next to nothing about Homebrew DS apps and have only recently began reading some. Mainly because I'm looking to either find and modify an existing app or create one for myself to simply study flashcards. 
<br/>
<br/>
Drilling chinese characters is getting redundant and I've amassed an awful amount of little flash cards haha 
<br/>
<br/>
I found an app called "DSLearnJ" that I'm going to start dissecting to see how it works, but i was hoping some seasoned homebrewers on here could point me in the right direction to a FAQ, How To, or possibly (more than likely) someone who has already made a flashcard app and preferably one that's editable. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
What exactly do you mean by flashcard application?
<br/>
<br/>
The single most informative document about NDS development I know, is the <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">gbatek</a>.
<br/>
There are also some tutorials out there, but this is the most valuable resource you can get, after aquireing initial programming knowledge, e.g. by looking at libnds' examples.
<br/>
<br/>
Have some fun. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Happy learning and have a nice day.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I've got a little open source demo on my web site that you may find interesting, too. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

By flashcard application I mean simply and application/game that would serve the same purpose as flashcards or flipcards. preferably with an erasable area to draw.
<br/>
<br/>
See I'm learning chinese, and the massive amount of flashcards I have lying around are becoming too many. So I figured it'd be convenient and helpful if there was a way I could get them all into my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly what i'm looking for:
