In order to port a game, what do you actually have to do?
<br/>
<br/>
I kind of just assume that you need to grab the source, and then re-code/replace the original hardware specific code with corresponding code for the device you're trying to port it to?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
obviously that's a simplistic view of it, but is that kind of the general gist of it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes that's pretty much the crux of it. But as you say, it's not as easy as it may sound :-)
<br/>
Things which may be an issue:
<br/>
- 256x192 is not a common screen size - you may have to move around hard-coded stuff (eg gui elements) to make it fit
<br/>
- most games don't support two screens - if you're going to integrate the dual-screen nature into the game, how are you going to retro fit this into the code?
<br/>
- the game you're porting may require more buttons than the DS has
<br/>
- CPU power (and FPU requirements)
<br/>
- memory usage
<br/>
- polygon limit
<br/>
- assumptions about the sound hardware
<br/>
- usage of APIs whose internals you're not familiar with (and so how will you replace these calls?)
<br/>
<br/>
this is all from my own personal experience btw. Any other porters got any juicy stuff worth mentioning?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think anyone can say it any better then you did, since porting is a code-dependent job and depends a lot on how the code is designed and what it uses.<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.
