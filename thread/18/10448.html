;) i think you got it wrong, he want's to know with which model editor (look at the other posts...) to work with. i can't imagine what other editor you might be thinking of ;p
<br/>
<br/>
personally i prefer cinema4d (i have version 6), but you'll have to buy it (though there is that free full version with a maximum render port size of 600x400 - shouldn't be a problem for nds ;D - i don't have any url, sorry).
<br/>
<br/>
then i export to .obj and depending on what i wan to do with the model i load it into ms3d (damn, another non free tool!) and export or modify it (or use the ms3d file with lith unwrap ;D - at least that's free - there is a newer version that is commercial, but it's got another name... i think unwrap3d or something).
<br/>
<br/>
you can write your own tools (exporters and stuff), but there are already some of them on the net. mostly for .md2 i think (someone said that before). maybe someone will make a ms3d im/exporter for display list models (or whatever), so everything will be simpler.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There'll be an exporter for Maya Win/OSX, as well as a viewer Win/OSX and the code to load and display the models on the DS... though it'll be a few weeks before the whole thing works smoothly as I'm currently moving and starting a new job :)
<br/>
<br/>
It'll allow you to save models with skeletal animation. You have one file for the model/rig and another one for the animation. That way you can save memory by using one walkcycle for all characters of the same type etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Right now the basic stuff like storing the model and the skeleton as well as displaying them is up and running, but I'm still looking into ways of converting and storing the textures etc.... I have to look into that stuff more before I continue as I'm not quite familiar with the texture format yet... but as soon as it gets interesting I'll open up a thread here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So heres goes:
<br/>
- What format does the DS store textures in internally? I'd like to prepare all the data so I don't have to do any conversions on the DS. Also, what texture format would you say is the fastest one in terms of drawing? (Are all textures paletted?)
<br/>
- As I understand it main memory and texture memory are two seperate things? If so, how much texture memory is there?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm familiar with OpenGL, but this is my first bigger NDS app... so are there any things that I should be aware of as they're different?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<a class="postlink" href="http://dualis.1emulation.com/dsti.html#lcdioteximgparam" target="_blank">http://dualis.1emulation.com/dsti.html#lcdioteximgparam</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at TEXIMG_PARAM. That's the format you use in your display list. I'd just store a u32 with bits 16-31, and or it with the address when you load the texture.
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see in the data under, some textures are paletted, some are not. The compressed texture format is kinda wierd, don't worry about that for now. You'll just need to store data and palette, and the TEXIMG_PARAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Afaik, all textures are equally fast. The smaller ones would load faster, I presume. It's not really hard to support all texture formats.
<br/>
<br/>
2.
<br/>
You can map the VRAM banks as texture mem. I'm not 100% sure how this works, you'll have to experiment.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I personally wouldn't use a lot of the DS's OpenGL implemention. Imho, it abstracts you away from the hardware, and makes it harder to do things that really are possible.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not familiar with the Blender API (it's python, right?), but someone who is should be able to write an exporter pretty fast, as the format is rather straight forward...
<br/>
<br/>
But regardless of the exporters, the viewer and loader would always work. So if there's someone here familiar with the Blender API he'd only have to write the exporter itself...

A shame... Not all people can afford Maya. Hopefully there is some Python hacker around here. Also, is there animation support in your format. That's almost a must-have, really.
<br/>
<br/>

How about integration with separate physics libraries? How do other 3d libraries handle this?<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know, yet on the other hand Maya is a very widespread tool for animation and with the move to that platform you also make it interesting for the more professional animators.
<br/>
<br/>
I really don't mean to say anything bad about Blender; but looking at the audience you'll find that Maya has the more professional user base...
<br/>
So having an exporter for both packages would be very nice imho.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it features sekeletal animation. As posted in another thread, theres DSM files, which store the model and sekeleton data and then theres DSA, which stores animation data.
<br/>
That way you can use one animation for multiple characters, blend between animations and so forth.
<br/>
<br/>
Talking about physics: As the format is joint based you could use it for ragdoll physics or procedural animation.
<br/>
<br/>
Imho it's a rather flexible format that takes up very little memory, but of course I'm interested in what you think about the concept.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">here's my suggestions on what kind of functions I think would be useful.
<br/>
<br/>
global funcs
<br/>
init3d() 
<br/>
setViewpoint(x,y,z,xrot,yrot,zrot,FOV) 
<br/>
update3dobjs()
<br/>
<br/>
class Object3d
<br/>
load(model_data)
<br/>
setVisible(true/false)
<br/>
setPos(x,y,z)
<br/>
setRot(x,y,z)
<br/>
setScale(x,y,z)
<br/>
isCollidedBBox(object3d) // only checks bounding obx
<br/>
isCollidedPoly(object3d) // checks if any polys are touching
<br/>
gotoAnimFrame(int frame)
<br/>
playAnim()
<br/>
stopAnim()
<br/>
<br/>
and perhaps a few primititves as well:
<br/>
cube, sphere, cylindar, pyramid, cone, torus, teapot
<br/>
That all extend object3d, except you don't need to call load(), they already have built in model data representing the simple primitive. This way we can mock up 3d games without having built all the 3d models yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Question about scenery (level geometry, like floors and walls) , can you load the whole thing just like a regular model, or does it need to be handled differently? if so, may need an additional class for this:
<br/>
<br/>
world3d extends object3d
<br/>
loadWorldData(world_data)
<br/>
// anything else needed here?
<br/>
<br/>
----
<br/>
<br/>
honestly, the above functions, plus an easy way to get model data out of a standard 3d format (ideally a commandline converter app which reads in a standard 3d format, which blender, maya, 3ds max, etc can all save to)
<br/>
and these are all you'd really need in order to start seeing a lot more people make 3d homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your interface looks really nice. Perhaps collision detection is better in another library? I don't know how well existing physics libs translate to the DS, they probably use tons of floating point math. Would a typedef to a fixed class fix the problem, or is a major rewrite required?

<br/>
Either way would probably be fine, if it's not automatic in the library, it's trivial for me to just make my own updateAll() func which just loops through all my object3d's (which i store in a vector or somesuch) and calls update on each one.
<br/>
<br/>
If i can know the x,y,z,width,height,and depth, I can very easily do bounding box collision detection, so this doesn't necessarily need to be in the library.
<br/>
<br/>
It's just the per-polygon detection which I would need to know more about how the 3d works internally in order to calculate, and that seemed good to include into the library. Thus I just put the other func in with this one</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I initially wanted to support soft skinning, but it'll have to wait as I'm currently trying to get a basic format working. It's planned flexible enough that features like this can be added later on though.
<br/>
So right now it's rigind bindings only as they're a lot faster to solve.
<br/>
<br/>
Concering MD2 models:
<br/>
The central problem with formats like MD2 is, that they store the whole mesh for each keyframe. On the one hand, this makes solving the vertex positions for any given time rather easy as you dont have any hierarchies and so forth, but on the other hand it takes up a whole lot of memory, is totally unflexible (you cant change the position of a limb with code; so no ragdool, procedural animation and so forth) and forces animators into creating as little keyframes as possible.
<br/>
Thats why i strongly favour skeletal based approaches. They're a tad slower most times but give you more flexibility, save a huge amount of memory and will give you more sophisticated animations most of the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you mean in the sense that you can just physically simulate cloth and then bake it to vertex transformations, then yes, that's something that MD2 is better at.
<br/>
On the other hand, phsical simulations are hardly ever loopable, and getting enough keyframes for a convincing movement would mean storing such a great number of keyframes that there's hardly anything left besides it.
<br/>
Skeletal animation would offer you to use a number of bones on the most relevant positions of the cloth object and let your animator control them directly. Or, alternatively, you could physically simulate the movement of the bones and export that.
<br/>
<br/>
Though, to be honest; if you really want physically simulated cloth I'd propably suggest really solving the physics on the DS. If the object doesnt have too much vertices it should be possible to pull it off without too much of a slowdown...
<br/>
<br/>
Say you have the user controlling a character, then the cloth should (for a realistic result) be influenced by things like a sudden change in direction. This is not the case with precached simulation data.
<br/>
So in that sense I'd say the most effective approach would be to create a number of bones in the cloth object and then solve the position of the joints using a physical simulation on the DS. That way, you only need to integrate the physics for a very small number of points (you could propably even fake it in most cases) and still get a good approximation...
<br/>
<br/>
or at least thats my opinion :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Check out what kind of loading-procedure the example follows (like load vertex XYZ then load texco UV) and write an exporter for your favorite 3d modelling application to export to that format (vertex XYZ texo UV).

I think toon shading just uses a lookup table to determine the shade and it indexes into that table using the red component of the lit pixel....this is from memory of a while back though.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm actually working on a texture converter, it's necessary to get all the tools and file formats sorted out before we start making them easy to use (I'm not entirely sure who 'we' are yet, though).
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/Tools:_Blender" target="_blank">Ogre</a> uses Blender with some export scripts to get its data, I figured we could do the same. Any Python guru's out there? Take a look at BlenderExport and BlenderSceneExporter, together with a texture converter that should be all we need to get nice 3d on the DS with free tools.
<br/>
<br/>
THEN we'll be able to make a nice lib :P<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah nice, But I still think that a FBX =&gt; DS importer would better.
<br/>
Because FBX is an universal Format and it's supported by all the professional 3d package. it supports Uv coordinates, skinning(with influences) and bone animation... For me is too hard to make someting so difficult because i'm a newbie in programming (But I'm enough expert in 3d graphic).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Is it supported by the free 3d packages as well? I think most people in DS homebrew are not going to pay $100s for a 3d tool just to make a homebrew 3d game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While I do agree that a converter from a specific file format would be better, as it would allow you to choose any modeling software without writing an exporter for every one, I'm a little worried about level designing, placing models and spawn points and barrels and design a level. Apperently Blender has some support of this, as Ogre uses it. Is there any widely used file format that does this?<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
