    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
I tried to get textured cube and quad from Dovoto site working, but I get black screen on my NDS :(, but it works on IdeaS
<br/>
<br/>
I made tool, which converts image to array of uint16 (used in my ConceptBall demo), but placing there my 128x128 texture makes only black screen.
<br/>
<br/>
So here is my question - how to get it working?
<br/>
<br/>
I will be grateful if someone will show me working something textured in 3D sample (with source).
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While testing my example set against r14 last night i noticed textured quad was broken.  I ended up rewritting from scratch as i could not locate the error.  It now works and has been updated in the ndslib cvs along with a few GL corrections and added Micropohne code.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am about to reorganize the examples and build them against the libnds distrabution.  I will probably not release them in zip form untill I get around to that.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
