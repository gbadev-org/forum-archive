    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Im making a 2d game to start with, probably a side scroller, like turrican or r-type from the amiga hopefully. I know its gonna be a bit of work, but i have a lot of time to do it over the next couple of months.
<br/>
<br/>
To start with, what modes are recommended for this sort of thing?
<br/>
Would mode_5_3d work, with an extended rotation scrolling background? or is that a bad idea? The reason i say 3d, is i was thinking of making a textured sphere for explosions, having the text layer for the player and enemy sprites, and then the extended rotation for the background.
<br/>
<br/>
Im not entirely sure if im getting this right, so im just looking for some advice.
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Im starting to get the hang of some things, i am doing chris double's tutorials and i've been reading these forums for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
Any advice on the above issue, or how any of you started out would be appreciated. thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
