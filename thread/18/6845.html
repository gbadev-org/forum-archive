I found 'em randomly while looking for stuff for tablet PCs.
<br/>
It's pretty neat, and I can definately see it being used on the touch screen while playing some multiplayer game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks like a very interesting method. One of the shells on GP32 used a similar system for text input and it was actually prety fast. Since the DS has 2 screens, it seems more obvious to just have a full virtual keyboard but this idea could work. This would be something useful to intergrate into a shell, it might be too confusing for in-game typing.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it's novel, and it's useful, and it's not obvious, then it's probably off-limits for 20 years.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I downloaded the MessagEase, and it's quite nice. I tried it out and it's pretty fast once you learn where everything is, however I'm using a mouse so it's not as fast as it could be. I would LOVE to see this as an input method on the DS. At least there'd be some alternative to the QWERTY.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been using MessagEase for quite a few months on my Pocket PC and then on my tablet pc. It is is a powerful, yet easy to learn system that requires a very small footprint. I see it ideal for full text entry when the space is limited. Since they support so many different platforms, it should be quite easy to port it to GB environment.
<br/>
<br/>
Their downloads are mostly free (at least for the first two months!). They have versions for Palms, Pocket PCs and Windows. <a href="http://www.exideas.com" target="_blank">www.exideas.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Any developer here wants to tackly this and create a version for GB?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a matter of fact, I'm in the middle of writing a simple demo of it for the DS. Kinda stuck on accurate pen input, though. I keep getting erroneous readings for when the pen is released and when it's pressed, resulting in inaccurate square selections and directions. I have plenty of ideas on how to fix it, though.<br/>_________________<br/>--Captain Soup</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
