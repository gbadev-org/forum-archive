    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry for being a bit off-topic, but once we reach the point that we can capture those booth game data ourselves...
<br/>
Would it be illegal to back it up to play it any time?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't see why it wouldn't be illegal, assuming you didn't distribute it... I mean, you could just not ever turn off your DS otherwise, and thus be able to play the demo whenever you wanted, so I don't see much of a difference of putting it on your computer... Other then some added flexability.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It just makes sense to place them there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Didn't Nintendo say we would also be able to download demo games via the Internet?  If they do that, a trick as simple as the PSP's WipeOut trick could let us easily get code onto our DS :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No

They said there would be downloadable demos from in-store kiosks, like there are in Japan. Not online.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
