But the problem then becomes keeping the antenna directed at the other DS, which makes using it a little ungainly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How do you figure?  So, having an antenna clipped to a desk (so that you can have a point to point connection with a friend, and still be able to move your DS around during play) is EQUAL to having a 300 ft cable running out your dorm room, down the hall, around the corner, etc?  Doesn't sound like it would defeat the purpose to me.  It doesn't sound Ideal to me either, but if you want to play over the standard 100 ft, you have to make sacrifices. (unless you use an amplifier)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  Actually, it sounds like it might be a great idea if you can point it out a window toward your buddy that lives 5 buildings down.  Or if you live in a house and can put the antenna on top of your house.
<br/>
<br/>
hsx:  No, it wouldn't drain the batteries any different.  You are not increasing its power output, just the way it transmitts the signal.  The current design is transmitting the signal in all directions, where a directional puts all power output in the direction you point it in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Uhh.. Ok..  since your comment was "...which would defeat the purpose of it being wireless."
<br/>
<br/>
You do understand that the REAL purpose of it being wireless is to be able to play multiplayer games, right?  And prior to the DS, if you wanted to play multiplayer games, what did you have to do?  Hundle around in a circule with a cable running from one unit to the other.  So, adding a cable to give you the ability to play a multiplayer game beyone the 100' range does not defeat any purpose at all.  It actually enhances the purpose, as the purpose is to play multiplayer games.
<br/>
<br/>
And, since your so kind to speak on Nintendo's behalf, if they didn't expect you to play multiplayer games, and be "stuck" to your living room, then why not 300' wireless?  Why not satelite wireless?  Or cellular?
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'm being retarded as the cost of implementing such technology would be costly and.. well.. down right stupid.  But, the point of the topic is to extend the distance of multiplayer games, and adding an external directional antenna would give that ability.
<br/>
<br/>
Would most people do it?  Probably not, but as I "EDIT"ed my previous post, I can see some really good reasons to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
*idea*: how easy would it be to make a wi-fi to modem relay program for a computer. think about this: a program picks up the packets sent by the DS via the wifi card, then it sends those packets over a modem to another computer that would then transmit them over the wifi there. you could have more than one DS on each end too. sure its kind of pointless doing it via modem, but do we as of now have the know-how to do it (modem or internet)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there such thing as an exteral amplifier that can amplify signals it receives at certain frequencies?
<br/>
<br/>
My idea would be something like this: let's say that you had a transmitter (or amplifier) that would receive all 2.4 GHz signals, convert them to a faster frquency (to reduce lag), send them to another transmitter that was about a mile away, and finally that receiving transmitter would convert the higher-frequency signals back into a compatible 2.4 GHz signal.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a picture illustrating what I mean:
<br/>
<a href="http://home.coastalnet.com/~evilsmithy/Towers%20Idea.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
And I suppose if the transmitter were "smart" enough, it could be programmed to discriminate among which 2.4 GHz signals to transmit via headers or some other means.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
hee hee "more per inch".  youre right but if i didn't know that ahead of time i would argue that sentence.
<br/>
<br/>
VLF transmissions send about 10 bytes/sec, because that's all they can send, and the higher VHF frequencies can send hundreds of megabytes/sec; this is what communications satellites use.  all electromagnetic frequencies (light, radio, gamma, delta) travel at the same speed, yes.  
<br/>
<br/>
imagine you're holding a pen, and that pen is writing to a strip of paper that is travelling at the speed of light.  when you touch the pen to paper, a mark is made that moves at the speed of light towards the recipient.  now imagine that the rate at which you can raise and lower the pen is restricted (this is the situation with VLF).  the paper still moves at the speed of light, but you can only change the pen position once a second.  at this rate it will take 8 seconds to send a single ASCII character.
<br/>
<br/>
now imagine you can move the pen up and down 1,000,000 times a second.  now you can send a megabyte (more or less, mebibyte to be specific) per second.  the rate at which you can change the pen position is called the carrier.  you can't move faster than the carrier, or your signal is lost.  
<br/>
<br/>
low frequencies carry through rock and even the planet earth, but higher frequencies dont' go through anything, so there's a tradeoff.  VLF is used by the Navy to send messages to submarines.  there is a single transmitter and it can send data to any sub anywhere on the earth because of the way VLF works, but that data is sent very slowly.  communications satellites (like directv for example) can send very large amounts of data to your dish very quickly, but goofy things like rain can totally block the signal.  such is the nature of electromagnetic communication.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm tired.  this is kinda off topic but it should help anyone wanting to understand radio a bit better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In what way, though? If it can read it (regardless of if it can't arbitrarily "understand" it), then it can repeat it. So, in what way cannot it not be "understood"?
