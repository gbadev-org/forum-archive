Seems to be a texture problem, as colored faces are well drawn. But texture faces are all white.
<br/>
Did someone have the same problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">devkitpro doesn't have version numbers, just "releases". but those really aren't version numbers, either.
<br/>
<br/>
besides that, check the libnds code for glEnable. you should find a GL_TEXTURE_2D somewhere. else you'll have to enable it manually.
<br/>
<br/>
all in all that's strange: i often hear ppl saying they *can't* disable textures. though, i'm currently not up to date with the libs. plus, i'm using modified version of some gl-functions (to be able to disable stuff that libnds wouldn't allow me to, just like textures).

EDIT: i'm a moron. overlooked the last post. sorry. well, at least there's the version number thing. ;^p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
