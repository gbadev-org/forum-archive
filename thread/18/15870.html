    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know why this works fine:
<br/>
<br/>
unsigned int *splashTiles=new unsigned int[3632];
<br/>
FILE *file=fopen(path,"rb");
<br/>
fread(splashTiles,4,3632,file);
<br/>
fclose(file);
<br/>
<br/>
While this crashes inside of fread on two emulators and hardware:
<br/>
<br/>
unsigned int splashTiles[3632];
<br/>
FILE *file=fopen(path,"rb");
<br/>
fread(splashTiles,4,3632,file);
<br/>
fclose(file);
<br/>
<br/>
I even tried pulling it out of my code and isolating it to make sure there wasn't some other memory issue going on.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is the stack that big?  I bet that allocating 14.5k off the stack is never a good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Usually the stack is put into DTCM, which is 16k in size.  I bet libfat would use up to 1k of stack before it returns.
<br/>
<br/>
When you use new or malloc, you allocate from the heap.  The heap is in the 4MB main memory, located right after the end of your NDS program.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That makes sense.  I was planning on using dynamic allocation anyway and had just tried the other as a quick test to see if I had the graphics file formatted correctly and was curious why it was failing.
