    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a question.. since the .12 matrices handled by the DS lose precision the more you transform them...  is there a fast way to renormalize them and reorthogonalize them? (assuming the 3x3 matrix is only for rotation, not scaling) so I can keep using them instead of constantly recreatig them? I dont mean so much with the DS hardware, but mathematically speaking (so i can retrieve the matrix and fix it after a few tranformations)

thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All my games recreate them as needed.  Renormalizing is slower than recreating from Euler angles, axis/angle pairs, or quaternions.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, using Euler angles as source data has worked well in almost all circumstances, and matrices are the "compiled" form of that source data.
<br/>
<br/>
Caching the 3x3 part of 4x3 matrices helps a lot for objects that aren't constantly rotating.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
