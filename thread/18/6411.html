    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I've flashed my DS with FlashMe but now I'm trying to figure out what it does. I saw that holding A+B+X+Y forces it to boot. Boot what? How does it act differently than a regular boot? It says that you can somehow use gamecode "PASS" or title "DSBooter" on the GBA cartridge. What does that even mean? Do you rename the rom "DSBooster"? 
<br/>
<br/>
I can find several threads or webpages talking about how to flash a DS, but nothing explains what it does beyond fading in the backlight and removing the health warning.
<br/>
<br/>
I have flashed my GBAMP and have WifiMe running fine, what exactly did I accomplish by flashing my DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Edit: Ok then.. Well, basicly (how do you write it?) FlashMe is some sort of build in PassMe. It is a firmware that allows us to run homebrew ds code from the gba port, without the use of a PassMe device. AFAIK it works almost the same. The newest FlashMe's allow us to multiboot homebrew roms (&lt;4mb) without the correct rsa key (aka Nintendo's key). And one other neat feature: it disables the health warning screen before booting. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's a bit late, seeing I have already typed all this, but in a other nds subboard there is a thread dedicated to FlashMe (IIRC)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Mr Snowflake on Tue Jul 26, 2005 3:43 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

LOL! Thanks. But that still doesn't help me figure this out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I flashed my DS because it meant I wouldn't need to use the Wi-Fi system anymore. I assume it also means you no longer need to use a PassMe. It speeds up the whole routine of copying and then running demos/projects  on the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gamecode goes into the ROM image.  Only of use if you are a developer.
<br/>
If there is nothing inside the rom image to identify it as a passme gba file, then you can hold ABXY to force it to run the gba cartridge in DS mode anyways.  Should never be needed for properly built roms.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
