    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't use my homebrew without wifi, so it's kind of a pain in the ass for testing :
<br/>
- Compiling... 
<br/>
- Take Supercard off...
<br/>
- Take micro sd off...
<br/>
- Plug Micro-SD on computer... Click on the various Windows 7 messages
<br/>
- Copy nds file...
<br/>
- Take Micro SD off, plug it back to the Supercard, plug the supercard on the DS
<br/>
- Start 3DS (super slow)
<br/>
- Start homebrew
<br/>
- Wait for wifi to connect
<br/>
- Realise you forgot ++i; in a loop
<br/>
- Le Fu
<br/>
- Going back to step one
<br/>
<br/>
So, all in all, it takes roughly 30 seconds each time I want to test the homebrew. I've got the wifi version of DeSmuME but couldn't get it to work with my homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why are you talking about 2d and 3d ? I want wifi emulation</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I assumed you were using dswifi - which has a socket implementation which is portable - mostly. the main obstacle to compiling your code for windows would be the 2d hardware specific code - which you would need to abstract. if you could compile for windows then you could find all of the "++i;" business in a much easier environment.
<br/>
<br/>
now if your project is to rewrite the dswifi library, then you are out of luck.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I also forgot to mention that wifi emulation in desmume does not work so well - work in progress I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
you mean compiling the homebrew as a windows executable ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it would be worth it...
<br/>
Another solution for me would be DSerial emulation :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

does it have a link with the DSLink flashcart ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no - it is just an nds file - a wifi bootloader. it would save swapping cards though.
<br/>
<br/>
I always go back to swapping cards when I need to test on the ds. it is annoying, but it is the most straight forward for launching something on a ds. fat access is so slow in emulators. I can have the card updated and back in and running faster than the emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
debugging in windows is well worth the effort though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
