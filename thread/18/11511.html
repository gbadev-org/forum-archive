    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For the many homebrew using the fatlib this is an obvious NO, but I am wondering for everyone else.. Do you make it a conscious goal to make your homebrew work with emulators?
<br/>
<br/>
I originally didn't give it any thought, but lately I have been going a little more out of my way to try and keep at least no$gba and my game in sync. Originally I planned to use fatlib for loading resources, but have been delaying it so that I can have the quick dev cycle that no$gba offers..
<br/>
<br/>
But now I am starting to wonder if maybe it might be worth it to ensure it works with at least no$gba so that when I pass it out online people without homebrew hardware can still enjoy it.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if you have no way of testing on hardware (like me right now), you'd hope that your work will work on an emulator, or at least one that supports the features you're trying to pull off.
<br/>
<br/>
For me, as long as it works on the more accurate emulator(s), I'm happy.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my project is a sprite editor, so i'm pretty much stuck if i can't use FAT lib (i.e. i <span style="font-style: italic">need</span> to load/save data, that's not just for the purpose of optimizing RAM usage or whatsoever). 
<br/>
<br/>
Though it's rare that i cannot solve bugs in the emulator, so i tend to use the emulator (DesMuME) a lot until the release is "stable" enough to try it on bare hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
And true, the fact there was no CF/SD device stopped me for a while, but then i hacked a bit the FAT library so that it checks CF devices first and then SD devices (which are damn too slow to try on the emulator and too poorly understood by me anyway), and hacked the emulator so that it now has a SC/CF storage device in an image file.
<br/>
<br/>
I can post the sources if anyone is interrested, though there's no actual write support (read as: your device is read-only in the emulator).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use the emulators (No$gba, Dualis, DeSMuMe) to test out the visuals and whenever I'm ready to build for hardware, I just uncomment the emu-breaking stuff. 
<br/>
For my software, it is impossible (not even just because of fatlib) to target emulators.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do not use emulators to test my creations.
<br/>
I tried to find one for AmplituDS when I just I just started coding it, but n emulator could handle it.
<br/>
I know emulators are way more mature now, but with all the music and sound features on ARM7 in AmplituDS, I doubt there's an emulator which can handle the latest release.
<br/>
But hey, releases need to be tested on real hardware anyway, so I'm actually okay with it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Dark Knight ez on Mon Oct 23, 2006 6:49 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use emulators for most of my development, then check on hardware before releasing usually.
<br/>
<br/>
Dualis and Desumeme have fatlib support, Desumeme will work with libfat, No$gba and ideas can work with fatlib if you enable FSCR images and create one.
<br/>
<br/>
I even maintain an older dslinux source tree that works in Ideas so I can code for dslinux and then move my code to new tree branch for testing on hardware later.
