<br/>
<br/>
Looks like I found an '.nds' files which uses R4DS I/O interface to trash sectors on SD card.
<br/>
Is there any way to disable I/O interface in R4DS?
<br/>
<br/>
More important thing, I'm looking for ARM disassembler. I would like to check if there is access to I/O control registers.

Not really, because there are a multitude of devices that they can use other than the R4.  It may even be a good idea for the homebrew community to distance themselves from the R4 as it seems to be Nintendo's number 1 target at the moment.

NDS malware already exists (I think darkfader made a bricking program ages ago).  The point is that malware programs get identified pretty quickly thus the distribution of them gets cut short.  Besides, if you wanted to make a malware program, you'd probably not bother using something as specific as a bug in the R4 firmware to do it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Based on the age of the games in that list, it looks like a bug in newer R4 firmware. It would have shown up earlier if earlier versions were affected and I sorta doubt anyone would bother suddenly inserting trojans into games that old. Anyway it's easy to work out if you can compare md5sums.
<br/>
<br/>
Developers aren't doing this on purpose. It just wouldn't pass Nintendo's quality control. "Intentionally destroys users' data" wouldn't be acceptable. It's a liability risk, and probably indictable to boot. Even without that Nintendo does nothing if not enforce their concept of quality. Somehow I don't think this kind of shenanigans would be exempt from that.

True, but  the sometimes overzealous anti-piracy bent on this forum is out of self-preservation.  The last think we want to do is give Nintendo any reason to try/succeed in shutting us down.  The more we talk about piracy, the more Nintendo would want to shut us down.  And the more ammo they would have if they tried.  (Although really, the only ammo they would really need is a team of lawyers and a big enough pocketbook).

Out of that list, my <span style="font-style: italic">personal</span> preference would be the Acekard RPG (not 2), as it's got both 1GB of nand and a microSD slot.  Also it has/had an open source firmware, so you could theoretically create a firmware that disallows booting commercial games.  They've closed the source on the newer Acekards.

I think the idea is that rather than having "You are playing a pirate game" pop up, the game silently trashes the users data to try and dissuade the user from pirating stuff.  It's much more likely that it's just a bug and completely unintentional.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Ungibber gibberish
<br/>
EDIT2: Also I've heard (through the grapevine) that even official Nintendo developers use R4's as the official kit can only hold one game at a time.  This would mean they would be familiar with the R4.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This goes along with how your rate breaking the law (yes, it's a moral issue).  Is it OK for you to steal $50 from a friend?  What about your father? What about a stranger?  How about a corporation?  
<br/>
<br/>
Stealing is stealing, each person takes it as they will.  If someone is a common thief, they don't think much of stealing from anyone.

True, stealing is stealing. But stealing is not necessarily infringement of copyright, nor vice versa. Otherwise, we wouldn't need separate statutes for the two offenses. Should <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_%28basketball%29" target="_blank">intercepting a pass</a> in basketball be a crime?

<br/>
And am I "stealing" from Nintendo when I develop software for its hardware without paying for a devkit, dedicated office space, and an ESRB rating?

Uhh, this is an example of the kind of ignorance I'm talking about. That comment I made was to point out the short-circuit of logic that equates "relevance to piracy" in the subject to actual support or involvement of piracy. I wasn't advocating piracy even a little, but now I get a lecture from you on morals for my trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to point out that this issue doesn't have to involve itself in piracy, but you're too busy repeating the piracy-is-evil mantra to pay attention.
<br/>
<br/>
And as tepples points out, copyright infringement and theft are two different things, despite what the media moguls tell you. Frankly, there are far more and far better reasons for stealing $50 from virtually anyone than stealing or pirating a game with an MSRP of $50.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I predict a fork/lock/argument. In short, there's no comparison between (a)<span style="font-weight: bold">taking</span> $10 the bank account of a coorporation and (b) listening to their songs on your mp3 player. Simple example: if 1,000,000 people did then in case a they would be $10m down, but in case b they would not - indicating a clear difference between the two; hence my dislike for those types of <span style="font-weight: bold">poor</span> comparisons :)
<br/>
<br/>
It is much easier to say it is wrong by morals than [flawed] rationale. I used to download mp3's and movies; but I stopped on moral ground (not rationale). I now subscribe to music/film services and would suggest to many others to do the same. I didn't download to avoid the payment, I downloaded out of curiosity, often songs of people who were recommended to me - who I most certainly would not have ever for any possible reason have purchased (as I had not heard them). In the same way that people are happy to listen to a song on youtube, or record from their TV or radio (which violates copyright) ... which is why I don't turn my nose up at someone doing the same thing (but with an mp3). However I would suggest to most to get used to paying for what they use, and seeing it as an investment (mainly with software), or a subscription to their own culture (like a regular purchase of music, etc.).
<br/>
<br/>
Interesting question Tepples; you may not be stealing their copyright, but could it be said that you are stealing their thunder? Does your success rely on their success (yet subtracts theirs)? Does your brand identity subtract [unfairly] from their brand identity to build your own? Does your marketing rely on their marketing, and can you be found by searching for them (hence subtracting part the value of their own name)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except thunder is not property; the NOAA isn't that powerful yet.

<br/>
What you say reminds me of U.S. copyright law's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bitlaw.com/source/17usc/107.html" target="_blank">fair use factor</a> #4 (effect on the market). Once, I tried to steal Nintendo's thunder by rushing a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#drm" target="_blank">GBA port of Vitamins</a> to the Internet before Nintendo could get WarioWare (which had Dr. Wario to unlock) out the door. I got it playable before WarioWare came out, but that didn't stop sales of WarioWare nor of Nintendo's later Dr. Mario + Puzzle League Game Pak. Nor will <a class="postlink" href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/24/wii-tetris-homebrew-edition/" target="_blank">the proof-of-concept homebrew tetromino game for Wii</a> affect sales of Tetris Party.

The success of Heboris, Lockjaw, and Texmaster relies on what some hardcore gamers perceive as Tetris's <span style="font-style: italic">failures</span> since the changes made to the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tetrisconcept.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tetris_Guideline" target="_blank">Tetris Guideline</a> in 2001: slow sideways piece movement, <a class="postlink" href="http://infinitespin.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">infinite spin</a>, overly large rewards for counterintuitive moves such as the <a class="postlink" href="http://epictetris2.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">T-spin triple</a>, and a randomizer that makes it trivial to <a class="postlink" href="http://tetrispwned.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">play forever</a>. Tetris products tend to force these "features" on players; the freeware games let players turn them off.

No more unfairly than GNU subtracts from UNIX, in my opinion.

No, but N-Blox can. I search for <span style="font-weight: bold">tetris</span> on Google, and results 1 (www.freetetris.org), 2 (www.neave.com), 7 (www.echalk.co.uk), and 9 (kidrocket.org) are all N-Blox, not a Tetris product. The official Tetris site is number 3, and Lockjaw doesn't even show up. But Lockjaw does show up second for <span style="font-weight: bold">tetromino game</span>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
I never mentioned copyright.
<br/>
<br/>
If intercepting a pass in basketball was against the rules, and you did it, it would be a violation and you would pay the penalty.
<br/>
<br/>
Did you (or someone) PAY for your DS?  If not, yes.. you stole from Nintendo and whatever retailer you got it from.  and if you did in fact steal it, I wan my money back ;)
<br/>
<br/>
The rest of this is just trying to muddy the waters to the point even a moral person wouldn't be able to see.. but I'll take a few minutes and kick some dirt around with you just for fun.
<br/>
<br/>
What does a devkit, office space, or and ESRB rating have to do with anything?  You purchased hardware.  Now, if you were distributing your software under the deception that it was <span style="font-weight: bold">licensed by Nintendo</span>, then you would be stealing, as your list is what it takes to be allowed to say that.
<br/>
<br/>
I also understand the laws of ideas.  and again, haven't mentioned copyright.
<br/>
<br/>
If we want to ask more useless questions, how about these:
<br/>
<br/>
Am I stealing from SuperCard when I give their product a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=133" target="_blank">bad review</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
Am I stealing from all the other hardware manufactures when I give a competitors hardware a good review?
<br/>
<br/>
Is opening a retail store stealing from all the other retail stores?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it steeling when you use an electro-plating machine?

So, to get back on track, is it likely that manufacturers are deliberately causing corruption on the R4 or is it just coincidence?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally wasn't trying to "muddy the waters", but from Tepples post I can see he was talking more about "morally right/wrong" rather than legally right/wrong. You (Lynx) appeared (to me) to hold stronger views towards the legal aspect rather than the moral aspect (not to say you have no moral views, etc., hence my examples of actions with equal effect to what <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">legally the same as piracy</span></span> and examples of actions of different effect, such as the two examples of "stealing").
<br/>
<br/>
I also hate that analogy of "but it's stealing, and you wouldn't steal a car", etc. The two are terribly mismatched (as my examples show), yet everyone from programmers to music producers give such examples like they are equal ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
My point is clear, they are not matched in any way - hardly a below-the-belt pick, or "muddying the waters" ^_^ Is there a problem with what I said? Was it illogical? Do you disagree/agree with it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
At this point, I'm inclined to believe that the microSD card corruption has more to do with programming defects in the R4 system software.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Lynx, I guess I've successfully demonstrated that the word "stealing" itself muddies the waters. GNU.org has a list of words that muddy the waters, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Theft" target="_blank">which includes "theft"</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
