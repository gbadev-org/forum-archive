Being connected to the dev box over the network allows you to debug the code in realtime.

It appears to me this won't be the case for DS development; rather, 
<br/>
- build
<br/>
- copy xex to flashcart
<br/>
- run on DS and see what happens
<br/>
<br/>
Debugging must be relegated to printf debugging.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there alternatives to make the code, compile, deploy, debug test more like developing for the PC ( or a console ?)
<br/>
<br/>
At a minimum, are any of the DS emulators at a state that they can run basic DS software now?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure what the problem is, the DS is just as network capable as any console is (assuming you have a wireless network of course). You can certainly debug software over the network if you chose to do so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Eventually the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10933" target="_blank">DSFTP library</a> will let you copy and start code over the network, and the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10765" target="_blank">Reborn debugger</a> will let you debug DS code running on DS hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
