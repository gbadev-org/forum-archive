<span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS start-up: </span>
<br/>
<br/>
At first boot, there is a step by step guide menu that will lead you to configure your DS, asking you type in your nickname, time, date, birthday?etc. There is also an optional touch screen calibration if you feel that the touch is a bit out of whack. What can be a bit annoying when configuring the system in any way is that you have to reboot the system to able to save in memory. Not a big deal, but noticeable.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS Accessories:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS is now being sold worldwide for around 149.99$ US with a standard package that includes:
<br/>
<br/>
-	Nintendo DS (built-in ?Picto-chat?)
<br/>
-	AC Adapter
<br/>
-	Rechargeable Battery pack
<br/>
-	Thumb Strap/Hand strap
<br/>
-	Two stylus pens
<br/>
-	Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt Demo (playable)
<br/>
-	DS Booklet
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS hardware/software features: </span>
<br/>
<br/>
This device is packed with many features for a low price. 
<br/>
<br/>
DS incorporates a clamshell design good for protecting its screens from damage; it has dual black-lit 3 inch 256 x 192 resolution screens, the top one having a removable protective filter, and the bottom being coated with anti-scratch resistance because of its touch screen capability. The DS also has an embedded internal microphone for games that may use voice recognition and in the near future VoIP (voice over ip) as well has two big external speakers that support rich virtual surround sound. I don?t to mention it also has a headphone jack do I? 
<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, I noticed an additional port next to the GBA port which has now been confirmed by Nintendo will be used for connecting head-sets for future online games.
<br/>
<br/>
As for its networking capabilities, it?s pretty standard technology for these days. It has a built-in 802.11 wireless adapter that supports 2 types of protocols, one for LAN gaming, ?Nifi?, and the other ?Wifi? for online gaming. What makes NDS unique in this respect is "Download play" in which you can send other NDS'es with no game, the same game you have, so you guys can play multiplayer with each other. An ingenious feature that I admire a lot from Nintendo because it removes the hassle of trying to get a LAN game with your DS friends because they don?t have the game that you want to play. Most games support this feature on NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
Yet, the biggest feature I believe people will very much enjoy in the DS is its backwards compatibility with Gameboy Advanced games, which means DS already has a huge library of software to choose from. On the other hand, I am pretty much convinced if Nintendo hadn?t added the GBA port, I definitely think DS would be much thinner than it is now. Hypothetically, which do you think is more advantageous is up for you to decide, but Nintendo it seems decided already for us.
<br/>
<br/>
*Oh I forgot to mention that NDS also comes with built-in free LAN software called ?Picto-Chat? in which you are able to draw, type and play any kind of sketch game with other DS owners nearby and maybe even cheat at in-class exams ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS storage:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The DS cartridges are noticeably smaller than the GBA carts; they are roughly the same size as a standard SD media card used for devices such as Pocket PCs and digital cameras. Currently the standard storage space for these cartridges is about 1 gigabit which is around 128 megabytes. It has been said by Nintendo that this is not a restricted size and that these cards can store more than that if needed. Of course, that would increase price of manufacturing. I know a lot of people debate which type of format is good for the consumer, and I will properly lay them down for you in regards to the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://image.lik-sang.com/content/nintendo-ds/release/nds-release15.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Advantages:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
- The best part about these cartridges is that they have absolutely no load times!!! Game loading is non-existent. 
<br/>
- The second advantage of these cards being that you won?t need to go buy a memory card to save your games as these cartridges have built-in ram for your convenience.
<br/>
- They are tough, and when I mean tough, I mean dropping one in the laundry machine and come out perfectly fine and working with no problems. Don?t ask how this happened 
<br/>
- These cartridges are RSA secured, which pretty much means they will be hard to hack. 
<br/>
- No motor sounds or heat, since its solid state media while disc type media requires a motor to spin the disc so it can read data.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, with every technology there are some disadvantages. And there is only 1 with NDS cartridges.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Disadvantage:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
- The small capacity of data, compared to disc formats that can be stored on these cards because of manufacturing costs. This could hinder game experience if a developer needs more space for textures or sound.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS controls:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The NDS has a traditional digital 2d pad, four thumb buttons as well as two side shoulder buttons, pretty much the same design as an SNES game pad. But no one is buying the DS for its conventional controls. What about the touch screen??
<br/>
<br/>
Let?s first take a look at its comfort factor. No longer do your thumbs get soar from hard pressing buttons nor get hand cramps from long use. This is heaven for left-handed people since you obviously can use the stylus or your fingers with whichever hand you want to. Not to mention, that most if not all DS games have several methods of controlling your games if you go in most options menus.
<br/>
<br/>
 I can tell you that Nintendo was right about it, it?s incredibly easy to play games with a touch screen. I simply love it and can?t get enough of it. Hell, girls I know love to play with the touch screen cause no longer do you need to tell people who are inexperienced with gaming what button to press or what to do, because the touch seems so natural to anyone who handles a DS. I even read reviews of seniors and fathers buying a DS for them selves? cause of medical conditions in which the control barrier in conventional systems would dissuade them from playing or purchasing.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I must admit there is a thing that is lacking for the DS that has been tackled by Nintendo before its launch and that is an analog stick/nub. This was an annoying problem with the DS, especially for 3D adventure/platform games where Nintendo who pioneered this control technology evidently sold us the argument that you can?t play these games without a kickass analog stick. So how did Nintendo remedy this problem? By adding a thumb strap, which is a piece of accessory that comes with the NDS where you wrap it on your thumb and on the tip has shoe like piece of plastic in which you will use to touch the screen with. I can tell you that it?s definitely not as effective as an analog stick, but rest assured that it works and works pretty well. I finished Mario 64 DS with all 150 stars within a week without a hitch using the thumb strap. Yes it does take time to get use to it, but when you do, it?s pretty easy to control.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS Battery performance:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the only part that I can safely say that I have no grudges about. Nintendo estimates that the battery lasts around 8-10 hours per charge, and they weren?t kidding. It would be times when I play the DS during my commuting for a week without charging. With all its hardware capabilities, it is amazing that the battery can last this long. Recharging takes around 4 hours. Nintendo like always has created another efficient machine.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy playing games on the Nintendo DS. It has superb hardware capabilities as well as a new way of controlling games. Anyone who is thinking of getting one should get it for the right reason and that is a new gaming experience. There is no other console that will give you the same gaming experience than with Nintendo DS, not even Nintendo?s previous consoles. This machine is unique in almost all categories that I mentioned. It is a piece of equipment that I believe will once again standardize future handheld gaming. The only faults I see with the NDS are not having an analog stick, and its size. It?s quite big for a handheld but still fits in most jackets, it did for me. I hope you enjoyed reading this review, because I enjoyed writing it, and yes I know this review was overdue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here's a fault, the current software library is pitiful. I have to admit, I am a huge Nintendo fanboy, but I've been taking a pretty strong beating amongst my buddies after shilling for the DS since launch. Nintendo crapped the bad in terms of its 3rd party library. They also obviously faked early release dates and then "mysteriously" pushed them back by many months as soon as the DS shipped. 
<br/>
<br/>
I very badly want this device to be a champ, but everyone who passes me and sees my Japanese imported PSP ghasp. With my DS they just look confused and ask what it is. Then I show them Feel the Magic and they roll their eyes.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm waiting to see what Nintendo is going to do to recover from this. I am sure I'll get flamed for writing this, but anyone who has followed my blog and knows my ordeal of losing my first DS and having to buy a 2nd one on ebay knows I am not a troll. I am just starting to doubt this whole DS thing. I hope I am wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That would be your opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
And how can Nintendo push back the release dates, if it never gave release dates in the first place? 
<br/>
<br/>
The only source of these "pushed back" release dates are from retailers like EB and GameStop, which simply made up the release dates in the first place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I couldn't prove that though, obviously, so didn't bother requesting a new one even though they'd probably give me one.

<br/>
Also strangely and evily got a scratch on my bottom screen. Luckily not very deep, but it makes me really wish it was a replaceable cover.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree, the game lineup lately looks very lame. Hopefully it will pick up soon.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Question - I've been playing the Demo units of the DS whenever I can find a kiosk, and while I'm excited about it to an irrational level, I find two things that constantly disturb me:
<br/>
<br/>
1. The screen is always, ALWAYS absolutely scratched to hell, and
<br/>
2. The touch screen is either slightly or completely broken
<br/>
<br/>
I went by Target last night and was overjoyed when I found they had Warioware Touched set up, only to discover that the entire touch screen below the top thirty pixels would not respond. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the scratching, that could disturb the unnaturual love I plan to make with Castlevania DS when it hits in the Fall, as that game almost uses the bottom screen exclusively.  Are these two things rare incidences or have they been pretty frequent with everyone whose bought the system?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As said in another topic on this board, there are 3 kinds of touch screens or actually, how they appear.
<br/>
<br/>
The first has a fuzzy touch screen but is well protected. The top screen is much clearer than the bottom.
<br/>
<br/>
The second has sort of a clear touch screen but it is less resistent to scratches than the first. It doesn't seem to have much protection. Both the first and second kind of touch screens were available at launch.
<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the third kind of touch screen. It is clear but very resistent to scratches, probably because there is some coating placed on top of the screen. You can tell this screen from the second because if you look at an angle, you will see a grid of dots. Also, the touch screen sems to have buouyancy. You have to press on it a bit before it responds.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hate to say this here but after playing Need For Speed Underground Rivals on my Japanese import PSP I am having a hard time imagining the DS version catching my fancy.
<br/>
<br/>
That said I picked up Wario touch for my wife yesterday and I still agree that the whole touch stuff sets the DS apart. I doubt games like Advance Wars for DS (btw, why not call it DS Wars?) would be as much fun on the PSP w/o touch.
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, I hope things get better, its just that after having my way with so many good titles this week on PSP, I am just scratching my head as to why Nintendo peed the bed on 3rd party support at launch. I love em so I will always be buying Mario and Zelda games.. Oh well,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It's probably called "Advance Wars" on future North American systems because North Americans, who had never seen translations of the previous systems' iterations, think of it as "Advance Wars" not "$half_of_system_name Wars". The other day, I was talking with someone in the local mall who was selling Famiclones bundled with pirate multicarts. He wanted to know why he had never seen Zelda or Metroid on the multicarts, so I started explaining the mappers. When I got to MMC4, I needed to give an example, so I said "the original version of Advance Wars".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That is what we're talking about here after all, opinions. And while we're on the topic of opinions, let's look at Gamespot, which no doubt is the most conservative review site on the net. Rarely does it hand out gratuitous high scores ala IGN. How many games for the DS score 8 or above (out of 10) ?
<br/>
<br/>
One! After almost 4 1/2 months, only one game scores 8 or above and its Mario.
<br/>
<br/>
Look at the PSP right now, the system has not even launched yet the reviewed titles that have shipped (every one of which I own and have played) have a total of six games scoring over 8 and one scoring 9.
<br/>
<br/>
Look, its all a matter of opinion, but overwhelmingly the opinion is that the launch title quality is heavily being won by PSP, and the damned thing is not even out yet. Its embarrassing for Nintendo, in the way it was embarrassing that some clever dude had to release a frontlit screen mod for the GBA. Nintendo seems to be in love with the idea of underpowering their devices and their software and as a longtime loyal fan I am starting to become very tired of it.
<br/>
<br/>
To the fella that said everyone he had talked to didn't like Need for Speed on PSP, all I can say is if they don't like i ton PSP, they sure as hell won't like it on the DS (where the lack of an analog stick would make it even worse). I think its a very quality title, not as good as Whipeout which I just picked up today or even Ridge Racer.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope for the best. But I won't be blindly optimistic. It is not looking good at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hate to break it to you, but pretty much every reviewer (especially ones from the online sites you mentioned) is a casual-game loving troglodyte. 
<br/>
<br/>
Which is why games like GTA and Madden 200x get rave reviews, while unique and good games like Feel the Magic, Fable, and Yoshi's Touch and Go get low scores.
<br/>
<br/>
The game media, and indeed most of the gaming public is garbage. The day I base my opinions on them will be the day I put a .45 in my mouth.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, respected reviewers, like those at Famistu, which haven't been completely mauled by the "casual gamer" rave that has taken over gaming in the West since the dawn of the PlayStation tell a much different story about the caliber of the games on the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, most of the DS's lineup has gotten top honors in Japan, not pissed on like your "conservative review" site has done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From what I'm hearing it sounds like Nintendo is trying to sell a Japanese taste for games to a Western audience. At this point in time it appears to be failing. If you want to suggest that these current titles in the US are doing well in Japan, I will take your word for it, but respond by saying I wouldn't expect everyone in Japan to accept American or Western tastes, just as it would be foolish to try to feed everyone in the US sushi. It will be popular with some, but mostly it will not become a staple of our diet.
<br/>
<br/>
So while you poo poo the Western gaming audience, I am going to bring things back into focus and remind you that this is the market Nintendo chose to play in when releasing their Japanese styled software in the States. And again, at the moment, this market is rejecting their offerings pretty loudly.
<br/>
<br/>
And another thing, about this idea of a "casual gamer"? The casual gamer is going to be what keeps these systems afloat when dealing with the brutal competition. If you cannot please the casual gamer you will not be successful. Without that success, the supposedly non casual gamer (with Japanese tastes) such as yourselves, will have nothing to foot the bill for your esoteric and offbeat gaming interests.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know what you have been reading, but the DS has sold around 2 million in the US, and 600,000 in the first week on the market in Europe.

The issue we're discusisng is not so much the hardware. We have already established that the initial hardware sales were strong, and we also established (including a quote from a Nintendo VP) that the next several million units will be the "hard" part to sell.
<br/>
<br/>
So what we are talking about here is the failure of the initial software lineup in the US. This includes the general concensus from Western reviewers and critics, including consumers. Just take a look at the user reviews for these games. 
<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to next argue that the Western software lineup for the DS is strong and healthy? I mean even people in this thread have already conceded that at best it leaves a bit to be desired. So, where are you going with this? I keep seeing the staw man appearing in this threed, over and over again. 
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I am as much of a fan of big N as everyone else here. But the writing is on the wall and its not a happy proverb that I'm reading. If in the next 6-8 months we see a flurry of AAA titles being released I will be the first to jump for joy and eat my hat. Clearly that does not look likely at this point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
