I read that you can just assign which of the two screens are assigned main and sub screen, which is something I really need.. I need the framebuffer mode on the touchscreen.. how can I assign them?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot :)

You don't need the framebuffer mode on the touchscreen, as you could use a 16bit extended rotation background in mode 5 instead.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want to do that, then the ndslib macro you want is lcdSwap().</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
