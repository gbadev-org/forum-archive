    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all, my first post and I'm already asking for help!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently looking for a dedicated and talented programmer who would like to help develop a game for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've posted this early in development to give the project plenty of awareness.  Theres lots to be done art wise, so theres plenty of time before someone is needed. But getting an early start would be great, I know this will be a big job.
<br/>
<br/>
My plan is to port an existing engine over to the DS, i think it would be easier due to the existing level design and modeling tools.
<br/>
<br/>
Everything you want to know about it is available on the projects site.
<br/>
Please give plenty of feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou.

Well I can appreciate:
<br/>
1) You're straightforward. You need help, and you asked for it. You might want to put it in the Help Wanted board though.
<br/>
2) Your website's content shows you've put in a lot of thought about the game design. I can't tell you how much I actually want a game designer to actually dictate what game I should program right now. I wouldn't be surprised if you had a complete design doc just lying around.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I can't help you right off, but I can say:
<br/>
1) Once my team is done with our smaller project, we may be interested. Possibly very interested, in fact.
<br/>
2) You may not want to say "port," or even attempt to try. If it's file formats (maps and models) then you may be fine, but any kind of rendering engine is probably much easier done from scratch on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend that you get some good art done first, while having a programmer do a techdemo that uses the textures and models you are working on. He or she can ignore weapon animations or anything to do with physics and just make sure your game is crunching poly's properly. Then you'll be able to grab 2 more programmers to get more advanced animations, weapon logic, and refined rendering.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll send you a PM with an offer of resources.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was reading over your plan, and seems great. Stick to the classic style, no real additions or anything, thats great. My concern is with the control layout. Its fine, don't get me wrong, but make sure that you support lefties as well. Basically, just a complete reverse, to allow using the stylus in the left hand.

I really dont know what the fuss is over, the controls will be mappable.. that means you can set them up however you wish.

I was wondering you were intrested in having any help with the art. Right now it looks fantastic, but there is a little optimizing you could do on the models.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm very interested in getting a community based 3D engine onto the DS. If you're willing to have the code out there for everybody to use I'd be glad to help. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have time to be a lead developer on a project like this, but could certainly contribute. I'm currently in the middle of working on bone based export of models and animations from MisfitModel3D. Misfit has some limitations, but it will import from Milkshape, and it's cross platform and open source, so I feel better about working with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Eclipse, your experience would be great. I stare at these models for hours shaving polys here and there. I know i could go lower, but i'm trying hard to escape that real low poly look and there are charactoristics i want to retain to keep them faithful to the originals. I personaly study every nook and crany in games and pick the hell out of the faults. Before getting into animating them, plenty of testing will be done to see if the DS can handle them, if not then they must loose weight. I'm sure in some cases due to the DS' resolution, some of the detail may not be noticable and could be shaved anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
So yes, your help would be great. At this time i'm working on some models that need optimizing. Their design is being tweaked constantly so it would be hard to just hand one over and let you work on it.
<br/>
Once more help is needed i will let you know. Thanks heaps.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like a message board, but i really dont have the time for it. I learnt from scratch the HTML needed to make that site. As basic as it is, it was all new for me. I've always been arty, not a coder. If anyone would be willing to help out, I'd impliment one on my page no worries.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for huge post, trying to cover everything.
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Aside from Dual-Soft's in-house projects, this is the first project for us to host and to share resources with. Dual-Soft was founded with this feature in mind; we want to support not only our own small team, but anyone else that wants to develop games in a community environment.
