    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This sounds like an error you'd get from a silly typo.  However there's not much code in my main function and what's there appears to be correct.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the main function that generates the error:
<br/>
<br/>
nt main() {
<br/>
<br/>
    /* Turn on the 2D graphics core */
<br/>
	powerOn(POWER_ALL_2D);
<br/>
<br/>
	/* Configure the VRAM and BG control registers */
<br/>
	lcdMainOnBottom();
<br/>
	initVideo();
<br/>
	initBackgrounds();
<br/>
<br/>
	/* Display the backgrounds */
<br/>
	displayStarField();
<br/>
	displayPlanet();
<br/>
	displaySplash();
<br/>
<br/>
	return 0;
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
Why the heck would this be generating such an error?  None of the functions from lcdMainOnBottom() onward take any arguments so its not like the compiler should be expecting any.  It must be expecting me to use powerOn() (the only function derived from ndslib rather than my own functions) differently?  This is exactly how it is used in the tutorial I am following, though (patater's tutorial, that is).  
<br/>
<br/>
I've checked and checked again.  With the exception of some comments, my main function is identical to the tutorial.  Could an error in another function be causing this?  And wouldn't the compiler mention that function if that were the case?
<br/>
<br/>
The hell is going on?
<br/>
<br/>
All I can think is that this tutorial is outdated and that powerOn() function is expecting something that it didn't need in an earlier version of devkitpro.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Haha.   That's a copy-paste error.  The actual code is right.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I did figure out the problem and wish I could delete this thread now.  Because I was only seeing part of a bigger error when running 'make'.  The error was, in fact, in another function, and was indeed a stupid typo.  sorry for wasting the forum space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
