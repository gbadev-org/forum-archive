    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on creating a Tronish game for my first DS app, and I've come across a roadblock.  When you move a dot, well its a dot for now, that leaves a trail behind it, it needs to be drawn as a line.  Controlling the speed of the player is vital, it would be impractical for the player to move at 1 pixel an update.  The only thing i can think of is every step i have to draw a line from the old point to the new one.  Does anyone have any code i could use for drawing a line from point A to point B on a 16bit_256x256 background?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I recall being highly peeved off that the basic calculus formula y=mx+c doesn't work perfectly on PC platforms (Because you have to take certain special cases into account and so forth :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

There's a way to implement Bresenham so you don't actually need to handle lines or special cases. Check the Wikipedia article on it under the optimization section.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically you step in the direction of dx or dy, whichever is greater. Then after a certain amount of error accumulates, you take an additional perpindicular step. It can all be done with integers which keeps it pretty fast.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bresenham is pretty outdated and is not optimal on modern hardware.
<br/>
The faster (and easier) way is to just used fixed point values X and Y, and add a DELTA to X or Y and 1 to the other while stepping along the line.
<br/>
<br/>
Allthough since its a TRON-game you're only doing horizontal or vertical lines I take it? So then it should be very simple, just something like
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
<br/>
while(oldx &lt; x) putpixel(oldx++, oldy);
<br/>
while(oldx &gt; x) putpixel(oldx--, oldy);
<br/>
while(oldy &lt; y) putpixel(x, oldy++);
<br/>
while(oldy &gt; y) putpixel(x, oldy--);
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
