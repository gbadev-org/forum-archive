    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want how you guys make your homebrew games.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you use a pre-existing engine and then make you own assets (textures and stuff) or do you code it all from scratch? If you code it all yourself, can someone show me a tutorial so I can learn to do this myself?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how in the world do you actually get the code to run on the DS, like, for instance how do you map the buttons, or how do you make sure it even recognizes the code and runs it?
<br/>
<br/>
These are the kind of things I want to learn.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, most development here is as of now (for all I know) done <span style="font-style: italic">the hard way</span>. 
<br/>
<br/>
The questions you're asking (also regarding buttons) are found on a great set of tutorials on <a href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/" target="_blank">http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The topic was just a few topics below yours. So keep your eyes open, and read the forums to keep up, cause we're moving fast ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, that's a site I haven't been to yet. I'll look into it.
<br/>
<br/>
About the "hard" way, that's what I was afraid of. I know next to nothing about writing code, but I hope to learn enough to mess around with some stuff on my DS. Maybe later I can join a project or something and help with 3D modeling (which I can do ^_^ )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On this board, the latter. There's a different board for asset replacements on existing engine, which are called "ROM hacks" or "mods" depending on the depth. There are other message boards that cover ROM hacking.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It will take you many years of coding to achieve this. Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah... but if you know nothing about coding this might be a hard start.. I'm coding for quite a few years now and often this memory and binary stuff puzzles me... maybe it's good to get familiar with C++ first by buying a C++ for dummies book or something (that's a good start right guys?) and that'll be a good step up for this stuff.. but then again, I'm a console coding n00b too.. so I'm giving you some good advice ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lots of good advice here already. While it's true that coding for the DS is probably a ways off for a beginner, it can still serve as a great motivation. So I recommend that you read through the forum threads, and keep reading as much as you are interested. You'll pick up on stuff related to programming, computer architecture, and hardware, little by little. In the meantime you should learn C/C++ if you really feel ambitious, or pick up any form of Basic or Pascal first. Basic and Pascal are easier to pick up for a first language, and I think I learned most of Pascal within 2 months. Once you feel bored with it (you shouldn't for a while though), go after C.
<br/>
<br/>
For learning C I recommend <a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131103628/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-8302601-5971165?v=glance&amp;s=books" target="_blank">The C Programming Language</a> by Kernighan and Ritchie. It's a classic and a good book to learn from.
<br/>
<br/>
So you want to program a DS? Good. Just make a plan and keep in mind that you are building skills you need to get anywhere on the DS. Keep in touch with the activity in forums and you'll pick up stuff here and there. You can learn a lot of stuff specific to the DS without ever programming it, but you need to understand programming in order to build something of your own.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
