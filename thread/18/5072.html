    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apparently, there is some kind of mini-game functionality available in the Playan.  Gamers can download a small ASF file from <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/playan/garage/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/playan/garage/index.html</a> which, when opened in the Playan video player, will let gamers play a mini-game on a small area of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
How hard would it be to reverse-engineer these files?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i wonder if the minigame is actually stored in the asf file, or it just unlocks it? because i can play the asf file in windows media player, i tried the 'insect' one and it was just a static image displayed for 10 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
 one problem is there is zero documentation on the asf format, and the only program i know of (virtualdub) that could open them outside of microsoft tools  was threated with legal action and removed the functionality from his app.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're worried about quality, use the Huffyuv lossless codec.

<br/>
The thing that throws most new Stoik users is that the convert button is labeled Record.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- Who?

-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The nice thing about the old virtualdub was that it could convert ASF to AVI, but WITHOUT re-encoding it, so it was very fast, like over 1000fps on my old P3.  (ASF &amp; AVI are just container formats, the actual codec would be something else, like DivX or ms-mpeg4, so that's why this is possible)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yeah thats exactly what i meant. You just see a picture of a bug and some sticks and a word "Insect" that doesn't change. there's no random noise or anything noticable</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
