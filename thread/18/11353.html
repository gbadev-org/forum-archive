    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi guys. which 3d emulator would you guys suggest? ive tried ideas and no$gba, ideas works and is really great but i dont think it will be really useful for me until the next release, and no$gba refuses to load my game (which works on hardware). any others which are fairly decent?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think any emulator does 3D very well (or if it does, doesn't do other things well). Emulators aren't really reliable for DS development yet. I suggest buying a cheap RT2500/RT2560 card (not USB, unless you have Linux) and testing your apps on real hardware via DS Download Play. It's pretty easy, and the second screen is nice for debugging if it isn't essential to your application.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That not only requires RT25x0 card, but also to reflash the firmware, right?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">cheers for the replys guys. thats what i was afraid of, emulators arent "mature" enough for developers (dont get me wrong they're doing frickin cool jobs emulating the ds! but devs need accuracy ;)) at the moment im using a supercard and constantly moving the sd card, might invest in a ds link for the usb conenction.
<br/>
<br/>
what flashcart/method of getting your apps on the ds do you devs prefer?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Rajveer on Fri Oct 06, 2006 12:41 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

You could always write your code and then have it compile for DS and Windows. The OpenGL calls should work on both platforms. You may have to do a bit different setup for the Windows version and limit the speed.
<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.codesampler.com" target="_blank">codesampler.com</a> they have really good simple Windows OpenGL tutorials.<br/>_________________<br/>Fruit Machine Games:
