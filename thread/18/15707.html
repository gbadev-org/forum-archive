I see the drivers performing data cache cleaning, and writes to control registers to try to gain control of the cartridge bus for the ARM9.  Does any of this stuff have unwanted side effects on a GBA, or is the invalid IO just ignored?<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From my understanding it should (see <a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/SendSave/index.html#cart_save" target="_blank">Chishm's cart_save program</a> for an example of a DLDI-capable GBA program) though the use of libfat will still take up 32 KB of RAM, which obviously has more of an impact on the GBA than it does on the DS.

Edit after your edit:  no clue about the other questions, sorry.  Until you added those I actually felt smart for once, being able to answer your question rather than the other way around, hehe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
