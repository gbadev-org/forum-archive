<br/>
Well I was looking through the devkitPro examples trying to see how to get both screens to work. After seeing a few of them using both screens, I can't see the piece of code which allows you to work on the sub screen. Can someone point it out? Please?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I started yesterday with the 'Beginners Tutorial' and after 3 long hours I finaly managed to print something on the 2 screens.
<br/>
The main program it runs took me half an hour to write in a normal Console window and exporting it to the arm9 file.
<br/>
<br/>
This is what I made...
<br/>
<br/>
At this stage it's just editing and experimenting for me, you can see this in the file, as you can simply ignore the build_log function because this function does nothing yet.

(File is still named .cpp and the code that I added to this file is C ... I know ...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
