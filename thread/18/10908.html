<br/>
Hi all, I started learning about homebrew development only recently, and as a first project, I decided to write a client for the game of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go" target="_blank">Go</a>. I already have something that works, but since it has a heavy lack of features (most notably no networking whatsoever; the game is a hot seat game), I thought I'd place it here instead of the DS Misc forum, which seems to be for more complete games.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a page for it up here <a class="postlink" href="http://argument.88-mph.net/blog/blogs/2/" target="_blank">http://argument.88-mph.net/blog/blogs/2/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not really asking for help with a particular problem, but this being my first project, I was hoping to get input from the more experienced people here on what things I can improve on (in the code), what features might be good to add, etcetera. I am almost sure my code violates common practices and conventions, and would love to hear what I can do to make it better.
<br/>
<br/>
(The most obvious problem I see in my code is that it has a lot of repetition--the same algorithm is repeated several times, with some minor changes each time, and I can't figure out how to make it any simpler except by passing loads of function pointers)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Erm, I know that JaGo is a very nice Go client. It's written in Java, but the features it provides apply in any language.
<br/>
<br/>
On another tactic, I'd take a look at GnuGo for a background AI, if you plan to support one. It's a GNU project, so it's completely open :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ha ha, yeah, good luck getting GnuGo (and probably any Go AI, if I had to guess) to play at any level of skill given the CPU power available on the DS.  Heck, GnuGo spends a fair bit of time thinking on my multi-ghz desktop machine, let alone a 66 mhz ARM9.
<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, a Go client would be pretty neat, both for play over wifi, or for playing on a single DS and just passing it back and forth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
that was just a front end to yahoo games or some other Go parlor
<br/>
that is web based.  It would be fun to hack the different packets and such, and if it ever worked you could play people online.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yep, the "pass it back and forth" part is working, actually. I do want to add Wifi support, but I'm having no luck finding an open protocol; anyone know of one?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, am I right in assuming I cannot make my DS offer the go game via download play?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
A wifi nds go game would be terrific !
<br/>
Hold on !
<br/>
<br/>
I made a Go clock if it could help you in any way (or just to use it while playing on a real Goban ^_^ ).
