Sure it will.  It worked in dualis-2 as well, you just have to modify the code.  Grab the my latest version from here, compile it, and test it out.

From what I know, cedega is a special build of wine which resolves common compatability issues that wine may have with popular DriectX games.
<br/>
<br/>
On a completely unrelated note, Dualis release 3 always crashes when I run in OpenGL mode, but runs fine using D3D. May I suggest to the author to save settings in a *.ini file?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know about that.  Our keyboard demo works fine on the hardware, and on r2, but is off in r3..  I don't think it's our code, as it would be off on the hardware.
