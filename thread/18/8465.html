    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">iam not ending the project i have started a compo instead check on my site at :
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.mofireds.50megs.com" target="_blank">http://www.mofireds.50megs.com</a> for more info but heres a lowdon on what the compos all about:
<br/>
<br/>
this is no lie but how ever the winner gets a 256MB CF card and a superpass sent by envolope to their house from the UK all you have to do is create a browser for the DS that can be compatible with Superpass DS that looks like internet explorer for windows but portable enough to fit on the DS's two or one of its screens and be able to scan through small pictures.
<br/>
<br/>
Competitors must send their entries at the latest may 15th at 10:00pm at their time in the world!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
I will not be giving a source but competitors need to create a source with their entries so i can check it and they must include this source as a attachment along with their program/application in a email to me.
<br/>
<br/>
 this will be a 2 and 1/2 month project for whoever wants to take it up just email me with your entries at: <a href="mailto:aaronadeniran@aol.com">aaronadeniran@aol.com</a> the compo is till in development but you have the choice to start now if you so wish check on this site for more updates on the compo and some intresting info on this browser: 
<br/>
<a href="http://mofireds.50megs.com" target="_blank">http://mofireds.50megs.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
iam not yet decided when this will end but it surely has already started u should also email me some screenshots of your browser and and link to a download in the Email.
<br/>
<br/>
 Iam hoping for a may 15th 2006 deadline but i will keep many posted if i ever change this date to be sooner or later!!! happy coding.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sorry, but <span style="font-weight: bold">WHY</span> would anyone want to make a web browser for the DS look anything like Internet Crapsplorer (yes, what a humerous pun on word, why, anyone would think he was a comic genius &lt;/sarcasm&gt;)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit wary of what looks to me to be a kid who wants to have a web browser and so has made two incomplete and badly coded websites. I've seen it before, we'll see it again. I bet that guy doesn't have any coding experience himself. If your going to try and present yourself as a legitimate competition and project, you need to put some effort in. I don't know how old you are, but as a 15 year old who's been contributing on Forums and other websites since he was 12, the kind of grammar and spelling errors displayed on your websites isn't really acceptable. I personally gave up reading them.
<br/>
<br/>
On a more positive note, well done for trying.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Idea for web browser interface: 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I been thinking, and you know, I dont think the Opera/Nintendo method is best. Having a zoomed screen and an overall screen is the best you can do to replicate the look of a website on a pc. 
<br/>
<br/>
But why do you need this? 
<br/>
Isnt it better to replicate the functionality in the easiet to use/read fashion? 
<br/>
<br/>
My preposal would be to have a full,zoomed out view on the bottom screen. 
<br/>
Then, you click on something on the bottom screen (eg, a paragraph of text). 
<br/>
<br/>
The text appears on the top screen then..not a zoomed view of the webpage, but just the text resized and wraped to fit the screen. 
<br/>
There could be a scroll bar on one side, and you simply use the D-pad to go up and down. 
<br/>
Much like moonshell. 
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, if you click on a jpeg, it appears on its own in the top screen where you can zoom in and out. 
<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about it, the more I think this would be a superb interface. It gets around the problem of having to scroll the screen, and I think the results would make large blocks of text even easier to read then on the PSP's screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Personaly, I think that system would be more usefull on the DS then any attempt to make something look like Internet explorer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>

The play-yan for example, is never been announced by Nintendo of Europe, so there is no European release of the play-yan.

The U.S. site also announced <span style="font-style: italic">Nintendo Puzzle Collection</span> for GameCube and <span style="font-style: italic">Earthbound 0+1</span> for GBA, but the North American releases were quietly canceled. The same thing happened even before the World Wide Web gained wide popularity: <span style="font-style: italic">Nintendo Power</span> magazine announced the 64DD drive and <span style="font-style: italic">Mario Artist</span> for Nintendo 64, but those ended up canceled in North America too.

<br/>
If everything go as it should go, the DS browser will be released outside Japan....They can't ignore USA and Europe if the browser is a success
<br/>
<br/>
With Nintendogs and Brain Training, they followed a "Japan first, then we see further" strategy....and those games are coming to USA/Europe :D
<br/>
<br/>
That's my theory about it, don't blame me if they decide not to release it in Europe/USA (that would be a  major mistake)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
