    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i download images from google earth at 4800 pixels (the maximoum googleearth allow)
<br/>
<br/>
Then i want use that image to guide me in the street and so on,
<br/>
<br/>
the problem is: when opening img with Moonshell; i can't move it quikly; i mean it move extremly slowly so i take 20 minutes to move from site to site.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried image viewer from Infantile Paraliser, but when i encode the image to *.pki format,  and i open it in the DS, the image become pixeled and blurry, even compressed at max quality i can't read the name of the streets and so on. I can move image very quikly and smoothly but image quality suxs when zooming,
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the example: if you open the jpg file in pc you can see it in full quality, but when you open ipk file with imgviewer in the nintendo DS,  it sux...

Yeah, the COMPRESSED image takes 1.5 MB. The decompressed image, however, will take up over 24 MB. This is way too much for the DS. It's possible to write a jpeg-decompressor that only decompress those blocks that are visible at any time, but this is not trivial to do. Perhaps you want to take on the task?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it process block by block when looking the image, but take too much time...  :s

moonshell is very slow, (probably is the DS hardware the slow one...)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by spalnndsstest on Tue Jul 31, 2007 12:01 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't expect it to. Loading really really big images (like this is) on your DS is a very specialized task, and generally need specialized tools.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

so up to day there is not any special program to use NDS as a street guide =(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmm.
<br/>
<br/>
mapviewer DS supports gifs of up to around 2000x2000 pixels or was it 1500x1500 if i remember correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
If you save the images as gifs and split them this program is feasable.
<br/>
It's also quite fast and easy to use.
<br/>
<br/>
however i'm sure it would be more convenient to not have to do that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

so doesnt matter the image size,

rightnow there is not any program that process images in that way,
