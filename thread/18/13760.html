    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I'm new to mac OS X, had my macbook 2.16 for a couple weeks now,
<br/>
<br/>
just wondering if someone can step me through the entire process of setting up the environment etc. . . I've looked at the tutorials and they seem to assume that I've already been developing non-DS apps on mac beforehand.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. . I'm plenty computer literate, just need a little help setting it all up. . basically to get me to the point where i can compile code. . dont need any help with actual DS programming (for now..)
<br/>
<br/>
any help appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) Download and install <a class="postlink" href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode</a>
<br/>
2) Download and install <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=124207" target="_blank">devkitARM</a> (both Intel &amp; PPC available).
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, it's good to download the nds examples package to see if your installation is working. If you're using different user for installing and actual programming you may need to set DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM to your environment pointing to correct directories.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
