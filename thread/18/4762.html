    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure Im not the only one wondering this.
<br/>
Basically I was wondering how I could help, I don't really know alot about hardware side of things and I'm really just a developer but I'm willing to learn if it means helping you guys.
<br/>
<br/>
So yeah basically is their anything I can do or should learn so that I could help out around here.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this has been answered before or I posted in the wrong section I've been reading this board for a while now but as you can tell this is my first post.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unless you want to learn Hardware, I think you can pretty much do the same as me, and just wait. I do sprites and moddeling and there's not really a large call for that either yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again we can never seem to find enough info on decoding roms, ect.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'ld gladly learn the hardware if it meant helping. I can't stand just sitting around waiting while everyone else does the work.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not really the DS hardware itself that would be helpful to us, but instead wireless networking know-how. It's probably going to be the easiest way to boot code on the DS for a long time.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeh reading through that 20+ page thread on the wifi hacking was what spured me to ask if their was in any way I could help.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I could continue learning how to write linux device drivers and help with writing drivers for wireless cards but that would have to wait until I got my wireless card and a DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
