    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have figured out how to print text to both the sub(Top) screen and the bottom screen of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
But now i have another problem, how would printing text to each screen at the same time be achieved?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe you need to rephrase your question...if you can write the text to both screens, then just write to both screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you've already created writeToTop() and writeToBottom():
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
void writeToBothScreens(int x, int y, char * text)
<br/>
{
<br/>
    writeToTop(x, y, text);
<br/>
    writeToBottom(x, y, text);
<br/>
}
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I'm missing what you mean by "at the same time"?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
you might want to look at the print_both_screens example that comes with devkitPro. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also recommand (to people in general) to say main and sub engine if you talk about the graphics hardware and top and bottom screen if you're talking about the actual screens. using things like main screen or bottom engine makes it harder to understand what you mean.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
yes,that is what i meant.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am able to print text to the top and bottom screen individually, but i was not aware of how to print to both screens at the same time. 
<br/>

Thanks for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
