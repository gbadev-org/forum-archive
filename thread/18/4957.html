yeah, i didn't believe it (even pinched myself to make sure i was awake) , and i'm still trying to make sense of it. i think its to use a rumble pack in the GBA slot, but there aren't any GBA games with a rumble feature, are there?
<br/>
not very development-ish, i know, but its interesting if the DS can access the GBA port in alarm mode</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, I believe this to be a planned release for a DS Rumble Option Pak (remember, Option Paks go in the GBA slot), and the flash cart is giving of some similar signal as the planned DS Rumble Option Pak.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

I doubt that as well.

FYI, there are also a number of GBC games with a rumble feature (Pokemon Pinball, Perfect Dark).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think theres a special Vcc pin for the rumbler (power pin) which wont corroperate with the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Cant some one take a cart for the gba and modify it with a rumbler and once we learn enough about the Ds we can write code (on the gba cart) to make the gba cart\rumbler react to certain ds game actions.But I could be dreaming because its nearly impossible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've got Mawaru Made in Wario (you don't need to have any idea about reading Japanese to play this mad little game) and it does have a rumble pack (and tilt sensor) that sticks out of the bottom of the cart, like a fat GB cart.
<br/>
<br/>
After hearing about the rumble-pack dialog on the alarm I tried setting the alarm with Mawaru in the GBA slot, but no rumble option appeared; then again it also doesn't appear with my flash cart.<br/>_________________<br/>---

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS seems to react very strangely with the GBA Movie Player in.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it doesn't see my player. Other times, it sees it, but when the DS boots up, you actually hear an echo... Super Mario 64 has glitched out once that did the exact same thing..so who knows, maybe the gba movie player is affecting the way the DS functions in real time sometimes?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Kinda off topic, but when I was playing the Zelda: Oracle games on GBA and GBA SP, I linked them with my 3rd-party link cable and some very odd things happened. When I switched one off, but left the cable in and the other gba on, the LCD continued showing the image for quite a while, until weird 'streaks' appeared. If I pulled the carterige out or unplugged the link cable, then the gba quickly returned to normal. Also, if the GBA switched off was the SP, then it would continue to have the front light on. Spooky.<br/>_________________<br/>I can't be bothered now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What would have been happening is the power line in the link cable was getting power to the LCD screen, allowing it to maintain the image.  The image fading with lines is what happens when an LCD screen loses power.  On newer systems, you can't really see it much.  On the old Game Boy, and on the Game Park 32, the image takes quite a bit longer to fade away.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess the cartridge being removed cut the circuit that the power was travelling along to get to the LCD, but I don't know enough about how GBs are set up internally to know exactly how.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, all GB link ports have a power line - that's how the 'worm lights' work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
