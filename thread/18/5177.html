    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">since apparently we can browse through the game resources of metroid wouldnt it be possible to make a slim version of metroid with either only multiplayer (delete all single player data and make the training button do nothing) or only single player?
<br/>
<br/>
this would also be a good idea for sm64 ds download play if someone dumps the download play version you could put that on a card so you dont have to wait to download so much and you wouldnt be wasting a whole card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In many countries perhaps, but not necessarily all.
<br/>
Not too many years ago sharing music, movies and games with a friend was perfectly fine under Swedish law. Unfourtunately, software has since been excepted from that law, and while sharing of music and movies with a friend is still legal, the restrictions are tighter than they were before.
<br/>
Anyway, I imagine some countries may still allow sharing software with a friend.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

just as a note, here in the states at least, these devices do NOT fall under the same copyright laws as normal PC software.  so, make sure you are looking up the specifics on copying ROMs, and not CDs.
<br/>
<br/>
also note: if nintendo intended you to share a copy of a game with friends, they would have included that feature in a game.  the DS supports this.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

What Nintendo (and other companies) "intend" to let us do has usually little to do with what the law says.
<br/>
Nintendo does not "intend" to allow third parties to develop things for their system without paying fees, but the law in many countries explicitly allow third parties to develop accessories and games for their system.
<br/>
<br/>
The DVD consortium does not "intend" to let people play region 1 DVDs in region 2 players, or vice versa. They also does not intend to let people play their DVDs on non-licensed and/or "unsecure" DVD players (like open source linux DVD players).
<br/>
The law in many countries on the other hand says we have thoose rights.
<br/>
<br/>
Big companies will allways try to take away your rights if it suits their business plans. The only way to not loose those rights is to fight them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think in this case Darkain is referring to mask rom, which has some interesting legal quirks compared to normal copying of something in an affixed medium (i.e. cd, printed paper, etc).
<br/>
Normal fair use is a lot harder to apply to a masked rom.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also fun stuff like the DMCA to consider, since it's pretty clear the cart hacking is 'circumventing a protection mechanism'.
<br/>
Granted, I and others know this is for the purposes of compatibility and furthering the cause of homebrew and other coolness, but that's something that unfortunately might have to be demonstrated in court.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I believe the passme is the best solution in terms of not directly violating Nintendo's interest in the DS (still requires a GBA flash cart, which of course Nintendo still wouldn't approve of). The PassMe cannot directly play DS roms so, such a device can't be used as a double-edged sword like GBA flash carts can.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo assumes that everyone who lives close enough together to play multiplayer will have bought their DS from the same country, and would have the demo.  Adding single card multiplayer would not be worth their time.
<br/>
<br/>
And, according to NZ copyright law (which I did just check to confirm - in case you're wondering, NZ copyright law classifies DS games as literary works), I am allowed to make a backup copy if it will be used for review purposes (I actually write for a DS news website, so getting to play Metroid in multiplayer mode <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> be useful for review purposes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
