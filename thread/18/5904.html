    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am totally new to making anything, but am rather familiar with programming basics.  If someone could advise me on what compilers to use, and the basic commands, I would be fairly good to go.  The things I need are how to draw a single pixel in rgb format, how to recongize if a button is pressed, touch screen recognition (x,y), and absolute must-have code that would need to be put in.  I can make all the functions on my own, as long as i have just enough to start out.  OH!  and could someone inform me on the physical limitations or requirements I must go through while making/ using functions?  thanks
<br/>
<br/>
also, i tried to use the ds tutorials, but they seemed to be telling me stuff that i didn't know, going a step too far, and all i want are the very basics.
<br/>
<br/>
again, I'm new to everything, so thanks for all the help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They go through most of what you want (drawing, button presses, etc). If there's anything you don't understand just ask or send an email and I'll try and make them clearer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can tell you, this tutorial is pretty handy, for starting ds development. Just the fact that it isn't covering anything to learn about the ds (yet :p)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GCC is the compiler. Use DevKitPro which contains the tools you need:
