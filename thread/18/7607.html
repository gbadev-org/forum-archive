    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I just bought an official Nintendo Wi-fi USB Connector to play Mario Kart online. I was wondering though if I can do other things with it... can I use it to use the Wifime technique to play some game demo's or homebrew? I've been searching for it for hours now, but can't seem to find anything on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I would buy a PCI WLAN card. It also works and is much cheaper. 
<br/>
But not so easy to setup. That can cost only 15$.

<br/>
<br/>
I've run out of PCI slots

I have no interest in WMB, seeing as I already have a flashcart and a GBAMP

I managed to get the USB adaptor at a good price

Anyway, what's the point in asking why he bought it? He already has! ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With the usb connector you have the advantage of mobility. You can take it along if you visit someone who does not have wireless at home.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If Nintendo were smart, they would have made the USB WiFi stick a memory stick also.  That way, you could store drivers directly on the stick.  Windows XP will automatically install the memory stick portion of it, and possibly 2K and ME if they used an older chipset that those OSes already have support for.  And 16 or 32 MB would be enough to hold drivers, and should only bump the price by about $10, if that.  I really like the portability aspect of the USB, but I don't like carrying around CD's with me.
<br/>
<br/>
I, however, will probably just settle for a new router, one that actually works with the DS.  I have a DI-514 that I bought about a year ago (it was on sale, so I bought it and hoped that it would work.  Sadly, I was mistaken.  Still, a 10/100 router is about a thousand times better than that old 3Com 10 mbps hub I used to have... talk about lag -- but I digress).  I now have to get a new router.
<br/>
<br/>
While I'm here, can I ask this question:
<br/>
I can get the DI-624 for about the same price (after main-in rebate) as the LinkSys BEFW11S4 (without any rebate).  I only want a router that scores 5 stars on Nintendo's site, and preferrably isn't dependent on which H/W ver. it is.  So between the two routers I've listed, would anyone with personal experience recommend either of them, or should I go with another make/model entirely?  Thanks guys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
