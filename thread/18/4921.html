Well, this is a Development forum. Everything relevant to developing is good news. Playing official games anywhere (online or offline or whatever) isn't helping us as long as Nintendo didn't give us any chance to use it with our own stuff. Official means probably not working for us.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to be so strickt about this online news. I don't see is as new or interesting. I'm more interested in how much RAM you can use in a DS game etc... :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It should also contain some rewritable memory.

<br/>

I think if Nintendo ever intends the DS to be a serious contender in the new market of online enabled handhelds, it <span style="font-style: italic">needs</span> to have some sort of common storage device that games can pull network information from, at the very least.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 I would have to agree with Abscissa and Griffzane. Requiring a dongle would defeat the purpose to play in a wi-fi zone, like an internet cafe. Each place would have to have one, resulting in less places to play.

The problem is that most WiFi access spots aren't FREE. Not only that, they use web-based authentication for connecting to their service. 
<br/>
<br/>
Like my wireless hotspot on my university campus requires my special ID and password. Chances are I probably won't be able to use that network to play online or any other web-based interface, unless Nintendo includes primitive web-browser support which is quite a huge task.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Darkain someone once said "Don't assume anything until you have facts."

In this case you nor I know what is "in the BIOS". As Ickmonst said "my thoughts on the whole thing."

So until you have solid prof that there is no such features, please keep the speculation to a minimum.

thats quite interesting. could b a doctored image tho (top down view of DS with some cleaning up and add a usb connector to the side).
<br/>
still, if nintendo's going to release a usb key specifically designed for communicating with the DS, that will b much welcomed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This isn't official. This announcement didn't happen. Can we please stop it with the tunnelling posts? I thought DSDev was about writing code for the DS, not shoving Nintendo's code through the Internet so I can play with sub-literate 12 year olds.
