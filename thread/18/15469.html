    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am making a Dr. Mario clone to learn about programming on the DS. I have looked at a few tutorials, and I can load in a background, a sprite, and move it around.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't seem to find a tutorial on how to do the following, however:
<br/>
<br/>
I have a 32x32 sprite with 16 8x8 images on it. I want to use load in this larger sprite and reference different parts of it for each virus or pill capsule. I can load the whole 32x32 image but when I set it to just show 8x8 I can't figure out how to show anything other than the top left 8x8 pixels.
<br/>
<br/>
If needed I can upload a .png of my sprite, but this seems to be something really basic like SpriteObject-&gt;IndexNum = 3; or something</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For technical reasons involving sprite memory layout, it is much easier to organize your small sprites in your original image as a vertical strip, and then once you convert/load it into OBJ sprite RAM, you can then create each 8x8 sprite with an offset address that points the smaller sprite image you want.
<br/>
<br/>
For 8x8x8bit (256col), the OBJ address of the individual sprite would be:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">objSpriteAddress + (pillNumber &lt;&lt; 6)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
and for 8x8x4bit (16col), the address of the sprite would be:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">objSpriteAddress + (pillNumber &lt;&lt; 5)</span>
<br/>
<br/>

You can if you set the sprite sheet to 2D mode, as Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land does. Or you can if you're always taking an 8-pixel-tall slice, as would be done in a Tetris clone or a Dr. Mario clone; the 1D vs. 2D sprite sheet bit has a noticeable effect only for sprites taller than 8 pixels.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Consider my original post "temporary insanity".  I seem to have had a brain-fart re. 2d sprite mapping.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
