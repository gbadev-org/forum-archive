First you have to flash your DS ROM or you could use a passme device. This allows the DS to run unsigned code. (official ROM's have some kind of encryption that gets overriden by the ROM hack).
<br/>
<br/>
After this:
<br/>
As long as the NDS roms are below 4MB in size and if they don't require data to be on a storage medium like a slot1 or slot2 card(when such a card isn't present with that data on it), you can run that application through wifime.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Find FlashMe, make sure it's the real thing and the correct version (DS vs DS Lite), follow the instructions that should be on the page it's found on. I don't know if we're allowed to link it here since it's a hacked Nintendo ROM, but I don't remember the address anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Official demos have a digital signature, which is essentially an encrypted hash of the file. Anyone can decrypt it but only Nintendo can encrypt it (or someone having their key, but to crack it would take hundreds of years), so there's no way to add the correct hash for homebrew or hacked ROMs. The standard firmware will reject those without a correct hash, but FlashMe won't. Assuming it either has the correct hash or you're using FlashMe, you can just send over any .nds file that's less than 4MB.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
