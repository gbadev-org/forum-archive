If you get sick of c compiling/building phase, you can always use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslua.com" target="_blank">DSLua</a>. ;)  You won't be as closed to the metal, so you will lose some finer control.  But you can get a sprite on screen in 4 lines of lua script. :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Visual Basic .NET is just as much a "real language" as C#. Python and Perl are just as much "real languages" as Java, especially given that Python can be compiled to JVM byte codes. Many commercial games are made of an engine in C and game logic in a scripting language.

It's not a form of Basic, but a language called <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lua.org/" target="_blank">Lua</a>.  Object oriented and all.  Has a very <a class="postlink" href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaGrammar" target="_blank">short grammar</a>, so it's very easy to learn and parse. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not that weird.
<br/>
<br/>
The main gcc sources have broken the ability to relocate the toolchain slightly. It's attempting to check folders in the original installed location - drive E on my machine. I'm currently trying to fix the relocation problem so all paths are translated to the local installation. You just need to put a disk in the drive and it will behave.

It has nothing to do with that case, it's a gcc problem.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
