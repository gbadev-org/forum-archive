There is no lack of information. Much of the important information is available. I'am guessing you are saying there is no information available because you don't know how to interpret the information which in fact is available.
<br/>
You need a deep understanding of digital electronics in order to make any sense of the relevant information at this time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is just a tetris game. It is techinically less advanced than some of the DS demos we have seen. It uses only the 2D graphics hardware (GBA compatible).

The point I was trying to make is that the game use very little DS-specific features.

Hmm, I kinda doubt he's working with an SDK.  The only existing SDK right now is the official one, and I don't see why someone officially liscenced would be intersted in building that passthrough stuff (Unless they didn't want to shell out for the pricey dev system). Plus, if he was official, posting the little bit he did might be borderline NDA-infringement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or maybe "to win". I wonder how you can win in Joat's touchscreen demo...
<br/>
<br/>
At least, the good thing out of all of this is that it is possible to run homebrew code on the DS and it works. Although, the majority of us with no EE skills won't be able to do anything with the DS (or even play around with an emulator as there are none) until some kind of commercialization of these methods occur. And that is usually done by pirates. :(
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice though, if someone with a passthrough can make a series of demos that uses most of the DS's abilities known so that anyone who wants a crack at making an emulator for developmental purposes can.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depends on the game mode.  In some modes you just have to clear X lines.  In the never ending score based modes, I think getting a high score counts as a win.

It would be nice though, if someone with a passthrough can make a series of demos that uses most of the DS's abilities known so that anyone who wants a crack at making an emulator for developmental purposes can.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Have anyone posted a tutorial/how-to on building a passthrough for those with at least some experience, or is it still just "take the specs and design your own circuit"? (Sorry if this is was already answered someplace obvious.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. The GBA flash card is simply used as a storage meduim and nothing else when in DS mode. The DS has full access to the GBA slot, and since people already have GBA flash cartridges on hand, it would be much easier to build a device (aka passthrough), which reroutes the DS to execute code from the DS slot to the GBA slot. Hopefully if/when commercialized, you will be able to  stick a passthrough into the DS slot which wil reroute execution to your GBA flash cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment though, I am unaware of the current designs of passthroughs, whether it is a "I know this and this, so simply building this will make it work", and there are lots of different designs or if there is some common point from which everyone started (besides the materials they are using).<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as I know, yes. But I myself do not have a passthrough. This is just my interpretation of the information that has been revealed to the public. It is not 100% accurate. I am sure darkfader or Joat would be able to tell you in full what exactly their passthrough does to make running hombrew code on the DS possible.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is a execution pointer in the DS card header. Passthrough devices change this pointer to point at the GBA cart.

Yes. Code cannot be executed directly from the DS card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't understand why they are using passthrough. Why not use a home made ds card ? 
<br/>
If I understand all of this, when using a passthrough they change the header of the DS card to change the ARM7 entry point. So why not changing both ARM7 and ARM9 entry address for an address on the GBA cart, so there is no need for soldering the genuine DS card on the passthrough. 
<br/>
It shouldn't be too difficult as (i think)  the command are unencrypted when accessing the DS cart header.

I know that, however, since we need just the header, we can build one (something similar to natrium42 passthrough)

I read it and except that you can't execute ARM9 code directly, there is nothing against this method.
<br/>
If you build a header (with the correct CRC) with all address pointing to the GBA card (ARM7, ARM9 entry point,...), then when the DS will boot, it will read the header from the DS card (in unencrypted mode) and then will load everything from the GBA card without any access to the DS card. So, if this method is correct, we don't need to solder a genuine DS card to the passthrough.

Sorry but there is.
<br/>
After the DS read the header it enables the encryption and read out a bunch of other stuff. If this encrypted data is not correct then the DS will report that there is no card in the DS card slot, and will refuse to boot any DS software.
<br/>
Problem is the encryption has not been cracked, so we need a genuine DS card to respond with proper encrypted data to the DS' encrypted requests.
