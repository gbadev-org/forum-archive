You mean snake as in Solid Snake, or snake as in Nibbles? I made a Nibbles clone for the NES once.
<br/>
<br/>
No wait, you said "NDS" meaning DS. Would my game in nesDS count? ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey man, i made a Snake a little time ago, and the source of a simplified version can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://vlozbob.free.fr/SimpleSnake.rar" target="_blank">&gt;there&lt;</a>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">However</span>, this snake has been made with PAlib library (so it will be a little bit different if you are using the LIBNDS), the comments are french and to finish, i am a f*** newbie in programming, so a lot of thing should be bad... :S

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also have a snake game called Super Snake DS, but for various reasons I didn't release the source and either way it is very messy and goes well beyond a basic snake game.

Anyway, it may help to do a google search for "C snake game".  You'll find a bunch of examples that should help you understand the logic behind the game so you can write it for the NDS.  Though, I think it would be more fun to figure it out yourself.  Plus, it'd be a better learning experience (if you are wondering if I "cheated", I diden't. :-) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
