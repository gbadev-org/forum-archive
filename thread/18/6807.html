<br/>
My goal is to create a user interface for the GBAMP that looks and acts very close to the original DS menu. I have recreated virtually all of the sprites for the menu pixel-by-pixel, however my coding ability is somewhat limited. I have detailed maps of what each menu option should do, how files could be layed out to make it customizable for the user, and timing and speeds for all of the menu animations. 
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested even in the slightest bit, contact me and I can elaborate much further. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here is an old test image I had used for my moonshell background. It is rather messy, but the new sprites I have are much cleaner.
