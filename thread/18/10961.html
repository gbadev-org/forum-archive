    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm having trouble with dswifilib and connectionless (well, connected or TCP doesn't work
<br/>
either) UDP. The thing is that I can send exactly 12 UDP packets and after them sendto()
<br/>
returns -1 and DS doesn't send a thing after that.
<br/>
<br/>
I got this after moving my UDP code to wifi_example1 that comes with the dswifilib. When I
<br/>
tried to use dswifilib in my own, bigger project I rarely managed to get a single UDP packet
<br/>
out of it. wifi_example1 should work better as a basis for my test than my own project,
<br/>
because in my own project I don't use libnds.
<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing is that wifi_example1's TCP connection to outside world works just fine. 
<br/>
But my UDP code connects to my local 64bit X2 4400+ Linux PC via D-Link DI-524 wireless
<br/>
router. Relevant ports are open, etc., there should be nothing on the D-Link side that
<br/>
prevents the packets from moving, and it's the DS side that stops sending the stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? Similar experiences? Is my local configuration somehow just killing dswifilib?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using DevKitARM 19b plus dswifilib 0.3a under Linux. With DevKitARM 18 the behaviour
<br/>
was a bit different (could send more packets, but the DS app got stuck sooner or later).
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote my own memory manager to get free of libc, but the result was the same. Under
<br/>
Linux my UDP code works just fine. I don't touch the ARM9 cache settings, and don't use
<br/>
dynamic memory manager (so I just have big static arrays in bss).
