    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have noticed that the sound files in metroid prime are compressed with 4-bit VOX raw ADPCM 11000hz.
<br/>
The sound quality is <span style="font-weight: bold">very bad</span>, i've converted the bgmdata.bin file into a wav, and there are some different songs on it. It seems just to be a standard ADPCM (G.721, I guess).  Sfxdata.bin is ADPCM 11000hz too.
<br/>
The files globalsfxdata.bin and menusfxdat.bin are raw PCM 6000~8000hz. (I haven't played metroid, but I think it's 6000hz).
<br/>
<br/>
ADPCM 11000hz, PCM 6000hz. How does it sound in a DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

&lt;joke&gt; At the moment we have music and models. We need animation from models and we can start PC conversion ;) &lt;/joke&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It doesn't sound too bad on the DS, but I guess the definition of 'bad' is subjective.
<br/>
<br/>
ADPCM sounding 'bad' sounds like the coefficient/scaler table isn't right, and we need to find which ADPCM flavour it uses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

not surprising, IMO -- with it being a pack in demo, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo scaled down as much as possible to get it to fit on a smaller cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, according the SM 64 header, the cart is the exact same size as the metroid cart.  Now I don't have any idea why the sound quality would be so much different...<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, Metroid is on a 128MB card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Because the Metroid music is presumable streaming whereas Mario is most likely generated in realtime, the way (IMHO) it should be done.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA from what I have read HAD to go easy on sound due to only having 2 channels to play with and not exactly too generous with the CPU power.  The DS I believe has more than 2 channels (or at least it has the ARM7 to deal with that sort of thing) so realtime music is more plausable and hopefully used more often.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
