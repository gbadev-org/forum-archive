    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
I installed and started using Palib because I find it easier than original libnds.
<br/>
However, to get it to work I had to downgrade devkitARM to version r20 (it's r27 now).
<br/>
What I want to know is how to use maxmod libraries with Palib? I can't find any tutorials and I don't know if the changes in Palib's Makefile should be the same as in libnds's Makefile (ex. creating 'audio' directory, linking libmm9 etc.). I get a lot of errors trying to compile such an application. Is it because of an old version of devkitARM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Libnds is much easier to use now than it was a long time ago, there are plenty of examples and documentation to get you up and running.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for advise. I'll give it a try when I have a bit more time, because I want to display a lot of sprites and Palib's method for displaying/rotating and moving them is QUITE easier ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let's say I got everything compiled. I want to play simple song using maxmod. I extracted same parts from EliteBeatAgents (for testing purposes only ;p) and loaded it as a maxmod's soundeffect (because it's a wav file). My question is: how to turn up the volume? I set DS slide for max and set 255 in maxmod's mm_sound_effect structure, but it's still far quieter than the same song played i.e. in DSOrganize.
<br/>
Maybe there's a third method how to make it louder?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Play the same sound effect on more channels.
<br/>
If it's mono you would play the same effect on 2 channels with the panning set either left or right.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure about stereo but it should be similar, but then again I haven't used a whole lot of maxmod except for the streaming.
<br/>
I know you got it _working_ but I'm pretty sure you get absolutely no support if you [break] your toolchain on purpose to use PAlib.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
