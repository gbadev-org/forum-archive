    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What make/model is your wireless nic? Airport Extreme won't cut it, A regular Airport should work or any other NIC that KisMAC lists as supporting "passive mode" in the driver prefs window.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have a nic that does passive mode then put your DS in a mode that it is transmitting, such as joining a PictoChat room, and look for a network with the SSID "&lt;nossid&gt;" in KisMAC. Double click on that network and look for a client with a MAC address that starts with "00:09:BF" and you'll have found your DS.

Also, I personally would appreciate it if your posts were a little more well spoken and sounded less like a drunk uncle visiting for the holidays.

I wasn't commenting on proper/improper english. I was requesting that <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/search.php?search_author=Griffzane" target="_blank">Griffzane's posts</a> be more polite. He did indirectly call your efforts "<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=34686#34686" target="_blank">this crap</a>" and then proceeded to demand help as opposed to requesting it.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't followed all of the thread, but doesn't the French word for "to request" (<span style="font-style: italic">demander</span>) look like the English word for "to demand"?

To check what type of Airport card you have go to the Apple menu, select 'About This Mac' click on the 'More Info' button and then click on the 'AirPort Card' choice in the device tree. Then tell me what it lists next to "Wireless Card Type:".
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have the 'More Info' button you have an older version of OS X and look in your Applications folder for the System Profiler application instead.
<br/>
<br/>
My card type says "AirPort Extreme" which won't work for what we want with KisMAC. I have to use a USB unit. If you have an AirPort Extreme wireless adaptor you're going to need to get a compatible card listed on <a class="postlink" href="http://kismac.binaervarianz.de/hardwarelist.php" target="_blank">the KisMAC hardware compatibility page</a> that supports passive mode.

Once we've determined if your wireless nic will do passive mode I'll help you with using KisMAC.

So it does, I'll keep that in mind for the future. My use of the words 'demand' and 'request' were not quotes from Griffzane but descriptions meant to describe the difference between 'rudely ask' and 'politely ask' for help.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Okay, open KisMAC and in the Preferences select the Driver grouping. From the drop down menu pick "Apple Airport card, passive mode" and click the 'add' button to add it to the list of capture devices. If you don't have any other capture devices then remove them.
<br/>
<br/>
While you're in the perf window, go ahead and check all the 'Channel Hopping' boxes for each capture device because I've read the DS will use channel 14 even though I thought the FCC says you aren't supposed to in the US.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally for the driver prefs window, if you want to later take a look at the data capture you need to select the 'Keep everything' radio button in the 'Dump Filter' section.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, close the prefs window and click 'Scan' in the lower right of the main KisMAC window. KisMAC may prompt you for the administrator password to load the kernel module it needs to interface directly with your nic.
<br/>
<br/>
You should start seeing networks appear in the main KisMAC window. If you haven't already, power up your DS and go in a PictoChat chat room or the multiplayer part of a game where it's trying to send to other DS units. Basically such that the network transmit light is blinking.
<br/>
<br/>
Back in the main KisMAC window you should see a network appear with the SSID of "&lt;nossid&gt;". Double click on it and you'll probably see two lines, one for broadcast and the other for your DS. Your DS will have a MAC address that starts with: 00:09:BF . Click on the DS line and on  the left you can see some more info like what channel it is using. If you're wanting to capture packets for later analysis then I suggest you tell KisMAC to only sniff that channel from the Channel menu. If you don't see your DS or you're not seeing new data from it when you think you should then check the Channel menu to make sure KisMAC isn't only sniffing one channel.
<br/>
<br/>
That's about all I have to tell you about using KisMAC. It's not that exciting. The next step is to take the captured data and open it in Ethereal. To that you're gonna want to install Fink. Both of those are beyond this post.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know, I don't own a regular AirPort Card. I guess you're going to need to read the <a class="postlink" href="http://binaervarianz.de/projekte/programmieren/kismac/" target="_blank">KisMAC</a> docs or wiki.
