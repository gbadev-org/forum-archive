    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was fiddling with the thought of making a remote debugging tool that allows you to actually debug the Nintendo DS without having to buy a devkit.
<br/>
The WiFi connection isn't fast, but it should be fast enough for you to do some basic debugging. That is:
<br/>
<br/>
- Putting breakpoints: sends the line and breakpoint signal to a PC over the network. Then you can resume/step from that PC to a next breakpoint. Of course there wouldn't be real stepping(line per line) as this would become a lot more complex.
<br/>
<br/>
Something like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
void Funcion()
<br/>
{
<br/>
    printf("blaat");
<br/>
    triggerBreakpoint(); // regular breakpoint
<br/>
    printf("blaat");
<br/>
    debug_TriggerBreakpoint(some_value &gt; other_value); // conditional breakpoint
<br/>
}
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
- Simple variable content watching: when a breakpoint is triggered, you can see the content of certain 'marked' variables.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
void Funcion()
<br/>
{
<br/>
    int i = 2;
<br/>
    debug_WatchVariable(i); // update i through wifi
<br/>
    triggerBreakpoint(); // trigger breakpoint so you can see the content of i
<br/>
}
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Watching a variable could be buffered of course, since you probably don't want to send packages for each variable change. Eg. you could send them when you trigger a breakpoint or when this send buffer reaches its max.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any interest in such a library?<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah that would be nice :)

Thanks, I searched for "wireless debugger" before but couldn't find anything. The second search helped me find Masscat's topic:

Probably the single most useful thing I've ever written for the DS ;-)

The reason it got pulled in the end was because my contract says programming outside of work is a no-no.

Thanks for the link! (I'll read it after going out for lunch)

Stupid contract ... it's possibly not even legal to have that item in the contract.
<br/>
Officially my contract says that all code written in my spare time is property of the company, but that's (legally) bullshit too afaik. I had a talk with my boss about that and there's no problem at all. I can even start commercialising my projects, as long as I always pass by his office first.
<br/>
If this wasn't possible, I'd be looking for another job right now.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have the same, and I have checked up a bit on it. Apparently, that clause of my contract isn't strictly legally valid - at least not in Norway - unless (of course) I use company IP or reveal trade secrets. But that's already covered in other (and stricter) ways in my contract. I also checked up with some of the guys "further up" (my bosses, HR, and the legal department), and I've gotten a written permission for some of my hobby-projects, and a verbal guarantee (with witnesses, so I'm not worried about potential denial) that virtually nothing I do on my spare-time can or will be claimed by the company. I even got permission to use company code as long as I don't disclose it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In practice, it's the same where I work. They told me that too during the interview, but the contract states differently. It's not that I didn't read my contract before signing by the way, I just believed their words :) - plus I was more than happy to get that job so I didn't want to start argueing there :P

Same with company IP here, that's what they're afraid of to 'lose' and I definitely understand that.
<br/>
We can use the company code too, but we can't publish anything made with that as far as I know.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
