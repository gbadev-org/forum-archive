Yeah, they're just mockups I made, but it would be really cool of SEGA to bring this game to the DS. I think Jet Set Radio would be perfect on the DS. Heres my idea.
<br/>
<br/>
The game would basically be a port of the original dreamcast version with some added levels, bonuses, etc. I know the DS isn't as powerful as the Dreamcast, but I think the could make a decent version of this game. Judging from screenshots of the new Spiderman game (which is cel-shaded) I dont think the DS would have a problem with rendering cel-shaded graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
The top screen would be the main action window (render 3D) and the bottom screen would be for map and other 2D elements. When you are skating around you use primarily the top screen for playing while the bottom displays the map, time, health and other HUD elements. When you get to a point where you can tag-up, then the control swiches to stylus mode. You then have to gesture out the actually tag using the sylus (similar to the way the Dreamcast version played). I had tons of fun on the graffiti level of 'Feel The Magic' and I think this could translate well onto the JSR game. The game would display the outline of the piece and you would just have to fill it in (without going outside the lines). Each color would be automatically selected and you would have to do the steps in order (sketch the fill-in first, then add details, etc.). There could also be an option for "free-tag' which would allow you to tag pieces you created in the tag-editor, or even allow you to throw-up something quick just with the stylus. This could add a whole new dimention to the game.
<br/>
<br/>
There should also be a multiple player mode (up to 8 players) where you compete for the most points in 2 minutes. Points would be rewarded for not only the number of tags, but also the skill involved. So a large piece would get more poins than a quick throw-up. Also, tagging in hard to get places (like the side of a bridge) would recieve more points as well. This could even be online once the Nintendo WiFi is released. This would be great since you could actually see other player's original tags in the game. It would be awesome.
<br/>
<br/>
I really hope someone from SEGA is reading this and will actually put out this game. This is exactly the type of title that would sell systems (at least in Japan). Also, Marc Ecko's 'Geting Up' should be released soon and may be the proper time to ome out with other urban graffiti type games. Not only that, but it would be a perfect example of a game that couldn't be properly done on any other system.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only one that would love this game? Let me know what you guys think.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I appreciated the XBOX port, it would be great if Sega ported it to the DS and the graphics are such that it would be possible I think....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the did make a really chessy port of it to the GBA a little ways back, which was pretty good for the most part. I'm sure if they can do that, they could easily make a DS version</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Saying that Sega isn't going to make a Jet Set Radio for the DS is just like saying that Nintendo isn't going to make a Mario game for the DS because the GBA has one. And it would actually be 3D, not isometric.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not necessarily. The JSR franchise isn't <span style="font-style: italic">quite</span> as popular as the Sonic and Puyo Pop franchises, which are more comparable to the Mario franchise that you use in your analogy.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This seems feasable in my opinion... the Tony Hawk DS screenies look just as/about as good, hell, their even cel-shaded.

Nice mocks, and good luck... &gt;_&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
