<br/>
<br/>
The former would mean telling the other processor data is coming, and sending the data via FIFO.(This is for local wireless; I haven't started anything yet, that will be later, and that will be changing Wifi stuff in my WMB_Host mod)
<br/>
The latter means telling the other processor via FIFO that data is coming, the other processor replies with a pointer to memory which can be used for the data, then the sending processor copies the data into that address the other processor sent.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
