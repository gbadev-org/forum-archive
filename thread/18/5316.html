    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would be nice to have visual themes depending on the cart plugged in. For example it would take the image for Mario 64 DS and use those colors to create a theme for the background and buttons.  Maybe some nice classy background music playing in the menu. I guess we need to wait till we can actually do something about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Can the firmware only be the same size as the original? It would be nice if lots of the old features could be left in. Maybe Pictochat could be placed on a flash cart instead to free up space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be nice if you bought a Pocket PC instead of a Nintendo DS ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

also, I was under the impressino that one can modify their system as long as they don't use illegal code if, say the bios is modified. *scratches head about why thread was removed*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

H20 is called water unless you absolutely need to specify it's other properties for some reason :P
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good work and all, but anything anyone does to it would have to allow it to still run purchased games. Also I would like to see it not open doors for piracy, but clearly it will happen anyway. Not because I am super against piracy, would just like to see Nintendo get money rather than some one-eyed chinese pirate fool.
<br/>
<br/>
As for any future firmware replacing methods replacing the passme... I assume it would still be needed to run the code that replaces the firmware.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

Version 2.0 now up - guaranteed at least 100% more pleasing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just a habit from the overclocking weebsites that I use.
<br/>
Where we also use Denatured alcohol, methanol, salt mixtures, and other components mixed with water to improve the performance.
<br/>
These mixes are used when we are using temps below 0? C.
<br/>
So when it is JUST water then it is just H20.  : p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
