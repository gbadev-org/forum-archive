    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've searched and searched but I can't seem to be able to find the answers anywhere. I own a GBAMP and was thrilled when I read about being able to load DS homebrew from it, and since then I've been searching for any information I can on the subject, but have found very little. I found this little tutorial for setting it up, but it doesn't answer all my questions. Could someone please answer these questions for me?
<br/>
<br/>
1. Are there any big disadvantages to using the GBAMP for DS homebrew instead of a flash card?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Do I have to use the PassMe every time I want to play homebrew games/demos on the DS, or is it a one time thing?
<br/>
<br/>
3. Can you recommend anywhere to order a PassMe from?
<br/>
<br/>
4. Do I need a flash cart, or will the GBAMP and PassMe be enough?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. A couple homebrews wont work with gbamp because they try to load data from the flash cart. They can be recoded to load the data from the CF card instead, but this involves a little work. Most homebrew will work though.
<br/>
Also, the commercial demos don't work with gbamp. But this is being worked on, and they will probably be fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Yes, you need to use passme every time, UNLESS you patch your firmware with 'FlashMe.' Then you don't need passme any more (but you need passme to install it in the first place). Search forums for more info on flashme
<br/>
<br/>
3. Agree with above post
<br/>
<br/>
4. gbamp and passme will be enough to run most ds homebrew. (see point 1. though)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So now for the big question: $70 for the PassMe and 256Mb flash cart, or $25 for just the PassMe.... one is cheaper than the other, but with the other I get guaranteed compatibility with homebrews...
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing: Patching the firmware.... I think I saw a tutorial for this, something about removing the screw for the battery cover and doing some stuff with a small possibility of damaging your DS.... worth the risk?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">flashme is pretty foolproof, just make sure you DON'T turn of your DS unless it says that the firmware flashing is complete, if the percent stops going up when flashing don't worry about it you can keep going if you put whatever you're using back in and touch the contacts together again. (if you READ the instructions you will be fine...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so I think I may just try to find a wireless thingy that's compatible with that driver that was released by... um, Tim, was it? Unless it doesn't, for some reason, work with the GBAMP....
<br/>
Will cost more, but I can't seem to find anywhere to buy a PassMe, so I guess it doesn't matter.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the help.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Just one more batch of questions and then I'm done. I really want to know as much as I can about whatever it is that I'm about to dive into before I take the plunge.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Can I flash the firmware with wifi?
<br/>
2. Does FlashMe have any disadvantages, like some homebrew can't be run or something like that?
<br/>
3. For future reference, how do I go about flashing the firmware through the wifi (that is if the answer to Q1 is yes)?
<br/>
4. If I go the wifi route will I be able to get the GBAMP to work as storage for the homebrew, or does that require a PassMe?
<br/>
<br/>
That's all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyone with a PayPal premier account can take credit card payments even from people who are not PayPal members. I'll assume that dspassme.com has a premier account.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
-- You know, the human.

It wouldn't let me order without signing up with PayPal, and then doing something extra... don't remember what it was called and not sure how to explain it.
<br/>
I'll try again.
<br/>
<br/>
It worked!! Now, how long will it take for it to be delivered?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
