<br/>
I've been using Insight with the desmume emulator, and its run fine on Vista. Now, when I try to run it on XP, insight will not even start - no error message, output - anything! Has anyone had similiar issues. GDB runs fine on the vista machine.
<br/>
Cheers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
