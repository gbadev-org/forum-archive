    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have a silly question.. the passme grabs the header off of the cart you plug into it right? and then you point at a different memory location.. now if im not mistaken that header is at a predefined memory location and the start location for code off of a ds or gba cart to execute is at a different memory maped location? i also read that 32Mb is the max useable on the gba cart. not that any home brew would most likely need more than that but in theriory couldnt you have too connectors on the passme? one for an "offical" ds cart for the header and a second set of pins for either a gba cart or some sort of serial memory pluged in and have some sort of a logic gate rout to the "offical" at boot up and then have it look back onto the ds slot for its exicute statement , but have the chip already on the passme, or a logic gate on the io of the chip to bounch it to the other chip to get around the 32Mb limit? ... lol i hope i explained that in a maner that makes since... give me your comments!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

32 Mbits is the size of the DS's internal RAM. Homebrew programs using PassMe could load themselves entirely into RAM, or they could load assets from up to 256 Mbits of ROM as needed. If that's not enough, you could use the flash cart's bankswitching (if known) or pak-swap to access even more ROM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
