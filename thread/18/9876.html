    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!  I know people generally hate requests, but this is a simple one:
<br/>
<br/>
An app for ds that can be sent over wifi from WMB that will unstick pixels on ds systems.
<br/>
<br/>
I know there is a gba app for this but it doesn't reach to where the pixel is on my ds, and therefore, does nothing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dead pixel is a pixel that simply doesn't work anymore --&gt; it's dead.
<br/>
Sticky pixel --&gt; pixel that does not want to change any color (it just stays one color that you do not want).
<br/>
Stickies can (sometimes) be fixed by a certain way of putting power on them (I don't know that much about that).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll try to translate a bit (I don't know much about this so don't hit me if I translated wrong).
<br/>
Dead Pixel: These sensors do not read anymore data, these are therefore always off. This can be seen on your screen as a pixel that is black whilst anything else should be shown.
<br/>
Stuck pixel: These sensors are always on, they will always dislplay the maximum value (as a white birght pixel/spot).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Top left are a bunch of stuck pixels (you get the idea) and there are a bunch of dead ones spread all over.

The stuck pixels can be any color, as long as they are the maximum value, so ultimate bright green/red/blue are posibillitys.

The thing is that they stay that way.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Scorpei on Mon Jun 12, 2006 6:05 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Anyway, it's impossible to reach a stuck pixel on the border without a PassMe2 or NoPass. WMB doesn't work because homebrew is not signed by Nintendo.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">doesn't nerd of nerds have a flashcard for his DS?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Issues? Issues besides the fact that one needs to coat the shorting device on the sides (so that only the tip is exposed and able to make contact)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be the most knowledgable place to ask, though I don't know, but;
<br/>
<br/>
My DS lite has recently developed a stuck pixel. It's only visible as light blue on blue, green on dark blue, and a kind of red on orange. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know it's only one pixel, and not as annoying as one that's white or black, but I wanted to know if they can <span style="font-style: italic">always</span> be fixed, and if it's just a matter of leaving the fixer on for longer?
<br/>
<br/>
I've left it on for about 4 hours, to no avail, and just wondered if I was wasting my time.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe, sadly, it cannot always be fixed.

If a sensor is broken, it stays that way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
