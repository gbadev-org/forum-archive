Hi everyone !
<br/>
<br/>
I present you the small test I did with my DS !
<br/>
<br/>
While playing Brain Training, I noticed some strange flickering effect on the text on the top screen of the DS ...
<br/>
What made it was the fact that when you look this screen from above, dark grays become black, and from below clear colors become white !
<br/>
So i thought that if it was possible to make the left eye see only dark colors and the right eye only clear colors, it would be possible to display 3D stereoscopic pictures !!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is what i made, I interlaced stereoscopic pictures after making the left one dark and the right one clear !
<br/>
Here is an example ( you will see nothing on a PC Screen ):
<br/>

<br/>
And here the rom I made containing several pictures:
<br/>
<a href="http://sylfurd.free.fr/3DStereoEffect.rar" target="_blank">http://sylfurd.free.fr/3DStereoEffect.rar</a>
<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do is to turn your DS like in Brain Training ( goofy side, bottom screen to the left and top screen to the right  ), to look at the top screen from about 6 inches ( 15 cm ) away :)
<br/>
<br/>
Press A or B button to change the picture !!
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if it will work with all the DS, I think some have different screens ... Mine is one of the first DS of the european lauch :)
<br/>
And I don't know if everyone can see such a stereoscopic effect, I often practice stereoscopic pictures so it's easy for me !
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The effect is not gorgeous, is a bit strange, but is here :)
<br/>
Let me know what you think about it, if it work with yours !
<br/>
RealTime 3D with stereoscopy would be cool :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sylfurd on Tue Feb 14, 2006 8:36 pm; edited 6 times in total</span></div>

Thats what I have been thinking.
<br/>
Apperently a few japanise mobile phones have been using a "Paralax Barrier" techique for awhile (same one Sharp uses for its 3D Laptop).
<br/>
I see no reason why not to use the technique in the next wave of handhelds.
<br/>
<br/>
Thing is though, if the next GBA isnt going to come till 2008....then we might just get a bit more.
<br/>
Transprent organic LED's have been developed now, by 2008 they will easily be in use commercialy.
<br/>
As far as 3D goes, they will make "glass's" 3D very light, comfortable, and high quality. Better then that, because they are transperent you can have the full augmented reality :)  (real and virtual mixed however you like).
<br/>
<br/>
It remains to be seen how long it takes for the price to reach a consumer level though. 
<br/>
An portable AR device needs 2 OLED's screens as lens, a GPS (Gallio-accuracy),3 -angle gyroscopical sensors and then the best wireless comms aviable at the time (WiFi Max or maybe Software-Radio).
<br/>
<br/>
All of those technologys exist...its just a mater of price ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting technique :)
<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking about a stereoscope-viewer for the DS, although I was thinking about utilising the two screens for the "cross-eye" viewing technique.
<br/>
The cross-eye technique has many advantages, once you master the technique : true color-images, no extra hardware / glasses required.
<br/>

I decided seperate a picture every 2 horizontal lines but horizontal interlacing is not really important, it could be vertical interlacing or a mix of the two ( I'll try it, it may result in a better effect :) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Me too.
<br/>
<br/>
The side-effect of mastering the techique is it makes "Spot the Difference" puzzles amazingly easy :p

Just go cross-eyes and your brain kinda highlights differences as a flicker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
