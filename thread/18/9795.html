<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things, maybe I was just missing something, I had to setup manually the include and library directory to add ${DEVKITPRO}/libnds/include and ${DEVKITPRO}/libnds/lib.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I can't seem to make the indexer see the content of the files in the include directory of libnds.

For the libnds .. probably I can add a feature to the project creation wizard to add libnds automatically. You can also create a project called e.g. dummy. Set your common preferences there and just copy paste it if you are too lazy ;))

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey man, just finally got round to checking out your managed builder - it's good! If I didn't love writing makefiles so much I actually might use this!
<br/>
<br/>
For those who wanna debug, yeah Eclipse works really well with the debugger. The icing on the cake for this managed builder would be add a debug configuration to the run-&gt;debug menu to make it easier to set up GDB. One thing to note however if you do wanna use the debugger with this builder is that by default thumb code is generated, rather than arm. And you guys don't have a thumb debugger yet :-) Someone's gonna have to write one :-(

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using the Eclipse builder for a bit now and it seems okay...
<br/>
<br/>
Except that every now and then it (Eclipse) manages to b0rk everything completely and becomes unable to compile whatever project I'm working out, spouting inane errors about missing tokens and the like that make me wonder if it isn't somehow frying the files in a subtle way...
<br/>
<br/>
Except re-creating the project fixes the problem...
<br/>
<br/>
Very irritating...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll try. With any luck something will come of it...
<br/>
<br/>
I just get this sneaky suspicion that Eclipse is somehow trying to save the files in the wrong format or something and hence the compiler is having issues...
<br/>
<br/>
We'll see. I'm re-creating things using a handmade makefile, so we'll see if the changes are actually down to the managed builder, Eclipse or something else...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Hmmmmm, okay, so...
<br/>
<br/>
I had a function, I added code to it, it stopped working
<br/>
I commented out the function, copied a fresh version of it from the original source file, it works
<br/>
I add in my new code, it works...
<br/>
<br/>
It's a little weird, whatever's going on. It's not the managed builder, I think. It might have something to do with the source file I'm working with. Possibly there's some kind of UNIX/Windows formatting clash...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm pretty sure it's not the managed builder now, so no need to worry...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Seriously, the errors were bizarre, indicating problems on lines of code that I hadn't even touched...

And no, I didn't accidentally delete a ; or comment something out :-(

<br/>
Well, anyway, as long as it keeps working, I won't mind...

<br/>
EDIT: The problem is definitely with Eclipse. Maybe it doesn't like the JDK version I'm using, maybe it has some issues with the CDT version I'm on or perhaps it just really hates NTFS, but it looks like it's deciding the duplicate the last 5 or so lines of the app when I save. Which causes problems.

<br/>
Thank you for making this tool!

I'm new to eclipse and I'm trying it with the 4.0 CDT (RC3). It is working, but the .nds it generates is bigger than the one generated by Wintermute's makefile. 
<br/>
<br/>
The example I'm using is NeHe lesson 2. The .nds is 73kb in eclipse and 17kb in programmer's notepad 2 (Wintermute's makefile). Both files are valid roms, just wondering why this is happening.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think its because I use other compiler settings.

In "Project-Properties/C++ Build/Settings" you can change it.
<br/>
Try changing the Optimzing level and/or Tumb/ARM Mode
<br/>
<br/>
I hope I can find time to adapt the plugin to CDT4.0 with new features.

Hi sniper,
<br/>
<br/>
do you think it would be easy to support projects with both, an arm7 and an arm9 code (as in the combined template of DevkitPro)?
<br/>
<br/>
As I understand your current builder, it only supports either arm7 or arm9 (I tried it out once, it was already some time ago)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks sniper, you convinced me to give the CDT a chance again. 
<br/>
Currently, I'm living very good with the excellent Makefiles in DevkitPro (my respect to Wintermute for this), but miss the Editing/Navigation/Refactoring/etc features of Eclipse. 
<br/>
<br/>
Although external Makefiles are useable inside CDT, the managed projects have some kind of magic I'm used to in the JDT currently, so I would love to use them for C++ Development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe It's the ManagedMake part that I'm unsure about.   In this version of Eclipse, I right click in the "C/C++ Projects" view, and Choose "New", there's no option for ManagedMake like there was prior to Eclipse 3.3.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried use "C++ Project."  That prompts me to the configure the project with a name, type, and toolchain.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not really sure how to configure beyond this point, because it's different from your demo video.
<br/>
<br/>
Possible types are:
<br/>
"NDS ROM (eabi)" (lists a "GCC Toolchain".)
<br/>
"Makefile" (lists "GCC Toolchain" or "--Other)
