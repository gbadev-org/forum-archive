    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks! I didn't knew that webpage yet. Seems to contain some very useful info on the DSi (not only on the camera).
<br/>
<br/>
For the camera, I was thinkung that there are various configuration settings... like different picture resolutions, monochrome mode, or RGB and YUV modes, or such things - implemented at hardware side?
<br/>
<br/>
And almost certainly, there must be a bit for selecting between the two cameras.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only problem is, No DSi games can be dump with the DSi camera data,  This making it a very hard to test issue,  Only real carts and DSi can be used.
<br/>
<br/>
Until someone come up with a new dumper that can do so , shame.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
