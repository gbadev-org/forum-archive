    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking to do a hardware mod of the DS similar to <a class="postlink" href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/DS/jumbotron/" target="_blank">this</a>, however I do not have a clue on where to start looking on how the DS outputs information to the display, is it LVDS or something else?
<br/>
<br/>
Any points in the right direction would help. I sent the creator a email, but I have yet to get an answer.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help, and sorry for the long hiatus from the forums.

P.P.S I was just reading through my old posts and found my "essay" on doing wireless tunneling for the DS over the internet, I just posted it on digg for kicks, if anyone wants to see it <a href="http://digg.com/nintendo_wii/Pwned_by_Science" target="_blank">http://digg.com/nintendo_wii/Pwned_by_Science</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That Sharp LCD is nothing like the DS's... the resolution is wrong (and square), I believe it may be like the Advance's screen in that it is reflective, and it has a 80ms response time.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cuyb10fzdz2" target="_blank">Strummer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">Drummer?</a>.

Or maybe you would rather play with sand? <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?a05z5wmdvxm" target="_blank">Sandscape is for you in that case.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can image that the screen capture is rather slow considering it is done over COM port. Do you think it would be possible to hook up an USB or LAN adapter to the digilent board and send the screen data that way to the PC?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to make a mod like this in order to be able to make screenshots, but I don't understand much of electronics. We've started to do CAD stuff in school with software from Cadence. That is related to Verilog, right?
<br/>
<br/>
I assume you need some sort of software on the PC to receive the screenshot data. Did you write it yourself?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, the Game Boy line has a lot of Sharp parts in it.

How hard would it be to get the FPGA to spit out an NTSC signal?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
