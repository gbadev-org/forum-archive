    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been on a break from my project due to work, but I'm starting to work on it again. I have a couple of problems with it though which I need sorting out first. I think they're both down to just how I've setup my project.
<br/>
<br/>
The first is a problem with libfat. I'd been using and older version with a couple of problems but I could live with them. I started getting the project ready for a demo though and wanted to sort this out. I downloaded the latest version of the lib from the depository and tried to update my devkitpro/ndslib installs too but now I can't get the built code to work.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried downloading various zip/rar files that I could find for the fat lib in and now have a handful of different versions, but I can't seem to get any to work now, even when trying to go back to the versions I had before.
<br/>
<br/>
When I say the code won't work I mean Dualis crashes when trying to run on the fatInitDefault function (i think that was the name). My code doesn't run at all on the DS hardware, even before, and that's an issue I'll be trying to solve after this one.
<br/>
<br/>
Really I'd just like to know what version of each lib I should be running, so that I can make sure my installs are correct. Also is there a good project that uses the fat lib I can download the source to and use as a reference? I'd like to compare make files so I can see mine is setup correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure this is just a stupid noob problem I'm having, but any help would be appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm using the version of libfat tweaked by dragonminded (which is rooted on chishm's library). I tweaked it again myself so that the device present in the emulator is tested first (it takes long enough to the emulator to see it's there, no need to wait for it to probe missing virtual hardware).
<br/>
<br/>
I tweaked it too so that all CF equipment is scanned before any SD test is done (SD is _way_ slower to access and to probe), and made sure the SD card i own is the first one checked in the list ^_^

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply. I'm going to try it again tonight, I'll let you know how I get on. I may upload the source code somewhere too if I keep having problems.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I just want to add I really appreciate all the work chrism has put into these libs! I've had it working before and it was brilliant, just wish I hadn't busted it somehow ;(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
