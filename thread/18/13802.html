Thank you for this new build!

Now I can implement all changes I have already done with old dsdoom version:<ul>
<br/>
<li>small menu to choose between wad type (doom shareware, doom1, doom2, tnt, plutonium, chex)
<br/>
</li><li>changed standard path dependent on wad type for wad files (/data/dsdoom/) and save files (/data/dsdoom/ +wadtype): doom/; doom1/; doom2/; tnt/; plutonium/; chex/
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>

it explains itself. I think there would be a good over-all response from anyone who likes this game. maybe along with some kind of fully customizable controls, so anyone could play it how they want.
<br/>
<br/>
we're all, after all, used to something different.
<br/>
<br/>
just thought I'd run it by someone who makes updates to this lovely brew.

Can you supply a patch?
<br/>
<br/>
If you're using TortoiseSVN this is just a matter of right clicking in the folder &amp; using the "Create patch" oprion of the TortoiseSVN context menu. If you're using command line subversion then svn diff &gt; dsdoom.patch should do the job.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Am I the only one that doesn't like having the map on the bottom screen?  Then you can't configure your controls so that you can zoom it in and out, which is important since the map cannot display natively at 256x192 and looks all screwy.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, for DSdoom without the map, I have...
<br/>
<br/>
Start - bring up menu, which pauses the game
<br/>
select - bring up map
<br/>
A - shoot/select menu item
<br/>
B - open door/zoom out map/close menu
<br/>
X - run/zoom in map
<br/>
<br/>
R, L, and Y are the same as the default.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Though, it would actually be better if we could somehow have some bilinear (is trilinear even possible?) filtering on the map like Lameboy does in the second zoomed mode.  Then you wouldn't have to zoom in and out to see those walls and parts that aren't showing up.  Darn you Nintendo for not going just a little farther and using the most standard small screen resolution: 320x240! :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For one thing, multiplayer works, and another thing, chex quest has the same exact weapons/enemies/items except different textures (I was tempted to call them... models? lol).
<br/>
So multiplayer on Doom is the exact same as Chex Quest, albeit there's no gore. (and possibly different maps, but I'm unaware if Chex Quest came with its own deathmatch maps.)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Luckily for you that means you can use most MP3 decoders and I'm sure there are more than a few which can run entirely on the arm7.
<br/>
<br/>
All you need to do is:
<br/>
1) Extract MIDIs
<br/>
2) Run them through timidity and output as wav
<br/>
3) Convert to MP3/MP2
<br/>

Yeah, some mods have more than one .wad, but as far as I know, dsdoom can only load one at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe using Lick's directory searching project, someone could make Doom search for .wad files, and add the name of the folder to the wad selector at the beginning.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, this is how you run Mods for doom on DSDoom.
<br/>
1. Download Wintex 5.0. Here is a link: <a class="postlink" href="ftp://drsleep@server1.thefourwinds.net/data/wintex50.zip" target="_blank">ftp://drsleep@server1.thefourwinds.net/data/wintex50.zip</a>
<br/>
2. Unzip(duh)
<br/>
3. Copy your doom2 file and your Pwad(mod) file into your Wintex folder.
<br/>
4. Open up wintex and it should say: Please select the main wad file of doom2. Select the doom2 wad you put in the wintex folder.
<br/>
5. Now you should see a button that says "Merge into Iwad". Select your Pwad and then click "merge". It should show some warnings, just click Okay on all of them.
<br/>
6. It should have merged your pwad into doom2. Now rename it to one of the wads and put it on your microSD. 
<br/>
7. Your done!
<br/>
<br/>
A bit of a note though, DSDoom really only runs Vanilla Doom iwads, meaning, it doesn't run any wad with a DEHACKED patch(modded weapons, monsters..) and most certainly not ACS(Zdoom script). So if your pwad has a DECORATE, SCRIPTS or DEHACKED lump, it won't work properly.
<br/>
<br/>
2 wads I suggest for playing with DSDoom are Hell Revealed and Alien Vendetta.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Hell Revealed and Alien Vendetta don't seem to save, DSDoom crashes every time I attempt to. Bugfix please? :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Saving and loading work fine for me as well, including in merged pwad&gt;iwads.
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't able to get the WinTex program working on my computer, but I searched a bit and found another solution with a different Doom editor app called Patcher.  The command line "patcher.exe mer &lt;input iwad&gt; &lt;input pwad&gt; &lt;output iwad&gt; /I" generates working merged wads.  Of course, there's still no way to get the dehacked stuff in, but all the wads I've tried so far had .DEH file that I just ignored and so far they seem working.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a big fan of Doom, but I do like some of the mods that are available like the WolfenDOOM series or A Fistful Of Doom, so the ability to play mods is great for me.  Hopefully, they'll be properly supported in the future since that would take up less space on my flash card and also have .DEH support.  There's nothing actually preventing pwad compatibility in this port is there?  It's just a matter of someone having the time to implement it, right?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is the first time I've tried out DSDoom and I must say it's running very nicely.  The only thing that really needs to be improved is the automap, because of the rescaling walls are often not visible which sort of defeats the purpose of a map.  How about just displaying it at the original resolution (320x200, right?) and cutting off 32 lines on each side?  Doesn't seem like that would be any problem.

Yes it is,you just need to download a wad editor (I use wintex but slumped and xwe are good too).and edit prboom.wad for an example check my tutorial video
<br/>

<br/>
If you want mods that are already complete
<br/>
(Cdoom64 from skulltag)
<br/>
(dsdoom3 demo6)
<br/>
(doom3 weapons)
<br/>
(sdoom2)
<br/>
(knee deep in dsdoom)
<br/>
These wads are all made with dehacked to insure ultimate quality (not just crappy sprite replacements)

and whatever you can find on my site &gt;&gt; <a href="http://dsdoommods.lefora.com/forum/" target="_blank">http://dsdoommods.lefora.com/forum/</a> &lt;&lt;
<br/>
You are even free to suggest Ideas.
<br/>
If you need help creating your own dsdoom wad feel free to PM me anytime I'll offer my support.I've been also talking over with alexander and we might be porting an older version of zdoom to the ds (with some other features such as mapinfo support and a cross between dehacked and decorate)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/1987-bmw-750il/" target="_blank">1987 bmw 750il</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/2003-bmw-m3-csl/" target="_blank">2003 bmw m3 csl</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
