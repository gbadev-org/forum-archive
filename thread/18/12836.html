    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's show off time again :-)
<br/>
I've finally got Quake2 properly running on the DS and I thought I'd post a quick (and crappy) YouTube video. I am still getting Q1 pre2 ready, it's just that I wanted to take a break!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, linky: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu4VczrZBdQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu4VczrZBdQ</a> (will be up in a few mins)
<br/>
<br/>
In case you're worried, this is exactly the same kind of performance that I had when I first had Q1's software renderer running on the DS. However, I'm still not confident that similar performance can be obtained with this game - there's just too much strain on the system this time.
<br/>
This is more of a proof-of-concept, showing that a full-blown game can be run of the extended RAM provided by slot-2 solutions. Yeah, I know all about the 8-bit write problem :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Kinda worried about properly working on this game though, as Q1 has pretty much taken my free time for the last five months!
<br/>
<br/>
Comments? ;-)

Still, that reminds me of one problem with switching from SW to HW in Q2: Garish lighting. Being one of the first games to use 3d accel and coloured lighting, it looked like bloody disco half the time.

Basically I do this stuff as where I live there is *nothing* to do so I'm just killing time till I move house :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Dunno about the eight-meg Opera expansion - it was pretty damn hard getting this to run in 36 megs! Really, the game should only require about half of that (or even less) but the lack of virtual memory means the game is chewing up loads when it shouldn't do. Hell, I can only load one level so far! But I said all the same things when I started Q1 so who knows how it'll work out!
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I'm pretty concerned about it the lack of VRAM - 512k isn't enough for Q1 and in Q2 there's gotta be like 5-10x more data which needs to be loaded as a texture!
<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, if we get proper Q2 gaming those PSP homebrewers are gonna wanna go one-up on us (like usual) so they will be pretty much forced to make Q3A work! Which I guess I'll have to respond to by porting that too ;-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Rofl.. Yeah way to go !! :)
<br/>
<br/>
So as I see it the major task for Q2 is getting the bigger textures to work ? Or is polycount an issue in your opinion. Cause if its "only" (yeah I know only does not mean its simple in any way ;) ) textures just choose the path of using lower res textures...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#123344 - simonjhall - Tue Mar 27, 2007 2:25 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah that's just one of the problems.
<br/>
There are a few issues which could mean it's a bridge too far for the DS. eg,
<br/>
- the split memory architecture makes things a little tricky if you want performance, as this slot-2 memory is slow
<br/>
- Q2 likes MMUs, so will need a bit of coaxing to fix that
<br/>
- the Q1 binary is pretty huge, but Q2 is nearly twice that! That means that all the custom tools which I wrote for Q1 can't really be used as they will inflate the program size even more
<br/>
- Q2 requires more VRAM than Q1 (and I've already lowered the texture resolution in that)
<br/>
- I'd imagine the polygon count is higher
<br/>
- level load times are seriously poor so tiny changes will require a 2-3 minute reboot to test
<br/>
- I've gotta do all the same little things to Q2 as I did to Q1 - there are *loads* of such things, and that is where I've spent a lot of the time
<br/>
<br/>
Need a team of people to help me on this one!
<br/>
<br/>
May as well skip Q2 and go straight for Q4 ;-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, easy to check. Just make it fullscreen (1280x1024) and the weapon is not pixelated or anything. It even partially goes through enemies and stuff :)

They just haven't animated the model better thus it looks like its 4 frames.<br/>_________________<br/>My DSQuake video: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03wz7nmaXa8" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03wz7nmaXa8</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@ravey - it's the original Q2 sources. Tbh I never even considered that there may be a better implementation out there which I could use! Last time I tried to use another source (PocketQuake), it was a complete waste of time.
<br/>
And you're right - stripping it down and DS-ifying it is gonna be quite a lot of effort. I may as well just write off 2007 in terms of free time if I start working on this game!
<br/>
<br/>
@ant6n - obviously doing that ain't gonna make it hit 60fps, but I think it could definately be worth a try! May have to have a go later... And if I disable texture maps it normally doubles in speed too... Good thinking, Batman!
<br/>
<br/>
For those who are wondering why this game on your 66MHz DS is getting owned in terms of performance against your Pentium 1 @ 66, it's due to the lack of a floating-point unit. If Nintendo had equipped the DS with a math co-pro the game would run at least ten times faster than this.
<br/>
Y'know - just for kicks I'm gonna compile whetstone for the DS just to see what result I get ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: for those interested, a 45-second run on my 2.4GHz A64 gives 2222 million (double) whetstones. A 42 second run on my 66MHz DS gives 7.1 million (double) whetstones.
<br/>
Surprisingly higher than I expected...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or at least a game which looked like Q3A. Goodness knows how much of the original code or assets were reused in the conversion.

I'm not saying it's impossible to get a game on the PSP or DS which looks and plays like Q3, but it would take a lot of time to work the original code into shape.

This is an early demo of Halo 2 for NIИTENDO's Game Boy Advance handheld video game system. It was leaked to me by one Gus Nomeles, who alleges that all of Halo 2 is in this ROM. It seems to have pretty good anti-emulator protection, as it doesn't run at all in No$gba, and it slows down and clicks in VisualBoyAdvance.

Are you planning on doing some kind of ad-hoc lib or just coding it into quake? Or both? (code into quake then make a library...) Personally the only thing I care about having ad-hoc at the moment is Quake :P Not to mention ad-hoc would put your port leagues above the 'other' one...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, just an update on this (dunno why I'm doing this!)
<br/>
Thought I'd get off my arse this weekend and check out the Q2 code on my PC. I've not done a lot of work on it in the last six months, besides fix the load times. They were so slow that working on it is completely unproductive, as you've gotta sit around and surf the net for three minutes until you can get it to crash again!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here's some info for those who care
<br/>
- the game now takes about a minute to load (once the program has started)
<br/>
- the world is now rendered with the DS' 3D hardware; the framerate looks very playable
<br/>
- I'm an inch away from getting texturing in
<br/>
- no models, GUI, etc
<br/>
- the proper palettes are in (hence I can now nearly texture), as are the game fonts
<br/>
- I've got the RAM usage down to a pretty low level. The existing system required an MMU and (virtually) allocated memory in a crazy way. One problem I had before I sorted this out was that I could *just* squeeze a demo into 32 + 4 megs. After looking into it I realised that 70% of that memory was actually going to waste! The *demos* ought to run in ~10 meg of RAM now.
<br/>
- it's 8-bit write hell, and I'm gonna have to go strb hunting to sort that out!
<br/>
<br/>
No promises, but there's a chance I may actually work on this properly :-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though it's nothing special by today's stadards, I grew up on Quake2 and was amazed by the graphics at the time - 3dfx was just becoming popular (at least where I lived) - and it was amazing for it's time with nice smooth graphics and excellent gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
Even more amazing is that you've somehow managed to squeeze most of that goodness, that used to only run on 'top of the line PCs' into a device the size of my wallet.
<br/>
<br/>
In case nobody has said it lately, thank you for the amazing contributions you make to the DS homebrew community!

And no I'm not sure if the DS can handle this, as I'm disappointed by the in-game performance. I can't remember if this original game was like this, so can't really compare with this game... On the flip side Q2 doesn't seem to have the massively inefficient VM that the Q1 has, so you can expect a cosy 10ms/frame back :-)

Also I've still not decided whether I'm actually gonna go to town on it, like the other game. I don't really wanna spend another year reverse-engineering code...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did a load of Q2 today, and I've decided to make a quick video (with me actually playing it) and stick it up your youtube, in order to show those "OMG 1fps!!1112" naysayers that the Quake2 on the DS is a very real possibility.
<br/>
So anyway, here's me buzzing around the entry level. It's surprisingly hard to make a video of the DS, as well as use it at the same time :-)
<br/>
The reason I never actually shoot the bad guys is cos I can't reach the L shoulder button due to the makeshift camera mount I made!
<br/>
<br/>
The framerate is still crap, but this time it's not due to the software renderer taking all the cycles. This time all the rendering's on the GPU, but the CPU hog is all the floating-point code used to set up the rendering.
<br/>
Also the white pop-in is when the game runs out of VRAM and some new textures need to load in, so something has to be freed.

Yeah, and the same problem exist in QuakeDS. I had a plan for hiding this by averaging all texels in a texture at load-time. This would unfortunately increase the loading-times a bit, but it would make the missing textures less annoying as a constant color could be used instead of a white color.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or, since everything is kind of gray/brown/bronze anyway, just arbitrarily picking one of those and making everything the same color would be less noticeable than white. The original Quake was very similar as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I must say I'm very impressed. Fantastic work and indeed quite playable even without the optimizations. And it looks great too! It's actually running better than I remember it on some old PCs I've seen (granted, I keep remembering an old 486 laughably trying to run it, which was about the same as the original QuakeDS 2 preview). This really gives me high hopes that it's possible to run on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, my primary concern is how to actually play the game. In the original, you just had to worry about moving, aiming, shooting, jumping, and weapon switching. All can be handled pretty well with the DS. However, now add in crouching, swimming, item/inventory control and activation, and jetpack support, and things get quite a bit more complicated for a handheld that's already pretty maximized in input utilization. This will certainly be interesting to see how much can actually work. But of course, I'm jumping ahead a bit. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Since crouching isn't as important as most other functions, the only place I could think of putting it was on the touch screen.

Imho Metroid's controls are the only way to fly when doing stylus-mouselook. I don't know about you, but for me holding the stylus incapacitates me from using the ABXY and R buttons. So for QuakeDS it was a choice between mouselook or having multiple buttons, as I couldn't find any options for tapping and doubletapping the stylus in the configuration, so I went with ditching stylus-mouselook and just using L and R for strafing, A for freelook (using the D-pad), B for fire, X for change weapon and Y for jump. I can't really pull off more than normal difficulty though, as it's a bit like playing an FPS on a console (Metroid and Halo players will feel my pain).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
As for binding functions to the face buttons, I suggested that because they're functions that are less important so that you can momentarily take a pause from aiming to press them and get back to firing. You still have the ability to run as well. I find it better than cluttering up the touch screen even more.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

In all seriousness, it may require something like Select to be used. Which would also require menu navigation to be tweaked from how it's currently implemented on QuakeDS to using something like A for accept and B for cancel. Start could still bring it up, though (maybe even pause the game as well). Otherwise, one of the other buttons will probably have to pull double duty.

    <h4>#146545 - MechaBouncer - Wed Dec 05, 2007 5:49 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Because there are those of us out there that despise double tapping a touch screen for an important function like jumping. In the Quake days, jumping is how you dodge (not to mention rocket jumping). It seems to be forgotten in a lot of games as of late and considered an afterthought. Here are the reasons I hate double tapping the touch screen to jump:
<br/>
<br/>
1. It's more difficult than just pressing a button. Lifting the stylus and dropping it back down again is a more complex movement, and one I find quite unnatural. This added complexity results in it taking longer than just pressing a button. The same goes for repeated jumps, where it just compounds the problem (just try bunny hopping with it).
<br/>
<br/>
2. It throws my aim off every time I do it. Because you have to lift the stylus away from aiming and tap it back down, I effectively can't aim at all through the time it takes to perform the jump. Then I have to recover my aim to fire again. However, if I am trying to dodge, this pretty much means I can't do anything else because all effort will be in trying to jump instead.
<br/>
<br/>
3. It's unreliable. The detection isn't perfect, and while it's okay enough to do it when you want to, it's even easier to do it when you don't want to. With the frantic pace of a FPS game, you're aiming all over the place. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to quickly aim at something else, only to jump.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying using a button is perfect, either. As pointed out, it's also difficult to use the R button to jump by curling my pinky around it (I have small hands), but it does allow you to jump and aim at the same time. It also helps that I bought an extending metal stylus that adds another .75" to it. The Thylus sounds like a cool idea as well, but I wonder if it would interfere with using the thumb for pressing buttons. Ideally, I wish the DS had additional second L2 and R2 buttons (and the PSP for that matter), but that's not going to happen. Hell, even a single touch screen "Jump" button would be more effective than double tapping. At least then it's a simpler action and more reliable.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

<br/>
I can tell you how many times I have.  Absolute zero.  Another possible solution is to use buttons in the corners of the screen that can be reassigned.  They would be really, really small buttons and would only activate if the stylus were to touch down and touch up on them.  I'm sorry, but the R button is truly impossible to hit without using a stylus that doesn't fit in the DS.  The thumbstrap that was supplied with the DS Phat was good for this, but the DS Lite didn't have one.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cuyb10fzdz2" target="_blank">Strummer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">Drummer?</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which is why I bought a cheap metal stylus that is the same size as the DS Lite's normally (so it fits in place perfectly), but will extend .75" longer. It works pretty well. I was able to get a 4 pack (one of each color) for less than $4 USD. Cheap, effective, and pretty durable too. I also took the thumbstrap off my old DS and put it on my Lite, but it doesn't work very well because of the short strap, large and imprecise surface when trying to press small touch buttons, and it interferes with pressing the ABXY buttons with my thumb. The Thylus would be more effective for most cases.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

How big are these changing textures, typically? I'm guessing the fragmentation occurs because there isn't enough room to just load them all for the particular models. And I didn't realize that the DS had such weirdly sized VRAM banks until I looked it up. Although, are only the first 4 banks (512KB total) available for textures? I guess that would further limit it. Sorry, I'm just really curious about this.
<br/>
<br/>
If it really comes down to it and there are no other options, I don't think I'd have a problem with it not changing the textures to the battle-damaged versions. The fact that the game runs on the DS at all is the best part.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <h4>#146610 - simonjhall - Thu Dec 06, 2007 8:37 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One phat post about texture management:
<br/>
<br/>
If you ever had a go with the first release of Q1 you may remember that the models were pink, but the rest of the world was textured? The reason for this is that the world and brush model textures can relatively easily be loaded and fit into the DS VRAM (banks ABCD are used), and it's even easier to get working since the textures are already MIP'ed - so if there are too many textures for a level, the next quality level down can just be loaded. The textures were loaded when the level was loaded.
<br/>
The model textures added a world of problems, which was why I waited quite a while to get them into the game. They're pretty big, they have odd sizes, they sometimes use transparencies and models can have more than one 'skin' (for instance there is one armour model, but it has ~3 skins, one for each type of armour pickup) and models can also have animated skins! Complicated...
<br/>
<br/>
Since there could be any number of different models in a level (each with different texture requirements) it is not feasible to load in the textures when the level is loaded. With Q1 I could load only 2-3 full-res skins along with a level's worth of half-res world textures. Each of the 10 ish gun models have a texture, there are 5-10 types of pickup and about 5-10 different types of bad guy. That's a lot of textures!
<br/>
<br/>
So the solution I came up with was to register a texture's details when the relavent model or world surface was loaded (when the level changes), instead of actually loading the texture into memory. Details would include what type of texture it was (from RAM, from disk, or always resident (like the crosshair)), where it could be found (RAM address or seek pos within a file + file handle), sizes and transparency details.
<br/>
<br/>
When the relavent model is rendered it tries to bind the texture the game says should be used. If it's resident in memory the GPU will be told to bind that texture, if not some 'other' action is performed (I turn off texturing and set it white) and the request for that texture is flagged. When it comes to the end of the frame it checks to see if any texture loads were requested and those textures are loaded during the really short window where you can play with VRAM without making the screen flicker. The next time that model is rendered (probably the next frame) the texture can be bound properly as it's already in memory and the object gets textured correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
However if there is insufficient VRAM available to load a texture then an old one gets discarded and the new one gets slotted in its place. This can lead to fragmentation of the texture memory which is why you can see the Q2 vid I posted flashing white a few times since lots of textures were flushed at once. This 'flushing old textures' scheme works pretty well since the textures that are normally dropped are the textures for the parts of the world that you can no longer see.
<br/>
<br/>
The sound system also has a similar setup. Only the most recent ones are kept in the tiny cache managed by the ARM7 and old sounds get dropped so new ones can be loaded in.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the cool thing about managing constrained systems like this is that you can defrag the memory in the background when the system is idle. So say it's vblank time and there are no textures to load - texture data can be moved around to reduce fragmentation...
<br/>
<br/>
You did ask how it works :-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Too bad the DS doesn't feature texture compression or anything like that. I guess the only thing that can be done is dropping the resolution. To be honest, I had no idea you were doing that on QuakeDS. It's so small to begin with that I don't think people would really notice. Perhaps you could reduce them further?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

<br/>
<br/>
But yeah Q2 is currently using full-res textures everywhere, hence the VRAM swapping! They're compressed in PCX format so I'll have to decompress them before down-scaling them which is something I don't think there will be enough to do in the tiny gap after the vblank... I'll have to do it at load time (and keep the textures resident in main memory) or something...

It does. Hardware LZ77 decompression. But the texture needs to be already compressed of course, and since QuakeDS uses standard quake files to load, the resulting textures are uncompressed (or at least not compressed in the format that the DS hardware eats). Compressing those realtime on the DS just for the sake of having more VRAM space would probably just slow things down terribly. For Quake2DS, it might be an idea to do some preprocessing on a PC to create a DS-optimised PAKfile with compressed and/or resized textures, precompiled models and such.

However, that's not as bad an idea as it sounds - you could totally compress stuff during the dead time at the end of the vblank. Or it could just be done by the ARM7. When it's compressed the old one is removed and the new smaller one is inserted in its place.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is a tiny amount of RAM :0
<br/>
<br/>
However, I could see that if they were to increase the amount of memory they might also want to increase the memory bandwidth too. As it stands the programmer can access every byte in memory in ~1/10th of a second. If they were to increase the memory size (without increasing the speed) to say 32 meg it'd take an entire second to access all the memory! They can't encourage developers to use the memory if it'll take a lot of their frame time to actually get a hold of their data (since they now have so much data). Y'know what I mean? They would have to increase the memory bandwidth by a factor of eight to cancel out the slowdown incurred by having eight times as much memory to play with.
<br/>
<br/>
Also they'd probably want to increase the data cache size or its associativity to make the cache more effective for the larger memory size. All these things would add up in cost and reduce their profit. And I'm sure the CPUs in the DS cost pennies to make ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the thousands of games available for the DS so far have shown that 4MB is plenty!
<br/>
<br/>
(as another example of the bandwidth thing, it takes me over FIVE SECONDS to walk the RAM in my 32 meg Supercard - that is insanely slow)

The game speed is pretty playable (but pretty poor in places) and a lot of the graphical issues have been sorted out. I've played through the first 3-4 levels and it's ok on a 16 meg card. For now, 8MB isn't enough. I am loading in a lot of extra data though that's not necessary which I could drop to make it work on people who only own the Opera expansion, but I don't think there are enough people to jusify the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the stuff that takes ages and makes all the difference probably won't be doable for xmas. eg
<br/>
- gui
<br/>
- hud
<br/>
- control customisation
<br/>
- game loading/saving
<br/>
- runthroughs of the game to see problem areas
<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna aim to ensure that it works on slot-2-only solutions. At the moment it'll only work on a slot 1/2 combo as that's easier. Also there's no sound, and I'd really like to just drop in my Q1 sound system...

Exactly!
<br/>
<br/>
The problem here is not so much that the DS can't handle this kind of thing. Games like Metroid Prime Hunters and so forth more than prove that.
<br/>
<br/>
The real problem is that Quake 2 was designed with PC's in mind, not consoles like the DS and hence, off the bat, it's not massively suited towards a DS port.
<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't mean a port is impossible, it's just difficult as Simon has shown :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

<br/>
<br/>
In terms of RAM usage I'm not surprised that the game runs in low-memory configurations like on the N64 (not sure of the PSX). If the static model data and the program were in ROM then not a lot of memory would be required. If for the DS I could have all the world and model data in an instantly-available read-only format, I'd be sorted.
<br/>
Since I can't distribute a 200MB ROM card, y'all are gonna need a 16+ MB RAM card!

<br/>
I meant that if the models were in an addressable place in memory there wouldn't be much use for extra RAM. The only reason it needs X MB of RAM on machines which have no ROM is cos the files need to be loaded from disk into the memory. If this was to be done for the DS I'd have to make a 200MB ROM but doesn't the GBA interface let you have only 32MB? If so, a ROM would be a no-go!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok ok, I wanna share with you an *amazing* piece of code within the Q2 save system. I've spent the last three hours tracking this down and as a result, I'm pretty...disappointed.
<br/>
<br/>
So I just upgraded the game to C++ from C, fixed all the endless casting errors, float-&gt;int warnings etc. I run the game and the demos starting running straight away. Score. I go into the game...cue obscure message on the console...ok...and the game hangs. The exception handler won't kick in, the debugger doesn't trap it...nice.
<br/>
After ages I realise that arguments to functions are getting corrupted but it actually turns out that functions are getting entered mid-function! Weird!
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it seems that when the game loads a save file (either auto-saved, quick-saved or a regular save) all the function pointers associated with the entities in the game are dumped to disk. When the game is reloaded all the function pointers are restored and the game keeps on going.
<br/>
However, what happens if the executable changes between saving/loading? None of the function pointers line up! One crashy game :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, wtf. This means that save files won't be compatible from PC-&gt;DS, DS-&gt;PC, one major DS version to another, or even from one build to the next!

Even if the game didn't use function pointers, or the implicit function pointers in most C++ compilers' implementation of virtual methods, what would happen if the layout of a struct were to change between builds?

Tbh I'm actually selling it kinda short - Q2 is made of several components, one of which is 'the game'. On the PC the game is loaded in separately as a dll to a fixed address, and accessed from there. It's this that all the function pointers point to, so as long as 'the game' doesn't change (they can change the renderer, the sound system - anything) then it's ok. But in many targets in the source package this DLL system isn't an option (and I've configured it that way for the DS, too) so you can't change anything without invalidating the save files.
<br/>
Maybe I need to write some kind of DLL system for the DS (ugh)
<br/>
...or I could just write a virtual function mapper of some sorts...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, I'm assuming you're going to resize the HUD.  I'm also assuming that you're going to keep it on the top screen, seeing that putting in on the top of the bottom screen would probably be pretty hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Those are awesome screens Simon. I don't know how you manage get Carmack's arcane code running on the humble DS. I've got a few questions.
<br/>
<br/>
1. I presume the initial release will run just the single player element of the original game and no multiplayer component.
<br/>
2. I presume the minimum requirement with be a slot1+ram pack combo. Is there any noticeable speed difference between any of the currently available combo's r4+ez3-1&gt;cyloc+ewin etc..? What is the kit of choice?
<br/>
3. Later levels of Quake brought the framerate to its knees. Is this still the case with Quake2? I'd guess that the later bsps are exponentially bigger than any of the Quake 1 levels.
<br/>
4. Quake2 had opengl support from the get go. Has this helped in the conversion and use of the DS 3D hardware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I still play the QuakeDS multiplayer so its not been a flop with me. Admittedly I play 1v1 against a bot on small-ish DM maps but it plays a treat. The vanilla QuakeDS build is super speedy. So all that hard work getting the net code up and running wasn't in vain from my perspective.

perhaps it's safe to say the same might be true of the DS's iteration of the game? I say try for it, if it's not more hassle than it's worth. might prove to be a winner.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But on the plus side, the rest of the game is pretty much there now.

What's left to do:

- sprites aren't rendered

- lasers aren't rendered
<br/>
- view weapon clips the gui
<br/>
- the key config menu doesn't fit on the screen
<br/>
- game saves don't work correctly (it's a directory listing issue, not a file saving issue)
<br/>
- osk needs to go in
<br/>
- needs some testing on the different flash cards
<br/>
- only two levels don't load, and they're not due to being short on RAM
<br/>

A 16 meg card is the minimum.

Since I doubt you're recompiling the dlls yourself try reinstalling the game dll (it'll be inside the game directory and named something like gamex86.dll) and having a look around to see if the game has loaded another dll instead (ie there's one on the path that shouldn't be there).

actually i was also compiling my own mods for q2 back then, but that had no influence on the behaviour (i allways had the original .dll at hand). sort of sucks i can't complete kingbin and the q2 mp! was nearly done with the first one (player couldn't die too often). thw: it looked pretty random to me, because most of the time everything worked and then POP! in your face, won't load.

<br/>
So I've been working for a while now to multithread Q2 by sticking bits of the renderer on the ARM7 whilst I run the game on the ARM9.
<br/>
Well I've sorted out the memory arrangements sufficiently to allow me to do what I want to do now, and to in particular time the code when running on the second core.
<br/>
<br/>
BSP traversal on a complicated scene:
<br/>
- ARM9, from slow RAM, cached, 15.5ms / frame
<br/>
- ARM9, from main RAM, cached, 14.5ms / frame
<br/>
- ARM7, from slow RAM, uncached, 20.5ms / frame (THUMB)
<br/>
- ARM7, from main RAM, uncached, 19.5ms / frame (THUMB)
<br/>
- ARM7, from main RAM, uncached, 14.2ms / frame (ARM)
<br/>
<br/>
Ha ha! Anyone want to draw any conclusions?
<br/>
Both processors have the code running from either itcm or wram, with the ARM9 in ARM mode. The recursion stuff has been flattened into a manually-done stack that lives in either dtcm (ARM9) or WRAM (ARM7). There's no floating-point code in use - it's all in integer. Compiled with -Os. The slot-2 memory has its timings set as high as they will go.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">The two Processors
<br/>
Most game code is usually executed on the ARM9 processor (in fact, Nintendo reportedly doesn't allow developers use the ARM7 processor, except by predefined API functions, anyways, even with the most likely inefficient API code, most of the ARM7's 33MHz horsepower is left unused).
<br/>
The ARM9's 66MHz "horsepower" is a different tale - it seems Nintendo thought that a 33MHz processor would be too "slow" for 3D games, and so they (tried to) badge an additional CPU to the original GBA hardware.
<br/>
However, the real 66MHz can be used only with cache and tcm, all other memory and I/O accesses are delayed to the 33MHz bus clock, that'd be still quite fast, but, there seems to be a hardware glitch that adds 3 waitcycles to all nonsequential accesses at the NDS9 side, which effectively drops its bus clock to about 8MHz, making it ways slower than the 33MHz NDS7 processor, it's even slower than the original 16MHz GBA processor.
<br/>
Altogether, with the bugged 66MHz, and the unused 33MHz, Nintendo could have reached almost the same power when staying with the GBA's 16MHz processor :-)
<br/>
Although, when properly using cache/tcm, then the 66MHz processor &lt;can&gt; be very fast, still, the NDS should have worked as well with a single processor, though using only an ARM9 might cause a lot of compatibilty problems with GBA games, so there's at least one reason for keeping the ARM7 included.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
While going trough a BSP-tree, the arm9 can only read it at 33Mhz, same speed as the arm7. So I guess that here the limiting factor is the data read access, since the arm7 achieve the same speed as the arm9.

And yeah I shrunk the bsp nodes so that more than one can fit within a cache line - but yeah I guess there's not a lot of locality-ness within the structure in memory so the next node (ie the second one pulled into the cache) is likely to not get used.

__builtin_prefetch generates the right instructions (when coompiled with the right compiler type), but it doesn't actually seem to have any effect.

the only real benefit whould be to try to squeeze quake 2 to let it run on a DS without the EXRAM or with only the 8Mo ram... the regular pak run quite good on the DS, of course smaller pak (like the shareware one) are a little bit faster but the regular .pak run quite fast enough, and Simon is really doing a great and impressive work to manage to run quake2 so well on a DS. 
<br/>

ho and I am also not sure that the games assets of the psx/N64 are regular .pak files, and the source for these version are, I do not think, released...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In this game monsters can also have a 'damaged' texture, so the first time you shoot someone they'll flash white whilst the texture's pulled in!

Use it conjunction with the slot-1 card and it'll clock faster!

The card I'd really recommend is the EZ-flash, since the memory is the fastest. I use a 3-in-1.

The hull checking is equally as slow, yet is run many more times per frame. The algorithm is a bit different, and still uses a load of fp math. It's called many dozens of times per frame and adds up to roughly the same amount of time as one pass of the bsp. It's the #1 function that I'm trying to sort out.
<br/>
Don't ask me about the speed difference - they're not my algorithms!
<br/>
<br/>
@alex: yes I will roll back the stuff I've learnt into the other game. With the problem you're referring to, this is a bug I found after doing the third release. I don't think it's in r2 so try loading your saves in that to get passed that bit. It'll get fixed, at some point :-)

Do you have a multimeter to test the voltage coming off the dc end? Also, does your jack have any play in it, i.e. if you have it plugged in, and move the jack in different directions, can you get the power light to come on?
<br/>
<br/>
I work at a PC repair shop, and most commonly we see dead power adapters, and dc jacks that have taken too much stress and no longer make a good connection with the board. DC Jacks can be replaced with a brand new one if that is the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, however, the board will just be shot. Worst case scenario is get a cheap 2.5" to 3.5" laptop drive adapter or a 2.5" usb hard drive enclosure so at least you'll have your data.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nah, I don't think the rail gun uses sprites. The weapon at the end of the list (I'm sure?) is the bfg10k. If you remember, when you fire it you get these cool beams which come out of it and zap through all the bad guys within reach before the ball of energy hits a wall and actually kills them! The ball is rendered with an animated sprite, surrounded by particles (which are rendered) and some beams.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, doubt that'll work! I've not had a donation (for a flash card) in a looong time and I doubt motherboard donations will be forthcoming! Besides the motherboard I could really really do with some new flash card readers. My SD and CF readers have disintegrated due to overwork, by mini-&gt;full SD shells have died and I've already resoldered my microSD reader once! The spring has also gone in my m3 simply! (as well as blowing fuses in two DS phats) :-D

But yeah, I think the game is due for another round of beta testing (one more little thing I need to add to the OSK) and baring any serious problems I might stick out a release!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

hum, just a simple question, can't you use the download game option to test builds using wifi rather than writing on the flashcard? I don't know the details about that, but i've seen somewhere that you could use wifi to upload binary to avoid having to remove flash card and such...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">by the way, i think that when you'll have the osk inside and when you'll remove all the trace for the sound system that slow down everything you should be good for a first release... it's already great...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
