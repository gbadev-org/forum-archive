And .AMR files are absolutely horrid. They're meant principally for voice-recording, I believe. I used to save my "songs" as AMR on my older Nokia phone. Needless to say, they ended up severely static-y and distorted.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AAC however is very nice, and with the MPEG4 video would be great quality. It would be much like what the Play-Yan uses or the Drangons Lair demo. However, you need to convince a dev to work on it. Moonlight has already done MPEG1 on the DS in Moonshell, and that only just works, pushing the DS to its limit. MPEG4 could be quite hard to do, but we've seen it done already, allthough my companies, so its possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
