But the designs that make up Unix make absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. Maybe they may have made sense in a certain context way back when, but they don?t for a modern OS user like me.

I?ll be trying to figure out how to work-over your template into a good one, but I don?t know how far I?ll get with it. This is the only site so far that I?ve seen talk about how they made their template, and I don?t much understand it...

Might be nice to use Pascal on a modern compiler. Really good at tiny data structures.
<br/>
<br/>
Technically speaking, though, shouldn?t it be a devkitARM template, with GBA, NDS, PSP, and GP32 all being targets available through that template?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

BLASPHEMY!

The Unix CLI is one of the most useful interfaces ever designed. I'll grant you that it is less user-friendly than a GUI, but in terms of what you can do with it, CLI is far superior. Try using a GUI on a remote system via 300baud modem. Or, even better, try to develop a GUI for the blind. CLI is far more versitile than any GUI on any system. Not to mention the fact that, despite it's age, the Unix-style CLI survives even today to the point that users from the birth of Unix would still recognize it and be able to use the system. Not eveyone feels that it is necessary to change everything with each point release.
<br/>
<br/>
Give the CLI a shot. Worst case scenerio, you might learn something.
<br/>
<br/>
And to your point about <span style="font-weight: bold">jstart</span> sharing what he knows, it doesn't seem like getting Xcode to work is a priority to him. Perhaps individuals have priorities that differ from your own?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not saying that CLIs are bad, I am saying that Unix has a BAD CLI.
<br/>
<br/>
Any CLI that uses a text character as anything but a text-character qualifies as a bad CLI in my book. Text is not meant to be used for anything other than text!
<br/>
<br/>
And despite Unix supporting spaces in file names, trying to properly deal with a file path that has file names with spaces in it is insane, particularly because different Unix programs expect different treatment of names with spaces.
<br/>
<br/>
Many fundamental Unix programs are so old, they depend on certain information being in certain folders or else they fail BADLY, and ultimately this mandates that a certain file structure be upheld, despite the purpose of this structure being outdated.
<br/>
<br/>
Unix file permissions are hopelessly inadequate.
<br/>
<br/>
I don?t even know how this one has survived this long; Unix decided that, for all systems, the most powerful user access on the machine will have the EXACT SAME LOGIN regardless of machine. Thus guaranteeing that AT LEAST HALF of the security protection of having a login screen in the first place is permanantly lost.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you grew up with Unix, then I guess you can forgive these faults; Unix has some very good points, including sweet, sweet power. But in a new, otherwise modern, Unix-unrelated OS, these faults would be UNFORGIVABLE. I was surprised, and not in the good way, that when we were going to inherit all of Unix?s good qualities, that we?d have to inherit its bad qualities too. I was looking forward to a good CLI. But I?m still only looking forward to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would be very pleased to receive anything you can give me about the template system.
<br/>
My intentions are to be able to pick and choose between targets via XCode so that I could (at least theoretically) add NDS and PSP targets to a single project, in addition to making things like cross-platform libraries, single platform libraries, source and data files, and so on.
<br/>
After looking at the template files, I don?t expect much right away (musta been done by a Unix programmer :P). Being able to make a GBA ROM template will probably tell me almost enough to be able to make the other templates.
<br/>
<br/>
I mailed the guy who makes that XTemplate utility, but he only barely knows what he?s doing, either. I think what we?re doing is a little off-track for him.

<br/>
Anyway, the point is to be able to make the most typical compiling job setups easier by having a default setup for each kind. It should be easy to select which language, which output type (library, full program), and for which platform type (or types) we are compiling.
<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to use as much of XCode?s GUI to make decisions as we can.

<br/>
I?ve got another link with more info on making templates, this time applying specifically to ARM. We should be able to use this...
