    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, in interneti i' ve found very nice map for 3dgame, but are in .bsp(quake Map).
<br/>
Quake map have inside texture, light and the collision, on some 3d engine, like irrlicht, are very good.
<br/>
I' ve seen a psp bsp viewer; so i thinked that we can hope in a one for ds.But is bsp ram needed too big? Can a ds view a bsp?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure, its possible. The biggest obstical though is loading the BSP tree, textures, and all that other good stuff inside the DS's memory limit. The textures will need to be radically scaled down from their original sizes. BSP may be a bit slower than ideal for console use... it'd be a much better idea to compile it into a display list divided into sections and work from there.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also the 3D hardware on the DS doesn't have any form of multitexturing.  Your options for static lighting are: (a) render the lightmaps as a second pass or (2) use vertex lighting.  I'd recommend vertex lighting.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know this is an older post, but I found this GBA BSP engine. Just wanted to show it because if it can be done on the GBA it can definetly be done on the DS. And since GBA roms will work on the DS you may want to take a look anyway.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm going to need a tool to convert .map (Quake levels before they've been compiled) format to something for use on the DS. This seems like a more reasonable format than the .bsp because most of the .bsp data isn't going to be usable on the DS anyway. All of the Quake map editors produce .map files, but I'm not sure if there is a tool to decompile a .bsp back into a .map or not.
<br/>
<br/>
There is source for various Quake utilities on the web, but I've just started looking into the options.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm loading successfully and rendering works perfectly on PC (on textures atm though). But on DS nothing is displayed and when using the findPlayerLeaf algorithm to find the leaf the player is in, the DS hangs right there, while it works on PC.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
