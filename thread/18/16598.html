    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">During the testing of a game I'm writing I've found that running it from Moonshell on the GBA Movie Player sometimes the game will crash and from that have found a bug in the game (an str to the wrong register for example).
<br/>
<br/>
Would this be because IWRAM is not clear when the game is run? Is it possible to have some sort of loader for Slot-1 cards that will essentially fill IWRAM before running the game to help track down bugs? Perhaps using dmaFillWords with 0xFFFFFFFF?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course! Good point!

I guess I would have to figure out where the unintialized memory is and how large it is before filling it. Any ideas on how to go about that?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you would have had a look at the named files you know which memory areas are allready initialzied and which ones are at a state where a loader could have left data.
<br/>
<br/>
The ds_arm9_crt0.s does copy data to
<br/>
- __itcm_start to __itcm_end
<br/>
- __dtcm_start to __dtcm_end
<br/>
and clears data at
<br/>
- __bss_start to __bss_end
<br/>
- __sbss_start to __sbss_end
<br/>
<br/>
it does not do anything (and thus might be vulnerable to junk) at
<br/>
- fake_heap_start - fake_heap_end
<br/>
- __ewram_end to __ewram_end +4k (where the firmware stores user settings, exception vector etc)
<br/>
- special memory sections (i.e. graphics ram)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes it does. As expected ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
There are some vital data points in that part, that's why it isn't used as heap. You need to keep that in mind when fuzzing. (Old IPC-Struct, Exception Vector and Stack, Card-Header-Info [including that startup loop of passme])
<br/>
<br/>
The values are usually initialized by the firmware on startup, but there is no warrenty that it isn't manipulated by a seperate loader. Doesn't mean that you can write everything there ;-) just that you could notice and ths have to expect some (limited) changes in there<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
