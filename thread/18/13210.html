    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've downloaded devkitpro to begin DS development, but I'm having a few problems. I've tried searching google and these forums for answers, but all of the tutorials I've seen on how to get the two working together don't explain the process very well.
<br/>
<br/>
I can make a makefile project and fill in the appropriate boxes, but I still don't completely understand how to make all of that work properly with the VS interface.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone has a link to a good tutorial I'd appreciate it. Even better if someone can explain the process here. Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Out of Order.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you seen that link?

<br/>
You just have to follow that faq and it should work properly.
<br/>
Once that is done, just add the source files ( c,cpp ) in your project source files ( the same for h files ). Then you just have to compile it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
