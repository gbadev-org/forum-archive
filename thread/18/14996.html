    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just finished yet another Maya-scripted 3D-&gt;DS exporter that may or may not get released, but from the few I did, this looks like a greater possible "release" candidate because of it's low TCM memory usage. However, I only have one model to test it with, which is the model I've used for the rest of my unreleased exporters, and I come here today to ask if anyone knows of a website that offers free models that are Maya-compatible and rigid-skinned, ranging from as low as 50 polys to up to even as much as 2000 polys, or even some you hold yourself that you don't mind sharing. This is all for purposes of the exporter and DS testing, and will not be used for anything else (unless you don't mind).
<br/>
<br/>
My only test model is an odd looking hand that is composed of 300 triangles, and 21 bones, which takes up to 29 scanlines to "pose" and "load" into hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
All help is appreciated.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
