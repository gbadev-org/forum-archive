I am trying to save/load to DSX Virtual EEPROM, and SRAM

but neithier works.

<span style="font-weight: bold">EEPROM</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Solved,
<br/>
goto this
<br/>
post for the solution.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Virtual EEPROM</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to use the Virtual EEPROM feature
<br/>
on my DS-X.(firmware version 1.1.2)
<br/>
<br/>
The firmware I have supports ~1 MegaByte of Virtual EEP.
<br/>
<br/>
The size of my DS-X is 2GigaByte(16Gigabit).
<br/>
<br/>
The following is my problems:
<br/>
<br/>
Click <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=144731#144731" target="_blank">here</a> for my new problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's how Virtual EEPROM
<br/>
is supposed to work on the DS-X:
<br/>
(As I understand it)
<br/>
The DS-X has no EEPROM.
<br/>
<br/>
It emulates it instead.
<br/>
<br/>
When Written to(EEPROM),
<br/>
it is supposed to write to a section
<br/>
in the FLASH memory(where the firmware is stored.)
<br/>
This is where the emulated EEPROM is stored.
<br/>
<br/>
When Read from(EEPROM),
<br/>
the emulated EEPROM is supposed to
<br/>
be read.
<br/>
<br/>
When I reboot my DS-X,
<br/>
It checks if the emulated EEPROM was written to.
<br/>
If so, it writes to .sav file,
<br/>
with the same filename as the last
<br/>
nds file ran.
<br/>
It writes all of the emulated
<br/>
EEPROM to that file.
<br/>
It also displays "Saving EEPROM".
<br/>
<br/>
When I boot homebrew,
<br/>
it checks for a sav file for
<br/>
that homebrew.
<br/>
If it finds it,
<br/>
the DS-X writes the contents of
<br/>
that file into the emulated EEPROM.
<br/>
<br/>
Each homebrew
<br/>
would have its
<br/>
own sav file.
<br/>
In this way,
<br/>
all homebrew
<br/>
on the DS-X can
<br/>
have there own
<br/>
slot of Virtual EEPROM.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">SRAM</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The following problem is old:(My new problem is below)&lt;old&gt;</span>
<br/>
I am still having problems though.
<br/>
When I try writing to SRAM,
<br/>
it won't work.
<br/>
I'm not sure about reading,
<br/>
but it probably dosen't work eithier.
<br/>
<br/>
When I write to SRAM,
<br/>
and run the program again,
<br/>
it dosen't detect the data it wrote to
<br/>
it before.
<br/>
<br/>
When I write to SRAM,
<br/>
it dosen't mess-up the
<br/>
saved data on the GBA cart,
<br/>
so it isn't even writing to SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
It's probably the same way with reading,
<br/>
not even reading the SRAM.I'm not sure about this one though.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;/old&gt;</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my new problem:
<br/>
<br/>
With Bomberman Tournment,
<br/>
the new written data written by my
<br/>
program stays!
<br/>
So it works!
<br/>
It also works with other homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
But, when I use my original code(the source code which is below)
<br/>
it won't do what I want.
<br/>
<br/>
When it detects the correct indentifier,
<br/>
it is supposed to display a string
<br/>
which is written earlier.
<br/>
<br/>
This string is after the identifier.(after the null-terminating byte
<br/>
for that string.)
<br/>
<br/>
It is supposed to display a string which was written earlier,
<br/>
with "Contents: " before it.(without quotes)
<br/>
<br/>
But it won't do that.
<br/>
<br/>
It won't even display a character in the SRAM_buffer array.
<br/>
<br/>
I also tried all the copy functions.(memcpy,bytecpy,dmaCopy)
<br/>
Only bytecpy copied the data correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my source code:
<br/>
Note that this is the whole thing.

<br/>
How do I save/load to a section
<br/>
in a NDS file?
<br/>
<br/>
Tales Of Dagur does this.
<br/>
<br/>
This would be used for game saved data.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
There was a mistake in the SRAM source code,
<br/>
in the WriteSRAM function.
<br/>
Instead of writing to the SRAM,
<br/>
it would read it.
<br/>
That is fixed now.
<br/>
<br/>
But it still won't work.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2:
<br/>
<br/>
I tried fixing the the size used for the SRAM.(32768)
<br/>
I tried using dmaCopy for the the SRAM.
<br/>
I tried using bytecpy for the SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
But none of those fixed it.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT3:
<br/>
<br/>
In the SRAM section,
<br/>
I changed the offset in SRAM it reads/writes to
<br/>
4.(0-based.)
<br/>
<br/>
That didn't fix it.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT4:
<br/>
<br/>
SRAM
<br/>
Tried Bomberman Tournment,
<br/>
and it works.
<br/>
It also works with other homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
But with my original code it dosen't work.
<br/>
<br/>
See above for my new problems.
<br/>
I have also updated the source code for the SRAM.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem I see with Supercard QPC saving is that with firmware versions 1.70 and up, many users find themselves unable to use said saving feature.  Instead of seeing "do you save to SD?", the message turns into "do you load from SD?" and the save does not get written.  The following solutions have been made to fix this:
<br/>
1.  Booting into GBA mode instead of DS mode makes it work correctly
<br/>
2.  For Rumble users, the DumpSRAM program acts as a homebrew alternative to the Saver menu.  I <span style="font-style: italic">believe</span> that DumpSRAM is DLDI-capable, meaning that SCSD_moon.dldi can be used if needed, but I'm not entirely sure about that.  If I'm wrong, then it will only work on Supercards that work with pre-DLDI libfat and the SCSD.dldi file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm no expert but I can be fairly sure that by "battery is dying" he is refering to the system employed by many flashcards so save SRAM into the memory card.
<br/>
<br/>
This is basically how I understand it to work (please somebody correct me if I am wrong).
<br/>
<br/>
1. The save data is created in a game which in a normal card would write to the SRAM, however in flashcards this memory is often just a portion of normal RAM which is battery backed (to prevent data loss after power down).
<br/>
<br/>
2. The data is held in the battery backed memory until next time the DS (or GBA) is powered up.
<br/>
<br/>
3. At the next time the card boots up, the flashcard reads the battery backed memory, and saves the data into the filesystem of the memory card (or flash memory).
<br/>
<br/>
So what this would mean is that data would be read and written correctly whilst the application is running, however due to low power in the battery when the DS is reset the contents of the memory are lost.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
A few of the Game Paks I tested is below:
<br/>
(Note that this isn't the whole list.)
<br/>
Yoshi Topsy-Turvy
<br/>
Tetris Worlds
<br/>
Brain Games/ Ultimate Brain Games
<br/>
<br/>
I have made some progress on the Yoshi game,
<br/>
and saved.
<br/>
Then I reset my DS and started it again.
<br/>
It loaded correctly, with the same data it loaded.
<br/>
So this Game Pak's battery shouldn't be the problem
<br/>
for this Game Pak, since saving/loading works
<br/>
correctly on the actual game.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the one of the other Game Pak's battery,
<br/>
I'am not sure if saving on the actual game works.
<br/>
<br/>
On Tetris Worlds,
<br/>
it won't save the options,
<br/>
and the other stuff,
<br/>
With this Game Pak.
<br/>
But it did that the last time
<br/>
I played it,
<br/>
which was a long time ago.(atleast ~1 year)
<br/>
<br/>
I tested it with my program,
<br/>
and wrote to SRAM,
<br/>
and then checked if it worked.
<br/>
That worked,
<br/>
but that data got erased after I
<br/>
turned off my DS.
<br/>
Its the same way with
<br/>
the other Game Paks I tested.
<br/>
This is the same problem
<br/>
I have with all the Game Paks
<br/>
I have tested.
<br/>
<br/>
On Brain Games/ Ultimate Brain Games,
<br/>
saving/loading on the actual game works,
<br/>
so the battery shouldn't be the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
After I tried to view the Opponnet section in the Options
<br/>
section on my DS, it crashed.(no white screens.)
<br/>
It made noises like when you pull out a GBA Game Pak
<br/>
on a DS, GBA SP, or GBA.
<br/>
After that, my DS wouldn't detect that game anymore.
<br/>
But it works(runs correctly) on a GBA SP.
<br/>
It dosen't crash were my DS crashed, on
<br/>
a GBA SP.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in my previous post,(after editing)
<br/>
I tested all the homebrew(which I have) which uses SRAM.
<br/>
I tested them with the Game Paks I have tested with my program.
<br/>
They all don't work.
<br/>
Except Tales Of Dagur,
<br/>
which dosen't use SRAM.
<br/>
Instead it saves to a section somewhere
<br/>
inside its .nds file,
<br/>
by using libfat.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by yellowstar on Mon Jul 09, 2007 10:45 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to try to speak more clearly. If I understand what you're saying:
<br/>
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Yoshi's Topsy-Turvy works just fine, but when you try to modify its save data yourself, the changes disappear after you turn the system off.
<br/>
</li><li>Tetris Worlds doesn't save in-game.
<br/>
</li><li>Brain Games was working, but it crashed when you tried to view a list of opponents, and now only works in your GBA SP.
<br/>
</li><li>No homebrew games are able to save to the games you have inserted.</li></ol>
<br/>
<br/>
Is that correct? If so, here's my thoughts on the matter:
<br/>
1) Yoshi is fine, but it's not using the type of save you think it is. Since the game has a tilt sensor, the memory map could be different than normal.
<br/>
2) Tetris probably has a dead battery, if it won't even save in-game.
<br/>
3) I'm not sure I understand this one. Is "Brain Games" a homebrew? What do you mean by opponent list?
<br/>
4) Homebrew games might be checking to ensure they don't save over a commercial game's save data, or they might be assuming the cartridge has one save type when the ones you've tried have another.
<br/>
<br/>
According to a site I can't link to here, Yoshi's Topsy-Turvy's save type is "EEPROM_V124 (4Kbit)". Tetris Worlds has no save function. I don't see any game named Brain anything for GBA.

Sorry to bring this back to the surface, but i'm looking forward to save my application state (max 2K of data). And i was thinking "the eeprom is the best place to store this, because afaik official games do this." What you're saying actually means that i shouldn't do it, and save to the cart via libfat-like library. Did i get it wrong, or is it what you actually advice ?
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, because conceptually, i find it far more logical to have our applications work in the same way as standard DS games... But of course, there might be some limitations/problems i'm unaware of.<br/>_________________<br/>NDS Lite Gold/Silver, MK5/R4DS, MSI PC54G2, D-Link DI-624</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You should always/mainly use fat, not eeprom. Every card in existence supports fat.(That is, they have a DLDI patch available)
<br/>
You should not use EEPROM, because hardly any cards, as far as I know,
<br/>
have that.(And only Slot-1 cards can have that, not Slot-2s.)
<br/>
<br/>
You could have EEPROM for a option for saving, but you should have fat as the primary saving method.<span style="font-weight: bold">But it is much better to only use fat.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But especially with this case, the problem with only using FAT is that a lot of cards that use FAT can't fit in the slot at once with a DS Game Card. A DS-X inserted into a powered-on DS resets the DS in some cases (has this been fixed?), and R4/M3 Simply doesn't bring up the SD card interface properly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yay. What I want to do is transfer some EEPROM save data to/and from a Game Card to my DS-X Virtual EEPROM basicly. A good while ago I wrote a liblobby EEPROM program which transfers EEP, but I never finished it.

I don't have Wifi. I got a N Wifi dongle at XMas, but the homebrew drivers indirectly busted my XP. Now I'm not allowed to use those drivers. Now both of my computers aren't working right, and they need fixed. Once they are fixed, I'm going to hunt down a Wifi device.
<br/>
<br/>
But if I do decide to accept that help, whoever would be helping with this would need to be warned that I'm using Dial-Up.(Of course it should be noted that's only because I'm stuck with it)
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my method for harvesting:
<br/>
I divide the work in half. First I work on the half of the town to the east of the river, and to the east of the shop.(And the shop is on the other side)
<br/>
When I finish that side, I then attack the other side, which has the shop.
<br/>
This side west gets done very quickly.
<br/>
I also divide each side in half horizontally. I tackle each section one-at-a-time.  
<br/>
When starting on one half of the town, I always start at the beach.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, for the procedure:
<br/>
1. Start at the beach on the right side of the river.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Dash to the nearest fruit tree, shake all the fruit out, and grab all the fallen fruit.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Repeat #2 until your pockets are full.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Run for the shop. Use the Y button to shoot the fruit over to the sell box. Move the cursor over every item, then press Y on each. Quickly do every as fast as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Go back to where you were, and repeat the procedure.

*Bookmarks that web site*(Firefox)
<br/>
Lots of stuff to dig through on that site!(*Later discovers it's mostly GC*)
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway:
<br/>
I have 100% foreign fruit. The long-ago local fruit was completely obliterated.(Not intended though... It was pears.)
<br/>
It's FOREVER to make anything close to what I make.
<br/>
It takes about an hour to finish harvesting.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently started playing ACWW again. I also thinned the trees.(All most all of them are oranges)
<br/>
<br/>
Previously, there were 200 orange trees, with a whopping profit of 300,000 bells.(To bad I only used to get 100,000... The rest goes to the owner of those trees. My brother hired me to do that work.)
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm trying to get a perfect environment, but with troubles. I think the problem is the fact that most trees are fruit.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I figured out the bug in my Nifi EEP app. But I decided it would be best to rewrite the whole thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
