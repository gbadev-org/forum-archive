    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a new "Metroid Hunters" movie out which shows some gameplay footage(in low quality though).
<br/>
While watching it I realized that the textures(and the whole game) look much better than in the demo.Then I paused the video at 03:03 where you can see that the texture has some sort of pixel-filtering(anti aliasing?).So there are no huge pixels visible(like you see in the demo or Goldeneye).
<br/>
But it hasn't the "blurry" look of some N64 games either.
<br/>
So,could it be that the DS has some "sleeping" graphic abilities which get unlocked somehow via software?
<br/>
<br/>
check the video out and pause at 03:03 and tell me what you think.
<br/>
Video is located <a class="postlink" href="http://s25.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=1DHFOJ5AARFMT1APILM3AEVGCG" target="_blank">HERE</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, I would say, the Video is too small and has a too low quality to say much about the graphics. But if someone gets the game and is willing to make a few "screenshots" with his digital camera, we could have a closer look at it.
<br/>
I don't think, you can tell the difference between a good texture and texturefiltering in a video with that quality.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt that the video you linked really can prove anything. The footage was taken from an output monitor with a cam and then compressed. Within that transfer a lot can happen to the quality. If you notice the LCD display monitors are not at the DS resolution/aspect ratio so some pixel doubling or linear filter maybe be in effect. Also, I dont really see how that looks any better then say, Mario64 DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
OT: When Metroid Hunters comes out I challenge you to a WiFi duel. ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pause at 1:43-1:44 (where the door pauses when opening for a sec), you can clearly see aliasing there on the door, the slight blur is probably due to the transfer of it to the TV screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise that vid is really impressive =P
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: It's even more obviously aliased at 1:04 for the moment a peice of the ceiling comes into view.<br/>_________________<br/>If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, why the heck do you care?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tepples has some interesting ideas on possible ways to acheive a type of texture filtering, but I'm not aware of anyone actually implementing anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS can do some simple kind of AA on lines, but it can't do any texture filtering. If you watch the video, around the 1:04 mark, where the player jumps up on a box... the ceiling comes into view at the top of the screen and shows the texture pixels briefly.

Metroid Hunters does not have texture filtering. It might have simple AA though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The anti-aliasing is limited to polygon edges only. It seems to work based on the polygons' ID, like the cartoon outlining, so it doesn't affect every polygon edges, and doesn't antialias z-buffer intersections.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alriiiight... I watched the video and... holy cow, the game is looking *far* better than the demo! It can be mistaken by the Gamecube version at a quick glance! They seriously improved Samus' model (it's both more detailed and much better lit, with good light/shadow contrast this time). The morph ball just looks like the Gamecube version's this time, it's all shiny.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Keep in mind that the video is scaled up in screensize so it will look even better on DS screen.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mario64 very clearly does lots of AA.
<br/>
Marios would look very jaggy around his edges if it didnt.
<br/>
Also plenty of edges are. (with the noteable exception being the staircase in the castle...the lack of AA there shows up how the rest of the game would look if it had none elsewhere)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Texture filtering has yet to be done, or proved practical, but I am sure its possible. (but nothing in that video shows that it exists in that game, imo).

Some of that video is FMV ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tepples suggested this a while ago, and I tried it, but it looked a bit weird - even at 60fps, the LCD isn't slow enough to blur frames together.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you have serious blockiness issues with a particular texture, you could just use a higher-res texture. Likewise, you can reduce sparkliness by doing per-object mipmapping, switching to smaller prefiltered textures when an object gets beyond a certain distance and putting a scale in the texture-matrix to adjust the texcoords.<br/>_________________<br/>"Ever tried?

uhm....thanx,I already knew that.

I watched it at least ten times now and it looks fantastic.
