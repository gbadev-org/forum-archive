First, Feel the Magic (previously known, by the way, only as "Project Rub") makes full use of the DS's unique control options, as players will need to tap, rub, scream at, and blow directly into the Nintendo DS -- all to help the game's main character win the affection of a lovely lady. To help you out, you enlist the Rub Rabbits, a "suave gang of dramatic performers" who enjoy wearing plastic rabbit ears.
<br/>
<br/>
To win love, you'll need to clean the girl, flick scorpions off her back, distract raging bulls from attacking her, and sail a boat directly to her, among other things. To make matters worse, you'll eventually have to compete for her affections as a rival makes his approach.
<br/>
<br/>
And then you rub some more.

for what this looks like..

I wonder who was part of the Dev Team on this one. They must have a basement floor where they keep all the anime otaku's jailed up. They were getting a bit to randy, so Sega asked them stop development on touch poker for the arcade cocktail machines and do a quickie on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If Sega lets this stuff fly, I definately want in on the Dev/Design team. I've got this idea based around the term "Come in Tokyo"...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
