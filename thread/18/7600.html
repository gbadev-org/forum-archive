    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone got any information on the ADC used to sample the microphone/headset?  I'm mostly interested in the maximum sample rate (or conversion time) but any other info would be nice too (model numbers, datasheets etc). I've had a look around but there doesn't seem to be anything published, neimod's example and libnds both use a 16khz timer for sampling with no mention of why that particular rate was chosen.

<br/>
Also, am I correct when assuming that the headset port is connected to the same ADC channel as the microphone?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I managed to go up to 44.1 khz sampling rate but the main problem is the 8 bit resolution. I'm still trying to figure out how to sample in 12 or 16 bit mode (if that is possible).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
