    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Check out the examples that come with ndslib. You can also check out the template that comes with ndsdev. I don't have any experience in setting up projects in VS.net since I just copy the template to a new folder and rename the files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, or try the Programmer's Notepad project file. I had a little trouble with VS.Net at first so I switched over to that and was up and running a little quicker. Once you have that working you might figure out VS.Net easier.
<br/>
pn.exe is in the \ndsdev\tools\pnotepad directory. The .pnproj files are the project files, and there should be one in the template directory.
<br/>
<br/>
Also if you are wondering what all the tools are in NDS Dev Env then read the manual setup tutorial. That will introduce you to what's installed and you might understand the whole setup better after skimming through it. Worked for me anyway: <a href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/Day1/day1.php" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/Day1/day1.php</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, if you didn't, like me, get the ndslib template VisStudio .sln with NDSDevEnv you can get it from here : <a href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/" target="_blank">http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't that easy to set up, but by following my nose and some directions from

I figured it out.  Things are compiling and spitting .ds.gba files out all over the place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
