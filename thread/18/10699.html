    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi guys, i have a problem with the modelview matrix.
<br/>
<br/>
when i call glLoadIdentity();, push this onto the matrix stack, translate it with glTranslatef(so its in the view) and render my model it works fine, so do rotations with glRotate.
<br/>
<br/>
now ive defined my own matrix[16], and changed values so its the identity matrix too, as in the following:
<br/>
<br/>
1 0 0 0
<br/>
0 1 0 0
<br/>
0 0 1 0
<br/>
0 0 0 1
<br/>
<br/>
the translation vector (4th column, rows 1-3) translate the object fine, but for some reason the object is not drawn properly (as in vertices are sharing the same coords or something).
<br/>
<br/>
multiplying it with rotation matrix with a call from glRotate doesnt rotate it properly, it seems to be rotating at weird intervals and even then not properly.
<br/>
<br/>
at the moment the matrix is defined as s32, changing to float screws things up more as even changing the translation vector doesnt do anything now.
<br/>
<br/>
anybody got any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
try f32 matrices and use flottof32(1.0) to test you matrix, ndslib converts the matrix to ds format from the f32 format</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
you mean libnds or the older ndslib? (using libnds atm)
<br/>
<br/>
thought it was a prob with types too, tried changing the matrix to f32 but didnt do anything, not too sure on how to use floatof32(1.0) hehe. got any tips?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: wow...it worked! cheers! you dont know how much of an idiot i feel like now ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
