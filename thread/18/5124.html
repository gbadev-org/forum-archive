Are you supposed to be able to draw on the bottom screen in Tetris DS? Because it doesn't work in my copy.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Had me thinking this was a hoax revision history of an emu for a bit :)  Haven't looked at it yet, but sounds promising from what you've said (a decent emulator would be the entry level for me getting involved, so hope it's really good!  but if it is good, then what does that mean for the gba projects I have been meaning to get round to for so long?).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't realise any emulators were even close to being released, let alone working &amp; running demos (my first reaction to seeing the pass em videos was 'how the hell have they written that flashing a card every time they change the code?', with an emulator, I'm merely in awe rather than in god worship mode!).
<br/>
<br/>
Emu's are coming on, the first tutorials are starting to appear, the passthrough technique is maturing into something the non-techies might be able to purchase.  All great stuff (especially from the point of view of a programmer who wants to play with the hardware but won't get his hands dirty finding all this stuff out first - I understand why the guys that do it enjoy it, but I'm not one of them, give me docs &amp; pre-built compilers &amp; plug &amp; play hardware anyday!!!).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've only managed to get the tetris demo so far...it includes two versions: one for running through passme and another containing just the arm9 binary which is perfect for using in dualis since it can't emulate the arm7 functions yet

<a href="http://www.auby.no/" target="_blank">http://www.auby.no/</a> is the site where u can get the tetris demo</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps it is just me, but when attempting to run the Tetris demo, by using the tetris.bin in the main directory, Dualis says : 
<br/>
glTextSubImage2D failed

<br/>
Select another texture format or 
<br/>
use the GDI renderer.
<br/>

<br/>
I see the GDI rendere option in the video section, but am unable to click it..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The emulator is still very rustic, the author says that if you try and use a feature that it doesn't implement, it will explode.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
