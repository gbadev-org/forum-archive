    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sort of interested in porting a game to the DS and it runs at a resolution higher than the DS.  
<br/>
<br/>
It has to do rendering to a surface.  So I was wondering if it would be better to do the scaling in 3d or 2d.  
<br/>
<br/>
In 2D, I draw to a background and use the scaling properties to shrink it.
<br/>
<br/>
In 3d, I'd use a quad and texture it with the surface that I'm drawing to and then just move the quad back so it fit the surface to the screen, effectively scaling it down (if this is possible).
<br/>
<br/>
So what would be the better approach?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you redraw the graphics to fit the display and colors of the DS? If so, then do it in 2D without scaling.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't, then the quality will be really bad whatever method you choose. I still go with 2D because 3D space is no good to work with in 2D unless you really know how to set up the camera for 2D perspective and no light.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, no emulator can really handle 3D textures correctly, so I still say 2D.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, if you are rewritting the entire game in the first place, you would be better off  just doing it in the DS's native resolution.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be a bitch, certainly, but it would turn out much better than any scaling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And have it do a follow sprite thing?  I'd like to port REminiscence (Flashback engine).  It's on my list of todo's so it might be some before I start, but I figure while I had it on my mind I'd ask the questions.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure exactly what res it is or whether or not I could do it on the regular ds screen w/o scaling.  I might be able to do a follow sprite thing with the ability to pan the screen left or right w/ l and r.
<br/>
<br/>
I might resort to doing it on the GBA instead, but I'd like the extra performance from the DS.  Less optimization to be had that way.
<br/>
<br/>
--Edit-- 
<br/>
I also would like to use the DS because of the screen size.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah REminiscence would be cool, data files would be to large for a wifi version i think around 6-7 megs though, 
<br/>
<br/>
I ported it to the dreamcast which has a workable port of SDL make it a pretty easy port.  If there was a SDL port for the DS that would be very cool. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was looking into that as well but the screen size thing would be a pain as far as scaling the screen. maybe porting the gp32 version and/or maybe porting the gba port of SDL(I wasnt able to get that working)
<br/>
<br/>
On the dreamcast most of the ports of things that use the framebuffer are switched to render to a texture so they can have the 3d hardware to all the work quickly, dont see why it would be much different for other consoles 3d hardware.

Because DS has a limited texture size, and doesn't do any texture antialiasing, so you don't get the nice bicubic (or whatever) smoothing you do on dreamcast.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
