    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I blend two textures Quads 
<br/>
<br/>
Enabled Alpha blending and used different poly ID's, used alpha=16
<br/>
<br/>
the texture is an RGBA texture
<br/>
<br/>
when the quads overlap one of the quads is darker then the other in the non-overlapping part?!
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I searched the forum found nothing regarding this problem</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by a128 on Thu Mar 27, 2008 7:27 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

also, did you try untextured quads of one and different colors?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hardware and Emulator same results!
<br/>
<br/>
I did this also with two untextured quads. 
<br/>
<br/>
and I saw that the overlapping part was mutch brighter then the non overlapping parts. maybe this is what you expect when you modulate the alpha values ?!
<br/>
both quads where rendered with alpha=16

yes, that's pretty normal and what you would expect. it's sort of: 50% + 50% = 100% (very generalized)
<br/>
<br/>
what else did you expect? :^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After a while I guess this is the normal behaviour ...so overlapping parts are brighter.ok!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on the blending function which describes how the output pixel will look depending on the incoming fragment's alpha and colour and the original fragment's colour.
<br/>
Have butcher's at the nocash stuff for changing the blending function:

...and finally, for more OpenGL-compliant implementations, have a look at the pictures at the bottom of this:

i just realized why i have misunderstood it previously: it's the topic, that mixed me up! should say "... get's brighter" ;?)
<br/>
<br/>
well, you basically just have modulation and decaling... so one can't really set the blending "function" like in opengl. i find this one of the few negative aspects of the system. but after all, everything comes for a price.
