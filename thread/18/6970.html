    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, im busy with learning a lot about wifi.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to write my own program , to connect on ip base with my computer.
<br/>
i want to connect my ds to my wireless lan card.
<br/>
I searched 2 days about how im going to write a program on my pc and for the ds to communicate with each other.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to learn how they are communicating.
<br/>
<br/>
Alot of topics i read say that the registers of wife aren't complete.
<br/>
<br/>
With wifeme the ds and my computer can communicate.
<br/>
<br/>
So there is a way that i can let them communicate?
<br/>
<br/>
In future i want to make a text base internet browser, but first i must learn a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
So where must i start to let them communicate, i cant find much of it on the forum.
<br/>
<br/>
I think i must make a small server program for my nintendo ds? So that i can ping from my computer?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any documentation about sending packages to other ip's or something?
<br/>
<br/>
greets,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wi-Fi is encrypted only if you're using a protocol that includes encryption, such as WEP, WPA, IPSEC, SSL, or SSH.
<br/>
<br/>
The only "encryption" used so far on the DS is the same <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cgexpo.com/encrypt/atari7800.htm" target="_blank">"encryption" used on Atari 7800 games</a>: public key digital signature.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
