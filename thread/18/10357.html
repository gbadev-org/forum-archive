    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I started to play with tile background layers last night but already I'm having trouble :( I followed the tutorial at (http://www.dspassme.com/programmers_guide/tutorial/using_tiles.html) and I'm storing the location of the tile graphics as a u16* called m_tile. I created a pallete where all the colours are black, except for 1 which is pink and 2 which is yellow. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm trying to draw on to the tile graphics in code. Starting with the first tile I'm trying to set the palette of the first pixel by calling:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
  m_tile[0] = 1;  //1 is a pink colour in the palette.
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This didn't work and I reasoned its because each pixel is only 8bits in 256 colour mode. However when I changed the m_tile pointer to u8* I couldn't get it to work at all :( If I tried the below it had better results:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
  m_tile[0] = 0x0002 + 0x0100; //2 is a yellow colour.
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This seemed to work okay, I could set the palette entries of both pixels fine, except it displayed them the other way round to what I expected! (Yellow (2) then Pink (1) :( So the first two bytes are for the second pixel, and the second two bytes are for the first pixel.. I'm sure I'm missing something here... any help? 
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I haven't described it properly or if its answered elsewhere.[/code]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That you write in 0x0102 the 01 before the 02 does not mean that it is stored in that way in the ram.
