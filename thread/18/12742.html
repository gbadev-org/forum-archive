    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">2 questions to answer first:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do you have a Wifime-compatible DS?  Go to <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7961" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7961</a> and follow the instructions to find out your DS's firmware.
<br/>
2.  Do you have a slot-2 flash cart that Wifime will boot?  
<br/>
<br/>
There's a difference between WMB (wireless multiboot) and Wifime.  WMB is the actual program that sends the data out over the wireless card with modified drivers.  With this, you can only send official Nintendo demos to your unflashed DS.  Wifime is a hacked part of the Super Mario 64 DS download play image, so it can be accepted by an unflashed DS, and it rerouts execution to whatever is in the GBA slot.  So basically, you have to have a flashed DS to accept regular homebrew via WMB, but you can't flash your DS unless you have a slot-2 flash cart you can use Wifime on.  
<br/>
<br/>
There is no way to send unsigned homebrew to an unflashed DS using WMB.  Besides, barely anybody uses Wifime anymore, the few who do mostly being developers.  Even if you did get your DS flashed, you'd have to be sure you have the right type of wireless card that WMB will work on.  The whole WMB/WifiMe thing is fairly complicated, and it won't save you much money unless you already have both a compatible wireless card and a slot-2 flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
It's highly recommended that you get either a slot-2 cart and slot-1 NoPass combination or a slot-1 cart that doesn't need a NoPass.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#122135 - dantheman - Sat Mar 17, 2007 6:39 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would suggest waiting and doing more research before buying.  There are many products out there, and you don't want to end up with the wrong one because you didn't know enough about it at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
There are two types of DS flash carts, ones that go in the DS slot and ones that go in the GBA slot.  For the GBA ones, you need a passthrough device.  Brief history:
<br/>
PassMe created - concept is to borrow DS game's boot code in order to launch code from the GBA slot while still in DS mode, a feat normally not allowed by the DS.
<br/>
PassMe2 replaced it after the original PassMe was rendered ineffectual on firmware 4 and above
<br/>
A NoPass is recommended today.  These are the same size as DS cartridges and can be used on nearly all devices.
<br/>
There's also FlashMe, a firmware replacement that, among other things, removed the need for the passthrough device, but you have to have the passthrough device to install FlashMe in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>
DS-slot carts are different though.  They launch directly and do not need external passthrough devices.  They do not have GBA compatibility, and their homebrew compatibility is slightly lower since not all homebrew uses the DLDI system.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you plan to do with your DS?  Is homebrew web browsing important?  GBA compatibility?  The ability to play GB and GBC games?  If you answered yes to any of those, then a slot-2 solution might be better suited for your purposes.  It's all about what you want to do with your DS and what you don't really care about doing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#122185 - HyperHacker - Sat Mar 17, 2007 7:55 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Playing GBA games requires a slot-2 device with RAM (so not GBAMP, Supercard Rumble etc). Making your own games requires knowledge of C/C++ and how to use GCC. The only Internet browsers available are Opera (official port, sold in stores but not in North America) and DSLinux Retawq (text only). Neither are very good especially if your card doesn't have extra RAM; Opera is slow, and Retawq only displays text and frequently runs out of memory without the extra RAM. (I can't even start it in the latest builds. :-/) Neither support Flash, so Youtube is out.
<br/>
<br/>
How you transfer things depends on the device you buy. They'll be using either a Compact Flash, SD, MiniSD or MicroSD card, or built-in flash ROM. You can buy combination CF/SD writers for your PC dirt cheap, and most MiniSD and MicroSD cards come with adapters to fit in an SD writer (it's the same thing, just bigger). Carts with built-in flash ROM (not recommended IMO) will have to be written using their included software.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
