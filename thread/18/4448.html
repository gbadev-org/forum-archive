Nah, it doesn't use OGL but the theory is sound. I've been flipping through Tricks of the 3D Game Programming Gurus in order to try setting up my own software renderer.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not buying a DS until there's a port of DevKitAdvance or something, though. Or at least until Zookeeper DS comes out. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's what I'm wondering as well.  Surely it's a software-layer API that hooks into the 3D hardware?  Oh wait, is there actual 3D hardware on this thing or are the CPUs used for rendering?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not that I am challenging you, but where is this shown? If this is true, then what is the point of having registers that relate to 3d matrices? I think if it is a software library then we are all screwed, because obviously that library is copyrighted. If it is hardware, then we are fine. Now if it is software and yet we can still get at all of that hardware that the software library is wrapping, then we are fine as well. Although it suggests a certain degree of complexity that Nintendo wasn't even willing to push onto commercial developers.

That would be the best I guess if there had to be a library at all. That said, obviously such a lib would have to be externally programmable. I forget off the top of my head but is there any kind of EPROM on the DS that's large enough to hold a 3D api of any use?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it is done by hardware, but the first thing I will do is write a software renderer, since I want more control than Nintendo will expose through their API.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To my understanding, the ARM7 at 33 MHz handles all the GBA stuff when playing GBA games, and it does the touch screen, wireless, microphone, and audio when playing DS games.  To me, this would say that the ARM9 at 66 MHz handles all the graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore to my understanding, the 2D side of things on the DS is little more impressive than the GBA, if at all, and having a few extra bits of color (18 bit compared to 15 bit) isn't going to require 4x or more (the GBA had 16 MHz to run EVERYthing) power, so it seems logical that the 2nd CPU does ALL the graphics, 3D or otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I'm not up to snuff when it comes to 3D stuff, so I could be wrong.  This is just me exercising my common sense.

From what I heard the two CPUs both render graphics one for either screen and that they switch screens depending which screen needs the higher quality graphics.  If you notice the graphics on one screen is always a little better than the other.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's cool, but I think the point here is that 3D on the DS is done via hardware. The fact that there is a software library available to commercial devs is a lot different then there being no other way of using 3D on the DS without their libs. See my point?
<br/>
<br/>
I think the point of clarification is worth mentioning, since essentially there is not a lot of difference between there being a software library available by Nintendo for 3D on the DS and there being a library available from Joe Schmoe to do gfx on the GBA. In the end, the commercial developer is allowed to use the hardware and Nintendo's consoles (in both cases) exposes the hardware, so the most accurate way to describe the DS from a technical standpoint is to say that the 3D capability is done through hardware.
