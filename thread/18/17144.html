    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was using the Pern Map Editor, and exported teh mappings, tiles, and palettes.   Loaded them up into VRAM, and everything is great except one thing.  The transparent color is black, and there are multiple black colors within the palette.  And because of this any tiles that need that transparent color use black instead of the transparent black.  I was wondering if anyone knew how to change it so there is one black before I export from the editor or how to manually fix this.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that all make sense. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
EDIT: I figured out how to do it manually once I got the tile data format.  All I had to do was just change sone numbers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the best way is to use a file format with alpha (like png), the editor will use this and so will grit in the exporter.  If this is not an option you should use ome color other han black for transperency (brigh pink is pretty common). you can change the transperent color in the tileset property viewer.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Funny thing is, I did change the color. I tried a bunch of colors, including pink, and it still insists on making it a black color.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a different question though that's related to tiles and sprite sizes.  I see you can have a 16x16 sprite or 32x32 sprite, but can you set up a 24x24 sprite?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no, you can place your 24x24 image inside a 32x32 sprite or you could use more than a single sprite (but I wouldn't do that, personally)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
