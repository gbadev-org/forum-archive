    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I was thinking about this. Anyways, I looked up on google about 802.11 b/g TV antennas. And why not try to write software for the ds like how the WMB.exe was writen, but be able to send wireless signals to the NDS and download the TV channel via wifi. I'm going to look more into it and maybe even talk to Tim Schuerewegen about this and see what he says. So yea, maybe be able to pick diff. chanells at a time. One thing though, a computer would have to transmute wireless beacon signals to the TV to the DS for getting TV channels on your Nintendo DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And your lazy, just download the chanell that's currently on in your tv, and yea, watch some tv from the ds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
