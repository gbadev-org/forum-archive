<br/>
<br/>
PC system requirements say you need at least a 90 mhz Pentium and 24 megs of RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
I would assume that it's just a matter of finding someone willing to port it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because of the violence. I like the game design of SoR as well as Final Fight.
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to see someone with very much experience on the SoR design to make a game for the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its just the particular bor.pak im using. Since the memory size I suspect would be a constraint i just went for the smallest bor.pak i could find, iv tried a couple other small ones Double Dragon and Simpson bor pak and they seem to work. I tried with the original Bor.pak(62 megs) and well at least my ds emulators dont seem to like it.
<br/>
<br/>
Iv setup a donation page on my site, so hopefully will be able to purchase some hardware to test on my ds by the end of the month.

I was waiting for Bor
<br/>
Just a stupid question from a noob
<br/>
When you say Mixer is updated in SDL does it mean sound work and will work in your next release ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your work :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nope not yet, but code that uses SDL_mixer can be at least compiled, but it uses the audio function from main SDL lib, so untill that works no sound in SDL ports.

its just a mod pak for Beats of Rage, the BOR engine lets you make mod pak's for different graphic/sound etc. <a href="http://www.senileteam.com" target="_blank">http://www.senileteam.com</a> for more information about BOR.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently a PSP port of OpenJazz ( <a href="http://treacle.hewwo.com/jazz/oj/" target="_blank">http://treacle.hewwo.com/jazz/oj/</a> ) was released. GPF, since you're an author of Dreamcast port of this engine, could you port it to DS ? Source code is quite small, and it uses SDL for all graphics/sound. IMHO, Jazz JackRabbit was the best platformer game on PC in 90's , so it deserves to be ported onto DS:)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah iv ported it already, but there are still some bugs in my SDL lib like doublebuffer so right now the screen is being drawn between frames and alot of other graphics problems. But otherwise it appears to be running just fine. I need to update my dreamcast port to the latest codebase as well so when I do that ill update my ds port too.
