    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm completely new to the DS homebrew scene and I'm wondering if it's possible to draw 3D stuff in front of 2D stuff drawn with a framebuffer?
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially what I'm trying to do for starters is combine the code from two tutorials; one for 2d using a framebuffer and one for 3d. I've got the 2D and 3D stuff working individually so that what is displayed depends on if I use MODE_5_3D or MODE_FB0, but is it possible to get both at once?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is perfectly possible if I remember correctly. Use MODE_5_3D, bg2/bg3 for framebuffer and bg0 for 3d, also make sure you set your priorities correctly.
<br/>

Don't attempt to do this in an emulator. I don't think it'll work, and you'll spend hours trying to figure out what's wrong.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
