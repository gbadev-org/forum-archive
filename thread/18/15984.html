    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm learning PAlib, and I need to load one jpg dynamic from FAT. I think that I can do it with Palib, but I can't find any function, to position and resize the image.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone help me?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have seen in other sites that I need load de image in the VRAM with a function that decompress jpeg, but I don't know use this function and I'm not really sure if with this I can resize and position the image.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Resizing would involve usage of an <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling" target="_blank">image scaling</a> algorithm such as nearest neighbor or bilinear interpolation. Positioning, at least in a framebuffer, would simply be ((y * screenwidth) + x), although you'd need code to ensure the image doesn't 'wrap' around to the other side of the screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm reading the first manual of this forum (the recomended) and I'm learning more interesting things.

Thanks again! :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
