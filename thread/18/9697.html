    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">...or lack of... it seems that there seems to be a real lack of emus development on the ds? why do you think the ds never really took off as an emu platform?
<br/>
but saying that, the ds seems to be a haven of really usable apps (draw, nitrotacker) so it's not at all bad. i just think that emu's are really nice things to play with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are already many emulators written for the GBA (PocketNES, SNES Advance, Goomba, PCEAdvance, SMSAdvance, MSXAdvance, Cologne,...). There isn't really a need for DS ports of them since they can also be run on the DS in GBA-mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that's true but there are features on the ds, like wifi which would be really nice for multiplayer online or locally, that could add a little something here and there. i'm not sure how the touch screen could be used with emu, but i'm sure someone could think of something innovative. metroid style voice coms in multiplayer emu games?you  could use the bottom screen as an always on coms thing in multi player emus online. maybe even swop roms online to play?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

nesDS has a really nice touch screen menu (and also uses the touch screen for resizing of the image on the top screen).  I for one would love to see an Intellivision emulator for the DS using the touch screen as the INTV's keypad.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
