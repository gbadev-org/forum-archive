    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I want to add ad hoc multiplayer to my game and was wondering what the state was? There is some info in the wifi lib but is there any working code out there? liblobby seems to have basically disappeared.....
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I want a solution that works, with reliable comms and wont get outdated next time there is a devkit update :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reply, I'll look at your post.....

I am a bit confused. Should I wait for the next wifi lib update and hope some ad hoc is present or should i try to piece together something similar to liblobby..... using posts that fix dropping issues?
<br/>
<br/>
Help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I gather the official adhoc support is still quite some time off, without a firm date.  My hack is workable and very simple, but not perfect, and liblobby was crash-central for me when I threw together even a few simple tests.
<br/>
<br/>
My project lives here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ndspoker/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/ndspoker/</a> - code and a working binary are there, the relevant code is in wifi.cpp
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that I didn't add to Google Code is the single function that I rewrote for the DSWifi library, but that's in my post here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say if you really want to get going on something, try my hack.  I'd expect that replacing my stuff with the real adhoc support if it comes along would be pretty trivial and in the meantime you can get something working.<br/>_________________<br/>It's not an illusion, it just looks like one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My changes aren't going to go into libNds because they don't adhere to the 802.11 standard.
<br/>
<br/>
I could email you libs, but I stopped taking libNds updates at 1.3.2 (which seems to be a good thing since it looks like the Wifi got a little screwed up recently) so any binary I have relates to 1.3.2 and not the absolute latest stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I might be persuaded to apply my changes to the latest stuff and build a binary but it's pretty easy so you should be able to do it yourself.<br/>_________________<br/>It's not an illusion, it just looks like one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
