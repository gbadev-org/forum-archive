<br/>
<br/>
how are the odds, that gbatek will go missing in the future too?
<br/>
At the moment, the information is no longer maintained, and the last update too it lies far before the last sign of life from Martin.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there an alternative and compareable source of information about the system?
<br/>
If not, does anyone plan to take it over for the time Martin is not unable to do it?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Maxxie on Thu May 29, 2008 11:42 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there are various mirrors. I vaguely remember lick having a zipped copy in his sig or something too.  Opera always maintains a copy in my browser for quick reference too so I could always grab a copy if it goes down ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, what happened with Martin in the end? Did anyone in Germany manage to reach him?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i have looked for a number myself, but i couldn't find a good match.

although i don't know him in person, i'm hoping he's all right!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have fiddled around a bit and discovered some behaviour in parts of the hardware that are missing in the GBATek. Since it has not much use any more to wait for Martin to pick that info up i've started to document the details in a wiki.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://nintendods.desperate-programmers.com/" target="_blank">http://nintendods.desperate-programmers.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the info is still from GBATek, but i intend to add several details. (Just like the behaviour when <a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/nintendods/doku.php?id=w_uscompare" target="_blank">W_USCOMPARE </a>matches W_USCOUNTER already at enabling)
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is welcomed to add in information when you stumble on it. If you don't know the interpretation of your observation, put in a testcase and the result on hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope we can help the open source emulators with an as accurate description of the hardware as possible to make their babies more accurate to fill in the hole due to no&amp;cash decaying.
<br/>
<br/>

I hope other people start editing too.

There are now quite some things there that are not covered by gbatek, even tho i only scrapped very few registers yet.
<br/>
<br/>
From what i have seen untill now on the circular buffer and usec counter, i think that a lot of the things done to initialize the wifi in dswifi and liblobby are really unneccesary. (It's written several times in akkit's doku, but it seems noone actually cleaned it yet)
<br/>
<br/>
I recently started to implement my findings on desmume's "experimental wifi" feature, check out the patch for wifi wrestler 002 :D<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://nintendods.desperate-programmers.com/doku.php?id=wireless_io_map" target="_blank">Trying  to bring more detail into understanding the wireless hardware</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
