    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before I get in over my head, I'm wondering a few things:
<br/>
<br/>
a) How high-level is the programming language (and what is the programming language) for the DS? I have experience with basic javascript and PHP w/ SQL. Would being familiar with such languages be helpful with learning the DS dev. language or is it completely different?
<br/>
<br/>
b) What are the hardware specific tech specs of the DS, such as processor speed, RAM, bus speed, ... (if it applies or is relevant)?
<br/>
<br/>
c) What kind of shareware/freeware programs are avaliable for DS program development for Mac OSX (10.2 &lt;--ya..kind of behind)? If there isn't much, recommendations for programs for Windows XP, are welcome. (I can't live without more than one operating system)
<br/>
<br/>
d) Do you have any advice from your personal experience with modding the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch for your input! I know the question is a bit broad and vauge, but I don't know where else to start!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hah, yeah, no. :)  Well, okay, that's not strictly true... javascript gives you a basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts (variables, control flow constructs, etc), but that's about as far as it's usefulness goes.
<br/>
<br/>
Get yourself a good book on C or C++ (we'll let the language bigots fight that one out ;), a compiler kit and development environment for your machine (I like the GNU kit (gcc, etc) + Emacs, but the less esoteric out there would probably prefer Eclipse... all of which is free), and start writing programs for your *desktop* computer first.  Once you have a strong handle on writing C/C++ apps (in particular, pointers and memory management), then you *might* be ready to start tinkering.  'course, for most people, it'll take 6 months to a year before they're comfortably at that stage.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the rest, the answers are in the forums/on the web.  Search and you shall find.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Excellent! Now I can start plowing through that C++ book that my mom bought me for Christmas. Funny how I only seem to use my programming books if it's been at least 6 months since I acquired them.

Thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
