Interesting, huh? This will be quite a battle between the DS and the PSP. 
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, does this have any similarity to how the GameBoy was launched? I am only 15, so it was before my time so to speak... :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Built-in memory isn't really the best solution. Building a memory with the same capacity as 20 memory cards would be very expensive and probably eat precious space in the machine.
<br/>
<br/>
Disregarding the cost, what would you do if the memory is full and you absolutely MUST save your game and you really, really don't want to free up save slots. Transferring saves to a PC isn't a possibility because Sony would have to either create a PC program to talk to the PSP, or have the PSP act as for example a Samba server.
<br/>
<br/>
Having a USB slot for memory sticks means you have to support the majority of existing sticks with various sizes and discrepancies. And the PlayStation image would probably take a hit if Sony encourage using non-PlayStation peripherals with their device.
<br/>
<br/>
Having both built-in memory and a slot for memory cards is probably also to expensive. Besides, when they have the memory card slot, why have built-in memory aswell.. That way they don't make money selling memory cards.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I should point out the PSP <span style="font-weight: bold">already</span> has a USB slot.
<br/>
<br/>
But you make two good points -- too much space taken inside, too much cost.  But what about <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> internal memory?
<br/>
<br/>
If you have two memory cards, and you bring two games on a trip with you, and they have their saved games on different cards, it'd be very annoying to switch memory cards every time you switched games.  But with some internal memory, you could transfer the saves for a few games internally, thus reducing the possibility of losing your card(s) due to swapping (or little brother theft), and would reduce the immediate need for people to buy more stuff.  It's rather off-putting to spend several hundred dollars on a system, a hundred or so on a couple games, then find out you ABSOLUTELY MUST pay more money just to save your game, something you've NEVER had to do on a portable before EVER (to my knowledge).
<br/>
<br/>
So, no it's not the best solution, but neither is requiring people to spend all their money.  Just my two cents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#27503 - mymateo - Thu Oct 14, 2004 8:29 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm going to have to side with tepples on his TV analogy, though for a different reason.
<br/>
<br/>
I am much more likely to buy something if I already own something compatible with it.  For example, if the PSP was compatible with Smart Media cards, I would be much more likely to consider buying one because I already own a Smart Media card.
<br/>
<br/>
So, in that respect, it would be a good move for Sony, or any other hardware developer, to support other popular technology.  This is purely due to the fact that people have a general distrust of new technology based on how fleeting it has been in the past.  The ngage flopped in my quiet little town, I have never EVER seen anyone use one (except for the demo model in EB), and I have never heard of anyone owning one PERIOD.  So anything a company can do to offset that natural distrust would be a good move, and may very well help a good product get the recognition it deserves.
<br/>
<br/>
If you doubt what I say, read a few techie magazines (Maximum PC, that sort), anything that reviews different hardware and gives honest upsides and downsides to everything they review.  You will find that most products that support a little-used technology might get some disapproval, and that anything that heavily relies on little-used technology for basic functionality will get flamed, and there is a reason for that.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope I've shed some light.  I really don't care <span style="font-style: italic">what</span> Sony does right now, nor do I think they have anyone reading these posts trying to get ideas, so this is all irrelevant in real life anyways.
<br/>
<br/>

To me that sounds about as silly as saying, "Hey I got a chair, now I'm more likely to buy a house to put the chair in." I'm not saying you're wrong, I simply don't buy the arguments when it comes to videogame consoles. For something else, like a computer or a phone it would be something completely different, I wouldn't buy anything that isn't standardized (unless for a very good reason ofcourse) ...

If I had a bluetooth connection in my computer and I was buying a new phone I would defenitely go for a bluetooth enabled phone rather than one with their own proprietary connection possibilities. So for that matter I definetely agree with you.

<br/>
I understand why a PC product that doesn't support the major standards will get disaproval but in the PC world compability is vital because if your product doesn't meet the standards to a 100% you cannot guarantee that your product work with every possible match in the world simply because you cannot test your product with everything else. In the console world theres another matter. Sony design their console and memory card to work with each other and nothing else, that makes it a lot easier to verify that every match (that only one) works. If a problem should arise along the way, which of course is possible, then Sony will know exactly what the problem is and prohibit developers from reproducing the bug in their own software.
<br/>
<br/>
And to draw my argument to it's extreme, why would only memory cards be disapproved when it's exactly the same situation with the joypads for the PS2? And that's just exterior, why would people want to buy a console that is built from unknown parts instead of one that's built from known hardware like intel motherboards+processor, nvidia graphicschip, yamaha soundchips. (I know some consoles actually are built on this hardware but it's not because consumer rather buys this hardware, rather it's because it's cheap to develop that kind of system)
<br/>
<br/>
So in short, I don't think the console world is comparable to the PC world because it's more closed off to the rest of the world and easy to control and verify that stuff works.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#27546 - mymateo - Fri Oct 15, 2004 6:20 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True enough.  But as for comparing controllers in the PS2 to the memory cards in the PSP, that's a little off-the-wall.  I'm not sure how to take it, but I'll point out that my argument is based on the PSP being portable.  With a home console, it isn't meant to be portable.  Yes, you can move it, but you can't really play it on the go, as in walking down the street, and therefore is more suited to people who have enough room to hook up a console and store, to a certain extent, peripherals and accessories to it.  
<br/>
<br/>
However, the portable gamer, has limited storage capacity on-the-go (pockets and, for some, carrying case), and risks a much greater chance of losing or damaging his console.  For this reason, I feel that reducing the number of parts, and therefore amount of storage space needed, is a good move.  Not always economical, but a step towards more secure gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the argument of compatibility, if the memory was built it, it would be absolutely 100% compatible.  Besides, 3rd party developers are bound to make memory cards/sticks for the PSP if Sony lets them, and that's exactly why we have standards.  The SD memory cards (to pull more references from the PC world - sorry, I'm a computer tech, it's what I know) are all made to the same specs, so anything that uses an SD memory card is guaranteed to use any manufacturer's SD memory card.  Whether or not the card is a peice of garbage and fails the first time you use it doesn't enter into the compatibility.  But, again, this is another somewhat poor comparison to gaming, 'cause it's not like there's an SG (Secure Gaming) memory card that the PS2 and GameCube use.  No no, each console has its different memory card.  Sure, the PS2 can use PS1 memory cards, but only for PS1 games.
<br/>
<br/>
And it is true that having a chair wouldn't necessitate buying a house, but wouldn't it be nice to have a place to put it?  (Totally off-topic and irrelevant, but I thought I'd say that just for fun :)
<br/>
<br/>
And something you said really struck me when I first read it, but for some reason I've forgotten what it was, and re-reading your post didn't help... Good lord, I'm a dunce...  Anyways, I was going to say it was a good argument, so instead I'll just say you're a good arguer.  It's rare to find someone interested more in the actual points of the matter.  Most people resort to mindless bickering... I like to avoid that, nothing gets done then...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyway, back to the original point of this topic, now that launch details have been revealed, what do you people think about it? Reggie says that the Nintendo DS has the best launch portfolio Nintendo has ever come up with. Do you agree with that statement and why?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is it important that Nintendo has a surefire killer 3rd party game to survive? Everyone knows that Nintendo will make the usual stuff, but I honestly think that the DS will only stay afloat because there is ample support from 3rd parties. 3rd parties left the GCN because no one was buying thier games on the GCN, but instead on the Xbox and PS2. Odd, don't you think?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#27575 - mymateo - Fri Oct 15, 2004 11:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the DS will sell enough games to keep its 3rd party support...  but I do think that getting awesome multiplayer from 3rd party devrs (lets face it, Nintendo ran out of ideas when N64 was just about gone) is really important to the DS thriving.  As for simply survivng, I think Nintendo could manage that with minimal 3rd party support... but only just.
<br/>
<br/>
As for release titles, this is what I think of it.  The 3rd party release titles are going to be really good, and cover many genres, so everyone will (most likely) have something to play.  But shame on Nintendo!  Everyone is going to get PictoChat and the First Hunt demo with their DS at release, and the ONLY game Nintendo has confirmed at launch is Super Mario DS (formerly SM 64x4).  I think they should release Animal Crossing DS, Mario Kart DS, Wario Ware Inc. DS, and Super Mario Bros. at launch.  Especially since it looks like the PSP will be getting released around the same time now.  That's unconfirmed, but it's possible.
<br/>
<br/>
But, I've read rumors that the big N might have some surprises yet to come.  Can you say "extra release titles" boys and girls?  Or maybe including a free year subscription to an online gaming service?  Even better, releasing an official Nintendo wireless router for $30 US ($40 CAN) to anyone who pre-ordered their DS so they can play people online from across the globe?  Or what do you want to bet all we loyal people who paid ahead of time get some dorky T-shirt, or a free 1 year subscription to Nintendo Power, or some kid's watch?  Ugh, I don't know if I <span style="font-weight: bold">want</span> Nintendo to pull out any surprises now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope. Though the system itself imposes no region coding, the Japan, USA, and Europe versions of a GBA game tend to use <a class="postlink" href="http://everything2.com/?node=mario%20kart%20bugs" target="_blank">different protocol versions</a>. I see no reason for the DS to break this tendency.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Changing the character set alone could break multiplayer if any text is excanged.  I don't think the goal is to make the games incompatable.  Compatability between different language versions of the same game is a feature.  Like any other feature, it takes time and money to develope.  In the case of the GBA, it's also an obscure feature that would not convince many people to buy the game.  With a global network the feature is suddenly less obscure and could potentially be justified.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well tepples, normally I'd agree with you because I've come to respect you as a higher intellect, but I *could* see a reason for DS to maintain the same protocols whereas the GBA didn't:  the GBA wasn't built to go online, the DS is.  This, however, doesn't mean much to corporate guys.  And as sgeos points out, different languages DOES present quite a problem...
<br/>
<br/>
So, overall, I think I'll just retract what I said before, and restate as such.
<br/>
<br/>
"Even better, releasing an official Nintendo wireless router for $30 US ($40 CAN) to anyone who pre-ordered their DS so they can play people online from outside DS' built-in wireless range?"
<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I'm getting at is that it'd be nice if Nintendo would finally support online gaming, even if it IS just an extention of DS' wireless, and not actually games hosted VIA server (just servers to facilitate a more P2P-type connection).  Does that make sense?  It's 3 hours past my bedtime, my eyes are dried out, and sometimes I can't tell if I'm making sense...
<br/>
<br/>
Let's put it this way, if I don't make sense, then just ignore me and continue on with the discussion.
