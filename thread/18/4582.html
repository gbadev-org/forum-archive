    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure the games themself doesnt do anything with the encrytion on the cart's. Its probably all taken care of, either in hardware, or the OS. So.. Once the wifi is broken. Cant we just write a small app that we upload to the DS that reads the card and sends it back to the computer?
<br/>
<br/>
There might be some protection in the OS that blocks access to the cart for security reasons. Both that it's probaly one of the easiest ways to dump a game, and also that you could make troyans that clears your saved games.
<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?
