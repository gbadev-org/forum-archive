Things wouldn't be so slow and we wouldn't be so behind the psp scene. Using the sdk works, I mean look at the xbox scene, it has always been on the xdk and it  is a very strong scene with pretty much all emus ported, and the libraries have even been made better like with virtual memory. Anyways do what you want, i'm just fucking whining.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Technically, adopting the Nintendo SDK isn't as simple as adopting the XDK. It's my understanding that the Nintendo SDK involves Nitro hardware and the development libraries probably depend on this. These kits cost $10,000 to $20,000 USD, so it's no wonder why no one is even bothering to use the SDK. The XDK is easier to adopt/pirate, as it involves the XDK libraries and MS Visual Studio .Net. It also requires a development-ready Xbox, something that's easy to create by modifying an end-user Xbox. Of course, there is info in the Nintendo SDK that is useful without the dev-hardware, but there are other reasons to respect copyrights and licenses...
<br/>
<br/>
Ethically...
<br/>
Xbox-Scene.com seems to straddle the legal line, but even they claim that they don't condone any illegal use of the XDK. From their homebrew releases page:

<br/>
Just because it's not shut down doesn't mean it's acceptable. Microsoft has a lot of bigger fish to fry than a few hundred console hackers.
<br/>
<br/>
Just because an SDK or XDK is "out there" doesn't make it legal to download and use without permission or license. Respectable people respect copyrights and licenses. You'll only find respectable people here (generally).

Nintendo is very different from Microsoft. They take more extreme measures to prevent piracy; did you ever hear about the Gamecube discs spinning backwards (and they're a wee-bit smaller too if you look =O)? They are much more focused than Microsoft in stamping out piracy and EULA violations on their console hardware.

Actually, "we" are actually quite far ahead of the PSP; "we" know how the 3D hardware works, and "we" have a better development environment. The reason the PSP has a flood of emulators and suchlike is that it has more RAM and a faster CPU, which makes these things a lot easier to accomplish.
<br/>
<br/>
And from what I gather, ndslib is broadly equivalent to the official SDK anyway, excepting wifi. In fact, ndslib lets you do stuff the SDK forbids (like accessing the ARM7). You seem to think that the SDK is some kind of magic bullet that gives you more RAM, a faster CPU, and somehow improves your coding skills.

Anyway, am I the only person completely uninterested in running emulators on my DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No your not. If someone wishes to play a snes game, go get yourself a snes -_-
<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate Homebrew games much more, gives me something new what not every game offers, something not done by others, or playing something i allready know. In some cases an emulator can sure bring some new stuff up, but i rather play it on the system it was ment for then playing it on my handheld without limitations and bugs (not every emulator has this though).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.picfront.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">www.picfront.com [ Upload your pictures ]</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
