<br/>
<br/>
From what I experimented, it seems that when one turns the microphone on, there is a bunch of data that are read as &gt; 128 (even if one does not blow in the micro :). Then, after a very short time, the level get stable around 128.
<br/>
Did somebody also experimented this fact ?
<br/>
Is there a known reason ?
