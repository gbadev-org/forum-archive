<br/>
does anyone work on an "ebook reader" for the ds?
<br/>
something like a converter for existing txt or pdf files! with the 2 sreens, it will be a perfect ebook ;)!!!

<br/>
<br/>
And don't worry about your English, some people who speak English as a first language can't speak as well as you can :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heheh. I had an idea for an eBook interface once.
<br/>
<br/>
Hold the DS sideways, rendering one page on each screen, in Portrait orientation.
<br/>
<br/>
Use the stylus/thumbpad to grab a page and flip it.
<br/>
<br/>
Voila, instant "natural" feel. Or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that you would hold it with the bottom screen to the right, turning the DS counter-clockwise, and you can't go back a page without breaking the whole disbelief-thingy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think that is very good for the eyes. The scanline will travel horizontally then and you can clearly see the picture gets a bit messier. Atleast i woulden't want to read a book that gave me epelipsy ;)
<br/>
But hey, who said that book really need to be in portrait dimension? we could change the standards and read our book as an almanac :D<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://manifested.ath.cx" target="_blank">http://manifested.ath.cx</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, playing the DS sideways in Polarium's multiplayer makes the screen look...odd.
<br/>
<br/>
It actually has a sort of 3D effect with the array of squares.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Allright, so I fail at scanlines.
<br/>
<br/>
Gotta admit it's a nice idea, though. Eh?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey guys, i'm no longer sure i'm 100% correct about those scanlines. Check that demo "Ds training for adults" , you're supposed to hold it in portrait mode, and i see no disturbances to the picture. What ever the trick is , it would be nice if the current gba-bookreader by Crowe could adopt it. Lately i've been seeing those damn scanlines when i close my eyes after reading.
<br/>
<br/>
Sub-pixel rendered text would also be a big plus.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://manifested.ath.cx" target="_blank">http://manifested.ath.cx</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
