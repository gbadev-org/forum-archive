    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What would the "Killer App" for the DS be? What kinda of program or game could make people buy the system? For instance, I know some people that got an XBox just because of all the emulators. Sure they loved Halo, but the emulators were the icing on the cake. 
<br/>
<br/>
So do you think the killer app could be an emulator? Lets say an SNES emu that ran at full speed. Maybe it could be DS-linux or some other PDA-type shell. Maybe a web browser, or other net-app like VNC. Maybe some sort of online game. What do you guys think?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think emulators are a big draw. A PDA is nice and all, but I have that functionality on my phone. 
<br/>
<br/>
I would say multimedia (GBAMP), but the PSP has that in the bag. Too bad they're $AU 400. I also believe a lot of people would have bought the Xbox for XBMC (Xbox Media Center). 
<br/>
<br/>
The biggest killer app would probably be an online game. I am really looking forward to Mario Kart DS, especially after completing Super Circuit and playing 4 player battle mode. So, come November (or December, or January 2006), I will be doing nothing but racing online, unless I need to reflash my firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a real PDA software with calender,phonebook etc etc would be my personal DS killer-app.....no question.
<br/>
The touchscreen screams for such an app and I'm still wondering why there isn't one out yet(exept some side-functions of  DSDOS).
<br/>
even more strange that not even a commercial PDA software was released yet.I know at least 12 people in my hometown who are waiting for one.Hell, it even seems that the only commercial organizer software for DS("Organizer Plus" by Summitsoft) got canceled for no reason.<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally, I would love to have a full featured OS on the DS, or at least a cool shell that could run OS type apps. I think a multimedia player would be useful as well (MP3, DiVX, etc.). Online applications would be awesome. Imagine using VNC to log onto your home pc (or someone elses!) using the DS. Even an VoIP program would be pretty cool. But this would mostly be for wow factor: "look ma, I can make a phone call with my gameboy!!!!"
<br/>
<br/>
   I real killer app, IMHO, would be HaloDS. Look at how many systems Micro$oft has sold just because of Halo. If nintendo could somehow create an online game as good as that, the DS would be golden. The metroid hunters demo had good enough graphics for a portable (and rivals even the PSP games like Coded Arms) and if this was online people would love it. Or what about a 2D MMORPG. If they made a Zelda Online that looked just like the SNES version but you could customize your character and play in clans. That would be awesome. Everyone would buy the DS. Why does Nintendo not do this? What are they waiting for?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Obviously a PS3 emulator is insane. I doubt any deskop PCs could emulate that for at least another 5 years. But an N64 emulator or a PS1 emulator are possible, IMHO. Obviously they probably wouldn't run full speed, but I think the DS is capable. In terms of realistic goals, I would be happy with a working SNES or Genesis emulator. A NeoGeo emulator would be awesome too. I checked the specs for the original NeoGeo and it is within the 10:1 ratio someone else mentioned. So a NeoGeo emulator would be technically possible if someone wanted to write one. I am not too familiar with coding an emulator (checked out some source code and it made my head spin), so I'll stick to creating original games from scratch. I would hold off on writing a web browser for now. It is possible Nintendo already has one made and will release it when the Wifi goes live. Similar to the browser hack in Wip3out for PSP, maybe there will be a way to leverage Nintendo's official browser. This is all assuming someone cracks the TCP stack anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The GBA is likely not to be able to handle emulating a Sega Genesis, given the slow CPU speed and the much smaller screen. Therefore, they're likely to be <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario Advance</span> style ports rather than Classic NES Series style ports.

Don't get me wrong; I'm stoked on homebrew dev -- a feeling I pined for when the PS2 Linux Kit made it's disappointing debut -- and tooling with dslinux, but in the end the games drove me to make the purchase a few days ago.  Kirby and Advance Wars are satisfying in a way not felt since playing F-Zero and Super Mario World for the first time.  That's what I want out of a gaming device: fun.

Hell yeah!  An updated version of Mario Paint with more than 9 possible frames of animation and wifi transfer would rock my sox.
<br/>
<br/>
So would a combination of a simplified character modeller (Spore), AI sequencer (Carnage Heart) and arena battler (Robotic Alchemic Drive).<br/>_________________<br/>dz

well,it's not Mario Paint but you ?make animations with 30 frames,8 draw tools and use DS'es full colorspectrum: <a class="postlink" href="http://nintendo-ds.dcemu.co.uk/flipbook.shtml" target="_blank">Flipbook DS</a>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">The program is pretty simple and I tried to make everything very intuitive, but here are some things you should know. First off, you'll need to adjust the pressure setting (top right corner of the screen) which will filter out low pressure touches which are usually innacurate. If you find the pen jumping when you try to draw, turn it down-- if you have to press hard or your touches don't register at all, turn it up. Also, only use the fill tool inside of objects (don't fill the whole screen with it).
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the controls. The duplicates are because I made it friendly for both left and right handed people:
<br/>
<br/>
L or R - Swap the screens
<br/>
UP and DOWN or X and B - Select drawing tools
<br/>
LEFT and RIGHT or Y and A - Select next or last frame
<br/>
Select - undo
<br/>
Start - Copy last frame
<br/>
<br/>
You can also turn on a ghost copy of the last frame (for tracing when animating) by pressing the button that looks like two pieces of paper on top of each other.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

No bad.  Reminds me of the sadistic MP Yoshi animations of my youth.  I should've really gone outside more often... thanks dad.<br/>_________________<br/>dz

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I say a Pdf/Doc viewer with functions such as text highlight, bookmarks, links (within doc), imgs, portrait/landscape view, zooming(text scaling?),  multiple doc support with the ability to save docs viewing pref in sram... i could brobably go on and on but what i shoud do is learn how to code so i could do this myself.... 
<br/>
<br/>
I would use this to read e-books and archived webpages such as mapquest routes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but really on the practical side of things an SNES emu with exceptional compatability would be a killer app
<br/>
has a PC-Engine emulator been mentioned? Alien Crush Rulez!!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Killer app would obviously be a OS with a flash-like editor, so you could create your own apps/games on the DS. The editor would contain a drawing part, animating part, scripting part, sound (maybe only importing). 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe these could be seperate apps, switching between memory and the GBA_MP in the background, so it would appear as just 1 studio/suite. 
<br/>
<br/>
The basis would be a very fast interpreter on which everything runs, inlcuding the os &amp; apps itself. So using the script you'd have the power to even rewrite the os itself. 
<br/>
<br/>
You could make it in such a way that starting an app or game would cause the current app to be dumped to the GBA_MP, so the new app has acces to all the resources. Switching apps would work the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Future versoins could also contain a modeller and 3d-functions in the script, and the option to send apps using wi-fi. And wi-fi functions in the script. Then you could write your own browser.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd write it myself if it wasn't such a daunting task, and if I had more experience writing interpreters, coding the DS, coding in C++, etc. And, most importantly, if I had some more free time. But if anyone feels up to the task, I'd be glad to help.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that concludes my thoughts on the killer app.
<br/>
(Maybe nintendo could even create a commercial game-creation app, using the play-yan as storage device. The app would be 'limited' to 2d, to give commercial games an edge, but still, it could happen)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
