<br/>
<br/>
I know that you don't like "make a port" threads from newbies, but my post is pretty simple - there ARE Hexen/Heretic/Doom ports which are abandoned by their developers, and these three lack DLDI support. AFAIK all the source code is available on the official pages of the projects. I myself (and many people from the community) lack skills to recompile the sourcecode themselves (I mean recompiling when adding DLDI support and stuff), bu I really hope someone on gbadev.org is capable of doing this. I also remember someone actually recompiling Hexen to work on libfat instead of gbfs, but again, that was long ago.

<br/>
<br/>
Seems the only port without DLDI is the Heretic one. But, it uses Slot-2, so I don't really know about full compactibility.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if the source is there, maybe someone can make an unofficial release.<br/>_________________<br/>...Huh.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Whats this? Closed source?? Doesn't that violate the license?
<br/>
If by closed you mean dead, yes, but that doesn't stop someone from adding DLDI support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dunno, it's not like it is GPL'd..  Here is a site with the <a class="postlink" href="http://heretic.linuxgames.com/heretic/bins/orig_license.txt" target="_blank">original license</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the source, and the license with it doesn't say anything about having to provide the source (that I saw) only that you can't make money from it.  I was supprised to see that you can't add "New Game Materials must not contain any illegal, obscene or defamatory materials".
