    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's my new simple little app that I made. It's a multiboot selector. Have you ever found yourself in the situation where one app works with one loader and another app works with the other loader and you don't want to turn on your computer and go switch loaders? This is allows you to select which loader you want to use on start-up. It's only hard coded to MightyMax's GBAMP Multiboot and DragonMinded's DSOrganize app and other.nds which could be another loader you know of or a homebrew app you really like. Thanks to Chishm for the DLDI loader from <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12906" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12906</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The following are the assaignment to each button.
<br/>
A (MightyMax's GBAMP loader): mightymax.nds
<br/>
X (DSOrganize): DSOrganize.nds
<br/>
Y (Whatever): other.nds
<br/>
<br/>
This will work for other cards besides GBAMPv2 but it was really only made for GBAMP. It's already DLDI'ed so just add it to your GBAMP and you're set.

I was thinking about adding MoonShell boooting but then I though that the new moonshell doesn't boot ever since it got DLDI'ed. I actually added a lot of stuff like 5 min. after releasing it. Right now I'm adding GBA booting. Next will be DS cart booting, no lol. I've pretty much made a mock firmware hack now...lol</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
1). I don't see how pirates would use it. It just boots the GBAMP into GBA mode so you don't have to hold down the key sombination at start-up.
<br/>
2). I probably will not be adding HTTP booting. If you want to get files from your computer I suggest using DSFTP. 
<br/>
3). I will maybe later add configuration to it but there's no plan to right now. I might make a version for lefties, though, if there's enough demand.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

2). If you want to use WMB then use that! don't expect me to add a feature I don't use. This isn't a firmware replacement. I might make a bigger project in which I would add WMB maybe...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

here's the entry from my blog:
<br/>
<br/>
Here’s the newest build of GBAMP Multiboot . It adds the ability to boot the GBAMP in to GBA mode. The GBA booting code I was using was outdated and didn’t compile with my environment so you must use a 3rd party GBA booter such as HyperHacker’s or RyanFB’s and rename it gbaboot.nds and put it at the root of your card. The program is pretty self explanitory when you load it up.[/url]

Use it like this:

yeah I figured it out. I was just being stupid and not noticing anything. It seems like whenever I add it in nothing works.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I tried doing 'PersonalData-&gt;_user_data-&gt;gbascreen' but that didn't work. Any suggestions? I suppose I could use the PersonalData from libnds 20060410... but I 'd rather not backtrack. Any help is a appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here's the latest build of GBAMP Multiboot Selector. It adds support for MoonShell (Older MoonShell's are recommended as the newer ones that support DLDI do not load .nds files as well.)  and takes away support for 3rd party GBA launchers. GBA launching will be added back on when I find a way to get the code running on DKA r20 and the newest libnds.  v1.5 will be the last v1 and will have GBA booting added to it. v2.0 will likely be the final version and feature a GUI (Though I don't think it is nessisary). Enjoy!

it's a struct.
<br/>
<br/>
I had  some complaints about this stuff not working in C99 mode so the anonymous structs were named. I'm not entirely sure it was worth it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

NEW:
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the final version of GBAMP Multiboot Selector. It now has support for MightMax's loader, DSOrganize, MoonShell, and other.nds. I have added a GUI if want to call it that. It's basically just a graphic on each screen showing the same info that the text version did. Here's a screenshot:

Believe it or not I made both of those pictures using DSO and Phidas. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you DragonMinded and Tassu for making paint programs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mightmax's loader must be named mightymax.nds. DSO can stay they defualt name of DSOrganize.nds.
<br/>
<br/>
MoonShell has to be moonshell.nds. And whatever other loader or anything, really, has to be other.nds.
<br/>
<br/>
 This will be my last planned version until someone finds away to boot in GBA mode with the newer libnds and DKA r20, or someone suggests another interesting feature.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!
