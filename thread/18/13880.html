    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I entered this into GBAX, wasn't expecting to win, but was hoping to at least get some feedback, but looks like most people who visited the site were more interested in GP2x :( So heres the alpha version of my DSLB game, feedback would be greatly appreciated!

PS. I'm already working on the speed, its a bit of an issue with four bikes playing, 2 seems alot better :) And if you die, don't press A straight away, it will let you watch other bikes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, I was disappointed with GBAX too.  They were a few weeks late for their judging, didn't put down comments for each homebrew, had a really weak one-line description for why the top 3 won, and didn't even show their rating system or metrics that quantifies why the three won over anything else.  I would look at your game but I am currently at work.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah the 'follow cam' still needs alot of work, and it really does run like crap in no$gba, but luckily it runs pretty well on hardware :) no$ has been an immense time saver for testing though. Its def faster than copying to microSD every time!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
