    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I like the organization of the new folders in devkitPro. I haven't had time to try to figure out why, but when I attempted to make the animated sprite example in the graphics folder of NDS section, it wouldn't build. Maybe I did something wrong, very likely, but I wanted to put it out there, just in case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a little typo in the source for that example.. I changed it and saved over the original, but if I remember correctly, it was on line 94:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">enum {SCREEN_TOP = 0, SCREEN_BOTTOM = 192, SCREEN_LEFT = 0, SCREEN_RIGHT = 256];</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>

..That last square bracket ] should be changed to a curly one } .. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
