    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello i am not a big poster on these forums or any nds dev forums but recently i am starting to notice dead links and add filled links because of people using free websites, i was thinking bout setting up a website just for ndsdev sites. so developers can post tutorials, status blogs, and homebrew downloads with out adds or quotas. because of the situation i am in this will come as no cost to me so i will not be charging for these services. for people like chism i have noticed he has still got a geocities site, i can remember the hell i went through with geocities. i dont wanna be wasting my time with this so if you developers think this is a good idea and you require and good free website dedicated to nds devs then please let me know wat you think. it will be good to have everything in one place. please let me know your thoughts......</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
