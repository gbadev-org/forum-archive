If this is in the GBA slot, then where is the GBA flash cart going to go with the actual program on it?
<br/>
<br/>
Unless this device can store a DS executable, and will retain backwards compatibility with WiFiMe/PassMe.
<br/>

But he doesn't seem to bring that point up, and that seems like a major issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Read the post a bit more and there is a picture of the schematic for the device. It's meant for the DS slot, not the GBA slot, based on the size ratio.

That's all well and good, but that doesn't mean it will be compatible with the current loaders.
<br/>
<br/>
The Play-Yan has an SD slot too, but you can't boot DS programs from it with the PassMe, it is a totally different piece of hardware than a GBA flash cart or even the GBAMP, and it will be the same situation with this.

I'd imagine that DSLinux will treat the SD card as a mounted file system, providing open() and related syscalls to the app. That's what more "typical" operating systems do.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Even if it was, since Linux is GPL'd, the driver would be there for anyone to look at, to know how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
For those programs licensed under the GPL, they could even pop chunks of the driver (if any) that would be applicable outside the Linux context.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
