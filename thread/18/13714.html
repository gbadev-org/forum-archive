Is there a website that has all of the Ds homebrew stuff organized and ready to download?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you mean you need a flashcart?  If you want to run homebrew on the DS you need a device that will load the applications onto the DS.  The GP32x is designed for homebrew, and it has hardware built in that loads homebrew, the DS isn't designed for homebrew, so you need a device to insert cards into the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Datel Games n' Music, it's decent quality, not the best, but you can buy it at retail stores, I got mine at Best Buy.  I also have one of the earlier methods of homebrew, the GBA Movie Player version 2 CF (GBAMP CF).  It is very compatible and has fast read and write speeds compared to the GnM.  It requires a passthrough though, I use my GnM for that.
<br/>
<br/>
Other people say the R4DS (Revolution for DS) is a good card, it, like the GnM, uses microSD cards.  The M3 DS Simply is very similar, I think it's the same hardware, as the R4.  There are lots of options.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're talking about developer software, look for devkitpro, which is a powerful devkit for the GBA, NDS, GameCube, PSP, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking for downloadable homebrew applications, I'd recommend <a href="http://www.ndshb.com," target="_blank">www.ndshb.com,</a> <a href="http://www.dev-scene.com," target="_blank">www.dev-scene.com,</a> just google "Nintendo DS Homebrew" for sites.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
