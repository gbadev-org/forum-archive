At this time, unless you have a PassMe, results are rather inconsistent in terms of testing and debugging. I too have been waiting for some tutorials, but in the mean time, it would do inexperienced programmers some good to learn the GBA first as useful skills learned on that platform will carry over to the DS. Also, you will then be able to poke around any of the many public available demos and learn for yourself (although the hard way) how to code for the DS.

<br/>
There are bound to be tutorials available, but if you really are that ambitious, you can go out there and learn for yourself. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's based off of development under Linux, but the coding is the same for any OS.
