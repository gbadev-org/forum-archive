<br/>
I have downloaded devkitARM 20 again (today). dsdoom from (http://code.google.com/p/dsdoom/) will compile with devkitARM 20 without errors. but it is not play able. it run until first graphic screen should appear.
<br/>
<br/>
same source compiles with a few changes on devkitARM 19 and runs without problems.
<br/>
<br/>
why? what's happen? what is broken in devkit v20?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">slightly offtopic: i wouldn't call it broken, just incompatible. think of it as things that were hackish before are now working more as they should. i guess there will be an updated dsdoom that'll be compatible with the new librarys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you are right, I'm too weak to finding out this myself.
<br/>
<br/>
But another question, is it possible to install v19 and v20 in same time. I cannot find where this path to toolkit will be set in environment. 
<br/>
<br/>
So I help myself with renaming the whole path to devkitpro. But I never can use both version same time.
<br/>
<br/>
And why I can't  change my path in a batch file??! I can do within a batch file
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">cd /D/Proj/dsdoom/
<br/>
ls</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
and I get the files listet from this directory. But after executing this batch I will stay in my home directory. If I do same by entering this two lines it works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I have this startline and I have set the x flag for execute.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
