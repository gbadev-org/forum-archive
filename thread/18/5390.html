    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can do basic 3d but md2 viewers are beyond me. I know some people did viewers for the GBA using asm, (which I don't like). Is anyone working on an opengl style md2 viewer? With the possibility of open source? I think a nice easy to understand viewer would open the door to a lot of quite good 3d games being made...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Should be done this weekend, unless the horrible work crunch continues. I'm doing a converter rather than a pure viewer. Most of the source code already exists if you search for 'opengl md2 source' or the like.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">of course you would need to convert them, this is just because of the way MD2 files are stored. It is a lot easier (and probably faster) to convert them into an easy-to-use format first.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

Maybe wait until ecurtz has finished it?
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote several MD2/MD3/BSP renderers for PC in the past, but i don't have a DS and i am not into DS dev but i think a quake 3 map renderer would be nice too (there are loads of tutorials about quake 3 maps on the net)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

It's just pasted together from other people's existing code, including an openGL viewer and the Metroid model viewer code that someone here wrote (mike260 maybe?, sorry I didn't find the original post in my super quick search...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can throw this data directly at GX_FIFO and the hardware will route it to the right registers. The following should be in ndslib soon:

Haven't tried it with the metroid models yet but it works ok for display-lists I built myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
