Any one know a good one? All I can find are "free to try" ones in Google... they are to be later converted with Grit to binary for FAT loading...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Emmanuel on Mon Feb 23, 2009 2:34 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

The problem is I intend to use them in the midst of the game, and perhaps I'll need to stream wavs for music, so I don't want to stream any further, as I think that will affect framerate after adding that to multiplayer and the previously mentioned music streaming...
<br/>
For what I know, which isn't alot, using a bin file is better on performance than using a gif directly.
<br/>
There will be like 4 of those animations (one per player), so
<br/>
<br/>
gif streaming * 4 + wav streaming + dswifi + (512x512 | 1024x1024  scrolling Bgs) + physics + ...
<br/>
<br/>
and that equation doesn't look good...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that Game Maker can load an animated sprite and split it into a single .bmp file that you can save to a new file, but I'm not entirely sure if it will be in the format you need for GBA usage (each frame appears next to the previous one horizontally, not vertically), and I don't know if it works in versions beyond 5.3a (as that's the last version I ever used of the program).
<br/>
<br/>
As a worst-case scenario, you could load up the .gif animation in Microsoft GIF Animator, delete every frame you don't need and save it as a new file, reloading the original animation and doing the same for every frame, before combining them all into one image with the Paste From function of MS Paint.  Would be tedious and time-consuming, but would work.
<br/>
<br/>
Imagemagick might also be able to do something with it, but I have absolutely no clue about that.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  IrFanView can export each frame to an image in your choice of file format.  From that point you just need to combine the multiple frames into a single image.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
