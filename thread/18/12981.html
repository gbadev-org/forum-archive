    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I some problems with Devkitpro/PAlib
<br/>
<br/>
The first problem I had with Devkitpro was that I wasnd't able to install the newest version (1.4.2)[file not found (404) oh ffs] because the Loader ALWAYS refused to download the examples, so I needed to go back to the version 1.2.7
<br/>
<br/>
Next i installed Palib PAlib070323 and tried out some of the Examples, but they all ( INCLUDING HELLOWORLD !!!!) showed up like this:

<br/>
<br/>
What shall I do to get this working ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I tried it on all Drives of my PC  Drive D and Drive C, no success...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem is that you're including two different 'gbfs.h' files.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Basicly I just want to know how to install Devkitpro 1.4.2 on my PC, because it always says file not found when downloading.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is: on my old PC it worked flawlessly</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Firstly I'm not entirely sure how devkitPro Updater 1.2.7 helped you - that version still downloads files from sourceforge but in a manner that is no longer functional.
<br/>
<br/>
The latest installer/updater *will* work eventually - there appear to be some problems with SF mirrors for reasons I'm not yet clear on. I'm in the process of making some changes that may help. Currently if you run the installer again later it will download the file it claims it can't find. 
<br/>
<br/>
As Tepples has said, the basic problem is that you're including two different gbfs.h files but one of them has been renamed to PA_GBFS.h
<br/>
<br/>
This is an error with palib and should have been fixed. Are you sure you're using the most recent version?
<br/>
<br/>
You say that 1.4.2 worked flawlessly on your old PC.
<br/>
<br/>
What's different with your new PC?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got that a lot but then I went into the PAlib source and deleted any mention of GBFS. GBFS is an old filesystem that sucks big time on the DS because it doesn't support a lot of cards. It was no harm to me though because none of my cards support it.

I'm not sure that's sufficient difference to make the installer fail.
<br/>
<br/>
Does the laptop have a different OS from your old PC?
<br/>
<br/>
Are you now using a wifi connection instead of a wired one?
<br/>
<br/>
Does the installer still work on your old PC or can you no longer check?
<br/>
<br/>
If you do still have access to your old PC can you try uninstalling the devkitPro toolchains and reinstalling from scratch. Does that now exhibit the same symptom?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah ! I use a PCMCIA Card to connect to our Wireless Router.
<br/>
Sometimes Devkitpro even blabbers something like: Your connection dropped out, thought I still can reconnect until I get the Error.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: Why don't you bring out a Full installation Package we can use OFFLINE ? I hate it to need to be connected to the internet to be able to install Devkitpro...
<br/>
<br/>
This with the old PC is a thing... I would need to ask my younger brother since he owns it now ^^
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had the same problem, I realized that my laptop had not connected to my own connection but a neighbours. Once I had connected onto my connection the istalation ran flawlessly.
<br/>
<br/>
It leads me to think that it could be your internet connection causing the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I then had problems with running hello world. I deleted my install and installed it again using my own internet connection
<br/>
<br/>
It now works perfectly :)
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>_________________<br/>Jeanette
