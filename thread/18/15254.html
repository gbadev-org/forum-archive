    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok before xbox live came out there was xbconnect it let you play LAN games over the net. This should be possible on the ds fairly easily with it wireless  capibilities, setting up a proxy sever and some fudging. Has anything like this come up before.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't played many local Wifi games other than Mario Kart DS, but in that game interference-derived latency cause massive slowdowns and stuttering (as the game tries to synchronize the players) and if the latency goes too high the game disconnects.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this may be true for most local multiplayer games: they just assume low latency and don't deal with lag as online games need to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So yeah, not standing next to the person.  I still don't fully see the need to get WiFi LAN working, but good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
