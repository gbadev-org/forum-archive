    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
I am Hermes, a spanish guy that has worked in PS2 and GP2X scenes.
<br/>
<br/>
Now i am working  in NDS scene and i have released a sound library (eSound library) and  i have finished other library to multithread uses and this package have the two library's combined.
<br/>
<br/>
Features:
<br/>
<br/>
In Multithread library:
<br/>
<br/>
- Complete documentation in English and Spanish
<br/>
<br/>
- 32 threads and 256 semaphores to use in ARM7 and ARM9 processors
<br/>
<br/>
- Possibility of executing functions from the section code of ARM9 in the ARM7 processor
<br/>
<br/>
- You can register 7 Remote Procedure Call serves for each processors (server 0 is reserved to the system, so you can use from 1 to 7)
<br/>
<br/>
- Added some systems functions to assign memory from the ARM9 heap in the ARM7 side (ARM9_malloc(), etc) and others utils functions (for example, message log from the ARM7)
<br/>
<br/>
In eSound library:
<br/>
<br/>
- Complete documentation in English and Spanish 
<br/>
<br/>
- You can play 16 PCM channels easily 
<br/>
<br/>
- You can record a sound from the microphone easily and use this capture for some thing in your game
<br/>
<br/>
- It have a Mod Player integrated. It is in the ARM9 section code but is executed by the ARM7 using a thread for it. So you have more space of the exclusive memory to be used in the ARM7 side
<br/>
<br/>
It have some basic code examples for multithread uses and some complex examples as the game 'Asteroids and Gems' 
<br/>
<br/>
'Asteroids and Gems' is a little game that use the touch screen to move one ship and the microphone to activate a capture field. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, i hope you understand my 'hard' expression in English (sorry) and that you find utility for these library's

I've found very few people in this scene speak Spanish (in contrast to about the half that speak German). Or maybe I'm missing a huge part of it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't looked much into it yet, but this seems very very useful! Great that you put so much time into a proper documentation, and that even in multiple languages. Especially the feature of executing code from main memory on the arm7 sounds very interesting!

I have done that, as well as trying to boot them from MoonShell and DSOrganize. I also ran them though the SuperCard homebrew patcher, which didn't do anything either.
<br/>
<br/>
They always do the same thing. "Asteroids and Gems" boots to black screens, while the examples boot to blue ones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Humm, It is strange.
<br/>
<br/>
In theory if you copies directly the files in your CF it must work. I suspect that it could be a problem on the loader.
<br/>
<br/>
It work without problems in my DS Lite with M3 SD and on the Dualis emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most newer .nds files will work this way, given that newer versions of ndstool put a miniloader at the start of the .nds file.

Rename all ds.gba to .nds and they'll work on SuperCard.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
