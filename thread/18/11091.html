    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just saw videos for the new PSP game "loco roco" and it looks like it would be fun to make a smaller/simpler version for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What would I need to know in order to get started making something like that. I mean, what type of collision detection do you think a game like that uses? And then there's the physics involved.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? Do you think it would be something fun to play on the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I LOVE LocoRoco for the PSP. A DS LocoRoco game for the DS would kick ass. Basiically, it's only a background with solid objects that can rotate on a point to a 30 deegree angle in either direction. All it uses is 3 buttons to play (and one to pause). Very simple graphics, (but very artistic and pleasing, if the art and music of LocoRoco was lacking in the DS Port, the most pleasing parts of the game would be gone) and a simple concept as well. I'm sure the first version wouldn't be perfect, just a blob on a field with rocks and stuff. I honestly think it should be made by someone who's at least played the game to get the full effect however.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was always interested in how Loco Roco played after seeing the game in shops, that video looked excellent. It'd be great to see someone pick up that source and make a spangly ds version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
