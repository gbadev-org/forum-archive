Can it play Level music? Level music is what's usually on 3D games these days, I see most NDS games are RPG music, which is 2D music, like teh Nintendo classical stuff, but they still play it on 3D games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ps: e.g. what do you mean by levelmusic (i can *imagine* what, but knowing is better than thinking)? RPG music??? *2D* music??? since when is music 2D? etc. NOTE: take it easy, i'm not being b1tchy on you. :^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is?? By who? (no sarcasm, actually wondering)
<br/>
<br/>
So you mean can the Nintendo DS play music files like mp3s, ogg e.t.c? Then no, it can't play it fast enough for implementation in a game. I'm not even sure it can play MIDI music, I know It can play MOD music.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
But I think we all know what you mean.
<br/>
<br/>
What you're calling "level music" is actually just regular PCM audio like WAV or CDDA or sometimes a compressed format similar to MP3 (even actually MP3 in some cases).  And yes, the DS can play raw WAV audio.  The problem is that using WAV audio tracks takes up a ton of space, which is is also why it didn't become popular in video games until CD-based systems came around.  But check out Everlasting Love/Tomorrow Hill, though for a game that uses WAV audio.  There's plenty of others too.
<br/>
<br/>
What you're calling "2D music" is either programmed chiptunes or tracker files like MOD or possibly MIDI.  I don't think any DS homebrew uses the PSG for music, but a lot of them do use MOD format music which are preferable because they're so much smaller than RAW music files.  I think there's other advantages to using tracker formats, they're just easier to work with overall.  They also often have a very nice sound, though obviously you could have a WAV track that sounded identical.  Another reason tracker files are commonly used is that there's a huge pool of already created music files on the Internet, most of which can be freely used in free software like homebrew on the DS.

i don't agree with this.
<br/>
<br/>
i never came across these terms... and i'm a programmer/musician/semi-artist... but who cares.
<br/>
<br/>
ok, what you may mean is that:
<br/>
- "2D" / "RPG" music is nothing but midi / noise / mod / frequency generated music. it's synthesized.
<br/>
- "3D" / "level" music shall be digital or pcm music - basicly wave files. or mp3's or anything like that.
<br/>
<br/>
any game developer should know *this*.
<br/>
<br/>
well, the good news is, you canhave both. the bad news is, mp3 is a bit tough to get working, but simonjhall (as well as possibly others) did it for quake. so it is possible.
<br/>
<br/>
you have quite a few digital mono channels that can play back anything you can record. it just needs to be in a format the hardware can interpret it.
<br/>
<br/>
then you can use some of those channels for sound generation (beep and buzz). to be able to use midi/mod sounds, you need a soundbank (afaik), because the hw itself doesn't have one build in. i read nintendo gives one away with their devkits. there are some sound generating homebrew programs on the net, so check them out.
<br/>
<br/>
finally: again, your terminology is very uncommon to me, really. it's very much gamer-/aritst-like. more descriptive than technical. this is no offence! i just want to help with communication, that's all. :^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yea, I'll take that back, a lot of commercial developers I know, use those terms. So I made a bad assumption.
<br/>
<br/>
OK, thanks, since I am new to NDS game development and OpenGL I'll have a lot of questions as I go. I am more fluent with DirectX9 and computer games, 2D is more along my lines, but since I want to make an FPS, I'll need to learn 3D. The Tutorial links don't help much, I am hoping to get into a project as a C++ programmer, not sure how much help I can be since I am still learning OpenGL and DS game development. I just want to be able to get the feel. I hope to see an Open source game, so I can analyize and learn by looking at the code.
<br/>
<br/>
Also yes, I am 15 years old. I want to do all of this now, because once I am out of high school, I want to go to DigiPen for my bachlor's in computer science then hopfully be able to make my own little buisness in game development, or I can apply to Blizzard Entertainment before I go that far with it or some other game company. Not sure yet, but I do hope I can get into DigiPen, I put my school work before almost anything except for my girl.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get much help here in this community and hopfully to find an open source DS game(3D would help me more) so I can learn more.

you're kidding me. ;^) i thought you were at least 15. ;^p
<br/>
<br/>
maybe it could help you to check out my shadow volume demo. there's everything you need to get started with coding. though it's hard to understand someone else's code, i admit that. anyway, at least you can modify, run, then modify again and some day you'll know enough to start things from zero.
<br/>
<br/>
click the www button under my posts and download the demo sources. beware: it still doesn't support slot1 devices, but runs (with some grapics bugs, i doesn't have on hw) in some emulators (like no$gba and ... some others i can't think of right know). slot1 support will be added "when it's done". (TM) ;^p

Uuhh... I really home you mean something like 15 years old... I dunno if I could stand the knowledge of another genious child prodigy, one thats got a girlfriend at that...

DigiPen requires impressive grades, and you have to be good at math, or at least be able to learn and remember what was taught to you in math. Also, do you live in the Seattle area? DigiPen offers summer courses for middle school/high school students for C++ and stuff. But on their website it lists alternate campuses for other places in USA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you want to make a first-person shooter, don't look at my code though. I followed Carmack's style by making it a complete mess (aka Extern Global City)
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, regular wav files work like a charm assuming you know how to parse them (I had *zero* sound experience before Quake) and mp3 wasn't too hard either. Having the sound hardware attached to the ARM7 makes it a little more fun, but there are libnds functions on the ARM9 to make it easier for you.
<br/>
In fact using wave-based sound is probably easier than tone-generated sounds and midi-like stuff as you literally just point the sound chip at your data and tell it to play!
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno if it's obvious but the size of sound files can be an issue. If they're too big you'll have to stream them and then you'll have to deal with clicking, ring buffers, and (dur) streaming. And in case you're interested, the sound hardware can't play from slot-2 RAM.

For any creative work, I personally believe in pure copyleft with absolutely no limitations, which is also what a lot of tracker musicians seem to believe in, too.  Especially the older ones.  Most who made any statement at all just asked for a credit if their music or samples are used in other creative works.

At least I can understand how he came up with those terms.  Redbook audio started being commonly used around the same time as polygons (if you, uh, ignore the Turbo CD, Sega CD and probably a lot of PC games), so I can see how the two could be associated.

<br/>
I'm really totally baffled and amazed by the "level music" versus "RPG music" thing, though.

I did it in Quake by attenuating the sound based on the distance and then figuring out the 'position' of the sound using the view of the position of the player vs the position of the sound. Slap this all on the hardware and adjust the panning and volume based on these calculations, and you've got 3D sound!

ADPCM is 4bits per sample, compared to 16bits per sample for normal ADPCM. This means it gives a 1:4 compression at the loss of some quality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

sounds in front of us "sound different" than behind us. like tepples said, it's "in" the frequencies. the same thing applies to sounds behind obstacles - things sound dampened - and to vertical positioning. that's why i wrote "add a bit of rather simple dsp and there you go." in my previous post - it's about filtering frequencies (in this case - dsp in general coveres quite a wide field of applications, not only audio processing).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you guys ever do the deer ears thing?  Cup your hands behind your ears so that they effectively extend the size of your ears.  It improves your hearing dramatically, though inly in the direction you're facing.  They taught it to us at the summer camp I used to go to.  We'd go on hikes and it was so much fun to stand near the top of a mountain with your deer ears and just listen to what you could hear.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's kind of like when an old man goes, "Ehh?!" and leans toward you with a hand behind one of his ears.  Actually, I don't know if old men actually do that.  I think I've only seen it in cartoons.
