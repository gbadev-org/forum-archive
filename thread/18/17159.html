I'm trying to compile DSOrganize. I have downloaded all libraries including Cyassl.
<br/>
But I have found that there isn't source code for libsound.a.
<br/>
I have the right to get Corresponding Source Code.
<br/>
<br/>
As DSOrganize has a "Last cluster corruption bug", I should fix it... So please anyone?
<br/>

As for your right to corresponding source code, good luck with that.

I don't mind - it is confirmed to be able to be built with r19 with small modification.
<br/>
(Actually I needed many modifications to compile MoonShell 1.71 (aka Simply))
<br/>
<br/>
Then could you tell me how I can build libsound?
<br/>
I searched Internet but could not find such a library.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I mind though, you should be modifying the project to build with the latest tools, not modifying old tools. We're up to r28 on devkitARM now, r19 was released close to 4 years ago.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as far as I know the source to libsound is unavailable so hopefully it's moot.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

He also agrees dragonminded breaks the GPL rule - are you there?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Errr, the GPL is a distribution license, so it applies to distributors, not to authors of the software (who obviously have all the rights without needing a license). Or am I missing something and you're talking about some third party code DragonMinded used?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a whole bunch of GPL source code in the DSO source tree which makes all of it GPL. Not that it matters, DragonMinded got sick to death of it and released a bunch of source minus all the contact links saying "don't email me, don't pester me on any irc channels I happen to be in, don't pm me.". The time to go chasing for missing source was 2.5 years ago when he did that, I wouldn't imagine he still has the stuff that Xenon is looking for.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
