    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all: HI!
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible to gain (selectable via zoom feature similar to gameboy player for cube) fullscreen support for GBA games via an firmware update?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just asking this out of curiousity cause it's beyond me why Nintendo didn't include that feature from the beginning.<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

mmhh....it wouldn't be too bad I guess.

Look at the gameboyplayer for cube.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the problem is that you only have a few additional pixel to work with. That would make it hard to interpolate between the pixels. 
<br/>
On the GB Player you can easily double the screensize which makes interpolation easier. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's the same with a TFT on a PC. They are made for a specific resolution so if you choose any other resolution you get a blury image.

<br/>
I've done some tests, and once you switch into GBA mode, you lose all control over the DS hardware. The most i've been able to do, is get 4 pixels to be colored on the sides of the screen, but everything else I do is reset.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, On the GB Player, it doesn't use the whole screen, presumably so that they can just use a simple ratio rather than proper convertion..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any stretching wouldn't really benefit from increasing the screen size unless you were able to do some post-processing(i.e. bilinear filtering) to make it look better. 
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the ratio is close enough so that it stretching the screen would have any additional benefit.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i agree, the black border is pants, but i know why they did it...
<br/>
<br/>
if you scale from small to big, quiality isnt majorly lost...
<br/>
ie, 320x240 -&gt;640x480 - perfect, 1 normal pixel=2 scaled pixels
<br/>
but 320x240 - &gt;512x384 isnt perfect, because u would need half pixels.
<br/>
<br/>
if you go from gba-&gt;DS res, we are talking like 
<br/>
 240 x 160 pixels 
<br/>
 256 x 192 Pixels
<br/>
<br/>
1.0666x1.2 ratio... last time i checked, 1.2 pixels didnt exist ;)
<br/>
<br/>
plus basjing that into the internal system to play gba games aint gonna happen. the only way to d oit would be an emulator, so ud get even more overhead and probably end up with slower games with uglier looking screens. in this case, i can live with the border.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
