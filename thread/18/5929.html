    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to put the things right, I'm not the main author of this project... Gally is, maybe he'll come around. I'm just helping him out a little. And this allows me to add new stuff to the lib (keyboard support for example, and this week-end the new mini-font will be integrated too... maybe some button/slider support too....)
<br/>
<br/>
The latest version isn't released yet, and has the small text for the notepad (there'll probably be an option to chose between normal or thin text), save support, auto-login... And much more to come ! I'll be working on integrating a Jpeg support using a lib... For that, if you know of a command line program that could re-dimension a Jpeg to fit the DS screen, I would love it. Another idea I had, kinda same thing : manga viewer :p displaying on both screens to have a full page, if the resolution is good enough (I'll have to test that, not sure...)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also hoping Darkain will release some info to integrate his multiloader, it is a must-have function ! I'll have to see with him for that...
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, feel free to give suggestions/ideas :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This looks real great. 
<br/>
A multi-loader would be great for such a project, but another thing that would be great is a sdk or something like that, so we can easily make programs to run inside this one, with the same look and feel.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For the sdk, I could try something, but as I don't know anything about sdks... do you have any suggestions as to where to start ? And how the programs be added ? By recompiling only or using a filesystem ? (if using the filesystem, not sure how to get a program to use the sdk...). 
<br/>
<br/>
As of now, it is actually very easy to add a program in it : there's a define containing the number of programs and an array with a function pointer towards these programs. The dockbar automatically adjusts to the number of programs, and you just need to add the icon to the other icons (it's just a bmp) to have it added... Each program is structure juste like a normal program, with the beginning, the main loop, and an end (the main loop being with while(!MoveMenu()) to test the dock, and a ndos_WaitForVBL...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What you are saying is pretty easy and I think it is good enough as long as we can add standard controls to our proggies (textboxes, ...) and have access to the virtual keyboard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a problem with the soft keyboard, it didnt show all of the keys but you could still press in the area and it would type, also  when typing alot of text in notepad and the calc it starts to overlap the text again.
<br/>
<br/>
one other thing. Whats up with the calc when typing more than 7 digits?
<br/>
<br/>
example: if I type 9999999 after the next 9 it swithes to somthing like 214567231 &lt;------ not exactly this but close to it....

<br/>
Edit : forgot part of it :p   For the text, it's still basic and I think the downloadable version is a few versions behind the one I have... The keyboard bug might be fixed (not sure, but I don't have it anymore), and the overlapping text changed too... The next version will also have the tiny font, which will be much better for the text...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
