    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, I was wondering about this. As far as I know, according to the specs the NDS can only detect one input point on the touchscreen. 
<br/>
<br/>
      But there was a game, in particular Hotel Dusk 215, that required you use two fingers to pull down two levers at the same time. I couldn't solve this puzzle cause I thought that it wasn't possible for multipoint touchscreen input for NDS. I just thought I was missing something and I finally gave up and checked a guide about the game and I saw that you can use two fingers for input.
<br/>
<br/>
      So then, anybody know how this was accomplished? This question is more out of curiosity really. Heh.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Typically, if you touch two points at the same time, the input is read as coming from the average of those two points.
<br/>
<br/>
eg: the game was looking for input in between the two levers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The resulting pressure point will be on the line connecting the 2 pressure points, the position on the line depending on how much pressure you do on the points. If you're pressing both with the same strength the you can assume the resulting value it's in between :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah I see! Thanks! I should probably try that when I play hotel dusk again. I'll try to slide my stylus across the middle of the two levers see if it works!
<br/>
<br/>
 Again thank you!<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
