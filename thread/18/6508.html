The DS Download Play doesn't use WiFI, and since people can already send demos to DS's from their computers, I'm sure there's a way to do it from DS w/demos+loader -&gt; Other DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyone who is knowledgable to run flashme in the first place is not going to randomly download available broadcasted demos for their DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the chances of you being in range of someone else who is broadcasting mal-ware (or anything for that matter) is really slim to none. In fact, we all have a better chance of seeing Microsoft buy out Nintendo AND Sony before that happens.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about the E3 demos? Couldn't you send those without reverse-engineering the stub? Those are obviously signed.
<br/>
<br/>
Reason why I'm asking this is because (for example) in the Meteos demo, you can play VS, but you can't actually send it to another DS through Download Play. So, if you can send the Meteos demo to the other person by using the other DS's own download play (in the loader), you can then play together. Obviously this is for people without WifiMe. All I have are Passme and a GBA flash cart. :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could load the meteos demo using your passme and flash card and once it's load remove the cart and passme and have your friend load it up and go from there?  Don't know if that's possible or useful or anything.  Just a shot in the dark.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">close the DS first, so it sleeps, then remove the passme and cart and load it onto your friend's.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: No wait, you're right, if you remove the Passme the DS will turn off. If you have FlashMe, then this method will work.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by IxthusTiger on Sun Sep 11, 2005 2:52 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
