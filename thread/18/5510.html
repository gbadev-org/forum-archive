Since making osx binaries available there have been a number of mac users having trouble with the shell oriented nature of a raw toolchain.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd also be extremely grateful if such an environment supported devkitPPC and the primary platforms supported by devkitARM (gp32, gba, nds)
<br/>
<br/>
You could have picked a better poll question, such as "Would you like to see an Xcode template for NDS devleopment?". It's fairly obvious that non-users of osx predominate on these forums.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yah you are very much correct about that. But you can still setup a dev env and anyone with basic knowledge of making templates could set it up. (I have never made a template)
<br/>
But it's just as easy to use terminal and type make you know.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I spend a lot more time helping people set up their tools than actually getting stuff compiled once everything is installed and set up. Do people really want an XCode templates, or do you just want it to be simpler to build things "out of the box."
<br/>
<br/>
I've tended to use my "support" time trying to write or port the tools needed to keep up with the PC guys in terms of building new stuff (i.e. ROM burning, the tools showing up in ndsLib demos, etc.) However if enough people really want XCode support in devkitARM I could probably make some templates for the tools I can test, which would be GBA, DS, and maybe GC (I have the hardware, but haven't tried building anything.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think the poll might not reflect the # of users on mac (because PC'ers are voting), i think only 1 in 30 still uses OS 9,and if so ,I doubt they dev for gba or DS.
<br/>
<br/>
This brings up another question: using the gbasdk,what other libs can we use instead of sgade?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
