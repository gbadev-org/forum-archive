    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is this a known mistake? 
<br/>
this line is taken from the wifi_example1 makefile and causes an error when trying to compile, it apears in both arm7 and arm9 makefiles
<br/>
LIBS	:= -lnds9 -ldswifi9r
<br/>
<br/>
this line compiles without the "r" on the end
<br/>
LIBS	:= -lnds9 -ldswifi9
<br/>
<br/>
and after messing with the curtime bussiness it finnally compiles.
<br/>
<br/>
now i know im going to get slated for this but i've asked a couple of times for a wifi tutorial on this forum but no-one seems to be bothered, i know it's a problem for alot of noobs like myself, i also know that some people have put alot of time and effort into applications for the DS and dont want some noob just ripping off their work, so please setup a clear step be step tutorial and give these people the chance to create their own work, it's ok looking at examples but unless they are commented in plain english every step of the way they are useless to a begginer</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">since wifi uses both the processors it is a little more complex then the basic demos. Add the fact the that mechanism used to communicate between the two processors is slated to be changed and you can probably see why people do not want to waste time making examples for something that is going to be obsolete and/or broken in the near future.
<br/>
<br/>
also, if you can not figure out how to set it up from the existing examples then you probably are going to have a lot of problems using it once it is set up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">since i figured out the problem with the makefile i seem to be making progress, i agree with you on the point of outdated code and libs, i've writen direct IP chat clients in visual basic although not for a while so my sockets are dusty, it's great of people to submit their code for people to see and learn from but as with spoken language there are different dialects and accents in english, same goes for c++.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just as a followup to my own post, it's been bugging me for sometime as to why i could never connect to my DS and here is the answer
<br/>
<br/>
open a dos prompt and type
<br/>
arp -s 192.168.1.10 00-09-bf-dd-a2-85
<br/>
<br/>
obviously your IP &amp; MAC will be different, this worked for me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
