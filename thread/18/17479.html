    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to take up on improving FrodoDS, especially the speed by using pure assembler code in some places.
<br/>
<br/>
But I have problems getting the standard FrodoDS sourcecode to compile!
<br/>
The newer libnds libs behave different that leave me wondering how to overcome those to get it compile correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone give me a libnds version that frodods compiles correctly with?
<br/>
Or other way around does someone have a frodods sourcecode that is modified to compile with recent libnds versions.
<br/>
<br/>
Because all older libnds versions aren't available anymore on sourceforge.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
That will allow some libnds programs to compile in the most recent devkit but it's only meant as a temporary solution. Once you get it compiling, remove that include and replace each old function with the new name: 
<br/>
<br/>
On Windows, it installs to: c:\devkitpro\libnds\include\nds\registers_alt.h
<br/>
<br/>
You should also update the ARM7 code to the latest from one of the libnds examples templates.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where to get the latest FrodoDS code. It was updated by many coders but none of them used google code or github, dcemu seems to have lost all their attachments in an upgrade and the working megaupload/rapidshare links that I found are just the binary.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Haven't tested it yet.
<br/>
Wonder why I didn't figure it out myself.
<br/>
<br/>
But then I would still appreciate, if someone posts a link to a modified sourcecode, like that with smoother screen scaling (don't know whom modification it was)..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I saw of the FrodoDS code you'd probably be better off starting again from scratch. It looks like upstream Frodo has been updated quite a bit since the last FrodoDS release.
<br/>
<br/>
See <a href="http://frodo.cebix.net/" target="_blank">http://frodo.cebix.net/</a> for upstream sources.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'd really, really, really like to see is someone look at doing these ports to the DS using the autotools framework so they can be merged up.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
