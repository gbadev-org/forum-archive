Actually, by using a marvellous invention called a 'calculator', we can estimate how long it might take. If you assume 1bn keys/sec (which is ridiculously generous), you'd need 9.5 million years of CPU time to search the entire keyspace. By way of comparison, seti@home has so far accumulated a mere 2.2m CPU years over a period of 5 years.
<br/>
<br/>
What I meant was to try and get more coders working on cracking it analytically and/or looking for more refined attacks that just brute-forcing the entire keyspace.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This may be true for elementary math operations, but for general (potentialy very complex) operations, like encoding for instance...
<br/>
<br/>
Besides we don't know the function yet, some guess its kind of LSFR (left shift feedback register), most of us (df is exception) don't know the result (LFSR stream), and I'm not sure wether anybody knows the input (value of RTC used for initial seeding).

Isn't it "LSFR", which comes from "left shift feed back register", as general encoding approach - a typical striming chiper (in constrast to block chypers like DES or RSA). In each specific encoding scheme there could be any number of LSFRs, syncronised in different ways, with any number of feedbacks (called also tapings). Also initial seeding of those can be made in many different ways, no mater where the seeding data comes from.
<br/>

I wonder if people could just say what kind of processor they have. I have a P4 2.4Ghz processor and am only at 12 blocks in 1 hour and 37 minutes. My friend started with a AMD64 3400+ stock 2.4Ghz OC'ed to 2.52Ghz started around the same time i did and already he has done 16 blocks!!!
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is though that we were once able to refresh the page and see how many blocks we would do in a page. I was going to get 252 in a day, and he would get around 360. That makes me wonder if people are get 580+ blocks per day, they must be running on Opterons/Xeons/AMD FX series or madly overclocked P4's to get up that high...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And I think that you, darkfarder, should hide the ip addresses a bit more by covering up the last number of each section such as:
<br/>

16?.17?.9?.23?

As for the legality of the whole thing, I'm pretty certain that Nintendo etc have eyes on these forums and many other sites (I think SimonB once said something to that effect after reading logs of IP's that visit and tracing them) but I wouldn't worry about them stomping on us for this. It's not bieng done to pirate anything, and I haven't ever heard of homebrewers getting crapped on by big video game companies.

<br/>
Sega v. Accolade, decided by the Ninth Circuit in 1992, makes clear that, in certain instances, the unauthorized disassembly of a computer program's object code in order to derive source code is not a copyright infringement. The Ninth Circuit applied the 'fair use' balancing test to determine that Accolade's use of reverse engineering techniques to produce an 'intermediate copy' of Sega's source code did not constitute copyright infringement. Accolade never distributed the intermediate copy commercially, but instead used it only to extract unprotectable ideas ? a sequence of bytes which act as a software key ? from Sega's game program. This key was then incorporated into Accolade's games, enabling them to 'unlock' and run on Sega's game platforms. The court cautioned, however, that disassembly involves the making of a literal copy of a program, and it is permissible only when necessary to extract the unprotectable ideas. It is unclear how far this fair use right extends.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I would assume the server has some type of "time out" setup.  So if a client closes befor finishing a block; after the time out,  the server would just assign it to another client.

Apache is very good, but the cofiguration requires you to be able to construct an entire sentence. The best advice I can give you is eat some ritalin then go ride a bike for a while.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

"Hi, I have a very fast AMD Athlon 64,t Microsoft Windows XP and can't get that thing (HackDS) to work. Do you know of a good webserver for windows?

<br/>
First: Read the previous posts, it won't connect anymore, you're too late
<br/>
<br/>
Second: AppServ. Good server, AppServ.

(Random sentence to increase size of post for no apparent reason whatsoever: Did I mention that once I took Ritalin (Aspergers syndrome) and tried to kill myself? Moral: Nothing works on everyone.)

<br/>
<br/>
Will future tests be larger? Do I need to download something different for each test? Does "Invalid input" mean the test is complete or is it some other error? I don't even know which thing to run, so i'm guessing it's loop.cmd.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The test is over, wget sends 'not needed any more' data to hackds, and hackds doesn't recognise it. Therefore: Invalid Input".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i see im very too late but, im working on a large company at the deployment server to distribute software packages. We use the altiris deployment console. I manage 2200 computers. All computers are p4 2,6ghz.
<br/>
So i can start a script or program on all computers. To help with decrypting.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this can speed up very quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
I have not much experience with decrypting, i only decrypted a lot of .sam files. I read alot about windows hacking, i dont know if this is the same.
<br/>
<br/>
But if i can help or anybody has a good seti like program to decrypt the nds? Just say it..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You'd probably have to ask him directly about encryption status.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
