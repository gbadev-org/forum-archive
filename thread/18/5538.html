Hey pal, I *am* a programmer. The actual reason I'm putting this poll up here is because I'm in the middle of writing a PSX emulator from scratch for the DS, and would like to poll the popularity of other platforms as well. I placed a wink emoticon in my last sentence to imply this.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I recently did some work for a popular N64 emulator on the XBOX.

I had the C64 in the list initially, and now regret having pulled it out.

I presume the authors of many emulators for the GBA will port their code to the DS though, as the porting threshold isn't that high.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

(first person to yell at me about me calling it "ultra 64" and not "nintendo 64" needs to do research into arcade boards)

as for the poll tho, i think its lame.  :)  we currently still have the limitation of code being copied to RAM, giving us a maximum size of 4MB total to work with.  how much emulation you plan to fit into this tiny space anyways ???<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
The emulator hasn't being officially anounced yet, as it is still possible that I will shift priorities to another platform (presumably SNES). However, I have completed an entire emulation engine, which is non-target specific, and am now about to start adding MIPSR3000 opcodes and their C and machine code counterparts to the system, which will take most of the time. Atfer that, adding co-processor functionality (the GPU first) would be the next logical step.
<br/>
I have some experience with the MIPS architecture, and the PSX hardware itself as well, so writing a PSX emulator should not be out of my league.
<br/>
<br/>
I've planned an ingenius system to conquer the limitations of iso storage, yet I don't want to give too much information away as I'm quite proud of it ;) Though at first, I presume only homebrew demos would run anyways.

<br/>
<br/>
The saturn has two CPUs, which the DS has as well, so it might be theorethically possible. However, those CPUs are relatively fast, and the saturn itself is not that extravagantly well documented.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm doubting the relevance of an N-Gage emulator, as the games released for it are quite suck, though I believe it would be possible to emulate it.
<br/>
<br/>
The PSX on the other hand lends itself well for emulation on the DS. There's nothing that currently says that it can't be pulled off due to memory or speed issues.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But if you're trying to meet the community's demand for new emulators, which is what Mike seems to be doing, it makes more sense to work on something that doesn't already have a decent implementation available.

Back when Nintendo was developing the Play Station with Sony, then canceled development, Sony went to create the PlayStation, and sold (I believe) 200 units.  This was during the time SNES first debuted.  A few years later (1995) Sony redesigned and upgraded the PlayStation, and called it PlayStationX.  The X was never really marketed, and thus everyone simply called it PlayStation, but the abbriviation continued, PSX.  This is probably off topic for such a forum, but it might help those understand the difference between the two PSX machines.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

oh, and Sony is really disappointed with how the PSX has performed (the PS2/DVD Recorder hybrid). no mp3 support (apparently cos one of their one copyright laws forbids it) and only 4x write, as well as poor sales</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The Spectrum might work, as its display is the same size in pixels as that of the Nintendo DS's top screen (256x192), but a lot of 8-bit micros had screens wider than that (Apple II 280x192, C=64 320x200, PC 320x200), which might not scale that well to the DS top screen without some sort of software downscaling.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I think the Arm 9(especially with its sound and graphics hardware) alone is probably fast enough to fully emulate the SNES, only maybe the FX chip games would be trouble.

Still need scaled mode for most games, but I was always annoyed that I couldn't change the vertical offset in SNES Advance without rebuilding the whole ROM.

<br/>
Even better, if you put the game on both screens and drag it anywhere between them, you could get it nicely positioned to where a HUD is on one screen and the main game on the other (super mario world comes to mind).
<br/>
Of course, having it on both screens at once means updating 2 sets of VRAM with the same thing, which may slow it down too much.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

If the DS wireless internet world opens up

If there is a fullspeed SNES emu
<br/>
<br/>
It should in theory be possible to get wireless mutliplayer working similar to the way snes9x works on the PC.

Your sat on your sofa with a beer. You load up the SNES emu and a client connects through your wireless net connection bottom screen lets you select a game and wait for another player.

But even for smaller games, CPS-1 and Neo-Geo are as difficult as Mega Drive aka Sega Genesis. Neo-Geo has a 320x224 pixel screen, same as the Genesis, and CPS-1 has a 384x224 screen, which is even wider. Let's see the DS emulate the Genesis as a proof of concept, and then ask for CPS-1 and Neo-Geo support.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

IIRC, the Space Invaders emulator uses the screen divide. Controls won't be that bad either. Just rotate the arrows and have one hand on top and on on the bottom. Try it.
