    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo DS usually uses C or C++, or any language in which you can write an interpreter in C or C++.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are new to game programming, please learn basic C, basic 2D graphics on the PC, and basic 2D graphics on the Game Boy Advance before you try DS development.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are looking to learn how to program then, as tepples said, do not start out on the DS. If things do not work as you expected (which they will) then you will be left staring at a DS wondering why (although the DS does now have a debugger).
<br/>
Start out on your PC (using C or C++) where you can get nice free friendly programming environments and write interesting things. When you are happy  with your programming skills then venture onto the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
