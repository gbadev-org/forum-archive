    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, as the title suggests, some folks over in japan have figured out how to extract save data from their DS games in hopes to transfer songs created in Band Brothers over the internet. They've built their own software to extract each song as well as put new songs back onto the game.
<br/>
<br/>
I've known about this for a little while, so it may be old. I've just been too lazy to sign up.

Eeh, no, they are not very big.

Extracting saves is not very hard. They are stored in a standard serial EEPROM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Datel announced their first product for the Nintendo DS. The Action Replay Duo goes into the GBA slot of your GBA or your Nintendo DS and comes with a USB link and a Windows Software. The product is supposed to be out in a couple of weeks.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is some info from Datel about the device including screenshots:
<br/>
<br/>
This cool device slots into your GBA or the GBA slot of your DS and enables you to access cheats and manage game saves. It comes with a PC application which you can use to download cheats and saves from the CodeJunkies server to be transferred to your DS or GBA. Isn't it annoying how GBA carts usually only have room for one game save? Well, with Action Replay Duo you can back up your GBA and DS saves to the Action Replay vault itself, or on your PC. Great if you share your GBA or DS with your friends.
<br/>
<br/>
We'll have more detailed info on Action Replay Duo when it's released (within a couple of weeks), but in the meantime, why not feast your eyes on a selection of screenshots from the PC Application and the devices on screen display (click on the screenshots for a larger view).</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Uhh.. I don't see how a passthrough fits into this at all.  Not that I could read the original page post, but from the pictures, it's a USB interface to dump/write save game data from a cart.  A passthrough it to run DS code from a GBA cart.  Totally different devices.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing it works like my linker.  I can insert a GBA game and save the "save game" data to a file on my computer.  I could then e-mail that file to you, and if you have a linker, save the "save game" data to your GBA cart and be at the same point I am in the game.  As BOB saves your songs as save game data, it's the same concept.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You are so <span style="font-style: italic">completely</span> thinking backwards. If a device like this can modify savegames, it would be useful for turning a buggy game <span style="font-style: italic">into</span> a passthrough. See <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fuzzymuzzle.com/Xbox/Linux/mechinstaller.htm" target="_blank">any of the various descriptions of MechInstaller</a> for the theory behind savegame buffer overflows on another platform.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

A passthorugh allows you to run software on the DS in DS mode. That software has full access to both the DS card and the GBA card. It is easy to read the EEPROM in the DS card and store that information on the GBA card, from with you can transfer it to the PC using your normal linker.
<br/>
It oviously works the other way asound as well.
<br/>
Or you could simply use the GBA card as a "savegame bank" for bulk storage of DS saves, without ever having to transfer them to or from the PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Without knowing the exact size of DS card EEPROMs, I'd say about 64-256.
<br/>
Probably more if you use compression.
<br/>
<br/>
But you are not really limited to the SRAM, there is little keeping you from using the main flash memory as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Other than that we don't know the specific register access sequences required to write to some brands of GBA flash card, and it in fact seems to be impossible to write to EFA cards (including those paid for before the Nintendo DS was first sold) through the GBA cart bus.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than the discontinued Visoly and F2A Classic cards, which GBA flash cards are known to be writable by free software?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, there is that. But we have full access to Visoly/F2A/XROM at least (probably more).
