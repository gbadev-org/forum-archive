    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there..
<br/>
<br/>
I am making an nds homebrew game..
<br/>
and i was thinking on dividing the game in more than one nds files(to alow some things that i have in mind)
<br/>
<br/>
i have very few skills in coding..i?m using some help..
<br/>
<br/>
i was looking for some king of line code that alows me to when something happens it will load a certain nds file, errasing the previous stuff from the RAM memory..
<br/>
<br/>
i hope you understand what i?m looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
if someone can tell me how, or show me an example i would apreciate.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance, and sorry fo the trouble</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The real question is why do you want to do that?  You can easily dynamically load assets from an nds card, which is generally what you'd often want to do.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well..
<br/>
i?m not to good in hombrew and coding..
<br/>
and someone told me that to make a big game(more than 4 mb - the ram size) i had to use so kind of hard coding to work with the ram data..
<br/>
and i think i can?t do that..
<br/>
and since i?m using a tool called DS game make to learn homebrew i must do more than 1 ds file..so that i could load each one..
<br/>
<br/>
any help or good ways (better ways) to learn?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks fo the replies :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I don't know anything about the DS game maker, but if you are skilled as a programmer, most of us would recommend not using the game maker, and instead, programming directly using the devkitPro toolchain.
<br/>
<br/>
When you do so, it's pretty easy to have all (or most) of your code loaded at the beginning, and then dynamically load assets (graphics, sound, levels, etc) from the card, so you stay within the limit.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when dealing with simple homebrew games, 4mb is actually a pretty large amount, so there's a reasonable chance you won't even have to worry about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
