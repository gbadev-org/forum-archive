Or maybe you would rather play with sand? <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?a05z5wmdvxm" target="_blank">Sandscape is for you in that case.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although a couple of the 128KB banks can be allocated to ARM7. ARM9 can't access them then, but you could do a double buffering system with them, or maybe just pass one over during VBlank, have ARM7 write stuff to it, and then switch it back.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
