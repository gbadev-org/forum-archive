    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i mentioned this in the PassMe thread, and i thought if there was enough interest then this might happen.
<br/>
basically it was on cracking the firmware update files used for the GBA Movie Player (available for US$24.90, uses CF cards up to any size for memory) to either use it as a general GBA flash card or anything else. Lynx also seemed to think it was a great idea.

i opened it up in visual c++ and got what i think is 16 bits a line seperated into groups of 8. someone else might make more sense of it[/code]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

16bytes per line grouped into blocks of 8bytes is how visual studio's hex editor displays files. It has nothing to do with the format or contents of the file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If that's what you're trying to do, then you do understand that you will only have 32MB you can store multimedia on at a time, and that you will also need to modify the actual GBAMP OS to not read from the CF but from a flash cart, that is, IF you can read out the GBAMP ROM.

Alter it and reflash the card.

It reads the firmware from the CF card at boot-up.

If it is possible to change this firmware we will be able to add/change the Card.

We will be using the GBAMP.

With  modified Firmware on the CF card.

GBA instruction set..... As far as the CPU goes, it uses the ARM instruction set - Coprocessor instructions.  Other than that, there are hardware registers.  Then there is the GBA bios.  After that, there's nothing special about the GBA.  You should be able to find all this information (via links) at gbadev.org (you know, the site you are already on).<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

<br/>
<br/>
1. Any GBA flash card on the market can hold a huge amount of homebrew titles...
<br/>
<br/>
2. If you actually want it for GBA piracy, almost any GBA flash card on the market can pirate almost any GBA game and this is not the place to ask...
<br/>
<br/>
3. If you actually want it for DS homebrew through a passthrough, wait a while and see what the developments are, regardless of the fact that nobody in a fit state of mind would write DS software that requires two speciality bits of hardware to run.
<br/>
<br/>
3. If you really actually want it for DS piracy through a PassMe (yes the famous PassMe you saw slashdotted), you are in for a job that people here have not done yet and will require some time before it ever happens.

I'm no PassMe expert, but what you said is contradictory to everything that I've heard.  The code on PassMe searches for DS code in the memory assigned to the GBA cart slot.  Since the GBA MP and the Supercard have to load the game code after they boot (from the CF card into memory) the PassMe would have problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Or.. Maybe not if the card is memory mapped.  Has anyone tried it?  I will once I get my parts for the PassMe, with my GBA MP.
<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I e-mailed the makers of the GBA MP about removing the size restriction.
