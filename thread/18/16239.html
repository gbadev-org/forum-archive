<br/>
What is the easiest way of making a homebrew game? A game that will actually be <span style="font-style: italic">fun</span> to play? A game where you can actually use the touchscreen (not THAT necessary)?
<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn't the most specific question ever asked.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I do not know any coding. And I don't want to spend a year learning it before being able to create something. If I NEED to know some specific coding for specific things, I'd like to be directly pointed to the right direction, if that isn't too much to ask.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, fellas! And sorry if many of these threads are being created.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, first, the real way to make games is to learn to code.  If you don't want to spend a year (maybe more, maybe less) learning it, then you'll be quite limited as to what you can make.
<br/>
<br/>
There are tools out there like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dsgamemaker.com/" target="_blank">DS Game Maker</a> that let you do point-and-click game creation.  I have no idea what kind of quality you can get out of them.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as making a game <span style="font-weight: bold">fun</span>, that's more about game design than about HOW you make the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you *really* want to make *fun* games (or any games at all), you have to *learn* making games. That requires a lot of effort and if you're not willing to accept that it takes years of learning to be able to do anything beyond the regular game maker stuff (which can also be pretty fun for a beginner), then I suppose you find yourself another hobby. Yes, it's that serious, sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
I really don't think that starting from scratch is best done on a game console. Try to get comfortable with one of the many game makers on the PC first. When you'll be able to make simple games (that means program them and make the art and design the game mechanics and all that stuff, which is a horrible amount of work for anything beyond pong - even some tetris games need a whole lot of "stuff" that has to be made), make the next step and try to learn basic C/C++ and only after that I suggest you come back to the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep this in mind: Making games (in general) is not a simple task.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, finally: Have a nice day! :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

It's not so much hate as not wanting people to create a huge mess for themselves. While the idea of PAlib isn't particularly awful - that of wrapping hardware in allegedly easy to use functions - there are immense problems with their implementation.
<br/>
<br/>
PAlib users and maintainers recommend that the toolchain and support libraries are downgraded in order to still allow their code to build. This leaves users with a setup which can't build the supplied examples, still contains bugs which have been long fixed and puts them in a situation where moving to the latest builds will break every piece of code they've ever managed to write.
<br/>
<br/>
PAlib has also implemented APIs which were always intended to be added to the support libraries as we built the infrastructure to support them.
<br/>
<br/>
The forthcoming devkitARM release set will break PAlib rather badly - quite possibly beyond repair. It's an unfortunate situation but one I don't really see a way to avoid.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have the new releases ready within the next week. The new feature set will be rather impressive but I'll leave that as a surprise ;)  Some of you already know what we're up to but let's not spoil it for those who don't.
<br/>
<br/>
I will say that the feedback from testers has been great so far ;)

<br/>
The implication being that programmers willing to sell some amount of labor for $100 are more likely to live in countries with a low cost of living, such as India where <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=100+usd+in+indian+rupees" target="_blank">100 USD converted to rupees</a> can buy more necessities of life than the same 100 USD can in the States. (To see why, look up <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" target="_blank">purchasing power parity</a>.) I'd guess they're probably also the kind of programmer who can find overly easy tasks, which might take an underperformer a month but would take an expert perhaps a day, and then take a bunch of jobs at once.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Not at all.  If I were interviewing someone, I would take paid homebrew development for a complete game seriously even if it was only a $100 contract.  How much of that is "complete game" VS "paid" really depends on what is on the table.  Others may not see things the same way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
