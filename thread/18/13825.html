<br/>
      I want to start programming for the NDS and order a dev kit.  What exactly do I need to order to get started?

    Thanks for the help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I told my boss we didn't need to order a dev kit, and that we could just use devkitpro.  But he argues with me that we do need a dev kit.  Why would developers order a dev kit when they can do it for free with devkitpro???  Oh and we applied to be an Authorized Developper, where just waiting on acceptance (if that matters?).  Can anybody shed some light on this matter?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're going to be authorized, you'll probably get the official Nintendo devkit, which is only for authorized Nintendo licensed programmers.  If you aren't licensed, anyone can get the free devkitPro and use libnds.  Note that the official SDK probably won't support 3rd party things like DLDI or flashcarts, because it is designed to work with official cartridges and 1st party Nintendo products only.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I started familiarinzing my self a little using devkitpro, but what is best to use? devkitpro? or the kit that we have to buy?  Is it possible we won't be able to publish our games or run into problems if we use devkitpro?  We plan on having our games published on cartridge.

Sorry for all the questions, Im very new at console development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So If I start developing with devkitpro (until we actually get an official kit in house), how hard would it be to move my projects over to the Official dev kit environment?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
