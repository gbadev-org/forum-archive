    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I know I'm a pain, and in using palib, rather than learning to code properly I have closed the door to most of the arm7 goodness etc.
<br/>
<br/>
But does anyone have code to switch to gba mode using palib? I noticed dotted around the net scource for arm9+7 to do this, but I haven't a clue how to add it to the palib setup.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know, but you ought to know that if you do switch to GBA mode, then it will start executing from the beginning of the GBA code in SLOT-2, you can't tell it to start differently. What you can do is set the backlight, top/bottom screen, and border, that's all.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
