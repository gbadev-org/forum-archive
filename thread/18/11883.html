<br/>
I want to have one solution with a few VSProj projects:
<br/>
<br/>
- A math project (for vector and matrix stuff)
<br/>
- A graphics project (for all display list functions, effects, etc...)
<br/>
- An XML converter project (for importing XML data into an array to be later converted into U32 FIFO data by functions in the graphics project)
<br/>
- A game object project (for combining transform data, mesh data for rendering and custom game-specific data)
<br/>
<br/>
I have successfully used this tutorial:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/visual-c++-express.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/visual-c++-express.shtml</a>
<br/>
<br/>
to use the Makefile with a VSProj...
<br/>
<br/>
However, the XML project needs to create data at compile time that the graphics project can use to build Display List data.  I imagine the XML project has to be compiled for x86, and the rest for ARM...
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else tried to do something simliar ?  Any ideas how I should approach this ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks !
<br/>
<br/>
Small edit: I brought in the XML project as a static library... I'm pretty sure this is the right approach for that one ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
