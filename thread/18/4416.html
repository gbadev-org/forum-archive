You would expect a much brighter screen like that to chew through the batteries... how long can you play before replacing/recharging?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">been playing all day, battery is prime.  The light is accually dimmer than the GBA SP.  I say this because when the lights are off, the SP illuminates the room more than the DS by a great margine.  When you view the sytems from their sides, the SP shines much brighter.  I imagine that since the DS is backlit, it requires less light to effectivly illuminate the screen(s)<br/>_________________<br/>DigiPen Graduate</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I really do wish there would be some attachment that you stick into the GBA port, in which you stick the GBA game into that attachment, and the attachment has the wired link port so that GBA multiplayer modes can work with it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
