    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently I am working on something that would require me to be able to look into the SLOT-1 card and find the game icon and descriptions.  
<br/>
<br/>
I have looked into libnds and found a section on cards, but I don't understand how to use the functions and even after leafing through the respective sections in GBATek do not understand the process enough to write my own functions.
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone explain to me how to use the card reading functions or how to make some myself?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... well not being able to get the code because <span style="font-style: italic">everyone</span> is a suspect for piracy is rather annoying, but it's just like the laws of most countries - just because of those that would abuse it those that would use it (and yes, what I stated as my motive is exactly what I plan to do,) can't.

Oh well.  Maybe I'll wait until I get my firmware clean enough for a release and then maybe I might be considered credible enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, wait a second... I just saw a function that came with hbfirmware that should do the trick.  However, it's likely to work only if flashed to the DS, so I'll check that out later.

As a secondary question, is there a way to detect a SLOT-1 card?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you read from the Slot-1 using libnds' functions and there is no card inserted, all data returned will be 0xFFFFFFFF. That's the trick used in NitroHax.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And I did manage to see your post before it was deleted.  My sister was quite happy that it linked to some AR codes for Pikmin 2.  It's also nice to know that the card reading method will only work if flashed.  Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try not giving the address of a piracy supporting/enabling website.
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter if it's hyperlinked or not, if it's piracy it doesn't belong here.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

a better way to detect the card state:
