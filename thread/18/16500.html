<br/>
<br/>
I understand that the hardware has wrap around for sprite, making sprite reappear at the top of the same screen when it disappear at the bottom of the same screen.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is how do I make my sprite appear on bottom of the top screen when the sprite disappear from the top of the bottom screen and vise versa?
<br/>
Basically, i want to avoid the wrap around.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can provide sample code, it would be much appreciated!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
