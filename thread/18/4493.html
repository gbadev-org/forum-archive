    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got my DS on launch day (Nov. 21st) and I since I never had a GBA I'm wondering if I should buy a GBA dev kit...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking at the EZ Flash II 512mb kit from JandaMan.com for $135, but I'm worried that a DS kit might be released soon and then I'll feel as though I wasted the $135.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, I don't think there are going to be flash carts (assuming that is what you mean by "dev kit") for the DS anytime soon. It's a completely different format. Not even the GBA flash carts, which were a much simpler design, were released that soon after launch. Besides, if you get a GBA cart, you can use it to play homebrew games and emulators on your DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree. Go for the GBA kit. If DS equipment does come out soon, you can always flog the GBA kit to one of the pirates who idolize such things.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA cart definitely, although I highly doubt you need 512 for development. Make sure you buy one that doesnt need the GBA to transfer stuff over.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would agree with everything said so far.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a 64 Mbit F2A card, and homebrew projects don't even touch that until you start loading it up with uncompressed sounds and images.  Really, even for big projects, a 256 Mbit cart should be plenty.  But, if you wanted to put music and movies onto a flash cart, a 512 is definately the way to go.
<br/>
<br/>
And you MUST get a stand-alone flasher with compatible flash cart if you don't plan on buying a GBA because you CANNOT flash it with the DS as it does not have the required plug.  Yaustar mentioned this, but may not have been clear why, so that's why I drove that point home.  Otherwise, this is gonna cost you WAY too much, and I'd rather see that money put to good use (like, buying DS dev stuff if/when it comes out).

That looks a <span style="font-weight: bold">lot</span> different from the one I saw. I'll have to track it down.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recommend the EFA 256 (that's Extreme Flash Advance, not EZFA). It's a relatively inexpensive 256 Mbit GBA flash cart, and the PC writes to it through a USB port on the cart itself. It's large enough to hold some homebrews and some music.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree with tepples on this one. The EFA 256mbit kit is my 1st choice (and I have tried almost all available kits including EZFA, EZFA2, X-ROM, XG-Flash 2, G6Flash, Visoly, Flash2Advance,EZ Flash II Power Star etc.....)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for all of the replies!
<br/>
<br/>
I've ordered an EZ Flash II Powerstar 512mb.  (I did this so I can either dump a ton of music or perhaps a video [?] or two)
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I didn't see the posts about the EFA 256 before I ordered mine.  Is the EFA really that much better than the EZ Flash II Powerstar?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
