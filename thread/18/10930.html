I'm using a Supercard CF if that makes any difference.  I also tried the patcher but then it'd do the load endlessly thing.  Yes MKDS was in and yes my firmware is flashed, v7 btw.

It's a premade set of tracks, but no beta ones :(  If someone could find one like that or make one, but with the beta tracks also, that'd be awsome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
