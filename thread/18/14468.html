<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to allocate some memory in my currect project by using malloc, but it's crashing on real HW.
<br/>
<br/>
The code I've got is simply:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
pbwNew = (pbaseWindow) malloc( sizeof( baseWindow ) );
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
where pbaseWindow is a pointer to a baseWindow struct.  I can over come this I'm sure by using new - but I'm doing this in pure C - no classes, no fancy coding styles.  I'm also having a strange issue with a switch statement, but the malloc is the most important one right now...
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on what's causing this?  and that's the only malloc in the entire code base at the moment, if I comment out that one line, everything else works fine!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Stupid brain fart - I worked out what the problem was - I was coping data to a malloced array and one of the bits of data was not passed correctly - DOH!!!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
