    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is cool for anyone who owns a GBA Movie player. On the companies main site <a class="postlink" href="http://www.movieadvance.com" target="_blank">www.movieadvance.com</a> it says that they are working on a firmware update strictly for the DS. They have no other details on it but it would be cool to see DS full screen video, MPEG 4 or Divx codecs, touch screen controls and Hold the DS sideways  (double screen) wide screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Post any other ideas of thought of this.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Possibly a bit better display on DS because of color characteristics. And perhaps support for more formats. Don't get too excited :)
<br/>
Although I am wondering... many seem to claim to be able to run DS software from GBA card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well.. I guess we'll just have to wait and see..  But, if they are able to pull off ANYTHING that is DS related using just a firmware upgrade, it will show that DS hardware can be used by just a GBA cart with a "DS enabled" bootloader.  If that's the case, we'd just need to reverse that bootloader and everyone would be set!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like a really cool idea. I love the PlayYan and can't wait for a NA release, but the idea that it'll be limited to the GBA slot kinda sucks. I was hoping for some DS enabled extras like touch screen play controls and such. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they'll rethink it and after the initial release, do a DS version?

Probably not but it'd be cool.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I had recently emailed the people at <a href="http://www.Movieadvance.com" target="_blank">www.Movieadvance.com</a> to mention some ideas of the new updates and this is the email replied back to me (also I will post what I sent):
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What I sent to them</span>-
<br/>
1. PocketSNES or GBA 
<br/>
2. Touch screen controls
<br/>
3. Full screen ( DS MODE)
<br/>
4. Side ways ( double screen ) Wide screen
<br/>
5. Mpeg 4 or Divx codecs
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">being a Chinese company it's possible that they've got some info from one of the flashcart makers about how to use DS resources from a GBA cart or possibly it will be used in conjunction with a passme.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say pocketsnes would be unlikely unless they modify the program to address the DS' 4megs of RAM (isn't there too much latency to read the rom directly from the flash card?) and it would prevent you from playing a few of the games which are bigger than 4megs.
<br/>
<br/>
the cynic inside me says it will be colour and sound adjustments to slightly improve the picture, maybe some touchscreen functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
I do hope they get fullscreen and a compression format that actually offers quality/size above MPEG1 and sort out the sound sync issues though</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#38986 - Dwedit - Sat Apr 02, 2005 9:54 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seeing as there is no way to access the DS features from a GBA cartridge alone, and I don't think there's any more room in the 512 bytes bootup page to check for a passme, I doubt there are any DS hardware enchancments in the next version.  Maybe just color correction.
<br/>
<br/>
Now long file names and FAT32 support, that would be nice.
<br/>
<br/>
The freezing at the 'This product is not endorsed or sponsored by Nintendo' splash screen happens on the real thing if no compactflash card is inserted.  
<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, the device uses such weird boot/copy protection that it's a miracle it even boots at all.  Often it fails to boot up.  I have no clue why dumps started succeeding after tons of failures where it just repeats the first 512 bytes of each page instead of showing the rest of the content.  I noticed that it makes the first 512 bytes of each page to be unimportant junk, probably to prevent useful dumps.  But for some reason it just worked one time.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how hard it would be to find a way to write to rom, find entry points for the existing routines, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBATEK explains that the GBA BIOS makes <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbatek/gbatek20.html#cartridges" target="_blank">a few apparently meaningless reads during the intro</a>:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyway to do a rom dump with a CF card inserted?<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#39065 - Dwedit - Mon Apr 04, 2005 2:45 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That won't make a difference.  It does compactflash IO through DMA reads and writes in a certain ROM area.  Maybe that explains the odd mirroring where each 16k repeats 8 times before moving on to the next, bloating the dump size to 4MB instead of 512k.  Not sure if it has to be DMA or not, but attempting to duplicate those reads and writes with a multiboot program freezes.  Maybe my code just sucks.
<br/>
<br/>
And the dump WAS made with a CF card inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
Also looks like the ROM itself is read via DMA transfers that read from a constant address, rather than incrementing the address.  That's why it needs the modification to run in VBA.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
