Right now it only plays the first 4 levels, so it allows no more than 5 minutes of fun ;-).

To get past the first level the correct sequence is A (uses the sword on the sea snakes) and then RIGHT (avoids the falling bricks).

Basically all the Laser Disc games are the same when it comes to code; so to move from DSlair to, let's say, DSace, would be as easy as replacing the movies and inserting the right timings for the various actions.

This game is a serious classic and still has better graphics than games today (though not very interactive). When I got my first computer I remember getting dragons lair and space ace and I was totally amazed at the quality of animation. Good job.

So it seems that the only cart giving problems to the game is the GBAMP. I'll try to learn something about this cart and to figure out what's going on.
<br/>
Also, next version of the game should have more levels (I guess the first 8), then it will not fit in RAM.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Weird. I'm using Firmware 2.03 for the GBAMP, and even loading from mighty max's loader (which is my boot nds file) it still doesn't have sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if I tried downgrading thefirmware..let me try that.
<br/>
<br/>
*Tries*
<br/>
<br/>
Nope.. still no good.
<br/>
<br/>
very odd indeed.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway Tony, one thing you could try doing for GBAMP users is including a CF driver, then stream the sound off the flash cart.. (the NDS file in one directory, streaming from say..MP3's in the same directory?) It's a thought for the people who don't have expensive flash carts.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I can also confirm that the NDS version does not have sound using Wireless Multiboot as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are my full stats:
<br/>
<br/>
Version 1 NDS (the one with the metroid demo)
<br/>
Flashme v5
<br/>
GBAMP firmware 2.03 (or 2.0, doens't matter, neither has sound)
<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT using a PassMe to use this program. I wonder if that's the key right there. Regardless Tony, it'd probably still be better if you put Compact Flash support to stream the sound files from the flash card rather than embedding it into the file.. perhaps when the .ds.gba version is done, you could do this with the NDS version? .. The Wireless Multiboot people will just have to suffer I guess. :P lol
<br/>
<br/>
Last Edit: Heh, even with my PassMe it didn't work. (was using Mario Kart in the slot)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Make friends and act mature? You tell me something, go look back in the thread and see how I've been treated, and tell me I have no right to be pissed.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said El Hobito, My Nintendo DS is a version 1. It was released long ago. Unless there's something different between that one and the new ones, I don't know. But, alls I know is I provided proof, I provided my specs, and I'm not the only one having this problem.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

i never accused you of lying ,now try and do something usefull and try out caimans other demos and see what happens.  i have the exact same set up as you yet i have no problems so stop bitching and get testing, im sure its only something minor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Regardless back on topic, I can confirm that this same NDS file does not have sound with his hacked GBAMP, nor his FlashMe 5.0'd setup. (I used my compact flash card inside his movie player)
<br/>
<br/>
I will try it on my buddy's M3.. But I'm starting to lean toward a few things.
<br/>
<br/>
The people who DO NOT have sound, did you downlod the NDS file in Mozilla FireFox? I did. I haven't had the chance to re-download it with Internet Explorer, to see if the NDS is corrupted in some way.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, it could be the kind of Compact Flash we're using, I guess. I'll try a different one once I gain access to my card reader (Though I'm thinking it probably isn't that since there's no sound via wmb)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has a working NDS file, can you please zip it up and then upload it to some server? Perhaps that's all it needs.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
interestingly enough theres no sound on the nds version(using an m3) when you boot it via pressing start(something thats only meant for loading official demos).  booting via the normal "a button" works fine.  
<br/>
<br/>
tssf what version of the original gbamp firmware are you using? mine has e19 i believe and you definately have chisms firmware that can boot official demos (since only the latest one can do that).  im also booting it via the latest release of moonshell and the dslair.nds file is in the root directory.  as far as i can tell we have identical hardware downloaded from the same server using the same browser.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Back on topic, I just downloaded with IE, and there's still no sound. Which I find odd. I've got my friend's GBAMP, and my GBAMP here, both have the same problem, his blue DS still has no sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have update.e19 on my card, and it was also installed before installing chishm's 2.03 driver.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay so here's a list of things I've tried:
<br/>
<br/>
Wireless Multiboot: No Sound with this NDS file downloaded with both Mozilla, and IE.
<br/>
<br/>
GBAMP with 2.03 firmware hack, update.e19 is on the card, 3 different compact flashes: No sound (for me) on either a Generation 1 DS, or a Blue DS that can use PassMe1.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to try his other demos but I have no clue as to where to find them.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Found them.
<br/>
<br/>
Grizzley Man demo (low and normal quality): GUI seems to "Flash" on the bottom of the screen. no video.
<br/>
Hefalump demo (low and normal quality): Two black screens. Bottom screen says "Caimans Video Codec"
<br/>
both Madagascar and Spongebob trailers have the same problem as the Hefalump demo.
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I can say that none of those demos work for me, either.
<br/>
<br/>
I was unable to try version 2.0 of the codec since those files are larger than 4 megabytes.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Hmm...question.  Have you tried inserting a different NDS game into the NDS card slot?  It probably won't make a difference, but I can think of (in my personal experience) some official demos that apparently depend on what game is in the NDS card slot (something to do with timing?).
<br/>
<br/>
Are you actually using PassMe, or FlashMe?  I think this would probably only affect FlashMe, although I'm not certain.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've tried it with PassMe1, but FlashMe 5 was still installed. I booted with Select when I used my PassMe.

<br/>
I just tried with Viewtiful Joe, Nanostray, and Mario 64DS in the slot (with and without passme), all resulting in no sound..

i was merely responding to your comments to which you seem to have for every situation...
<br/>
back on topic,  well tbh i'm not sure what could be causing you problems since we have exactly the same set up hardware and firmware wise were you booting them via moonshell or mighty max's (there shouldnt be a difference but you never know).  yeah unfortunately the other demos dont work and i'd imagine it would be due to a similar issue that causes gbfs to not work on the gbamp.  i also hex edited the v2.0 ndses to fit but they suffer from the same issue (gui but no video).
<br/>
<br/>
so if its not the gbamp, its not the ds, its not the nds file itself, its not the firmware and its not the bootloader then whats left? only perhaps some kind of hack in the code itself or perhaps a memory(sound buffer?) issue?
<br/>
since the videos themselves are separate files inside the file system thats used for this game(is it gbfs?) then i would imagine it would be a rather simple modification to add native cf reading support and supply the videos as separate files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Little update: The NDS file works with sound on my friend's M3, but not on my GBAMP when used in his system.
<br/>
<br/>
If it was GBFS (isn't it incompatible with M3 as well?) then that certainly would explain things.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, if the files were seperated for a GBAMP version, then like, future versions that exceed the DS's RAM limitation could be written and actually work.
<br/>

I personally would love to see Dragon's Lair 2 actually.. that was like playing an interactive Disney cartoon.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Hello everybody. Came back after a while and saw that this thread is still alive, thanks everybody for the deep tests.
<br/>
None of the demos on the website can run from RAM, also the ones smaller than 4 mb because they use Filesystem. Not GBFS nor official nintendo's, but a much simpler one, anyway the way the data is stored is pretty the same as GBFS does:the video files are joined at the end of the rom and then the codec looks for their header. In DSlair 0.1.4, I decided to fit everything to ram to allow the largest range of users to run it but new versions with more levels should not fit into ram anymore. I'm not an expert of all those exploits/carts/loaders (i only own a neoflash) but I'm afraid that's going to cause problems to many users.
<br/>
as to the sound issue: I used a custom arm7 binary and my own sound routines, but I was thinking about rewriting the sound part (not the decoding one, but the playing one, which is the one it seems to fault) using the standard arm7 skeleton coming with devkitpro, libnds and following the hints by Chris Double in his tutorials, namely part 4 and 6 where he talks about sound playing via libnds and interprocessor communication.

<br/>
<br/>
I too am using a supercard, and you will be happy to know the answer to your problem is very, very easy!  It took me a bit of research to figure this out, but here ya go:
<br/>
<br/>
Take the GameName.nds.gba file, and simply rename it to GameName.nds -- Isn't that frustrating?  =)
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, you do NOT run this file in the supercard software patcher program (say THAT 10 times fast!), just put it onto your SD or CF card, launch it, and voila, away you go!
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, i can confirm the sound works perfectly on mine.  (I'm assuming there is no little *plink* sound when you actually move Dirk.. is this true?)
<br/>
<br/>
Just in case it matters to anyone, i am using the following equipment:
<br/>
<br/>
DS Lite, FlashMe Ver. 6, and a Supercard with a 1 Gig SD flashcard
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">NICE WORK ON THE GAME!!! </span> Very very impressive!!
<br/>
Looking forward to more levels, and perhaps in the future, the small *plink* sound when i move Dirk!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
