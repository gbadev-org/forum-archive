    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently using programmers notepad to program for the gba. I would like to try programming for the ds in the same way. I know that they both use the same cpu architecture so it should be fairly easy to get programmers notepad to compile for the ds right? How can i do this? Adjust the makefile?<br/>_________________<br/>French re f draft free e w shredder for c rt</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First look at the examples directory for devkitarm, there are NDS examples in there.  Copy-paste one of the projects, and modify it until it's your own.  You may need to slightly change the makefile.

Your code doesn't care which tool writes it.  You could use Programmer's Notepad, you could use Visual C++, you could use TextPad, or anything else you want to use.  What matters is the makefile, and that it calls the correct commands to build each file until it has finished generating the output file.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
