    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it's become quite popular recently, head tracking. Basically, you get an infrared source (usually two infrared LEDs, attached to the side of glasses) to go on your head, and an infrared camera (Wiimote best example) to detect the two dots. Then, it recognizes the dots and uses the movement of your head (which changes the appearance of the dots in size, etc) to move the stuff onscreen around, making it look, well, "real". Google Wii Head Tracking for a more thorough explanation.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, a PS3 developer recently invented his own way of Head Tracking using the PSEye (little camera peripheral), infrared "glasses", and an exposed developed film filter to go over the lense. (Basically making an infrared camera). This got me thinking.
<br/>
<br/>
You're all aware of the DS Face Training game released about half a year ago in Japan, right? It has a Slot-2 camera that detects many features of your face and facial movements. Well, wouldn't it be great if we could somehow utilize this and be able to make head-tracking/motion recognition on the DS? Add that with the already available touchscreen, and there's a whole other dimension of creativity.
<br/>
<br/>
I have the Face Training game + Camera (imported), and the face-recognition works really well. If only we could figure out how to use this, and possibly use an infrared filter.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You would have to hold the DS perfectly still, you cant play many games on a handheld without moving it. What use would it be anyway? I can see the point on a huge tv, improving the 3d experience, but on a 3 inch screen, it seems a bit daft.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can see this being used, but still very limited.
<br/>
<br/>
Games like "Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney" come to mind.
<br/>
<br/>
Move the DS to look behind things, you know what I mean?
<br/>
<br/>
Still, very limited...
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that on a TV or something like that, it's certainly usable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm this would be great for a wifi webcam/voicechat app. You could use your Mii save and it would position your Mii head and rotation according to what the DS detected. And whenever you talked the mouth moved according to your speech. Just an idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an idea for different implementation on DS.
<br/>
<br/>
instead of tracking the game more officiant for DS will be tracking of the orientation of DS. Using the motion sensor you can detect if DS is rotated from it's default position. This method had limitation that you can't get closer or get far away from the screen. But you will be able to look behind objects.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, just a suggestion. I mean, it would probably take a lot of time to program the "shape" recognition (i.e., two dots) but after that point it couldn't be <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> hard to work with it.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking something like an organizer (sort of like DSO) that provided alternate angles, but like naleksiev said, the Motion Pak could probably do this just as well (if not better).
<br/>
<br/>
Seems more like a hobby or something to do in spare time to me. Oh well. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I say build it, even for fun :)
<br/>
It might make a nice addition to FPS shooters, not many people may be able to use it though on account of the hardware availability.
<br/>
<br/>
Shame the DS does not bend completely over as if you had a front and back facting camera you could then flip the DS over to see the backside of something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does the Face Training camera have facial recognition hardware in it, or it's done entirely by the game? If it does have built-in hardware, you could use it to detect the user's eyes and use the information to scroll the camera.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you wouldn't need to hold the DS in a firm position. On a handheld screen this could work even better than on a big, fixed screen, because the user can move the screen around and the camera would move in the opposite direction, fixing the view based on the user's eyes. This makes the screen work as a movable "window" to a 3D scenery.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
