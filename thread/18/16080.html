    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using moonshell to read text files. I haven't bothered to put much effort into getting the others working. You might also look at dslibris and dolphin reader. Nothing I know of seems likely to go for the "stronger" formats, but .pdf and probably .rtf are quite a bit to deal with. .lit would be nice to see, though.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">appart from the various text reader we have there is also a "comic book reader" that basically let you browse and watch (with zoom) images(in a single packed file i think), It might be possible to transcode other source to something readable by comicbookDS, I don't know... damn I'dd love to have a pdf reader too...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could try dslibris.  The books need to be in xhtml format but it is a good product and is still being developed and has a mailing list for bugs, etc.
