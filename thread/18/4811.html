I have been following the DS development since pretty much day 1 but I'm not too great at hardware so I was just going to wait til things got moving and start developing whenever we got an emulator or until we cracked the carts to test in on hardware but anyway about when can we expect it/one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We don't even know the 3D hardware yet. How can someone make an emulator for a system you don't understand? Sure the DS is simular to the GBA, and it helps to already have an emulator done for the GBA, but you can't except an emulator before people can test the hardware for sure.
<br/>
<br/>
Running our own code on the DS hardware is the key</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Running illegal games on the DS. Not my dream. An emulator for the PC would help the development. An emulator on the DS would be used to play games downloaded from Interent.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

emulated touchscreen, combined with buttons and mic as input? I really don't think many people will seriously consider playing pirated games on this thing when it becomes available.

*edit* ok, I misinterpreted your post :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What an odd formulation. Of course someone can write emulators for a system that redhatspecial don't understand. :) If you are the guy writing BoycottAdvance I can understand that You can't write the emulator because You don't know the hardware, but that doesn't stop people who actually know how the hardware works from writing an emulator.

The first working GBA emulator was released before the retail GBA was released.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You'll have to wait a bit before my emulator will actually run the metroid demo... First I need to focus on the ARM9 emulation and then reverse-engineering everything in the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Since there is one romdump for a demo game and leaked info, starting to understand the GBA hardware is possible.
<br/>
While working on BoycottAdvance, pretty much everything was guessed through reverse-engineering. Of course, there were many public domain demos available so it helps a lot too.
<br/>
<br/>
Only hope is to have people starting coding demos and test on hardware... Then an emulator could develop more easily...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I knew it wasn't going to be very soon but the thought of being able to code a game with two screens to display on, wireless gaming, a mic, and all the other DS features is like a dream for game coders... well atleast me! Anyway I know it seemed kinda newbish and hopeful although i am quite hopeful it's just very exciting so I had to ask after reading the post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
