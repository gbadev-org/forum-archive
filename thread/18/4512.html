Have you ppl seem the micro HDD's that GS MagicStor used in their flash cards (GS MagicStor 2.2GB CompactFlash). That CF card uses 3.6V, so it's possible to use that HDD in DS's GBA slot. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gs-magicstor.com/english/product/product_a_07_x.htm" target="_blank">Link to GS MagicStor 2.2GB CompactFlash</a>
<br/>
**Of course it have to be build to fit in the GBA cart case**
<br/>
<br/>
DS slot needs to have a starter for this GBA-slot HDD. That HDD could have OS like Linux, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Where to get DS cart?? After the DS cart gets cracked, it could be possible to rewrite the Metroid Prime demo cart with something else.
<br/>
Maybe Reiner Ziegler can help with reading that cart? He is totally genius. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ziegler.desaign.de/" target="_blank">Link to his site</a>
<br/>
<br/>
So it's needed to start the DS with stuff in the DS-slot to take control of the whole system. These were my thought that I last night wondered and get no sleep because of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can't rewrite DS cards.  It's nothing to do with the encryption;  it's the type of ROM used.  You can only write a card once, after which the data is fixed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, I tought they were similar to flash cards. Then we need some fast memory chip to be able to delivery the data fast enough to the DS console. I believe it's not possible to make such small carts as the DS cart, but maybe the alternate solution can be found from some other memory chips? Of course the backup cart would stick out from DS a bit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
