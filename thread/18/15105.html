    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I really think this one is in the wrong board, so if you would like to move it or delete it, it's fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm a graphic artist, somewhat of a writer, and I've just started wanting to make a homebrew RPG for the DS. I want it to be a 2d game, so you wouldn't have to worry about 3d conversions or anything, mostly, I just want someone who can take my ideas and art (sprites, tiles, what not), put them into a .nds file with the proper codes to run them.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I'm a graphic artist, goto my deviantart to see what I can do (unholy-hatred.deviantart.com). Like I said, all I would need is someone who can code the game, which I hope wouldn't be to difficult, as I would be doing everything else. (The way I want the game, though, is to load from an indirect source, so it isn't really compiled into a single file, because I've got a games N' music and it has some problems when it comes to homebrews over a certain amount)
<br/>
<br/>
(Btw, the things on that site are currently only regular concept-type characters. I'm thinking of a way to sprite my characters that'll allow the most detail and such.
<br/>
<br/>
Graphic Dimensions:
<br/>
<br/>
Sprites (if possible) will be roughly 50 high by 30 across, making it easy to splite into 4ths for me to make them. portion of icons and all tiles will be 32x32, while some icons will possibly be 24x24 or 16x16</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, 32x48 pixel sprites are doable, although I don't see why you'd want to make them larger than, say, 24x32. If the sprites are too large in a 2D view, it's hard to see long distances down the screen in 2D. Do you have a value of pixels per meter in mind?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the thing is, I want sprites with the highest detail possible. But, the current things I know is the sizes were 50 by 30, 100 ppi (pixel per inch). Is that what you ment by pixels per meter? I'll most likely shrink it down, but im not sure. Btw, I'm still considering the sprite sizes.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on the concept are for one of the sprites, once it's done, I'll decide the sprite size from there; btw, is it possible to have it 4 frames by 5 frames. 4 directions, 5 steping animations.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

<br/>
What I meant is how many pixels of screen represent one meter of world.

You can have pretty much as many frames as you want.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
