    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've got code looping in waitforvblank, and other code that has to fire 10000 times a second on a timer.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm noticing 16.7ms delays in some of the output - is my timer irq waiting until the vblank code returns?
<br/>
<br/>
hrm... or is the sound code in palib only syncing arm9 and arm7 on vblank?
<br/>
<br/>
update: sound is only syncing on vblank in arm7 PA_VBL(). am going to try and move the pattern playback into the arm7 and see if i can get it running smoother there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
