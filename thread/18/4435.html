    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have.  I've heard about the ability to download small games and demos onto the PSP, and store them onto a memory card.  I've also heard that they're very worried about piracy, and might not do anything of the sort if they can't protect themselves against it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't heard anything about the PSP being able to download data directly, only through games, but not the BIOS. Maybe through firmware upgrades, the PSP would be able to do such a thing, but nothing has officially been announced.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
