<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to start compiling Firefox for NDS WinS tonight or tomorrow (or later), but before I start, I need a group. If anyone who is interested and has the skills, please contact me. Here's some people I need:
<br/>
<br/>
All the DS Developers I can get
<br/>
All the GBA Developers I can get
<br/>
A website host
<br/>
A sponsor
<br/>
A really rich guy. o_O
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

The one thing I don't like about Firefox is that it seems to use up a lot more memory than IE, especially when you have multiple tabs open. Even when you close then, it's almost as if the memory isn't freed.

Seriously... FireFox for WinS? Better say <span style="font-style: italic"><a class="postlink" href="http://links.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">links</a></span> (or so) for NDS, running directly on the machine.

p.s. Making a web browser is silly while they don't develop the WiFi libs.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Diskun on Mon Jun 06, 2005 10:16 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I have some comments for you:
<br/>
-I'm not from the USA, not even America (lol)
<br/>
-First, you can be developing anything for whatever you want, you SHOULD know where are the boundaries of the DS. A full web-browser is possible, just as it is on Symbian Phones (Opera for S60, and such) but don't wait to see Flash or Java running.
<br/>
-Trying to port FireFox is lame, unless you make a REALLY lite version of it. And of course you first need the functions to access the WiFi components and write a TCP/IP Stack. In Spain we say: "Don't begin building the house from the roof". I think it needs no explanation at all.
<br/>

You're probably better off writing a browser from scratch, it's not that crazy if you know what you're doing. I would write one myself, but I'm having more fun doing games that will actually function. If I did do one, I'd leave out network protocol and wait for someone else to implement the proper WiFi libraries. I'd stick to presenting HTML files at first (tables, lists, headers, etc.), and then support links, address bar, history, etc.  I really think that would be a lot easier than stripping down an industry standard like Firefox.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You have to write a program that can understand pretty much all standards of HTML and possibly XML, then display it correctly. It's not as easy as it sounds.
<br/>
<br/>
Firefox DS could be done, but you'd have to de-bloat it: No extensions, No themes, No plugins, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only drawback would be that the current version uses Objective C.  But, there are plans to migrate to standard C/C++.

Not really a lot. GTK dependencys are only on linux i think, the win version does not use gtk imo (could be wrong tho) glib and libx is due to gtk of course libssl is for secure connection i guess we don't really need that (well not right from the start, k?) and libpng and libjpeg for image processing appear to be nescessary i guess.
<br/>
Dillo might actually a good bet...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
