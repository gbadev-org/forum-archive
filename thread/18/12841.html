    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How do the various flash carts work with the roms generated by the official nintendo ds devkits.   This can be handy for letting a producer play a game, without having to have a full devkit on their desk (not like they would be debugging, etc).

Another way to let a producer play a game is to develop a version for the Microsoft Windows platform in parallel. It's extra effort, but in your proposal, you can try claiming that the revenue from sales to the public as a casual game justifies it, unless your studio is getting a deep discount from Nintendo for keeping your game DS-exclusive.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Generally developing for multiple platforms is the way to go.  Window is the easiest and cheapest SKU to add.  I guess  a mouse emulates the stylus fairly well...  there are also emulators to run the games too.

While that is good point, I have been asked to investigate getting our roms to run on stock DS's, so it makes the point moot. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
