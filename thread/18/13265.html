    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if it is possible to port the PC version of Final Fantasy 7 on the DS... (or of theres a ps1 emulator out there) I dont know anything really about creating a port... Just wondering if it is possible, or if theres anyone attempting it. Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes it would be possible if you wanted to port Q-Gears, it's getting pretty far in now and can load 3d models and 2D scenes, can parse a lot of the opcodes and can play the movies with sound.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't expect any of the developers to spend their time porting it though, the furthest they've planned to go into portables is a PDA port, and that isn't going anywhere at the moment.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, it's coming along pretty well. I'm looking forward to the next release.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the main issues are going to be:
<br/>
1. Re-implementing the SDL based code to work on the DS
<br/>
2. Compressing the original data enough to actually fit into the small amount of RAM available on the DS
<br/>
3. Having to scale the screen down to accomodate for the lower screen resolution
<br/>
4. How to handle the dual display, considering the original game was designed for only one screen, and is implemented in such a fashion as to require the main kernel to be completely rewritten if you wanted the main menu visible alongside the other modules such as the field or world map.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than this it should be fine :-P
<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion I think a port to another portable like the PSP or GP2X would probably work better, considering the larger screen size available, and larger amount of RAM and processing power.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, the DS does have more RAM than the PSOne. So it would be more of a matter of scrapping the SDL code and writing something from scratch for the DS to keep RAM usage under control (pre-processing all art assets into DS-friendly formats using an offline tool would also help keeping the binaries' sizes down).
<br/>
<br/>
The rendering code would need to be re-done entirely anyway, since you can't freely draw that many polygons on the DS before hitting the limits, and a two-pass (or maybe a three-pass) approach would be required to get things running without the need for modifying the original geometry.
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, it's too much work and Square-Enix might as well port it themselves in the meantime (or at least they'll start sending cease-and-desist letters if the project starts progressing too much).
<br/>
<br/>
A PSP port is a bit pointless, since any homebrew-capable PSP can also emulate FF7 perfectly. A GPX2 port could be viable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
