How does this compare to the SP?
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, Pin 4 when Connected to Ground pin 6 will turn off the sound for the unit, so you could use attached headphones instead.  Silly that they stayed with this setup, because the SP didn't have a headphone jack and the DS does.<br/>_________________<br/>│?ig │

Hmm...   I never really thought of that... so true.  People can be idiots, but mistaking the DS power port for GBA compatible would and could happen to anybody, idiot or not.  Yay Nintendo!  (I guess that's why the warning screen at every boot, to make the DS more 'idiot' proof.)

It would not have been hard.  In fact, it could still be done!  Just make a wireless adapter that plugs into the GameCube and sends out a Download-and-Play "game".  Go into the DS, choose "Download Play", and select the adapter.  Each adapter would have a button to change its channel, and whatever channel it's on, that's the name of the download.  For instance, if the adapter in P1 spot is channel 9 and the P2 spot is channel 1, then player 1 would select "Wireless GBA Boot Ch.9" and player 2 would select "Wireless GBA Boot Ch.1" from their DS menus.  Once someone has selected their port, the adapter would lock in communications and not allow someone else to connect to it.  Then, the program the DS downloads would be a GBA Boot emulator, and the Adapter would act as a GBA plugged into the GameCube taking commands from the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Whew, lengthy explanation, but there you have it.  It (probably) can and SHOULD be done.  I mean seriously!  And Nintendo should have built in 1 more protocol -- the one used on the GBA wireless adapters!!  That way, DS owners who don't have a GBA can play their wireless GBA games like Pokemon, or the new Classic NES series that can multiplay over wireless... geez.

This would kill the GBA/GBA SP as there would be no reason to buy one anymore. It is stupid to kill a successful product.

Besides, it is supposed to be a "third pillar". If you put in a link port, people will begin thinking it is just another GameBoy.

You say you are sure it could have been done without risking compatibility problems? Well, sorry, but you are very wrong. It is technically impossible to emulate the GBA link port over wireless at all!
<br/>
You cannot emulate the synchronous serial communication interface over wireless, or any packet switched network (such as Ethernet/TCP/IP) for that matter.

1) TCP/IP defines a reliable, FIFO-style transport layer which just happens to support full-duplex communication.  There's nothing stopping you from using it in a half-duplex (and hence fully-synchronous) fashion.

Now, as for the idea that Nintendo is worried about killing the GBA SP, that seems kinda silly, too.  After all, they had no trouble doing the same with the regular Gameboy.  In fact, given the increased price point of the DS, Nintendo should be doing everything they can to encourage people to move to their new platform.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Then I guess the best solution is a GBA card with a serial port built into it that, when you turn it on, will act like a GBA in listen mode, grab the data, and send it into internal memory and execute it from there.  Two problems I can think of with that are:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Send-back data.  Some apps/games (in fact, many) talk with the gamecube to either tell it everything is OK or to start a conversation.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Making the downloaded app/game talk to the port on the cart instead of hardware in the GBA which isn't there 'cause it's a DS.
<br/>
<br/>
So, unless Nintendo knows of a way around this (and let's face it, I'm not that smart, so just 'cause I don't know it doesn't mean it doesn't exist) then I guess we're all gonna be stuck with both a DS and a GBA if we want it all.

Yes, good point.  Although with clever buffering algorithms, you might be able to cut down the overhead some (try to detect when large-scale streaming is in progress versus periodic control messages, etc).  And, of course, TCP, with all it's overhead, isn't the only reliable transport available... heck, you could probably get away with UDP and basic sequence numbers since, by-and-large, packet drops aren't terribly common.

Yes, but the point isn't to perfectly emulate the physical layer.  The GBA exposes a form of programmer's interface, in the form of registers for data transfer, status, etc.  Emulating these correctly may very well be sufficient to trick most software, as games probably use status registers, rather than carefully tweaked timing trickery, in order to perform data transfers.

<br/>
It is correct that it is slightly easier to emulate the communication on the register layer rather than on the physical layer. However, it is not a huge difference.
<br/>
GBA software send and receive one byte (or one word) at a time, and expect a response byte to be immediately available in a register when a byte has been transmitted.
<br/>
<br/>
The latency requirements would vary depending on the number of GBAs connected to each other, and the transmission mode used, but to get a basic idea of the latency requirements: A byte transmission is 8 clock cycles, 8*3.9 = 31.2us.
<br/>
You see the problem?
<br/>
Even on the register level the latency requirement is nowhere near that of packet based networks.
<br/>
There is also the packet bandwidth overhead issue, Ethernet packets can never be smaller than 64byte (assuming wired ethernet, I don't know the specifics about wireless ethernet), and the GBa protocol requires transmisson of single bytes. That's one packet for each byte.
<br/>
256kbit/s == 32kByte/s == 32000 packets/s =&gt; 2 * 16Mbit/s Ethernet traffic (16Mbit/s in each direction) 
<br/>
<br/>
That's just for 256kbit/s and only two connected GBAs.

I can see their logic but it will be a real shame if the DS DOES prove hugely popular (im not counting my chickens yet, its sold well but it could still flop later) then they really missed out on a useful feature.
<br/>
<br/>
As for having a GBA link port on a GBA cart.  Possible?  Maybe.
<br/>
But the usefulness would be limited as it would only work with multiboot games unless it could somehow be a passive devide allowing a GBA cart plugged in at the same time.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

Well, sorry, but you are very wrong. It is technically impossible to emulate the GBA link port over wireless at all!

You cannot emulate the synchronous serial communication interface over wireless, or any packet switched network (such as Ethernet/TCP/IP) for that matter. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Ooops, latency, I always forget about the latency. LOL
<br/>
<br/>
Well surely they could at LEAST have made the Pokemon wireless compatible with DS wireless.  This would have also mean that all future GBA games could have been designed to be fully DS compatible.

i don't think the DS was designed to be the next gameboy at all.  infact, if the Revolution lives up to its name, you can count on the next Gameboy being a gamecube in your pocket with some of the revolutions features (in fact, count on it being a gamecube in your pocket anyway) nintendo's gonna steer clear of discs for GB-Next too, we all know the battery problems with the PSP (nintendo themselves have also said that they won't use discs in a portable system)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo held out too long on switching to cd media, and it hurt them on the 64.  Eventually they capitulated and the Gamecube had the mini cds.  The same is inevitable for portables as well.

It's somewhere around 1.6 GB from what I remember.  I think it's actually the same amount as the UMD - aren't they both just mini DVDs that are formatted strangely?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, it's 12288 Mb or exactly 12 times the size of a DS card.

I guess I was too tired to multiply 1.5 GB by 1024 to get MB before the other math, which if we pick apart I probably didn't do quite as accurate either, especially since I don't think GC discs are exactly 1.5 GB in the first place.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EXT 2 Socket (Power Supply and Headphones)

  X,Y,B,C Headphones ???              \_/

I figured this out:
<br/>
<br/>
  C       Audio GND (Shield)
<br/>
  B       Audio L
<br/>
  X       Audio R
<br/>
  Y       ??? (connect this to D(when charger is not connected) and the speakers are disabled and audio is piped through the audio pins)
<br/>
<br/>
I want to use the connector for audio out and charging for my project. Thing is, I am unsure if the DS or GBASP would be damaged if 5.2V is connected to Y and D to not only charge, but pass audio out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
