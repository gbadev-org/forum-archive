    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I descided to stop the development of my GPS system on a DS.
<br/>
The complete project is available on request.
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that to be able to use DS-GPS you need:
<br/>
<br/>
- a DSerial card 
<br/>
- Serial GPS mouse/module 
<br/>
<br/>
The code is written in C++ and makes use of the PALib library.
<br/>
<br/>
