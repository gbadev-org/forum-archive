    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can a normal Wifi router/AP act as a relay for 2 or more DS's.
<br/>
ie, say i was in range of a router, and someone else was in the range of a router, but we wernt in range of each other, would we still be able to play multiplayer via the router.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">an example is that Mario 64 DS only has single cart/download play multiplayer, but Madden 2005 only has multi cart which means that everyone must have a copy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Offering DS Download Play is a slightly different decision from offering GBA single-pak multiplayer because in theory, DS Download Play would require fewer engine design sacrifices. The Nintendo DS's cart bus is reportedly slower than the GBA cart bus, requiring all code and assets to be loaded into RAM even on the master side. The DS RAM is much bigger than the GBA RAM, allowing such loading to take place. A broadcast in Ni-Fi is also a heck of a lot faster than a broadcast in the GBA multiplayer protocol, allowing the master to stream assets to the slaves during gameplay as it streams them from its own cart.

<br/>
So in the long run, for titles released after the rushed launch, it comes down to a business decision. Charging double for a 2-player capable version is exactly what I'd expect out of Electronic Arse.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
