    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just dont know anything about DS but here is my question :
<br/>
Can i take my gba code and add fonctionalities, or ds's registers are way differents.
<br/>
Is ds works with mode 0-5, with X backgrounds, X rotations registers, dma etc etc ? I guess VRAM, palette memories are bigger (like 2x).
<br/>
Must i rewrite all my code if i want to switch to ds ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can have the same code run on a DS and GBA, but it's very limited.  Since the systems are completely different, you're better off making a separate GBA and NDS version, unless you need to have a GBA and DS version run from the same cartridge for some reason, such as a GBA Movie Player replacement firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
