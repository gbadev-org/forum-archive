    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody!
<br/>
<br/>
I'v got this little game I'm trying to program, and I just
<br/>
added a Backpack &amp; an Equipment screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I also got Icons to click to toggle those screens (you can also use buttons),
<br/>
this works by changing tileset &amp; map and stream the new tiles into VRAM.
<br/>
(the screens are just tile-maps so I keep the same video mode).
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that if I use a button (ex. push Y) to switch, it works well
<br/>
(in emu and on hardware), with the pen though, the DS freezes (emulator
<br/>
works okay).
<br/>
<br/>
I'v clicked like mad with the button, it works perfectly.
<br/>
If I push the button and just click anywhere on the touchscreen, it freezes too.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I came to the conclusion that I'm doing something bad when
<br/>
the pen gets read but I'm kind of stuck here. I don't even
<br/>
know if the read is made by an interrupt and/or if that takes
<br/>
long time or whet else might crash because of VRAM copies...
<br/>
<br/>
BTW I'm not using DMA copy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone has an idea of what might be crashing the program feel free
<br/>
to share any thoughts :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try making the simplest program you can which uses the touchscreen, and see if that still crashes. If it does, post the code and people can take a look at it.
<br/>
<br/>
Many people have used the touchscreen before without crashing, so my guess is that there is a logical error in your code somewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
