    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In an attempt to completely uninstall devkitpro then reinstall, I deleted all my project files.  I kept everything Dev related in my Devkitpro folder and want to try and recover it.  I have Easy Recovery Pro but the files it bring back are corrupt.  Anyone know how I can get my files back?  I remember some years ago when I had Norton 2003(?), it had a file restore that worked instantly.  Easy Recover Pro takes ages and you have to recover to a different partition than the source.
<br/>
<br/>
Please help!  I don't want to have to rewrite my project just yet.  Also I'll like to have the original source when I do decide to clean up the code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Each time Windows writes to the hard drive, more data gets overwritten.  For the future, make BACKUPS, don't put your code in the devkitpro folder and modify the uninstaller so it doesn't remove files that it didn't put there.  I am sorry for your loss.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So recovering your free software project can be as easy as 1-2-3:
<br/>
<ul><li>Connect to the Internet. </li><li>Download the last source code package of your project from an FTP server. </li><li>Start developing. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
True, but it won't take you nearly as much time to write it again.  You already know what you want to do, how to do it, and have a much higher level of understanding of the code.  You may find that you end up liking your rewrite even better and will see ways of improving it that you may not have seen before.  I wish you the best of luck in recovering your files, but at the same time I hope you'll just go ahead and re-write the program if you can't recover.  It may end up becoming a better piece of software because of this.

<br/>
As long as you remember any long string in the file, you can find it on your drive.  You will probably find the file on the drive 20 times, each revision is often stored separately on disk.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
