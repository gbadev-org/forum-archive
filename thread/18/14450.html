    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just and idea that many have probably had, would it be possible to make a Cell Phone cartridge for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
With the homebrew going in it's current direction, if this could be done the DS would own the iphone (at least in the eyes of the gaming community).  I know there are phones out there that have circuit boards small enough to do this with (cingular has one that a few of the people I work with have that's small enough).
<br/>
<br/>
I hate my cell phone and only want to upgrade to a pda type phone to get better features and programmability, but why spend 300$ when we could just turn the ds into a pda/cell phone?  And I don't really want to carry around 2 devices in my pockets, making the nds a cell phone would eliminate that need.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a question of is this possible???

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yepp. Would be cool, even if it was only GPRS. As far as if it's technicnically possible I see no reason why. If they can plug in a camera using the GBA slot post-launch, it is probably possible to create other more or less intelligent devices. I don't know what kind of power you could get out of it though, so it's possible that you would need an external power-source.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
only cost you $200-$250 to build.

In other words: its not worth it. pay the extra $ and get an iphone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">$200-250 vs. $400+...  I think it would be worth it.  I don't have the knowledge of computer circuits to do this kind of thing and wouldn't really know where to start, i'm just going to school for software development/programming/engineering/whatever...
<br/>
<br/>
Dserial would be cool, but I would rather have this kind of thing fit into the gba cartridge slot (sticking out some is to be expected unless it was able to fold under the ds).
<br/>
<br/>
If someone pointed me in the right direction to make this, I would gladly save my self $150+ and make something better and more useful/effecient than the iphone/pda phones.

I guess you could ask nGage owners.  Wouldn't look quite so dumb if you used a headset, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
