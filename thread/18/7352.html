I've started working LAN-only netplay code into the PC build of the engine I'm working on; hopefully the dswifi API will be sufficiently socket-like for the DS version to reuse the same code.
<br/>
It'll be at least a couple of months before I've done any actual games with it though (as opposed to prototypes).<br/>_________________<br/>"Ever tried? Ever failed? No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better."
