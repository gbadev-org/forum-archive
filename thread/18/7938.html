<br/>
<br/>
I've written a mod player and have been trying to move all code across to the ARM7 processor. I've been trying to access data on the cartridge ROM and it's failing...
<br/>
The method i'm using is this..
<br/>
  1) Get address from gbfs_get_obj in my ARM9 code
<br/>
  2) pass that address to ARM7 using interprocessor communication code
<br/>
  3) try to read a value from that address.
<br/>
  4) check value to ensure it's correct
<br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere that both processors cannot access cartridge rom simultanoesly, but i don't really have a clue how to tell DS which processor has access. I believe it has something to do with WAIT_CR register what i don't know... 
<br/>
<br/>
anyone have any ideas, cheers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

void sysSetCartOwner(BUS_OWNER_ARM7);

This can only be done from the arm9<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
