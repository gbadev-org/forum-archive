    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm wondering how hard it would be to implement the Chishm loader into my File Browser app.  I would really like to use it because it can load from all cards, and I was thinking that you could make a program that could boot an NDS from either SLOT 1 OR SLOT 2 without having to passme over to slot-2, just load the .nds as-is.  Is it possible?<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was looking at Chishm's loader myself, it seems there are only a coupld of files to include. I'm using palib myself, so I have no experience with arm7 (palib takes care of sound, touch screen and wifi) I hope it wont be too hard to do. It seems like a useful feature for your browser to have, I wish you luck.

How compatible is chishm's loader anyway?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using PAlib as well, I want the Chishm loader because it's used in DSOrganize and is compatible with all cards.  Where did you get the source?  If I had the source or library to include, I might be able to get it running.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thats because there are some problems sometimes where the arm7 doesn't always initiate properly. You could try DragonMinded's updated one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
