    <h4>#175049 - pjkemp - Thu Aug 26, 2010 6:22 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using a windows 7 32 bit computer running Cakewalk Sonar Producer. I have installed LoopBE and dsmidiwifi. I have purchased AC-7 pro on my ipad.
<br/>
<br/>
To date I have had no success in getting anything to work.
<br/>
<br/>
The ipad is on the same subnet (wifi) as the the win 7 box. I have tried using the wired connection and a wifi adapter, I have disabled the firewall on the pc, and ensured that my router (linksys wrt610n v1) doesn't have any blocking, filtering, or firewall up.
<br/>
<br/>
A single input and a single output port on LoopBE show up as available midi ports to midi apps on the pc. I have invoked DSMidiWifi from the folder, and from a command line (without any arguments). I can assign the loopbe ports to the dsmidiwifi from the gui.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I get no status from dsmidiwifi when I invoke from the command line.
<br/>
<br/>
I open sonar, add the mackie control surface and assign the Loopbe ports as input and output. I get no response from the ipad, no snapping to position of the faders, updating of the track names. and when I move either the controls in cakewalk (via mouse) or on the ipad there is no repsonse on the ipad or in sonar.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to find some debug options from the command line to no avail...
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help out here?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm desperately trying to make this work with an almost identical setup. Windows 7 64 bit, Sonar 8.5, ipad version of AC-7.  I'm crashing at starting the DSMI server. I get an error that says ERROR INITIALIZING MIDI2UDP and then Could not bind to port 9000.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any ideas? i 've tried with the Loop midi program and the version that is the next step up (trial version). I've also got other input/output options there as a result of the drivers for other IO devices like a AxiomPro controler and an M-Audio Project Mix. Seems like i wouldn't need the Loop program as these would suffice. Thoughts on that question?
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea on how to proceed with the server errors?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,

<br/>
The first thing to try would be to run the DSMI server from the command line. If it's receiving MIDI messages from the iPad, it should output something to the command line. If it does, then the problem is on the MIDI side, i.e. you could try using a different MIDI Loopback software like Maple or a different DAW software like Live, to find out if it's LoopBe1's or Cakewalk's fault.
<br/>
<br/>
If there's no output, the problem is on the network side. Make sure your PC and iPad can see each other (some routers isolate hosts on the network) and that the router properly forwards UDP broadcasts (maybe there's a setting for that, otherweise you could try another router).
<br/>
<br/>
mikerenna:
<br/>
Something on your PC is using port 9000 which is required for the DSMI server to work. Try to eliminate processes that could be using the port.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
