    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am considering using an open source graphing calculator to (sort of) create a graphing calculator for DS which far surpasses the overly expensive TI stuff in speed, capability, input, and screen quality. (Yes, my first big DS code project; I like to come in with a bang... eventually).
<br/>
<br/>
Some searching on Sourceforge.net didn't turn up much, so perhaps you know of something?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not necessarily intending to directly port anything, by the way. I don't think such a task would work very well, and I have very picky opinions on the ultimate graphing calculator.
<br/>
Rather, I would be using the source code as an example to work off of (probably with a good bit of copying and pasting, of corse) since I really am unsure how graphing calculators work at the moment.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just found <a class="postlink" href="http://www.graphcalc.com/" target="_blank">this</a> on a google search, and it looks pretty nice.  The source code is in the downloads section, but coding it for DS will probably take a long time.  Whatever you decide to do, good luck with your project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
From there, I pick a languaje (usually Java or C++) and basically, you just port into whatever you want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">*grrs at Mr. Picklesworth* i was planning on doing the same sorta thing, only starting with a scientific calculator and moving on from there
<br/>
i'd be happy to help out a bit if you need it, i've had ideas on how to implement the buttons and that for a while. just drop me a line if you want any help<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
