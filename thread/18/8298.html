    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get DS2key to work. so far i've bought 2 wireless adapters (the official nintendo one - which i cant get to work and will probably ebay), and the airlink AWLH5025.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to install the airlink two times following <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php#what" target="_blank">http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/wifime.php#what</a> exactly, and both times i get an error message saying that windows cant find the correct driver, even after i point it to the ones i just downloaded.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there something im doing wrong?  Is that airlink card just not compatible (even though it was on the list)?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be much appreciated... i've spent alot of time going nowhere on this one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, manually trying to install the driver got me to having the DS 802.11 in my device manager, with a big yellow questionmark by the card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
