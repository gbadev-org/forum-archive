    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The most recent version of yeti3D supports MD2 model format.  The version I ported to the DS based on the GPLd yeti3D is only configured to use 2D sprites.  I seem to remember MD2 code being in place but #ifdefined out.  The source is fairly easy to read and the yeti site seems to have disapeared (maybe they sold their engine) so there is little info about how to use your own data...maps or models.  Good luck with it.  Sorry I cannot be more help.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
