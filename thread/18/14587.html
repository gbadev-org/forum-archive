Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently having some problems while streaming data from the arm9 to the arm7, and the only problem I can think of is a problem with nesting interrupts, as my streaming method is really simplistic, and I tried 3 differents, with the same results..
<br/>
<br/>
So here are my questions:
<br/>
<br/>
-if I enter in my VBL IRQ handler, but it's taking a long time (more than 1vbl) so another VBL occurs, what happens? does it reenter into the handler or is masques, or even queued for later call?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks, I'm really scratching my hair on that problem...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
