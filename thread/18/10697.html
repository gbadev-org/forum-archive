    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">edit: sorry about this, just realised the reason why it wasn't working - the interrupts are firing correctly everywhere, but my arm7 custom code doesn't communicate the touchscreen status to the arm9 via IPC. at least, i think that's what's happening. cheers!

hi
<br/>
<br/>
i've just started on ds development. i want to get into audio app development on this platform, so i've started off with a simple theramin-type app - drag the stylus around the touchscreen for different tones (using multiple channels of PSG to give the sound a bit more depth):
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://remaincalm.org/theramin.zip" target="_blank">http://remaincalm.org/theramin.zip</a> (please excuse the rough code)
<br/>
<br/>
the theramin bit is doing mostly what i want - but i'm running everything on the arm7. i want to do some stuff on the arm9, but i can't get interrupts to fire there. is it that the vblank interrupt can only be handled by arm7 OR arm9? or am i doing something else wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
if you see any other blunders, please let me know - i haven't coded c/c++ for a couple of years (been stuck in enterprise RAD dev land for a while now)
<br/>
<br/>
cheers,
<br/>
