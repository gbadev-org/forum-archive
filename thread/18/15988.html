    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I got a little processing question here.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, for the game I'm working on, I want to be able to run 2d 256 colors on the bottom screen and use the stylus for the majority of gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is, will it take any extra processing power(aside from when I call the function) to draw to that screen in my main gameloop(in the arm9 of course)?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, while I'm here.  I'm trying to get very large maps in my game and I'm using tiled backgrounds.  So everytime the background updates,  I'm doing 24 memcpy commands to update my map for the tiles.  On a 2d game, with numerous sprites, will this cause any large noticable hiccups in the processing?  I guess it'll largely depend on my game engine itself, but does anyone foresee any really noticeable problems?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like it should work fine. Try doing it and if you run into any walls, post about it and maybe we can give you specific help with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
