AVI is a container format, not a codec.  Ever notice how the "AVI" format has been around since Windows 3.1 and earlier?  Ever wonder why it didnt really seem popular until "DivX" (and derivitives) came along?  People seem to forget what container formats really are.  They still use external encoders/decoders.  WAV format is the same way, however 99% of WAV files are encoded in PCM/ADPCM, so people just think thats all they can do.  Next time you are in sound recorder, check out all the possible formats, including AC3 and MP3 inside of a WAV container.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

Kyoufu Kawa's question sounded to me like "Which codec do I need and where can I get it?

Not to mention that people who actually try to use .wav files produced using ACM codecs will typically get errors such as "Error: Non-PCM WAV files not implemented" in The Games Factory and RPG Maker for PC. Damn those programs for not supporting anything between MIDI and PCM .wav.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Are you talking about this particular am3 codec or something diferent? It would be really cool if actimagine released the player/codec.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
