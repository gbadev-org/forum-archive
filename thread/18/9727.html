Do you have any links to such projects??   I could see communicating via WiFi through a router to a computer then interfaced to something else... but what about peer to peer??   wouldn't that only be possible using nintendo's proprietary peer to peer protocol?

Interesting idea... I've never attempted something like this, chances are it would be a pretty involved circuit... unless there is a good IC package out there to make it easier.  Modem stands for Modulator Demodulator... as I understand it (on the receiver end), it bandpasses different frequencies to register whether a signal is coming through at a certain frequency range or combination of frequency ranges, clocks this signal and converts it back to digital.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi Payk... I am not sure I understand you.   Ok, the "port" i was talking about originally is NOT a port.  I understand that.   
<br/>
<br/>
About the GBA cartridge slot,   I read in the Nintendo DS Wiki that Nintendo intended this to be used as an add-on device port in addition to a GBA cartridge slot.  Perhaps the DS cartridge slot is not intended for this purpose... but maybe it can be used this way with some hacking??</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by TheRain on Sun May 28, 2006 9:41 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <h4>#85361 - DJBlitz - Mon May 29, 2006 12:23 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow I was just about to ask the same thing. . I'm interested in hacking up my DS now since in just a few days I'll be getting a DS Lite to use normally.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow... The power plug on the back of the DS seems to be MORE than just a power plug - it has 4 'pins' (well flat bits actually)
<br/>
<br/>
the power cable itself that plugs into that port has space for 4 of these 'flat pins' but only uses two of them. Also, interestingly - the 2 flat pins &amp; 2 spaces in between them line up exactly with the 4 evenly spaced flat pins on a USB plug - apart from the dimensions of the outer edges of the plug being different, and that little kink in the middle section, it seems to be the same as a USB plug.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the user manual describes the port as a "External Extension Connector" which sounds a lot like "peripheral device" to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Just on a lighter note - My uber-idea was to hack my iPod's USB connector  together with the DS power plug, then write up the code to access it (if its even possible) giving me a self-powering 20gb hard drive for my DS! 
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from being quite useful - it'd look really awesome using a white nano &amp; white DS lite . . . lol. . Cos looks are so much more important! :P (Of course ill be using a blue NDS and a chunky old ipod so it wont look good at all)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...for now I'm just checking out how viable that would be.. and this part about being able to access it through this "external extension connector" is pretty crucial!
<br/>
<br/>
Any comments appreciated..
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and by the way. ..  Hi everyone! Hope to get to know some of ya better and learn a bit of DS dev along the way.

<br/>
<br/>
you're sure?
<br/>
<br/>
i remember my ole gba (classic ;) ) has the same interface... the gba-sp used it for power and (the missing!!! &lt;- my reason not to buy one!) headphone plug adapter. but couldn't it be used for analogue data transfer? i mean instead of sending audio you could send (like the modem stuff you already mentioned) some, well, other stuff? if you had a controller to decode the audio signal as a digital signal (A/D converter) you could build a remote of any kind.
<br/>
<br/>
PLUS: there are games on ngc (like zelda 4 sword or something) where you connect you gba as a controller and additional display... now how you want to burst THAT bubble ;P *don't want to offend anyone*
<br/>
<br/>
i haven't played that game or any other game supporting that feature, but it works for sure. don't know how, though. by the way: if i had that cable i could connect my metroid prime and metroid fusion for some extra stuff... nice idea... i think i'll get that cable ;)
<br/>
<br/>
someone dig into that, may come in handy somethow!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why would they have audio out on the back when they already have a perfectly good headphone plug on the front anyway (and audio in as well)?
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here actually unscrewed there DS and had a look at the circuits?
<br/>
<br/>
If not. .  I might have to take mine apart...see if there are any clues (or maybe there wont be..)  Only 2 more days till DS Lite in aus. anyhow :D
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I was wrong before about it being similar to USB. . it has 6 pins in the back port.
<br/>
<br/>
and yes i realise this is just enough to have power, mic, and headphones.. But i still dont see why theyd add another port that does exactly the same thing (+ power) as the front one.
<br/>
<br/>
Silent Code . .  yeah that does sound interesting. . .  does anyone know what kind of port it connects to on a gamecube? and if it connects via the same 'external extension' port on the DS..... I dont have one unfortunately (the cable or the gamecube)
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
You cant exactly tell from this picture, but the thinner end of this link cable looks about the right size to go into the back of the DS? Its difficult to tell - the diameter of the 'circle' in the plastic cover of the plug is the same width as the metal casing on the end of the plug. . which is how it is with the DS, but rest of the black plastic is much chunkier/wider. . .So this could either mean its a smaller plug (and black circle), or its the same size but with more chunky plastic around it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">WARNING: CRAP FOLLOWING!!!
<br/>
<br/>
that is the standard gba connector for multiplayer. because the nds and the sp use the same powering strategy (one can even use a sp adaptor to power a nds, not?) AND the port is the (visually) same as the gbas (damn, it's 12:25 am and i'm still in university -&gt; no gba at hand) i assume the three of them have the same functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
BUT: i read that it's not possible to play multiplayer games on nds in gba mode the other day (can't remember where, it's damn long ago - i was looking forward to deathmatch in doom on my gba and a nds [that i don't have yet, waiting for lite]). maybe that's because the nds' "port" ISN'T exactly the same as the gbas (and sps). maybe someone else knows why, i don't. just some speculation.
<br/>
<br/>
the gba is connected via a cable to the ngcs controller port and there can be up to 4 gbas or sps connected to the ngc (like in zelda four swords). maybe i can find a pic of that damn thing...
<br/>
<br/>
there is a usb powering cable for sp and nds:
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
a 4 player link cable for gba and sp:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.lik-sang.com/image.php?category=45&amp;products_id=1094&amp;img=gba-link4player" target="_blank">http://www.lik-sang.com/image.php?category=45&amp;products_id=1094&amp;img=gba-link4player</a>
<br/>
<br/>
and finally the gba to ngc cable:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.lik-sang.com/image.php?category=45&amp;products_id=1879&amp;img=gc-gba_cable_port" target="_blank">http://www.lik-sang.com/image.php?category=45&amp;products_id=1879&amp;img=gc-gba_cable_port</a>
<br/>
<br/>
comparing the jacks you can tell they ARE the same... man, these devices share the same cables (gba and sp / sp and nds), so it HAS to be the same. the link kables are always ONLY for gba and sp.
<br/>
<br/>
that's what makes me doubt they are really exactly the same. it may be that the nds just uses the jacks audio and power or even just the power line and the remaining ones are dead.
<br/>
<br/>
why would they do that? they already have that ac adaptor and the cables and jacks developed and manufactured (sp), so why bothering changing things that work and factories are already producing? it's just a question of not soldering some connections...
<br/>
<br/>
i hope i'm not making a total dork of myself with these posts ;)
<br/>
<br/>
someone better find out if my assumptions are crap ;p
<br/>
<br/>
either way: greets 'n Rob out

I was unaware that WiFi could work peer to peer, I thought a router always had to be involved.   The reason I thought that the NDS peer to peer stuff was some proprietary Wifi like technology was because of the special NDS Wifi adaptor you can get for your computer.   If what you say is true, it's either just a standard Wifi adaptor or something that has some software bundled for special NDS game piping or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even then, it's over Ethernet as well.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Say... isn't there 802.11b compatible printers now?

lol about the printer thing... there are even flatscreens that are able to streem from a wifi connection (pc/laptop/wifi hdd...) so you don't have to connect your home theatre to any device to listen to your music or watch your movies...
<br/>
<br/>
you guy think the same as me (the ole crap-o-tella)? tunneling the video output through wifi and displaying stuff on such a tv... hold it! it's BS ;) well, at least the tunneling thing... the tv set is real. e.g. acer has its mediacenter thing (1080i native *lol*)... but these devices all suffer from crap images and high prices. it's not like i have the cash to affort such a thing... i can't even affort a damn nds dev kit...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hey, I would consider it the *easiest* option... best is defined more by what you're intending to do with it.  The good thing about the DSerial through the Passme is that it's been documented and there is example code available.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I am going to etch my own PCB to fit into the NDS slot and then figure out how to access some of the pins through that because, for one, I don't have a Passme... and for two, I may be able to get some parralell communication there instead, or multiple serial lines... or in other words it will be more flexible.   On the negative side, I will have to understand what code like what was coded for the SerialMe is doing at the hardware level.   This may be easier or more difficult than I know. 
<br/>
<br/>
Darkfader has a few different forms of PCB designs for the NDS slot which can be adapted for whatever you want if you know how to work with that.   The dimensions of the slot and pin spacing are also available on his site <a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Using the audio in and out sounds like too much effort and too little gain.   Depending on what you want to do, WiFi may be a good option for you.   For me, it would be a waste of time because I really just want to toy around...  and I've never done anything with WiFi before and don't own any hardware to interface to my circuits.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS to DS multiplayer mode (with up to 15 other players simultaneously) is sadly not adhoc.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the DS'es is the parent DS, acting like an Access Point, and thus running in infrastructure mode. All the other DS'es connect to this parent.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS seems to be very strict in what it can receive. Management frames seem to be no problem. But Data frames need to have the "From DS (Distribution System)" bit enabled, or else the receiving DS will not accept it. This means Ad-Hoc mode is not possible under normal conditions.. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's possible to constantly poll the DS's temporary receive buffer to retrieve _everything_ the DS received from the air, but this method is not very practical.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Small update:
<br/>
<br/>
It seems Ad-Hoc mode <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> possible on DS. I've managed to get it to work just like Infrastructure mode, with these features:
<br/>
<br/>
- Hardware pushes any valid packet (FCS) into the RX ring buffer.
<br/>
- Hardware automatically responds with ACK to data frames addressed to it.
<br/>
- Hardware automatically encrypts/decrypts WEP data frames.
<br/>
<br/>
As for implementing a soft AP on the DS, I guess it would not take too much work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah yes, I'd like a USB port on the back of my DSLite too...
<br/>
<br/>
But, there might be a solution to control the real-world or acquire data (GPS coordinates, for example). The Acekard RPG features a USB port for which the driver is on the DS side (I believe).
<br/>
<br/>
The late DS-XTreme had USB connectivity also, but USB control was on the PC side, for quick download.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably get RPG just to check it out for myself and open up a new dimension to DS homebrewing (so cool, so geekish :) )

did you know the post you replied to is 3.5 years old?

Anyway here's a device you can use to get I/O ports on your DS to connect to outside devices:
