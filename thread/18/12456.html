    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know it is very long time since I did such things, but this weekend I will start to work on it. (sorry, I can only work on it on Friday night, Saturday, Sunday, statutory holidays, and a few other days)
<br/>
<br/>
Someone changed my name on my Nintendo DS last week, and I couldn't use the built-in configuration to change it back because it contained Unicode characters, but I managed to change it back anyways: I had to find the memory addresses and Unicode numbers for the characters I wanted, and then I went to PROGRAMMING MODE to enter the values, and then CONFIGURATION, USER PREF, and save current settings to firmware, and that worked (I checked the value on the Meteos demo).
<br/>
<br/>
In FWNITRO 2.0 I will replace the keyboard entirely with a Unicode keyboard, and I need help some of the Unicode numbers for non-standard Unicode symbols used in Nintendo DS. Some parameters you can enter only ASCII, and in those cases it will go to only ASCII page of the Unicode keyboard. Also the bottom screen will display other thing as well when not keyboard, such as nickname, user-message, DS card title (using language set in user pref), etc. (I will use the BASE POCKET MONSTERS CODE I wrote in another software, to display the Unicode)
<br/>
<br/>
These are the thing I need help:<ul>
<br/>
<li>Unicode numbers for non-standard Unicode symbols
<br/>
</li><li>Reading DS card title
<br/>
</li><li>If I need a different version of devkitpro in case some DS cards doesn't work with my version, but it does work with yours
<br/>
</li><li>Protected settings display (I will try to figure it out myself, but I may need help, as I have never done it before)
<br/>
</li><li>Calibration
<br/>
</li><li>DS download play (when anyone knows how!)
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not alot of help, I know, but the icon and title offset is 32bits at 0x68 in the header, and the data at that offset is described in no$ data here:

<br/>
Using the card read function from the dumper you should be able to get that data easily enough (5x512byte reads, a bit more than the data though).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm going to PM you a modified source with a bit better passme function (supercard would not run things with the original one, M3 doesnt seem to work with either though). Feel free to use it, modification taken from moonshell and conversely chishm's gbamp loader.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think all it would take would be opening up the dump of one of the cards and checking what the difference is between booting that card and booting a regular NDS game cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't see why it wouldn't work as it is, but I don't know how the M3/R4 boot routines work, they must be similar to how a Passcard3 preempts the regular boot process of a NDS, and that should be in the FW code.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully someone here can contribute a method so that FWNitro can boot these new Slot 1 card solutions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm nice to see projects coming back to life. In the latest version of my CreeboMe, most of the popular FAT Slot-2 cards are supported (SCSD,  SCCF, GBAMP, M3CF, and M3SD are confirmed working...). I could help you get more devices supported if you would like. I am also researching into the DS card's title, but I haven't gotten it working yet (I think I'm close though). Also, all you people with Slot-1 cards, doesn't loading it like a normal game card work already? I would think so since there is not room for a passme....

You try what I said yet? Use the proper struct to access the info/logo offset in the in-memory based header and create a struct that follows the guidelines in the link with possibly some dummy bytes, and do 5 512 byte card reads at the offset (if it is 0 there is no game title) into that struct.
<br/>
<br/>
EZV, MK5 both boot fine like game cards, but R4 does not. The slot 1 card loader is quoted as being "quick and dirty, probably should be relocated" in the source, this could be why, or it could be that R4 expects some different state in the DS memory that isn't handled by the current memory clearing routine for slot 1 loading.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it doesn't help, the DS Firmware doesn't use Shift-JIS, it uses normal Unicode (as I typed on the top message, I changed by name using PROGRAMMING MODE with normal Unicode values and it worked, so I know it uses normal Unicode).
<br/>

What I need is the non-standard Uncode characters used in Nintendo DS, such as push A,B,X,Y,L,R buttons, and a few other stuff as well.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
