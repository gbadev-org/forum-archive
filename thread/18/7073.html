    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyone have any music systems developed for it? Or perhaps, maybe a nice mod system? (Something that can probably handle more than S3M?)
<br/>
<br/>
I ask because I am interested in tracking some music for the Nintendo DS. I had my hand at some GBA music development, none of which ever got released commercially.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some demos from my GBA Work:

If you switch to a different instrument based on pitch, you can achieve the same effect. This method is more flexible because a lot of multi-sample instruments I've heard have the problem that they change too drastically between two pitches, causing melodies that go around the change to have notes that stick out like a sore thumb

Spoken like a true programmer. Larger, longer samples give a more realistic, more expressive sound. Why have a sample that can't go longer than 64k? Then you have something that sounds like it's coming from an Amiga. Oh yeah, and voice samples for lyrics in music would also be nice without having to stream through samples. Wait, that could bring an S3M to it's limitation of 99 samples very quickly, as well.

The samples you speak of are done by musicians and sound engineers who don't try to make the sounds seemless. Tell me if one single Piano sample can compensate for an entire Grand Piano. No, you'll get something that sounds like it's coming from a Super Nintendo. Not that that's bad, but for a more realistic sound, you need to swap samples. Granted, it can be done manually, but it's much harder, more complex than simply programming an instrument to do it.

Yet another reason why sample swapping inside instrumentation would be a lot easier. But, that's not the point. The higher the pitch capabilities, the better the support for sound effects.

How about smooth panning with 256 instances of panning rather than 16 with S3M? Longer than 64 rows per pattern? More Patterns? More channels doesn't matter, but it would be nice to be able to produce music on the DS that doesn't sound like it belongs on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I've worked with the S3M, XM, and IT formats for years, and other formats as well. I'm pretty familiar with mostly all of the formats' limitations. I've even worked with them in most cases.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: fixed some quotational stuff
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT #2: Forgot to mention the fact that XM supports 16-bit samples, and ping-pong loops, and..well, needless to say, there's more.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds to me like you should just use something like GSM compression, that way you can make a song using any software you like from a tracker to Reason to full hardware studio gear. Just export the entire song to WAV and convert it to GSM. Ironically the guy you were talking to (Tepples) has written a GBA port of such a sound system that probably wouldn't be too hard to port over to the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The main point isn't to get the biggest and baddest sound system the Nintendo DS has ever seen, but I was simply asking if anyone has developed one with something more than S3M support.
<br/>

The goal is to create something that sounds like it's playing from a Playstation 1 in real time, and not a Super Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, most sound systems on the GBA sucked, which is why all anyone ever got was badly made GBC music with sampled drum instruments. Some companies made it work, like Capcom..but yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I'm not talking about recorded audio.. It's all real-time, just well-designed real-time music, that's all. Sometimes it depends on how good the sound system is, others it's the composer. But S3M can't be the only solution for the DS.

I've made plenty of S3M files with samples larger than 64 KiB. Perhaps it's a Modplug extension, but every PC based S3M player I've tried can handle the 113,500 byte "oh, the thread is locked" voice sample in "Token Whore" (<a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/dwi/tokenho.zip" target="_blank">s3m</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/dwi/tokenho.ogg" target="_blank">ogg</a>).

If you're using lyrics, and you want something less repetitive than the two lyrical tracks in Nintendo's <span style="font-style: italic">WarioWare</span>, then it's probably time to spring for a port of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GSM Player</a>.

<br/>
Say you have a piano with one sample per octave. If you have a melody that straddles a dividing line between octaves, you might get obvious stick-out-like-a-sore-thumb notes as the melody alternates between two samples. It's like singing, but alternating between falsetto and normal voice per syllable. But if you assign separate instruments for different octaves, then you can use one instrument for an entire block of notes even for the occasional note that crosses into the "other" octave. Fudging it can sound better in context.

At least in Modplug Tracker, S3M's volume column has p0 to p64.

<br/>
How long of a song are you trying to make? Are you trying to stuff all of a game's songs into one S3M file? If so, then your playback system probably lacks support for sample sharing. In playback systems that support sample sharing, one S3M can reference another S3M's samples, such as by CRC32 value or by matching filename.

<br/>
If you want music that doesn't sound like it should be on a GBA, then perhaps it's time for streamed music. Given the faster ARM9 CPU in the Nintendo DS, I'd wager that a DS port of GSM Player can comfortably fit into the same 15 percent CPU budget that many commercial GBA games spent on audio mixing. And a two-hour GSM soundtrack at 18 kHz mono (30 kbps) would take only 1/5 of a 512 Mbit DS card.

<br/>
With a 10-bit DAC in the DS hardware, how will that help? Still, S3M supports 16-bit samples, at least on Modplug Tracker/Player.

A lot of PS1 games used streaming music. For example, Technos's <span style="font-style: italic">Geom Cube</span>, Viacom's <span style="font-style: italic">Zoop</span>, and Acclaim's <span style="font-style: italic">Forsaken</span> used Red Book audio.

Konami's <span style="font-style: italic">Dance Dance Revolution</span> used VAG audio, another form of ADPCM, and so do a lot of PS2 games such as the <span style="font-style: italic">Katamari Damacy</span> series.

It sounds like what tssf is after is an Impulse Tracker player. It's quite possible to do on the DS (I've written one myself, but it's commercial), although some of its features are a bit CPU hungry, like duplicate checks, and all the volume levels you can play with. 
<br/>
<br/>
Having dynamic channel allocation with fadeouts and such makes a big difference I think, at least in convenience compared to manually sliding volumes in S3M. Although with only 16 channels, sometimes there aren't enough to go around for all the old fading notes.
<br/>
<br/>
But yes, the DS is a bit RAM limited for mega samples. For lyrics, it may work better to play the instrumental part as a normal tracked song, and stream the voice. That way you can compress the voice a little bit harder without the whole thing sounding like crap.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also been tossing around the idea of doing a Vorbis player for the DS, but I'm a little worried there won't be any CPU left for a game :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

Actually, what I'd REALLY like to do is remake and track some FF7/8/CC music in XM and have it play back on the DS in real time, maybe for a project or a demo that someone may wish to make. I realize that the Impulse Tracker format is far too advanced to be supported easily on the DS, actually that's why I'm not even asking for IT support. ;) New Note Actions, resonant filters and sustain loops would be way too much to ask for. I'd be happy with the features of Fast Tracker, anyway.

Songs like these:

The Chrono Cross stuff is the stuff that particularly interests me.

<br/>
Anyway, A lot of the S3M/XM/IT's made with Modplug are not standard format, modplug tracker has really screwed up these standards giving S3Ms features that it should never have natively supported. A lot of PC players only support them because they have to, but again a lot of them don't have any support for these features at all. When I track, I use the original programs. Impulse Tracker for IT's and S3M's, Fast Tracker for XMs and MODs.

<br/>
Once again, GSM is not what I'm looking for, but anyway.. Yeah.

The GBA Game Pak is a word-addressed storage medium, allowing any byte on the cart to be randomly accessed within 4 CPU cycles. The DS Game Card, on the other hand, is a <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/Block_device" target="_blank">block device</a>, and so is the CF card in the GBA Movie Player. Block devices behave more like disk than like ROM, meaning that you have to load things into RAM before using them. If you rely on the ds.gba format, then be advised that you're relying on something that commercial games cannot use.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

No, it's not too much to ask, especially if you strip out a few features (like the duplicate checks). Envelopes are pretty CPU hungry too (mainly because they cause the volume to be recalculated every tick), but worth it I think.

New note actions do require a dynamic channel allocation system to be set up, but it's not that bad. I'm not sure if sustain loops can be done though. I haven't tried changing the length/loop point while a channel is playing.
<br/>
Resonant filters aren't very practical though :)

On GBA, you had direct access to ROM, so you could play sounds directly from there. You also had to mix everything in software though, so usually player logic had to be pretty simple so as not to slow things down any further than it had to.
<br/>
<br/>
On DS, you don't have direct access to ROM, so you have to load everything into RAM before you can use it. But then you have 16 hardware channels to do all the mixing work for you, so you can spend lots of time on player logic and still use less cycles total than a GBA engine would. 
<br/>
The hardware channels can also play ADPCM data directly, which helps on the RAM usage.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
