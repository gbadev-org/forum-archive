    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm thinking about getting a DS Lite, yet I like the clicky buttons of the phat. Reason why is because my DS is autographed by Charles Martinet and I'd like to preserve his holy chicken scratches.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I haven't seen the insides of the Lite, but is there a possibility of replacing the D-pad and ABXY buttons with the clicky buttons from a Phat? I sincerely doubt it, but it'd be nice to know.<br/>_________________<br/>FW4 White DS with FlashMe v7

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the lite's d-pad is a completely different shape and it's smaller so it wouldn't work. a/b/x/y are the same size so they might work. if the buttons have tabs in behind them (which is likely) it might block them from fitting properly but you could give it a shot. you might be able to switch the pads behind the a/b/x/y buttons which could make them clicky, that's the best i can think of. start/select are definitely out of the question.<br/>_________________<br/>DOT MATRIX WITH STEREO SOUND</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it just depends on how much you really want to mod your lite to get the feel of a phat.. by the time you are done cutting, I doubt you would be able to get the proper feel anyway.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dunno about you, but the face buttons (other than start and select) looked to be all the same size.  I don't have a lite, but if I did, I would certainly crack open my phat again along with the lite and take a look.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
anyways I think the buttons on the phat DS is slightly larger, but I doubt it would fit in a regular DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
