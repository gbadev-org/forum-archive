What you should notice in these pictures is:
<br/>
<br/>
- The DS's model code is NTR, which stands for Nitro
<br/>
- The cartridge connector is shown in one of the images
<br/>
- The DS runs on 3.7 V, according to the battery
<br/>
- The original DS looks pretty good in that beige-white colour
<br/>
- Looks like the dev unit loads games in via the AGB slot
<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering which dev company let Cube-Europe see their dev hardware, I bet Ninty would like to know :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well that's the same amount for the GBA SP. You would have to recharge the battery once a day before it would go out, and even then it would have lasted about a year and a half. So no worries. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking at the pic of the board on the back, that small IC on the bottom left -- is that the CGB chip that's in the GBA as well?  I don't have a pic handy of the GBA board, but I was just wondering if anyone knew...
<br/>
<br/>
So far, it's been disappointing that there hasn't been any mention of GB/CGB compatibility in the DS -- since they have the GBA cart slot anyway, and that the 4 sound channels from the GB are used in the GBA, it would seem to make sense that GB/CGB compatibility would come along for the ride.

I think the CGB stuff could be emulated fairly easily, but it will not be a selling point for the DS.  If it is trivial for them to include from the business end, I think they will do it.

Actually, from a business stand point, it is better NOT to include that feature. Otherwise, competitors can claim that this is in fact the new GameBoy, and if the DS goes downhill, all will be over in the portable market. Nintendo has stated firmly that all GameBoys will be completely backwards compatible, and the DS doesn't. But allowing the DS to play GBA games is also a good part of their strategy as it lets those who never did get around to buying a GBA play those games and also play the new DS games as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It won't. I guess it saves them some money by not having to embed a Z80 processor into the ARM7TDMI which people rarely use anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know if I would say rarely -- sure, I play more GBA games than GB/CGB games, but that backwards compatibility was a big factor in purchasing my original GBA on launch as opposed to waiting for a better game selection.  I still play some GB games regularly -- Mario's Picross is what I currently have in my SP.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as saving money goes, I would agree except that they already use the sound portion of the CGB chip in GBA mode.  Unless Nintendo is going to go through the trouble of designing a new chip just for the 4 sound channels, or re-desigining the GBA chip to include those channels, or moving the sound channels to the DS chip instead, that chip will be there.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't see how re-designing a chip that already exists is gonna save them money -- unless, they put it into the DS chip instead.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be willing to wager that the DS will have the CGB chip -- but, if it's enabled as a CGB or not is anyone's guess.  I just hope that it is :)<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
