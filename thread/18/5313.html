    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i don't remember where did I read this, but could a irq handler of the arm7 be in the arm7 bios? it could make no sense if we could put our own irq handler into ram an a pointer in 0x03FFFFFC which we can modify. I read a long time ago that nintendo pretended 'closing' arm7 for homebrewn development programming a bios and using it as a fixed library, but now this makes no sense. I guess that if there is an irq handler in the bios is for making ds programming easier. What do you think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
