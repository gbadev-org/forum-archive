    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm considering switching from EFSlib to NitroFS, for handling the extra assets of my games embedded into my homebrews.
<br/>
<br/>
First, I thought that NitroFS required the linker to be ARGV compatible, forcing either to use a compatible firmware, or HBmenu. If it was the case, that would still prevent my homebrews from running on older, not-updated linkers. 
<br/>
<br/>
But then I stumbled upon this page: <a href="http://blea.ch/wiki/index.php/Talk:Nitrofs#Finding_filename_for_nitroFSInit.28.29" target="_blank">http://blea.ch/wiki/index.php/Talk:Nitrofs#Finding_filename_for_nitroFSInit.28.29</a>
<br/>
<br/>
where the original author of NitroFS had made a generic function to locate automatically the ROM we are currently running. My question is: does DevkitARM use this function, in case no filename was passed through ARGV? In that case, I suppose it works on any linker, it's just slower to init? (because it scans every rom?)
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your reply!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK, it doesn't a function like that, and it shouldn't cause its a waste of time. nitroFS/libfilesystem works on the homebrewmenu and on any flashcard that supports homebrew, any flashcard that doesn't pass argv yet should be pursued to support it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your reply and the link. I'll think about it, even if the fact that users may need an extra loader to run my games is not exactly the most user-friendly solution I could imagine. Not everybody is a geek I'm afraid... ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I understand the technical needs for all this, but I think that adding a card scanning process in case people don't or can't use HBmenu, would be a nice backup solution (I heard for example that HBmenu doesn't work on R6 Gold).
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers

Card scanning isn't a solution, it causes problems.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
