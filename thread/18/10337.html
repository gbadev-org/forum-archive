    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well you know how that tim guy created the WMB program for PCI and the laptop card. Well I was thinking about writeing a USB version driver. Since the only usb version not compatible with the driver is the RT2570 chipset usb. So if I write a driver for a USB 2500 wifi stick. And I combine it with a wireless controller. Then I could have a wireless controller for the Nintendo DS. Now my only other question is is where I'm going to find a wireless usb input controller. And when I mean usb, I mean that the usb stick has to go into the controller. If anyone finds me one could you tell me. The first person will be givin a usb stick along with the controller and my driver before I realease it public.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, so that way the Nintendo DS reads the driver from the controller and you'll be able to download the sofware after that, then as mentioned somewhere, you could download a demo after using the demo that u used in the ds download play. WHat I'm still working on is that when you download the 802.11 wireless chipset from any wireless usb controller, then it will save to ethir the main system so that way you don't have to keep on downloading it, or if it goes onto a flashcart and be able to just read it from the flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If that's what he wants...sounds pretty odd to me. That's why I didn't understand at first, I didn't think anyone would want to do that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
