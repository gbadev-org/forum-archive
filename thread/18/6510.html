    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I compile using the new chain and the playSound example it compiles fine, but when I try to run it there is no sound at all.  I also have the same problem with the game I'm working on.  It compiles but doesn't deliver the sound at all.  Help please!  Oh and the sound example by doublec works fine.  But it's a different makefile/setup than the templates used by nds.

the examples from 04 work.  Now I just need to figure out why mine don't! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
