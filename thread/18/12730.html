    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It will cost you money. No way around it. A decent amount. $40-50 for an R4 Slot1 + $10 for a 1gb microsd card. There might be better deals if you search.

<br/>
If you're really hard on cash, a DS as an mp3 alternative is not for you.

<a href="http://www.frys.com" target="_blank">www.frys.com</a> has an Emprex mp3 player for $10. Then buy an SD card for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Prior to this, I used the GBA GSM Player as my primary music source.  While not mp3 quality, it was good enough for the noisy situations I used it in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As compared to the 128kbit songs from itunes? people are already used to listening to degraded (compared to original CD) audio.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In theory, 32768 Hz is all you need. A 32768 Hz sample sequence can reproduce frequencies from DC to 16383 Hz, and for adult listeners and typical music signals, the energy in 8192-15000 Hz will mask anything in 16384-22049 Hz.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I thought that hiss came from the sampling frequency. You learn new things everyday.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, aren't you annoyed by it? I seriously am - after I noticed it the first time I couldn't overhear it anymore. It's like a bad Vietnam memory that's always coming back ;) .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hehehe, I guess I'm not an audiophile, since I find stuff on my DS sounds just fine when played with a nice pair of headphones :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
