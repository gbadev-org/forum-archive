I'm sure that if we all put a little $5 dollars towards the cause every now and then, we would surely be able to support some real research. And encourage newcomers and floating members to do so aswell.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The idea of a team pooling resources would be great. Those who have done this before could help. But come to think of it, RE'ing the DS looks like a nightmare. It has (correct me if I'm wrong) 2 screens, 2 CPU's, and I'm thinking those 2 CPU's can work together at the same time(correct me if I'm wrong again), just like the dual screens.

There are four or five possible DS code entry points to RE.
<br/>
1: The DS cart interface. (possibly encrypted)
<br/>
2: The Wifi multiboot interface. (definitely encrypted)
<br/>
3: The GBA cart interface. (unlikely that DS code can be loaded from this interface)
<br/>
4: The BIOS. (if the BIOS is external, like in the GC. Most likely encrypted)

5: The SDRAM bus. (60-70 data, address and control lines, horror, horror...)

From the pics of the DS on the net, there is no link port. It has been removed. So multibooting is most likely out of the picture. Probably if the GBA Wireless Adapter is similar to the DS's WiFi or Nintendo Wireless protocol, then it would be a lot easier to RE since we would have a headstart on it.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
