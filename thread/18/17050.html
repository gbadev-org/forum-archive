    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
Is is possible to use the "DS download play" functionality in homebrew?
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen examples of DS-to-DS homebrew code, but the code has to run on both DSs from the start, and is not downloaded.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a homebrew example of "download play" anywhere?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's a thread you may wish to look into:  <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11946" target="_blank">WMB host for the DS</a>.  Unfortunately this was before DLDI came about, so there's only support for some of the oldest slot-2 devices.  I could never get it to send the "test.nds" file on my card, though it did succeed in sending the built-in test program.  This requires that the recipient has FlashMe installed, due to the RSA security issue that others have mentioned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
:)
<br/>
<br/>
I perhaps will start working on this project again, now that time is less scarce and such.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for just up and vanishing in the middle of the project!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, first sorry for bumping a month old thread, but I was wondering does anyone think its possible to figure out how use the RSA? Would be nice to run homebrew on my DSi by sending it from my DS Lite with out needing a new flashcart that will be disabled next firmware update.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">mattw, the only way to run homebrew via WMB on DSi or a NoFlashMe DS is with a second-stage loader exploit. It's impossible for us to sign WMB binaries. <a href="http://dsibrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_Zone#Exploits" target="_blank">http://dsibrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_Zone#Exploits</a> My exploit currently isn't Nintendo Zone compatible for bootstrapping, however I can't test it on DSi at all yet. I'm not interested in redistributing the 1MB JP DS Station binary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yea thats what I figured well hopefully you or someone else can figure out how to exploit it someday. Thanks anyway and good luck on your project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
