    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I want to cap the sum of the loudest possible sample (software) and the loudest volume on the DS (hardware slider) to something that won't hurt the ears.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how to achieve this! Can someone explain?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think what you ask is feasible. What hurts the ears is entirely dependent on whose ears are to be hurt or not hurt, and what is plugged into the headphone jack.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm.. True. I suppose I could set up a configuration screen where you hear the loudest sound possible, so you can set the limit yourself. 
<br/>
<br/>
But isn't there some standard in the world of music? Like how do <span style="font-weight: bold">they</span> decide what the limit is? They, being Apple, Sony, Creat!ve.. etc.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS's volume output is so low that I wouldn't really worry about that.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also the problem that how loud something is depends on what frequency the sound is.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Firon on Wed Dec 13, 2006 8:07 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the speakers volume is capped very low, but if you plug in earphones, some sounds can disturb your hearing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In France there is a limit on the volume a device for headphone produces (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.avrev.com/news/0306/29.ipods.shtml" target="_blank">here</a> is an example). There have been MP3 players that have had there amplifiers limited for EU models (search around <a href="http://www.dapreview.net/" target="_blank">http://www.dapreview.net/</a>) because of this. I do not know what the headphone output of French DSs is.
<br/>
<br/>
As for a hardware fix, find the maximum that you are comfortable with then cut a match stick to stop the volume slider moving any further and gaffer tape it to your DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The limit is 100dB, though, or something to that extent. That is much higher than what the DS can output.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Correct me if I'm wrong,but 100db isn't far off a jumbo skimming your fringe!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, how loud that can be depends on the impedance of your headphones, and the actual volume of the music itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
