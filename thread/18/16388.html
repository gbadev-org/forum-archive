    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, it's been a while since I've done DS dev but I've started a new project and all I need to do is make a GUI.
<br/>
<br/>
The program is a calculator and I have made png images (with their respected .grit counterparts) of things like pi, cos, sin, tan, +, - etc. So that when the user presses the cos button on the touch screen the respected image is appended to the current equation at the top. So...
<br/>
<br/>
user presses 4
<br/>
<br/>
equation reads 4
<br/>
<br/>
user presses cos
<br/>
<br/>
equation reads 4cos (an image of "4" followed by an image of "cos")
<br/>
<br/>
user presses the pi button
<br/>
<br/>
equation reads 4cospi (an image of "4" followed by an image of "cos" followed by the pi symbol)
<br/>
<br/>
and so on and so forth.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to make all the numbers, functions, and other math symbols into sprites since they won't be doing anything, all they will be doing is sitting there in the same space.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there an easy way to copy the pixels from the image into either one of the DS's screens without the complex management of the OAM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your images align on 8 pixel boundaries, sounds like tiles are an easy solution to this.  I'm new to DS development so there may be a better way but I can say for sure that the tile approach will work because that's the approach I've used for something pretty similar.<br/>_________________<br/>It's not an illusion, it just looks like one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
