    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds" target="_blank">Various updates to the wiki</a>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>I've added some information on the Wireless MultiBoot protocol, the wireless basics, and packet capture formats. 
<br/>
</li><li>The Timers page has also been updated with some introductory information. 
<br/>
</li><li>Chishm has put up some information on how to display things on the screen borders in GBA Mode. 
<br/>
</li><li>Various other small additions, corrections, and tweaks.
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
I am still looking for people to contribute to anything to the wiki.  Down to earth explanations of hardware are especially welcome (i.e. sort of like what I was trying with the timers page).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Reading through these updates, starting with the WMB section. Nice work BTW. Pointing out any mistakes I find...
<br/>
<br/>
"the signature is a 128 byte public key and an 8 byte SHA-1 message digest over the NDS header"
<br/>
Is the signature really 128 <span style="font-style: italic">bytes</span>? I always thought it was bits. Or am I confusing signature and key?
<br/>
<br/>
In the data packet (type 0x04) format table, it doesn't explain xx and yy. I imagine they represent the data itself, but why yy?
<br/>
<br/>
In the GBA section:
<br/>
"Interestingly (but not unique to the DS, I found this on my GBA also)..."
<br/>
should be written passive:
<br/>
"...not unique to the DS, this also occurrs on GBA)"
<br/>
<br/>
That's all I noticed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yeah, xx and yy don't specify anything in particular, it's payload data.  I don't remember why I used xx and yy, maybe to indicate that it was varying (but not ignored) data, instead of the typical x meaning don't care / high-Z.
<br/>
<br/>
The signature block of the RSA frame is 136 bytes.  I don't know the exact meaning of the data in there, since there isn't much point in figuring it out.  This is the same data that firefly puts at offset totalRomSize in re-assembled .nds files, and DarkFader mentioned it was a SHA-1 hash or digest (don't remember), but someone probably knows more about it and could tell me or stick the info up there.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
