    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want one sound.  That's all.  I also want to be able to change the properties of this sound constantly.  So, as there appears to be no FIFO/IPC tutorials around anymore that work (can't find one that doesn't have a banner reading "Does not work under latest Devkitpro" at the top) I simply went into my ARM7 source and made the getFreeSoundChannel(); command always return zero.  It works fine, as far as I can tell, and the volume works.  But the sound resets every single time I run the playSound(); function, making a noise like an angle grinder.  I've flicked through the ARM7 source and the includes and have found nothing that looks like it resets the sound position.  Is it hardcoded into a library somewhere?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cuyb10fzdz2" target="_blank">Strummer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">Drummer?</a>.

Or maybe you would rather play with sand? <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?a05z5wmdvxm" target="_blank">Sandscape is for you in that case.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
