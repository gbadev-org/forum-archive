I'm in the UK too, so may wait, may import (customs &amp; delivery will eat up any savings made on the exchange rate).
<br/>
<br/>
It's often $1 == ?1 rather than 'exchange rate + a bit' so don't be surprised at a ?149.99 UK launch price (which is a bit on the expensive side).

Thinking about it, I'll need a killer app or the ability to program for it before I get onboard I think...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ditto.  I'm looking at ~$200 for a "killer app" and a unit.  I figure more for a unit and a 'hobby dev kit'.

Unfortunately Australia is considered to be part of Europe by alot of game / hardware companies.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand why Australia gets every Nintendo console far later than the rest of the world, manufacturing demands are high for better countries, so we have to wait for more to be made.
<br/>
<br/>
Rumors are Aus may have to wait until APRIL 2005!!! for the DS, and I say that sucks, but lucky I have a visa and a link to lik-sang :-)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
