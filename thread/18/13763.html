    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it has nothing to do with that... i think it ruined the whole scene, when somebody says he is going to make a program everybody says it is a fake :( we are really making one and trying to release an alpha as soon as possible!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About Gnirfleo: Yeah, it kinda cracked the scene a bit, even DM complained about it.
