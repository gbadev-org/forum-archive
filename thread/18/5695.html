<br/>
PhoenixRising &amp; Lynx keyboard demo maybe?

Use at your own risk :)

"Ripped from photographs" sounds like he took pictures, either his own or someone else's, then used thos to create the graphics.  If that is indeed what he did, then the work is his own, not ripped from others'.  Sounds honorable enough.  In my opinion, that statement was made a little hastily, whether or not it's valid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">mymateo is probably right. It does look like an original drawing of a QWERTY keyboard. And if you want one at 12-pixel pitch rather than 16-pixel pitch, <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/keyboard.png" target="_blank">I've made my own as well</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the graphics <span style="font-style: italic">were</span> ripped from Pictochat, meaning they were taken from others work, even though I did make them by hand from photographs. I did expect a few comments like that from G-Pjube. The point of it is for developers to have the official DS font and Pictochat keyboard for use in their own applications. This can be modified to suit your own tastes. Someone may find it useful for re-writing a custom Pictochat chat software or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree, there is more honor in making one's own work, but being honourable was not my intention. This is to help DS dev'rs make cooler apps. I may make my own custom keyboard a bit later.
<br/>
<br/>
Those other keyboards look cool guys, I may make a new keyboard with the MS-DOS or Amiga font using the Pictochat layout.
<br/>
<br/>
Hows the keyboard program going Lynx? Maybe you could make it skinnable? :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, it's Phoenix Rising that's doind the real coding, I just made the keyboards.  and it will be "skinnable" as I believe it will need to be able to handle other languages and layouts as well.

But it would require a little cut &amp; paste to create a usable set of tiles.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well Spin, I'm impressed by what I finally can see. Fortunately, there's a distinct difference between screenshots (even if faked by hand, which you did very well) and actual font glyph graphics, which I did.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have three images, one is the full icon set as seen in your image #8, the second is mostly 32-127 and a load of symbols, and the third is an adaption that resembles the DOS codepage a lot, including a load of glyphs not found on the DS, most notably the double-ended arrows and the vertical double-end arrow with base. And the thick arrows are ABLR buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
If Filb wants either one of them, the PictoChat symbols and/or the DOS Adaption Set... just ask.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Funny how minds think alike, I was going to do a DOS char set as well but in the Pictochat style keyboard layout.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by headspin on Thu May 19, 2005 7:17 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
