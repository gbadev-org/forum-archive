<br/>
<br/>
I just got my first DS program running, and stubled upon an interesting problem, namely the textures.
<br/>
<br/>
I was porting one of my old demo effects to DS and would have liked to use 128x64 R5G5BA1 texture. Instead of the right texture I got the first half rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise and duplicated twice. The texture was in an contiguous array of uin16s allocated by new. Everything was fine if I used a square texture.
<br/>
<br/>
My questions are:
<br/>
<ul>Does anyone know the memory layout of the textures (rgb, paletted, etc)?
<br/>
Are non-square textures supported?
<br/>
I was porting the effect from opengl, so is it true that the S and T texture coordinates are flipped too?</ul>
<br/>
I also noticed strange color shift in my textures. The texture is black and white, and it looked like the other side of some antialised edges were more red-ish and other sides were more green-ish. I was wondering if this is some known interpolation issue or is my data just miss aligned or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
