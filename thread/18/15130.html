    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Under the FAT file system, what would you want to do with chmod? The only bit that has the same meaning on UNIX (where chmod came from) and DOS/Windows (where FAT came from) is the user-writable bit.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you trying to play with the hidden and system bits? I know the customized gba_nds_fat used by DSOrganize can play with those.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you give an example? Do you mean that if you make a directory on the DS inside another directory made on the DS, it'll fail?

I do a recursive directory-building thing in Q2 and that seems to work...
