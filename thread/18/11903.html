There is a GNU compiler version of it, but apparently this is more of a front-end than an actual compiler...
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like a nice language, but whether it's suitable for the DS I'm not sure...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's probably a pipe dream, but does anyone have any thoughts on this?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is a fantastic language, and only really held back by not having the ubiquity of C++ or Java.  I'd been working in it before I started programming for the DS and having to come back to deaing with C++ was quite painful.
<br/>
<br/>
Though I suspect that OOPMan is right about garbage collection being a problem (since most DS programs will be time-critical things like games), I believe I remember that you can disable it.  In which case you're back to having to manage memory as in C++, but retain the other benefits.  You may also be able to tweak your program to avoid any allocation during the critical loops, as the collection only occurs when you allocate an object.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

rRootage and Noiz2sa have been ported all over the place since they're in C, but his later games written using D are even more amazing.  It'd be great to have them on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Though they do use SDL for some things and the DS implementation of SDL is pretty incomplete isn't it?

Still, a big "yea!" to the idea of D on the DS from me even though I've never used it myself.

<br/>
<br/>
D is now past version 1 and the GNU D front-end is following rather nicely in its footsteps...
<br/>
<br/>
So, I decided to do a search on the D mailing lists for "ARM"
<br/>
<br/>
Guess what?
<br/>
<br/>
People <span style="font-weight: bold">have</span> been working on getting the GDC front-end working with the ARM back-end of the GCC.
<br/>
<br/>
In particular <a class="postlink" href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/archives/digitalmars/D/gdc_nokia_arm-_-gnueabi_46720.html" target="_blank">this</a> psot and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/archives/D/gnu/994.html" target="_blank">this</a> post are of particular interest.
<br/>
<br/>
So far people have been able to get D playing nicely with ARMs and at least one person has made an attempt to port GDC to devkitARM.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this is pretty good news and it looks pretty possible that we could get D working on the DS in the near future.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to do some more looking into this over the weekend, but I'm not a compiler monkey of note, so I'll probably have limited success...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

To me this really only seems like a problem during loading since most games tend to not allocate any memory whilst running. And in at least J2ME you can do a garbage collection thingie whenever you want to, so when you've loaded all your game resources and are ready to go into game you can just garbage collect before the loading screen close down.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just an update for anyone who doesn't keep an eye on the devkitARM mailing list over at SourceForge.
<br/>
<br/>
I have succeeded in cross-compiling GDC 0.22 (The GNU D Compiler front-end) into the devkitARM toolchain.
<br/>
<br/>
The process is easy enough and hence it is pretty much possible to program in D.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there are still some things that need to be done...
<br/>
<br/>
I still need to finish getting libphobos to compile. This will require a bit of work, as libphobos is more difficult to cross-compile than the base compiler front-end (No surprise...)...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably going to look into getting the alternative runtime libraries (Tango and Ares) to compile.
<br/>
<br/>
libphobos is probably going to require some modifications anyway, since a lot of the existing stuff in it is not of use to DS developers and it would be nice to reduce it's linked in size from 600kb to something a little more space concious.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm going to need to go through the libnds (And maybe libgba, if anyone wants to use D on the GBA) headers in order to create skeleton D modules definitions. These are needed in order to allow people to use libnds within D programs (Something I think people will appreciate :-)
<br/>

At the moment I'm fairly busy, so progress and activity is somewhat slow and I haven't had much time to look at libphobos this week.
<br/>
<br/>
With regards to an SVN, that's a good idea. If arm-eabi-gdc gets integrated into the standard devkitARM distribution it'll probably end up in the devkitPro repositry. If a 
<br/>
separate one proves necessary, then I may well make use of Google code though :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try and post something on my blog as a stopgap. At the moment the measures necessary to get GDC compiled into DKA are extremely easy, so that shouldn't be too hard to do...
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you or anyone else is keen to help, then any time spent examining libphobos and developing ideas with regards to how to get it to compile nicely would be welcome.<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Anyway, with any luck we can get D included in the standard DKA build scripts, as the process of integrating it isn't really that hard, overall :-)
<br/>
<br/>
On my own front, I've been rather busy of late and haven't had much chance to look into getting libphobos working, which is a little sad.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, at the moment, the configure script included with libphobos refuses to play nicely with DKA, so I'm thinking of putting together a custom makefile (Based on the original makefile created for use with DMD) to get libphobos compiled. There are still a few stumbling blocks, though, and it looks like libphobos itself will need to be pruned somewhat in order for it to be useful.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I still haven't gotten around to getting the libnds headers done up for use with D :-(<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

No, I think that the best route may be to take a gander at stripping Phobos down (I'd like to keep GC, Threading (Which I think may be necessary for GC anyway...) and a few other useful components.
