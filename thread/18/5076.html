sure, I'll have to figure a bit of stuff out but I'll try to figure it out this weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
Recently I've actually been looking into ways to better integrate GBA dev stuff with Xcode and haven't found positive things yet. Xcode has some neat features but to use it seems to makes some pretty strong assumptions about your target platform, mainly it being Mac OS X. Anyway, that stuff is separate from a devkitARM package.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From what I can tell to get menu options like "Show source code" to enable the source needs to be added to the "Sources" of the appropriate build target or for full auto-complete support to work the headers need to be added to the right target too. Also, while you can select what version number of GCC to use (within limits) there doesn't seem to be any real support for selecting custom versions of GCC for other platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
Goggling I saw that some Palm OS developers bitching about the same problems trying to get GCC to do what they want for building palm apps.

<br/>

Because with the molasses speed of Bochs, [exaggeration]you could cook a burger while waiting for the compile to finish[/exaggeration]. Flip enough burgers at a fast food joint and you have 300 USD, which is enough to buy your own x86 Linux box at walmart.com.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm offended that you imply I could not cook a burger that quickly.

Bochs is glacial, not the speed of molasses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could use bochs as a temporary dev platform until Devkit arm is built For OS X. And the speed of bochs depends on how fast your computer is.
<br/>
If your running it on, lets say.. a 400mhz processor of couse it'll be slow(around 40mhz emulation speed).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
