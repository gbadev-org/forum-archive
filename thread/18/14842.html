anything is greatly useful for me thank you :)<br/>_________________<br/>Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, you cannot use OpenGL for the Nintendo DS, but you can use videoGL, which is a somewhat OpenGL-alike library. But it's not OpenGL, and normal OpenGL tutorials will teach lots of things that won't work with videoGL. A lot of the OpenGL-function calls does not exist in VideoGL. IMO it's important to know this difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there's quite a lot of examples that come with devkitARM that you can look at to see how to use videoGL. The headers are pretty much the documentation, though. And when it comes to OpenGL, there's a lot of documentation out there.

<br/>
<br/>
As allready mentioned the 3D library included with libnds is neither complete nor standard as far as openGL goes but any openGL tutorial should get you on your way to 3D coding on the DS.

They teach bad coding-practices (like close to no error-checking), outdated methods, often either no or misleading explanations etc. But I think the biggest problem is that it doesn't actually teach you anything, it just gives your recipes for particular effects, instead of telling you where to go to get a deeper understanding. People tend to go back and back to the same place to be spoon-fed, and get stuck doing only the things that are taught in the tutorials. As for better tutorials, well, I'm not a big fan of the whole tutorial-way of learning, especially for complex things like OpenGL. But OpenGL.org has a large tutorial database to pick from, and the nvidia and ATI developer pages usually have good stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I would personally recommend a combination of an OpenGL book and reading the specification. You'd be surprised how many things does not work the way they seem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I bought the OpenGL "red book" (from Dave Shreiner, Mason Woo et al)
<br/>
several years ago. Besides being detailed and clear, it provides a wealth
<br/>
of information, documenting about everything you could fiddle with in GL.
<br/>
<br/>
IMHO this book is far sufficient as a basis for <span style="font-style: italic">learning</span> OpenGL.
<br/>
Once you get things sorted and understand the way it works, you
<br/>
can safely go read any tutorial you want to achieve a given effect.
<br/>
<br/>
I refer to it as often as i need. ie for everything i code OpenGL wise.
<br/>
And if the 4$ investment doesn't appeal to you, there's an online version :

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's not really a lot of information that's going to be available that's not from homebrew sources.  Once you learn how to program OpenGL you can take what you've learnt and then figure out how the graphics hardware in the DS differs from the standard OpenGL model.
<br/>
For me, the biggest differences have been the lack of Z-buffer manipulation, the funny polygon ID thing and the lack of floating-point inputs. As well as that the numbers only have a limited range which you need to be aware of.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
