    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi there!
<br/>
<br/>
this question has surely been answered in the past, but could someone give me a tip or two on how to integrate the devkit arm compiler for nds into devc++ (5, well the last release... 4.9.x)? i have tried it on my own, but couldn't get it to work. would be enough if someone posted a link to a thread...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! I've attempted this in the past but in the end...
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that Dev C++ likes to generate it's own makefiles and handle all toochains by itself, whereas devkitarm has it's own special makefile vodoo which should not be overridden.  The main difference is in the creation process of an NDS binary and the process of creating an win32 binary. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think it is possible to fully integrate devkitarm into dev c++ but once a new version of devkitarm would be released i suspect you'd have to start all over again.
<br/>
<br/>
But that's talking about "full" integration where dev cpp is actually aware of everything and compiles the files itself.
<br/>
<br/>
If you just wish to use it as an editor that works just fine!
<br/>
But you will have to make two custom tool macros, one to run  "make" in the project path and one to run the nds file through an emulator or simply launch it over wifime.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason to why you need a run macro is because the standard file-extension of a binary is hardcoded as ".exe" in dev cpp. I haven't found a way to change this. 
<br/>
<br/>
And to be honest with you, you won't get what you're expecting. Dev cpp's editor is actually a pain, the syntax error checking usually hangs up after a while and I remember having to restart dev-cpp once every 30 minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
So I'd personally recommend programmers notepad 2 which is bundeled with devkitarm. It might not look much of an "IDE" at first sight, but it has a very flexible framework which allows you to practically turn it into anything you'd like.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://manifested.ath.cx" target="_blank">http://manifested.ath.cx</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've changed from msvs to devcpp years ago and i'm quite comfortable with it. but till now i had to use it as an editor for my nds stuff and compile it via dosbox. that sucks. so i want to set up the devkit arm gcc compiler as a compiler set and use it for my nds... there's also an option to select a custom makefile. the problem is that it's kionda tricky to set the compiler up! damn it! maybe i'll have to try again myself...
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, thanks for the respose!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
