    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
I would like to know if it is possible to make a homebrews which could allow us to play "lan game" with people from the internet (playing online).
<br/>
<br/>
U know like on gamecube: mario kart can be played with 8 players with gamecube in lan. (example of software for gamecube: <a href="http://cubeonline.warppipe.com/" target="_blank">http://cubeonline.warppipe.com/</a> )
<br/>
<br/>
Imagine game like resident evil being played online ? :D
<br/>
But I don't know if its possible to make something like that (by using only a homebrews to do that), so I would like to know if it is possible to make something like that ?
<br/>
<br/>
thank in advance
