    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I have been watching this forum a little, and it looks interesting to program for NDS.
<br/>
So, I wanted to know if annyone can point me to some pre-reading on C++ and topics neded to program for NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
I have been programming in:
<br/>
HTML(Advanced)
<br/>
PHP(Advanced)
<br/>
C#(Basic)
<br/>
GML(Advanced++)
<br/>
<br/>
So, if annyone can point me to some books or online tutorials for me to read on, becouse i tried those NDS tutorials, but they where too hard for me :P
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">More specifically, and I'm surprised Tepples doesn't mention this, but the GBA FAQ link in his sig has a lot of good resources that'll help you get started.
<br/>
<br/>
Although there are some differences, for all practical purposes the NDS is a superset of the GBA, so all of the principles you learn on the GBA will apply to NDS coding.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But if you allready did GML (GameMakerLanguage?) you can probably use the PA_libs without much effort. I only knew HTML, PHP/SQL, C(basic) when I started using them, and after a few hours I could allready do some need things :D<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.picfront.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">www.picfront.com [ Upload your pictures ]</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GML = GameMaker Language, you got that right ^^
<br/>
I was rather good at GML, I used it for 4 years I think, and i could use DLL's andm ake MMORPG's with it.
<br/>
I'll check out the site and the PA_libs(Dunno what they are tough, but they sound like some lib.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
