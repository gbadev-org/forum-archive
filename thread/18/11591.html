    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I just got my passcard3 in today and got some simple stuff to compile and run on my DS using devkitPRO, so I know everything works right. I want to be able to mess around with the touchscreen and work with the two processors and things properly, but I find swimming through tutorials to be a bit tedious. Is there a reference site of sorts that simply lists all the things the DS can do and briefly explains how do do it? (OK, not all the things, just all the things we know at this point.)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, although I\'m sure the ndslibrary is an awesome package of stuff, I have no idea (1) how to use the stuff in it, (2) what all is in it in the first place, and (3) how the stuff works. A help file of sorts would be usefull here, but I can\'t seem to find it. Is this kind of info on the homepage? If so, what is that link? (I got the library through the devkit updater.)
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is a bunch to ask for, but I feel like I\'m having to re-learn everything that I knew from the GBA world. Not to mention that I have to jump from batch files to make files, seeing as how I can\'t get the batch files to work at all. Stupid windows environment variables... Oh well, makefiles are better anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I figured out  bunch so far, and got some bizzare stuff to compile. Anywho, I guess what I really need is an instruction manual for libnds\". (Which I misspelled earlier, very sorry about that.) I understand that it has a lot of stuff built in, but dont know what all is there.

You can click on the ds tutorials link to go to my own tutorials or you can click on the ds icon on the left and follow the link to a few more tutors including Pataters doc which is a pretty good read.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
