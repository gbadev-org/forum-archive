    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, i have a DS ready for homebrew and an USB wifi stick configured as an access point ... but i don't own any Nintendo game that does AP detection/configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
Any one of you know of a homebrew program that i could use to run WiFi tests, AP selection, pick channel/ssid, etc?
<br/>
<br/>
The only immediate use would be to run tetattDS homebrew game, but i'd love to integrate that debug-over-wifi library in my code too ^_^<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could try the wifi lib test program from sgstair. Also I don't think that the tetatDS server is working. I have tried for the last couple of days to connect and I just error out. It is a very addicting game I might ad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

missed the obvious. Indeed, it has AP. selection, DNS tests and all the features i wanted ... either i'll include that or i'll just save the settings on a file to reuse them in my app ...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
