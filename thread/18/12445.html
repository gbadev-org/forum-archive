    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I've been using C++ for a while and I wanted to try my hand at DS development. I knew this site was good for GBA and DS development, so I came here. I found the topic with tutorials, and used the first one on the list, which was the one the topic creator recommended. I opened it and started reading, and it came to installing necessary software. I got to this point:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">1. Simply download the latest source from
<br/>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=151608" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=151608</a>
<br/>
2. Extract it to $DEVKITPRO /libnds.
<br/>
mkdir $DEVKITPRO/libnds
<br/>
mv libnds-src-*.tar $DEVKITPRO/libnds/
<br/>
cd $DEVKITPRO/libnds
<br/>
tar -xvjf libnds-src-*.tar.bz2 $DEVKITPRO/libnds
<br/>
3. Change your current directory to $DEVKITPRO /libnds and type make.
<br/>
cd $DEVKITPRO/libnds
<br/>
make
<br/>
4. If DevkitARM is installed properly, libnds will compile in a matter of seconds and youâ€™ll
<br/>
be on your way to developing software for the Nintendo DS.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Got some of it done, I think.
<br/>
<br/>
I now have:
<br/>
C:\$DEVKITPRO\libnds with with .tar.bz2 file, and the following folders:
<br/>
build - contains empty arm7 and arm9 folders
<br/>
include - has some headers and folders with more headers
<br/>
lib - empty
<br/>
source - contains arm7, arm9 and common folders with some files in each.
<br/>
<br/>
Still not done... and would appreciate help.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

PS. I hope you don't mind such a newbie question, but I didn't see anything against posting this in the rules topic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I did use DevkitPRO updater to install ARM, but I'm not sure if I installed LibNDS. I, erm, didn't read everything, but checked off the whole list (DevkitARM, PPC, PSP, etc) so would it have installed it already? If so... I feel like an idiot. &gt;_&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Well, I'm officially an idiot. Apparently I already had it installed. Thanks for the help. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
