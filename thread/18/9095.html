    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an idea for a DS game (no, I'm not telling :-p) that I think would sell pretty well. Problem is I don't know how I'd go about becoming an official DS developer. Nintendo doesn't even give devkits to newbies and they cost thousands anyway. I figure I could sell it to a third party or something but I really have no experience there. The game pretty much needs a touch screen and microphone, so it'd have to be for DS. Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

O rly? Don't most Windows Mobile devices have a touch screen and microphone? Develop and sell the game for Windows Mobile, and then you might be able to convince a publisher to authorize a DS port.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You could send them the ARM9 and ARM7 binaries and they could use the official tools to build it into a ROM compatible with their equipment. However, you'll run into problems with this, due to Nintendo forcing everyone to use a common ARM7 binary that is probably not compatible with the Devkitpro version.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I mean to sell the game on your own DS cards without a license.

Sony has the PS Family logo, which is roughly equivalent in strength to the Nintendo seal.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
-- You know, the human.

Hmhm ok there are tools to capture the entiry display i think. With another tool u could splittout that parts which belongs to NDS-Displays.
<br/>
And then u could pitch the speed to that speed the nds runs ur rom.
<br/>
And another hind: Sega could buy ur game. Go to sega.com they have sometimes jobs and they allways searching for games...
<br/>
So if u send ur video to there they perhaps invite u to work for them or they could buy ur project. But it realy has to be bugfree and awsome in one or other way. I think even Tales of Daguar (which seems to be best homebrew for now) would have no chnace i think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

An old friend of mine got his start in the industry on the Nintendo platforms, he and his employees had no prior professional experience in the game industry.  They got their license without issue.

Sony does not just <span style="font-style: italic">give</span> a devkit to anyone, you must be licensed first and foremost, and can apply for the devkits only after approval.  They're not free either.  They also have similarly stringent licensee requirements (compared to Nintendo).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not hard to find or make a program that would capture only the game being displayed on an emulator, but no DS emulator I know of really works that well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
