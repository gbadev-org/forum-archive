<br/>
if you want to view paletted instead of mono)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to use the same gfx and gfxID for
<br/>
2 sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
The other is seperate.
<br/>
<br/>
Also,
<br/>
when I try to move the sprite,(during init)
<br/>
it won't move.
<br/>
<br/>
The left and right sprites are
<br/>
supposed to be the bats.(64x64)
<br/>
The other is supposed to be the ball.(32x32)
<br/>
<br/>
(VRAM E and D are for main and sub sprites, A and C for main and sub
<br/>
backgrounds, B for LCD(screenshots))

<br/>
Does the difference between the SpriteGfxIDs
<br/>
matter?(Or how does it work?)
<br/>
<br/>
Does a bigger/smaller difference mean
<br/>
more and less space?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I disabled the sub screen sprites and sprite mapping,
<br/>
but that didn't do anything.
<br/>
<br/>
When I singled-out every sprite,(made only one sprite
<br/>
init and display, and repeat for the others)
<br/>
it worked fine.
<br/>
Except,
<br/>
for the ball.(<a class="postlink" href="http://members.iglide.net/ticeandsons/yellowstar/screenshot_ball.bmp" target="_blank">screenshot</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
Also,
<br/>
when I only display the bats,(with and without the same gfxIDs)
<br/>
only the right bat is displayed.(second sprite)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Somehow I have this feeling that whenever there's a problem, the first thing you do is post about it here. Asking for help on these forums is ok, but rather do that after no other means have proven helpful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have found and fixed one problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Here,
<br/>
I had the 32x32 ball sprite size wrong.(64)
<br/>
<br/>
Now,
<br/>
it seems only the last initiated sprite
<br/>
is displayed.
<br/>
(So, when I displayed all the sprites,
<br/>
only the ball was displayed.)
<br/>
(I have tested this,
<br/>
and that's correct.)
<br/>
(Only the last initiated sprite being
<br/>
displayed.)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>
<br/>
I have updated the source.
<br/>
<br/>
The ball's sprite ID
<br/>
was the same as the second bat.
<br/>
I fixed that,
<br/>
but nothing happened.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have updated the source.
<br/>
<br/>
I have found and fixed another bug.
<br/>
<br/>
All the lines with spriteEntry[0]
<br/>
were supposed to have ID for the index.
<br/>
<br/>
But,
<br/>
I'm still having problems.
<br/>
<br/>
All the sprites are displayed
<br/>
this time.
<br/>
<br/>
But,
<br/>
there is white pixels displayed,(and some gone)
<br/>
that shouldn't be.

All I had to do was up the ball's sprite gfxID to 128.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
