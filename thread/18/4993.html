Definitely don't use anything C++ specific.  It can be wrapped without overhead if needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Clear names should be preferred over short ones.  In well-written programs, a small portion of the code involves direct register access, and that work is hidden by a higher level interface.
<br/>
<br/>
IO_ is not as good as REG_ because it's a needless deviation from convention.  Also, "IO" is slightly ambiguous because it sometimes means actual keypad input and graphical/audio output, as opposed to accessing hardware outside the logical CPU and memory map (e.g. DMA, timers).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I voted for IO_ but while reading the whole topic I have some thougts:
<br/>
-Begin with a C library then a C++ wrapper
<br/>
-Use REG_ as the GBA, will made simpler.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If input is done through registers, REG_ is appropriate.
<br/>
<br/>
The choice of naming conventions for memory areas is a seperate issue.  Names like BG_VRAM and OAM seem ok, but prefixing them with MEM_ might be good since #defines don't obey namespace rules.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmm.... I voted for io:: because really namespaces are a far superior way of doing things, but I know that even the idea of learning c++ scares the crap out of a lot of homebrewers for some reason.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I'm not trying to start a C vs C++ war due to naming conventions in a library which I assume is imaginary right now anyway. Anyone who likes a certain naming convention will make there own libraries with that convention, and I will write my own and wrap them up all nicely and type-safely etc. with C++.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
