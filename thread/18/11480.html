    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As the subject reads, I'm trying to figure out if there's a common way that you can tell if someone has traced a graphic? Basically, I want to know if someone traces any object, like a letter or shape, something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
The only way I could think of is by writing a library that captures some user input, that defines what a "good" trace is, and writing some coordinates to a file in order to store the information. Which is my second question, could I do this on the DS, or would I have to create the files in advance, and compile them into the rom?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how do I move one image in front or in back of another? I'm currently using PALib to handle graphics, but I don't mind using the NDS library. I tried swapping the sprite numbers, but it never works.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm not a guru here, but as far as i know, most "drawing recognition" programs tries to fit the pixels on a line which is constructed from the previous points. As long as you can find a straight line which is at most <span style="font-style: italic">k</span> pixels away from the furthest pixel, you'll go on with that line, otherwise, you just enqueue the segment you add and start with a fresh segment using the last two values.
<br/>
<br/>
You might want to run a similar algorithm for curves fitting too, so that you can recognize round shapes by another mean than just looking at a bunch of disorganized tiny segments.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
