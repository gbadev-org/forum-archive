    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just noticed a strange bug when running some code from the MK3 : the X and Y buttons take like 2 seconds to update (either going on or off). 
<br/>
Has anyone noticed this before ?? My code works perfectly well if I flash the rom directly on a EZFlash or Neoflash cart, and works on Supercard... 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas ?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit : just noticed that my stylus updates every 2 seconds two...
<br/>
<br/>
Edit 2 : changed 2 bits of code around in the IRQ init and it worked, not sure why... but at least it works, lol<br/>_________________<br/>PAlib official forum : <a class="postlink" href="http://www.palib.info" target="_blank">http://www.palib.info</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">haha there are many strange things like that. at our project mousearrow jumps on my hardware at releasing stylus...but on other devices not...hope that its not because of a touchscreen error...hehe no on my sisters ds is same thing so its a sc sd thing i think... perhaps just with my inputcode... But why all flashcards ahve different bugs? i mean they dont patch rom, and they just copy that arm codes to cpu ?!?!?!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Payk - because they all deal with memory clearing differently when launching homebrew, and there are likely remnants in the memory from the menus they use after launching that could cause problems. Make sure you are initializing the hardware too just in case that helps, something like "POWER_CR = POWER_ALL_2D;" (note that this swaps screens as a side effect) or similar.
<br/>
<br/>
Mollusk: I suspect the MK2/3 menu is the culprit, not certain but I suspect that the ARM7 isnt getting handed off to the code correctly (or is perhaps substituted entirely in the case of homebrew) - which menu version are you using to load the homebrew? Some versions did not handle the touch code very well, but I think that was fixed in menu 0.5.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was trying versions .4 and .5, same thing... (.4 seems weird because everything starts blinking in the menu when I have too many files on my SD :S)<br/>_________________<br/>PAlib official forum : <a class="postlink" href="http://www.palib.info" target="_blank">http://www.palib.info</a>
