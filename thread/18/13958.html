    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By the looking of those errors, it seems the example was made for r20, but it tried compiling against an older version: 
<br/>
<br/>
- glInit() is new in r20
<br/>
- glClearColor gained an extra parameter
<br/>
- glClearPolyID is a new function that allows you to set the polyID of the whole buffer to enable antialiasing against the background
<br/>
- glFlush() now has a new parameter so you can enable/disable w-buffering and translucent polygon auto-sorting.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure you installed the newest version on the same location as the previous one? Check your environment variables and see if they are pointing to the correct folders. Also, for sanity reasons, check if libnds is really up to date (go on the include files and confirm the changes I listed above).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

r20 is a toolchain version number. None of these changes were toolchain related.
<br/>
<br/>
devkitARM comes with several libraries which relate to the various platforms it supports. These have separate version numbers.

The devkitPro installer <span style="font-weight: bold">should</span> update everything to the latest versions when you use the update option in the devkitPro start menu.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any more trouble give me a shout.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the middle of sorting out r21 right now but I may roll a new libnds and examples tarball before I release the new toolchain.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
