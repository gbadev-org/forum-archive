    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
Need some help getting the new 3 in 1 + to work with the DS browser. I have patched the browser... and is still doesn`t work, using it unpatched doesn`t work. I patched the browser for my SC and thats fine.
<br/>
<br/>
But can`t get the 3 in 1 to work! Can anyone help? Using it with the R4 ultra.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn`t think what i was asking was wrong. Considering i own the browser.  The barcode number on the box is 45496 46348. I just didn`t want to keep swaping the offical mem pack out with the 3 in 1 all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
