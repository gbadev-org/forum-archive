    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I want to get info about progress on DS dev. 
<br/>
<br/>
I’m programming in C/C++, and I had game concept. Right now it was developed in C++ and WinAPI for testing, and I want to port it to DS, so I have some questions:
<br/>
1) are we able to use DS at full speed?
<br/>
2) is there any way to run sound at this moment?
<br/>
3) homebrew developing on DS is similar to GBA homebrew development?
<br/>
4) are we able to use touchpad and all buttons?
<br/>
5) what about graphics memory access? – can we do same thing like linear array in 13h mode or with DIB in WinAPI?
<br/>
6) is there sense to do a port right now?
<br/>
7) which emulator use for tests to get most possibility of working on real hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
I’m looking at this forum for some time, but I didn’t get those information ;)<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
5: do some research and read the docs that have been written. it's not really like graphics programming on the PC (except some of the 3d api is like openGL, and there is a framebuffer mode which is like a framebuffer mode on the PC)
<br/>
6: if you're up to it, yes
<br/>
7: none of them, they are still all alpha quality. If you have a DS and a gba flash cart, you can dev on your ds with an investment of 20-30$ (by buying a passme or a compatible wifi card...read the relevant info on the forums)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
