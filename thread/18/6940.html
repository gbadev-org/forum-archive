    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all.
<br/>
<br/>
Seeing as the Yeti engine has all but vanished from the net and the official website is no longer online, its been an impossible task to track down any development tools for it.
<br/>
<br/>
dovoto did a DS port of the Yeti engine and it screams along, its a shame that there is no active DS or GBA development for the engine happening anywhere. The engine needs some work on its texture mapping and collision detection/ control, but it shows some great promise. 
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me in the direction of some working links to download the editor and other related Yeti tools? I have tools that need compiling, but i've never done this before.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to do some level editing and see what its capable of.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm after the Temple demos and the editor/ tools. (compiled of course)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks ecurtz, that would be great.
<br/>
I've done so much googling for it and i just cant find it. Many downloads are linked to the now offline "theteahouse" page while i've found some through small fan sites.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the best I've found is a Yeti3DGPL folder from Nov 2003 which has an editor folder in it with source. I don't have any idea if that's the final released stuff or not, but let me know if you want it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seeing as both Yeti3D and the DS port are offline (or discontinued) it may not be the best choice for development. If you are having problems just finding the file, it is doubtful anyone will be able to provide any support. You'd probably be better off with the version of OpenGL they are using in the 3D demos that come with NDSLIB. Is there a particular reason you need the Yeti3D?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To be honest, i'm really eager to get some of my art and levels running on the DS in any form i can. Dovotos port of Yeti is promising and would be fun to tinker with.
<br/>
<br/>
There is not much happening engine-wise on the DS, Heritic and Hexen have both been pushed aside, which really is a shame and frustrates me greatly. I'm having to turn to tinkering with the Yeti engine untill i get some help with DoomDS. I think there is alot to learn from Yeti that could be put to good use in other projects, including the previously mentioned ports. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've come accross a working level editor for Yeti and I'm hoping to work with it a little and see what it can do. Ill post anything of interest.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone wanting to help out is of course welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
Ecurtz, is that the version 1 that had open gl support?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too want more yeti info... I think its a great engine on the GBA and DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted a version that supported slopes but I think that it is only in the Pro version that you needed to buy... unless anyone has manually added it to their gpl version since?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeti is a great and powerful 3D engine, especialy for systems with no hardware acceleration.  But...
<br/>
<br/>
It is not particularly well suited for the DS.  The reason for this is also the reason it is so fast.  It breaks large polygons down to smaller cliped polys.  This has the effect or reducing overdraw for the system to nearly (or perhaps entirely) zero.  Since it only has to draw each pixle once it needs no zbuffer, and it has great performance.  The reason this is not such a good thing on the DS is because of the DS's low poly threshold.  
<br/>
<br/>
A bit of testing with the supplied level puts the poly count for the level to as much as 1200 polys on screen with an average above 800.  Even looking strait into a solid wall has supprisingly high poly counts.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not acceptable for DS hardware limitations.  But for just getting your art into a walk through demo it might serve the purpose.  In the end i think you will be forced to begin any 3D engine for the DS from scratch.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
