    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This should be relatively easy.  Set up a dual timer system much like any other music playing code, but use it for the mic and the speakers at once.  On the faster timer, you should be firing a record event and filling the current back buffer.  On the slower timer, you should be firing a swap so that you play back the just recorded sample, and giving the mic a new bank to record to.  This is very similar to double buffering video, and should be doable on the arm7 by itself.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.
