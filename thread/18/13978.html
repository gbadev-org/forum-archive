<br/>
<br/>
I've had my DS for almost a week now, and I have quickly discovered an interest in developing my own applications for it.
<br/>
<br/>
I have found some tutorials and got a pretty basic 3D car game working, which went surprisingly easy with <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=151608" target="_blank">libnds</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'd really appreciate some basic tutorials to get started with network programming (I want to create games for local network play, not Internet applications).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch in advance.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/4064/1184503265197kz4.gif" target="_blank">hi2u</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DS-to-DS connections in DS homebrew still need an access point due to a limitation of dswifi. First get your PC talking to another PC on the same network. Then get your DS talking to your PC. Then get one DS talking to another DS on the same access point.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
