    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What do you think? 
<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong. videoGL is on top of my favorite things about libnds... it introduced us to OpenGL on DS development (something that, IIRC, the official N tools doesn't even have :| ). And, for the most part, it does wonderfully.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, although videoGL follows in many aspects the OpenGL standard, it's not a close match to it. Matrix handling, textures, lights, (some) color mappings, and the many extra functionality that the DS has that OpenGL does not. Again, this is not bad; it's just not-compliant OpenGL.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm basically thinking is that, if we can provide developers with an externally linkable OpenGL library, ***in addition to videoGL, not replacing it***, it should make things easier to understand for us devvers that know enough of OpenGL to feel comfortable using it. I know it would for me. Do you?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ooh, I'm in two minds about this!
<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand I'd say no, people are gonna eventually have to move their stuff over to the 'real' GL solution (ie using fixed-point, special data types etc). That means loads of work is gonna have to be put into devloping a library which will eventually be redundant. When people realise they should be using the faster solution, the compliant GL will stop being developed and will get code rot etc...
<br/>
<br/>
But on the flip side, a proper GL would be great for me as porting code would be oh so much easier!
<br/>
<br/>
Where's the 'I'd vote for both' option?!
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I was about to make a poll (about something else) - if I add one now it looks like I'm gonna be copying you!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would say do one of two things (or both :) ...
<br/>
<br/>
1/ put your effort into helping to improve videoGL.
<br/>
<br/>
2/ create a true replacement, _if_ it can be done with more compatibility and only minimal additional overhead.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd avoid co-existing APIs as you'll split effort and knowledge between the two camps.  Worse still, the terminology is shared causing problems in terms of documentation and community help.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that if you work on option 1 then you'll be able to establish the viability of option 2.  Maybe you have already?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying don't do it (although it may sound like it), I'm saying try your best not to divide the community.  Keep the project low-key until it's ready to fully replace, and avoid any long period of co-existence.
<br/>
<br/>
Other things that would help,
<br/>
<br/>
- More tutorials and examples to help those used to compliant GL get used to videoGL.
<br/>
<br/>
- A code analyser (to run on the to-be-ported compliant code) that points out likely porting issues.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) GL is a floating point standard.  A subset of ES might be okay
<br/>
2) GL has about a billion things in it, much of which the DS has no hardware support for. The cpu/memory bus is not equiped to make up for much of it in software.
<br/>
3) I wrote the gl wrapper to make starting out on DS familiar but I would hate to see libnds have its hands tied by a standard which is out of sync with the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
I do agree much could be added with minimal overhead to make the library more open gl compliant and just plain better (the stuff gbabear is doing for instance is great).  
<br/>
<br/>
There is much room for improvement in the library but the DS cpu is just too slow and memory too tight to make too many sacrifies in efficiency for the sake of a complient opengl wrapper.
<br/>
<br/>
As to a higher level 3D library that is probably not going to be a goal of libnds.  Perhaps we will see more third party library contributions which will fill these gaps (PAlib for instance although I would prefer it if were packaged as an addon instead of a replacement for libnds)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The main problem with videogl.h seems to be that functions that are named with the gl prefix don't always work exactly like OpenGL functions. I purpose the following solution:
<br/>
<br/>
Break the videogl library across:
<br/>
<ul>dsgl.h - OpenGLish interface to the DS's native 3D engine. <ul>* functions that aren't gl compatible are prefixed dsgl
<br/>
* only functions that work exactly like they should in the OpenGL 1.0 spec will receive the gl prefix
<br/>
* all functions will still TRY to conform to their OpenGL counterparts
<br/>
* this file will be 100% inlined</ul>gl.h - partial OpenGL; contains gl commmands that aren't DS friendly (most of them)<ul>* all functions in this file will conform to the OpenGL 1.0 spec
<br/>
* any gl function that doesn't map perfectly to the DS that can be reasonably done should be here.
<br/>
* may contain large bits of nasty code</ul>
<br/>
</ul>This way gl functions that are implemented should work exactly like you expect. The dsgl.h file will be included with nds.h the same way videoGL.h is currently included, but the gl.h will have to be included explicitly. Not including gl.h by default will keep people from accidentally using non-optimal implementations.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, and making it OpenGL-compliant to a degree where you won't have boat-loads of forum-threads like "HELP! MY glBegin(GL_POLYGON) CODE DOESNT WORK", "IS GL_ARB_SHADOW_MAPPING ON DS BROKEN" etc is way too much work.

your opengl implementation could be a good way for prototyping, but final "products" (not speaking of commercial items) should be build ontop a very thin library layer that is very close to the hardware. that's my opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
speaking of function prefixes: it's damn right that naming stuff according to opengls names is a bit off. using it's naming conventios is ok, though. it's overkill to set up all those functions with lots of "unused" parameters, just to artificially make it look like opengl, although these functions work differently and need different (and mostly less) data.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bad news, guys. I just dropped work on my initial attempt to OpenGL compatibility code.
<br/>
<br/>
I just recently realized what everything has been telling me all this time: a standards-compliant OpenGL layer would not be useful with the current 3D hardware in the DS. The device, simultaneously, does AND does **not** do many things I didn't imagine at first. Alpha-per-vertex, spotlights, matrix querying, stencil/accum buffers, direct framebuffer access, these among the things it does not do. Polygon IDs, per-primitive antialiasing, cel-animation, shininess table, translucent primitives, automatic depth sorting, and I'm sure ***many more***, are among the ones that it does.
<br/>
<br/>
My current knowledge of OpenGL simply can't cope with the differences. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to assume that, as of now, videoGL functions, even if they have the same name as some GL functions, they do **not** have the same effect as their counterpart GL ones. However, they do A LOT MORE than OpenGL can do, so it's probably better to stick to what libnds offers us for the time being.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if somebody else is actually interested on continuing the project, I posted a .zip containing the source code of what I was working on until today (april 13, 2007) at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.costarricense.cr/pagina/izhido/Data/libGL.13.apr.2007.zip" target="_blank">http://www.costarricense.cr/pagina/izhido/Data/libGL.13.apr.2007.zip</a>.
<br/>
No strings attached. Take it &amp; use it for what you need (or want). It **should** work; a copy of the hello.c GLUT program (from the Red Book) is included, if you want to test it.

<br/>
Thinks like the hard cap on the number of polygons you can draw and the horribly limited numeric ranges for things like vertex coordinates means that hardly any pre-existing OpenGL programs stand a chance in hell of running on the DS without a lot of work.  Given that you have to do a lot of work anyway - the effort level to deal with the non-standard things is almost negligable.

Don't know how people here are generally dealing their project development but it's always easiest in the long run to get things working also on the source / compiler platform.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Desktop OpenGL is a nightmare to write a fast (hardware accelerated) standards compliant implementation of.
<br/>
<br/>
But maybe a non-standards compliant OpenGL ES work-a-like would be a bit more attainable. As Izhido says, the DS is missing some features which are required for compliance, but if the user doesn't try to use them, then it may be good enough.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://aaiiee.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://aaiiee.wordpress.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There already exists such a workalike: videoGL, part of libnds. It got **a lot** better since I started working on my lib... maybe you should check it out :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
