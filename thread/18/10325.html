<br/>
<br/>
Like many others popping up, I use Datel's Max Media Player to launch homebrew apps and work on my own projects.  The device works great with the Chrism FAT library, but I had to do a bit of extra fudging to get the drivers working etc.  The driver I'm using was listed as one of the "Third Party" drivers in the latest Moon or Rein shell (I forgot which I nabbed it from :D).
<br/>
<br/>
The current Chrism library does not support MMP out of the box, and this severely limits the amount of homebrew apps MMP users can sink their teeth into.  I feel the MMP has become a formidable homebrew platform worthy of this sort of compatibility by all our devs.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think?  What is a good first step to take here?

If you'll notice, he has already done this in the next version of libfat (currently in ALPHA):

You are the second person to ask this, after he made that thread. (well, I think so at least, I didn't compare the exact post times)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Easier said than done. Since MoonShell doesn't write to the disc, the manufacturers don't add write support to the drivers. Also, they are often fragile in that they need to be initialised in a certain order otherwise bad things happen (eg SC SD breaking the SC CF support in gba_nds_fat). This isn't really acceptable for a library that should be usable "out of the box".<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
