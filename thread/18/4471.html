    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't gotten mine, but even if I could, I don't think I would be in a mad rush to get any games. The DS launch isn't what I would like it to be as many of the "good" games I do want don't come out until next year.

Ugghh... more waiting. :(<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Overall, I am very happy with my DS, and excited about the future of the sytem. That's not to say I like everything about, though... the dearth of good launch titles for one(1 Nintendo title, 1 Sega title, and a few other boring games). Also, I'm not quite at home with the feel of the DS unit in your hand...it needs more curve. It's just not designed to fit your hand comfortably. The fact that you have to power-cycle the DS to switch between functions and Pictochat's lack of things like a line tool are just minor nitpicks. Like I said, I love the little thing, but the overly flat and thin unit is going to be a real bugger when I start playing more games on it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
