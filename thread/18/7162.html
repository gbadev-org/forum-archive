    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello....i just purchased a SUPERCARD SD and a SUPER PASSME.  I have a 64MB sd card inside the gba supercard sd.  I downloaded a .nds file, which is supposedly patched for the supercard...it has a file extension .nds.dsi...but i can't see it when i start the nintendo ds....so i changed the filename to .nds.gba as i saw on this site.....and then a countdown begins when i select it...i think it's being "flashed"...after the countdown stops, the screen goes black, but the ds stays on...
<br/>
<br/>
i  then turn off the ds, and turn it back on..nothing happens...the file then countsdown....if i have the passme inserted with a nintendo ds original game inserted in it..the screen goes white whenever i turn on the ds, and it just stays white.  doesnt matter which game i use, (i have nintendogs, metroid demo, meteos, and supermario 64) the screen just goes white...is my passme broken?
<br/>
<br/>
can someone please give me step by step directions  on what to do..i am completely lost.  i purchased the ds after it launched, so i think it must be able to play backups with the supercard devices...PLS HELP...I TRIED SEARCHING EVERYWHERE, BUT I CAN'T PIECE IT TOGETHER.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Uhh, thats the problem right there. AFAIK, there is no homebrew that requires patching.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any homebrew that needs to access the CF card of a GBAMP will need to be patched to run on a SuperCard, an M3, or anything but a GBAMP. I don't know of an appropriate patcher yet.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I'm using a SuperCard SD with the WifiMe method, and I can run homebrew by :
<br/>
<br/>
-having my Supercard flashed to the latest firmware V1.50
<br/>
-renaming .ds.gba to .gba.nds (not the other way around)
<br/>
-copying it to the SD card (windows copy, not using the SuperCard appl)
<br/>
- WifiMe procedure (try PassMe procedure here ?)
<br/>
- then the upper screen lists the file .gba.nds, the lower screen has a SuperCard logo on it
<br/>
- press A to launch the homebrew
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...
