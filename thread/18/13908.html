    <h4>#137438 - relpats_eht - Sat Aug 11, 2007 9:13 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone name any project (it doesn't have to be for the DS, as long as I can access the source) which uses a tile-based GUI? Due to memory restrictions, my only GUI option is tiled and, although I am about half way through making my own, I find the whole thing exceedingly boring for some odd reason. I would much prefer to work on the actual game instead.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I stuck grinding out this particular task, or can anyone point me to a place where this wheel has already been invented?<br/>_________________<br/>- relpats_eht</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I mean a GUI that builds its entire output--widgets and all--by constructing a map of indices to much smaller images of the same size (preferably 8x8). Basically, a GUI that could run in a text background (or maybe rotation) on the DS. I am unfamiliar with old DOS and UNIX applications, but that could be what I am looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
I am using banks A-D for textures, so I only have H and I for the sub-screen where the GUI is located. 46kb really wouldn't suit well for a bitmaped graphics mode as far as I know.<br/>_________________<br/>- relpats_eht</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You might want to look at how <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/dx/RAC" target="_blank">RAC</a> draws its text and the file selector. It uses a 16-color tile map, with tiles numbered 0 to 767 (or 0 to 599 when the same library is used on a GBA), to simulate a bitmap within a 32 KiB VRAM bank. The technique is explained in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=122297#122297" target="_blank">this post</a> and a few that follow. If you need further explanation of how it works, I'll be glad to help.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That seems interesting and I will likely read into it, however, the more I think about it the more it seems to me that this post, as is just about every other I have made, has merely been an excuse for my own laziness. I think I'll just force myself to finish the half finished GUI I already have.<br/>_________________<br/>- relpats_eht</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could try coding a point and click GUI Editor and have it generate all of the images/etc for you, that'd make it a bit less tedious, and probably easier to update the GUI in the future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
