Dualis runs <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" target="_blank">LOCKJAW</a> fine, but it crashes on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/dx/RAC" target="_blank">RAC</a> with some sort of "unimplemented instruction: unaligned R15" as soon as libfat tries to find the file system. It also wraps instead of clipping when the sound volume exceeds full scale, causing the snare drums to sound way too loud momentarily.
<br/>
<br/>
NO$GBA freeware version appears to run both correctly, but RAC hangs for a few seconds while searching for a file system, and the emulated DS turns off (which is correct, as Mr. Resetti explains) because it finds neither a writable file system nor a 2 Mbit flash save. Can anybody help me set these up?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

LJ doesn't. RAC does. But I don't seem to get any sound in either, no matter how I set "load default ARM7 binary".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm also interested in this.  I'm trying to work with libfat and cannot get the code that works on my DS to work on any emulators.  I run into the same issues tepples mentioned.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm no expert on how emulators operate but it strikes me that perhaps the formatting of the Hard Drive on which the emulator is operating might have some impact?  I use NTFS so I'm wondering if setting up a FAT partition would help.  I'd be interested in knowing if anyone else has experience on a FAT HD before going through that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a filesystem scheme which works on NO$GBA? 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to start a homebrew project which should stray as less as possible from the coding practices used by licensed developers, so I'd like to use a filesystem for loading models and textures and be able to test the project on emulators as much as possible (NO$GBA is the only one which runs my prototype correctly).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
