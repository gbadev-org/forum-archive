Anywho, that settles it. I am going to get to work this week (provided I can find the time) and get the wifi network working. I'll post back if I have any real success. I realize that the real bulk of the work will come about in rendering the pages, but it seems useless to me to render pages that are offline, so I plan on concentrating on getting my networking stuff happy first.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, my rendering engine is going to be last. I figure support for the "a" tag is of primary concern, simply because it's most important for enabling simple pages to work. I plan to focus on primarily functionality over prettiness, so images and other things will be dealt with as they become necessary. My main goal is to make gbadev accessible through the DS. If I can make that work early on, I think the rest will follow, even if you can't see the images at first. (I can get by images by displaying their alternate text if available, and their filename-path if not availavle.)
<br/>
<br/>
I am going to first work out the details of Wi-Fi, and then focus on downloading a page's HTML through the DS and saving it to the memory card, at which point I can borrow DSOrganize's HTML rendering and have a go at the page. I'll focus on the rest from there.

Well I've done myself in this time I guess... I'm using PAlib by the way, since it looks easy enough to get what I need to get done done in. Thanks for the 7+ posts telling me this. &gt;_&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to support as many HTML tags (and their proper useage) as possible. I will of course ask for lots of help I'm sure. At this point, I'll be doing well to get the google HTML code pulled down. Although give me a minute or two and that should be done. Thank goodness HTTP requests appear to be quite simple to use... o.O
<br/>

kk, off to drown myself in code now. I'll let you know how it turns out.

Yes, it actually works pretty good. From what there is now, this thing is going to own Opera DS, gnirfleo (...) and even Elinks over SSH. Really nice font support, quick panning and zooming and a keyboard as responsive as DsLinux' one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like the VNC type stuff for the DS?  I don't use those because first of all, they are slow, second off, they don't fit to the DS screen, and third off, I prefere to the tools on either or of my two linux servers than I do the tools I could use graphically on my windows desktop.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, this is really starting to bug me. I cannot get the wifi version of PAlib to do anything. It keeps asking for "arm-elf-gcc" and the like, but I searched through my devkitPro folder and all I seem to have anywhere is arm-<span style="font-weight: bold">eabi</span>-gcc and the like.
<br/>
<br/>
Does the newest version of devkitPro (which I'm downloading with like 2 hours to go) fix this? If I can't get this to install I'm a little screwed, because it looks like it will make the whole Wifi connection thing a snap. 
<br/>
<br/>
If there is a tutorial or docmuentation on the DSWifi library that will let me get connecty without using PAlib, now would be the time to let me know. Besides, I'm going to end up writing my own custom functions to wrap it anyway, PAlib was just going to make that easy. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not quite to the point of coding the browser bit, I'm still in HTTP request land at the moment. I have my PC submitting requests and recieving data quite nicely with one particular flaw, that being handling of large files. I can't seem to intercept the entire message, it keeps cutting off at a certain point. Once I get this fixed on the PC (it's bound to be something relatively simple) I'll be ready to roll. I think.
<br/>
<br/>
UPDATE: I just finished installing the newest devkitPRO. Still no "elf" functions, still no PAlib building. Drat. [evil n00b sounding]Help me please... someone...anyone...[/evil n00b sounding]
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
*edit* Nevermind, I got it to work. It seems that the PAlib tutorials are a bit out of date, and the properly compiling wifi template is now a part of the current PAlib download. someone should fix that. Oh wait, it's a wiki... ^_^ I'll go fix that.
<br/>
<br/>
On to mass coding then. -Yay! Basic HTML retrieval in the template is flawed! It apparently doesn't handle either long messages or chunked data, so I'm getting the incomplete header of the google page prefixed in places with a number. I'll have to write those GET routines myself then... sigh. Oh well. I wanted this challenge I guess. I'll report back probably in a different thread if I get anything useful going.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
The newer versions of devkitARM changed from arm-elf-gcc to arm-eabi-gcc because the old version of the ABI (application binary interface) had no way to indicate that the DS ARM9 has some features not in the base CPU model (ARM9TDMI) but lacks floating-point hardware. You can change all occurrences of arm-elf- to arm-eabi- in the makefile in order to fix the problem.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I have got my changes moved over to svn dslinux now, but haven't had a chance to figure out the new patch process for svn yet, need some time to read the wiki :)
<br/>
<br/>
I have also done a native port of retawq to libnds , but still haven't figured out my dswifi problems I'm having, so it can only load .html files from FAT right now.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@tepples: I tried that and it gave me weird errors, like there were errors with things being included twice, or things that were used but not declared. My guess is that PAlib had adapted to some weird quirks of the \"elf\" system that didn\'t transfer over too well. Regardless, I\'ve thrown out the wifi version entirely, as it was unecessary. The entire thing was just generally weird, and since (completely by luck I might add, seems to be my expernience with these types of things) it works, I\'m through bothering with it. Until I have to go instal it for The_Perfection that is...
<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I\'m considering implementing the \"grafitti\" style writing as well as a keyboard for entering text into forums. I want to take that a bit further when I do it and allow you to \"train\" the letter recognition so that the program can recognize what works best for each person. I just personally find that being able to draw letters \"blind\" rather than having to look at a clunky keyboard (no matter how well implemented) is faster and more efficient. You can look at your text this way.
<br/>
<br/>
For basic implementation, expect to be seeing the HTML code of a lot of pages in the early days. I am going to basically output everything within the body tags if present, or the \"noframe\" tags if present. As I add tags to the rendering engine, the tags will dissappear from the display and their effects will show up instead. In this way, something not being implemented yet will be blatantly obvious and you can yell at me directly. 
<br/>
<br/>
I plan on first implementing the basic functionality tags. Things like hyperlinks will come first, followed quickly by form tags and the form POST method. (no email method, that will simply return an error as I don\'t believe it should have existed in HTML in the first place, plus I\'m not writing an email client. Sorry.) This should allow the gbadev site to become useable, once I have everything sorted out. Oh, and if I haven\'t implemented a form object, you will still be able to \"click\" on the tag and give it a value, so you can use the element anyway. Functionality first, prettiness later.
<br/>
<br/>
Tables will be next in the list, as most pages use them and they tend to make things much more readable. This should be followed closely by formatting tags and images. (I may not have a very extensive font collection though, don\'t expect much there.) I\'m not quite sure how I am going to handle showing the page with proper proportions though. I think basically I will need to \"render\" everything by giving it a position on the page, and then re-draw stuff as you pan around the screen. If I can get this going fast enough, it should be useable. I may also go with a DSopera style \"whole page view\" at the top, although that will take a bit of time to render properly with a lot of images in place.
<br/>
<br/>
So there you have a basic outline of my plans for the project. Right now, I\'m lost in the world of networking issues. As soon as I can get the entire page into memory (which is giving me grief right now) I should be able to get something useable on-screen. At the very least I want you to be able to enter an address and get the proper page for it. So yeah, I\'ve gone full steam ahead on it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi gamefreak,
<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of ?online? browsers / sites that allow you to view normal full size pages normally only meant for your computer desktop.
<br/>
This ?proxies for cellphone internet? could be usefull to make a good xHtml/cHtml browser.
<br/>
You can use the Google?s wml/wap reformating proxy with this URL request :
<br/>
<br/>
[/url]http://www.google.com/gwt/n?u=YOUR_ HTML_URL
<br/>
<br/>
Result with GbaDev :

<br/>
<br/>
Google?s mobile search :
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/xhtml" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/xhtml</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The Browser only read the page without any other reformatting operations. (less CPU usage, less RAM needed -&gt; biggest cache allocation  to speed up the surf)
<br/>
<br/>
Some other proxy example  :
