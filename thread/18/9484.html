First and foremost; This is a development forum. Even though we have a section about flash equipment does not mean that you should ask about how to get X game running on your gba flash setup. We do not care if you own the games and just want to keep them on a single cart. It's not what this forum is about. 
<br/>
If you still post asking such a question, do not get upset <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">when</span></span> your post is removed without warning. Consider it strike 1. Strike 2 will get you banned.
<br/>
<br/>
When starting a new thread, it is very important that the subject of your post <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">clearly depict</span></span> the contents of your post. Ie, subjects such as "Is this possible..." will either be deleted or renamed depending on how much time the moderators have available.
<br/>
<br/>
No promotion of any retailer outside the Retailer Feedback forum. NO affiliate links are allowed.
<br/>
<br/>
No links to sites offering/relating to piracy/warez.
<br/>
<br/>
See a post that you think is in violation with the forum rules? <span style="font-weight: bold">DO NOT</span> start bashing/flaming the poster. <span style="font-weight: bold">DO</span> contact a moderator.
<br/>
<br/>
Try your best to use correct spelling, grammar &amp; punctuation please. If you know you have some problems with any of these, there are spell checkers available (see google).
<br/>
<br/>
Do not "bump" posts. EVER. "bump posts" will be deleted on sight.
<br/>
<br/>
Posting "can someone make an (insert example of game) clone/port/sequel for the GBA/DS please?" is frowned upon and if you're new to the forum you are strongly recommended not to post such a thing. You have been warned.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep your signature short. We do not allow images on our forum so you don't have to bother trying to get one in your signature.
<br/>
<br/>
We will be very happy if you stick to using black text. Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions please contact a moderator. Complaints regarding a moderator? Notify the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3" target="_blank">admin</a>
<br/>
<br/>
We reserve the right to delete any posts &amp; users for any reason at any time. Did your post disappear without a trace? Contact a moderator BEFORE you post the same thing again. Was your account deleted? Go elsewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, we really are a friendly forum and common courtesy will get you far.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Moderators:
<br/>
<br/>
-Move topics without leaving a shadow.
<br/>
-Use the Lock Thread function with causion. A lot of the time Delete Thread is much better. Only Lock when there is interesting information in the thread not available elsewhere.
<br/>
-Report users posting about running commercial games (etc) to the admin. Delete any such threads. This is a development forum and even if the poster owns the game in question it doesnt belong here.
<br/>
-Replace links to retailers with a link to the retailer feedback section.
