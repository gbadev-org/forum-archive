<br/>
<br/>
When running a retail game that has wireless connectivity capability there is always a very nice connection utility you can access.  Is this hardware based or just a kit piece of code nintendo gives to developers (which is why its the same utility in every game)?  
<br/>
<br/>
If it is on the hardware, has anyone tried to access / run it from homebrew?  I know we can read from the information that is saved by running the utlity, as dswifi and many other homebrew programs can read settings directly from firmware. Though, this doesn't necessarily mean the utility code is hardware based (as there is no way that I know of to access it unless you have a wifi enabled game).  
<br/>
<br/>
If it is software based, anyone ever tried to emulate or recreate the code?  Is it possible to write to the firmware settings at all?  
<br/>
<br/>
A little library for a utility that works like the nintendo version might be a good project idea if it is possible to write to the firmware.  I think it would be a really nice addition to any wifi enabled homebrew app.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<a class="postlink" href="http://fwnitro.caitsith2.net/" target="_blank">FWNitro</a> says it can edit wi-fi settings but it is very old and is likely not compatible with all DS systems or slot-1 flashcards.  Use at own risk!
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know of a stand alone wi-fi configuration program that was ever finished.  Writing to firmware is risky since you can brick some DS systems if you write to the wrong area.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
