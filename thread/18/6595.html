ScummVM DS would have to be written to support the filesystem on the compact flash card to support the GBAMP because you can't load 10 megs of NDS code and old SCUMM Adventure game into RAM all at once, because that just isn't gonna fit. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">scummvm does work with the gbamp its just he hasnt bothered with a .nds version (i dont mean that in a bad way!) there is an older version with a .nds floating around or you can compile it your self.  Fortunately they are making a proper version i believe since its the only way to play the larger games with full sound etc
<br/>
<br/>
in other words you can play the floppy disk versions such as the monkey island demo that i have running on my gbamp</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA MP doesn't work with ScummVM because NDS files load all their resources into RAM.  The old demo of Monkey Island 1 works because it is incredibly small.  Unless you want to play some of the very old games like Manic Mansion you're not going to get anything inside of 4Mb
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, ScummVM may be able to read the compactflash card directly and load only the resources it needs, and then it will work.  But I don't have a GBA MP, so it's not going to be straight away.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He has it on his site.

I just donated ?20.00. Didn't find any way to leave a message though.

Use the cash to get that GBAMP.

On a second thought, use it to do whatever you want. Thank's for all your work so far.

Yeah, even though the GBAMP has a limited onboard buffer (v3's is 256Mbit), the GBAMP people told me bigger files will work regardless.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",
