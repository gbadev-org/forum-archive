    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys. I've been coding a game as my 3rd year university project and am nearing completion of the documentation. I was wondering who I'd acknowledge and give credit to for creating libnds in the first place, joat dovoto and WinterMute (if they don't mind)? Is there a document somewhere which I'm missing which states anything about credit due to anybody? 
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. If you can remember helping me and/or want your name in my documentation, let me know ;) .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
