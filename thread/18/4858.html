The thing is, anything could be created with this SDK, but none of it could be legally distributed for free. That's pretty much why everyone wants to go the reverse-engineering way and do it themselves so Nintendo doesn't come after them.

Hypothetically, IF anyone were to break the law, the first part of your statement would make sense. However, the second part does not. If Nintendo can embed tags into documentation, what is stopping them from doing the same to their own emulator? The information from the documentation would lead to a emulator anyway.

<br/>
All such talk really should be moved to PM's or something. Nintendo is just bound to serach for "Nintendo DS SDK" and come up with this site. Don't believe me?
<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's just say that Nintendo's reps in charge of seeing how icons of its own IP do do a lot of searching on the net. Remember that incident that happened last year with the umm.. less than conspicuous site which had names of some of Nintendo's beloved characters? Apparently, Nintendo doesn't like its IP on sites which might be offensive to children.... :?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If I were reverse engineering something,  I would not want docs that cannot be legally obtained, as that is where code tainting and that stuff comes from. Clean reverse engineering means that you don't actually have any of the original code/docs yourself, which leaves a 0% chance that your code contains info that belongs to nintendo or whoever.  If you had any access to the docs and read them,  then some of nintendo's code might just sneak its way into your code, not something we want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
