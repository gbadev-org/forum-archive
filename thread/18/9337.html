    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a way that the DS can interact with a MYSQL database? I haven't ever coded for the DS and am only just working on GBADEV but, interacting with a MYSQL database would be a great way to post High scores and stuff on the WEB.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure, why not? But you'll have to wait until the Wifi-lib supports TCP. Then you can either write or port a mysql client to the DS and include it in games/apps. Would be quite cool to have such a thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, you'd just need TCP and an HTTP client on the DS side, as the MySQL client is usually part of a web server's CGI. MySQL isn't as good at enforcing business logic rules as PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, and other <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure" target="_blank">scriptable database servers</a>. Internet apps that use MySQL typically enforce rules in scripts written in a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.perl.org/" target="_blank">language</a> whose <a class="postlink" href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">name</a> starts <a class="postlink" href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank">with P</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I know we first need an HTTP Client, how hard would it be to port Lynx or one of those Text-based browsers? :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
