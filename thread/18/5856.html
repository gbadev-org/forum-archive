    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, my little MOD player is in a usable state now. Grab it <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.gbadev.org/program/soundds.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. No SFX support yet, but I'll get to that eventually (well, maybe).
<br/>
<br/>
It will hopefully drop right into any ndslib projects that want to use it. Check the readme for details. 
<br/>
<br/>
It should work well with file systems too, although I've only tried it with plain old .incbin'd MOD files. 
<br/>
...or now that I think about it, maybe not. Since you pass it a pointer to the MOD from ARM9, that means ARM9 needs to have access rights on the GBA cart to find the file, but then ARM7 needs access to load it.
<br/>
Suggestions welcome on how to get around that one :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________

I grabbed devkitarm off sourceforge and ndslib from the zip on your site yesterday, and those worked fine. Just now though, I grabbed ndslib from CVS and am getting the same problems you are. 
<br/>
<br/>
From my first couple of tests, the problem does seem to be that ARM7 isn't getting any commands, like the ARM9 is never flushing them from the cache/write buffer. I'll keep fiddling with it for a while and see if I can find what's wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Turns out the problem was in the ARM9 makefile, there was no ARM7 bin specified so it was pulling in the default instead of the one in the project... Might want to fix that in the lib. Should be

<br/>
Possible of course, but I haven't decided how to handle it yet. SFX will have to be loaded into RAM, but I'm trying to steer clear of having to use malloc/free on them.
<br/>
<br/>
One possibility would be to make SFX lists, where you tell it a bunch of sounds to load, and they just go into the memory pool with the song, but starting from the top down. Then if you get too many sounds/too big of a song, they'll run into eachother in the middle of the pool and die.
<br/>
<br/>
The advantage is that they would all be pre-loaded at the start of a map or whatever, and you'd know exactly how much memory they take. Disadvantage is that you'd have to know every sound that could need to be played on the map ahead of time.

Have every sound compressed (via software) and put into memory.  When it is time to play a sound, extract it quickly (needs to be super-optimized) into a temporary buffer and play it.  Will cause a small delay, but gets rid of the overflow problem (most of the time).  Same goes for the patterns (for the most part).

<br/>
<br/>
Depends on how many channels your mod uses. If it's an 8 channel mod, it will use channels 0-7. Any above that are safe to use.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also the channelBlocked flags in sndVars on the ARM7 that will tell the player not to touch particular channels nomatter what.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the bugs, it turns out there was a whole slew of them.
<br/>
1. I wasn't setting my "shadow" sound channels' loop length to 0 when playing non-looping samples, so things were looping when they shouldn't.
<br/>
<br/>
2. I was loading samples with DMA, and dividing the size by 4 because I didn't know the ndslib function did it too.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Sample offsets were throwing the loops off. Now it's set up so if a sample offset goes past the loop start, it just starts playing from the loop start (since the hardware can't jump back to before where you start from).
<br/>
<br/>
4. Vibrato/tremolo were totally screwy. I was reading off the end of the tables for sine and random modes, and not resetting the vibrato slide amount to 0 after stopping it (that's what was causing the slight off-pitchness). Now it uses temporary vars instead of storing them in the channel structs.

When I tried it without VAR_IN_EXRAM it didn't bloat the ROM, but didn't run either. Might have put it in TCM. How do you tell the ndslib makefiles to spit out a map file to see where everything is? It doesn't seem to accept -map when using g++ as the linker.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just hardcoded the pool to address 0x2200000 in the new one, which I don't necessarily like, but it works for a small demo. I guess I could just give up my hatred of new[] and use it instead...
<br/>
<br/>
And to answer the actual question, you can use a Bxx in the song to make it loop. More flexible than looping in code so I didn't bother adding it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Dovoto, if you're around, where are those IPC interrupt defines you mentioned before? They don't seem to be anywhere in ndslib, but I would like to do some better comm code to make it work with loading music from filesystems on the GBA cart.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

It seems you use a technique similer to adpcm which the DS can play back in hardware...i think compression of sound samples and effects would be pretty slick since playback would be free.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Type -M "mapname.map", or try it without a space (or quotes).  The map file will be printed in the same directory as the resulting .elf file (as I've known...).

I haven't gotten Wifi-Me to work, so I can't test it (yet) for any bugs I might find, but when I do find mmy FlashCard, this'll definately be my first tryout. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can just remove the VAR_IN_IWRAM. It looks like the latest ARM7 linkscript puts variables in iwram by default, and it would still run fine with the table in main RAM anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
