    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) I have begun working with the RGB8_A5 format (3bits of color, 5bits of alpha), and I'm seeing a problem with two polygons using that texture format when overlapping each other. The areas where the alpha is closer to 0 (making it really faint) seem to show a lightly tinted black on the polygon "closer" tothe camera than the other, as opposed to mixing the colors based on the alpha. Is this where the polygon id comes into play? I've never really understood that portion of the polygon format.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Is there a way to brighten the colors on a 8-bit texture without resorting to palette manipulation? I had thought that increasing the emission would do it (since it acts like light coming from the polygon), but it only seems to modulate how much red/green/blue the polygon will use, and not actually increase the intensity to higher levels.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For problem 1 you have to give them the same ID if you want them to mix. I think that is easy ^^<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://imetal.nl/" target="_blank">Website / Blog</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, it's the other way around, polygons with different ids blend.

DiscoStew, have you tested it on hardware? I made a quick test and in no$gba I get the same slightly darker areas as you describe, but on hardware it looks ok.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you could try vertex or polygon colors using glColor. though this would only be able to darken certain areas not lighten them.
<br/>
<br/>
another more difficult approach would be to use the per polygon depth equal test in conjunction with a specially crafted "brightness" texture. I use this for the dual layer sky texture in <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/cquake/source/browse/trunk/arm9/clock/null_rmain.clk.c#775" target="_blank">cquake</a> I do not use it to lighten areas myself but I could see how overlaying a white texture and blending by certain amounts may produce results along the lines you are looking for. this does have some undesireable side effects like using double the triangle count and it has to be used with the less precise glFlush mode 0.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A quick, if slightly hackish, way to brighten the scene is to use multiple lights, all placed in the same location.  You can do it very easily even if you don't use the lighting at the moment, just pop a glNormal pointed at the light before every batch of polys you draw.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
