    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone has create a GBA Emulator/Debugger that runs in DS Mode and uses one screen for the GBA stuff, and the other for Debug info. I think would could be really useful, but I know next to nothing about emulators and DS development.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's been discussed a number of times. The general concensus is that an emulator could possibly run near full speed with a lot of hacking (more virtualization than emulation) and probably without sound. I certainly wouldn't count on a debugger.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as the virtualization goes, that's what I was thinking, but I just couldn't think of the word. On the debugger, i wasn't thinking anything to high tech, mainly something to watch memory locations and registers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
