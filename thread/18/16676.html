    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if there is like a NDS helper thing. You know like that paper clip in Microsoft Office Word 2003? I think it would be kinda cool to have an animated character that just moves around and maybe says random things on the R4 interface before you choose a game. Maybe it could also act as a chatterbox...XD.Not rly but i want the first idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, you're talking about homebrew games, aren't you?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Get rid of the R4 interface and it wouldn't be.  Just a simple homebrew launcher with animated character.  I doubt making one would be very hard, but I also doubt there is any interest in making one.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
