The ARM7 code won't run. I have FWNITRO 1.6C, Supercard CF, and the ARM7 code doesn't work in normal mode or failsafe mode. The ARM7 code works with some other software in failsafe mode only, and some it works in both modes.
<br/>
<br/>
I changed the ARM7 code in my game becuase I wanted to use square-wave sounds instead of samples, but now the ARM7 code doesn't run. What did I do wrong?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But sometimes works with some games, and not others. (The ARM7 code works properly with Aztec Puzzle, whether or not you use failsafe mode.) Also, with some software it works only in failsafe mode. With the D-SPACE game, it works neither in normal mode nor in failsafe mode.
<br/>
<br/>
O. Maybe, I should also tell you that the ARM7 code did run in failsafe mode before I changed the ARM7 code<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well then it sounds like FWNITRO isn't setting things up right or something. You should at least try with FlashMe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That may be part of it, but first I will have the chance to fix the SuperCard software (I think that may also be part of the problem). But, how do I fix the FWNITRO to set up thing properly?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I realized I need SCCONV to convert to SuperCard, then things work in SuperCard properly, even if not failsafe mode. But, the D-SPACE game ARM7 code still doesn't work!
