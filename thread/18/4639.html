From a technical point of view, it is of course very unlikely, but thoose photos are indeed interesting..
<br/>
It is very complicated to replace GB cart PCBs with GBA flashcart PCBs due to two things:
<br/>
1: The center screw in the GB cart goes straight through the GBA flashcart PCBs.
<br/>
2: Most (all but older Visoly carts I think) have flash memories on the back of the PCB with only ~0.2mm plastics left to protect them. The GB cart plastics must be significantly modified to make room for the flash memories, and it is _very_ hard to do that without any visible trace of it on the back of the GB cart plastics (I have tried it).
<br/>
<br/>
In at least one of the photos the GB cart screw is slightly visible while inserted into the DS, so it is indeed there...
<br/>
<br/>
I see two possible alternatives:
<br/>
1: However technically unlikely, t is possible to run GB(C) games on the DS.
<br/>
2: He went to _great_ lengths to fake this..
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is possible to boot a GB(C) game from a flashcart and then swap carts live.. The game will of course crash/hang, but for photo purposes..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

eitherway i dunno. im not opening mine. i have a sp, and a gba, and other older gb's to use.

edit: yeah hotswapping the carts would make it hang, and good for pics.

but why are there people saying it does work?

I have never asked for proof.
<br/>
<br/>
But if someone really want to prove this, it would have to be done with a GB cart with removed top cover, and a video showing the DS boot a GB game from this cart with the PCB clearly visible.
<br/>
<br/>
I'am not saying he is lying, because I have no proof that this is impossible while he has pictures (that could be faked however) showing that it works. It is however technically very unlikely.
<br/>
<br/>
In theory perhaps the DS only provide 3.3V to the GB cart.. Old CMOS logic will in fact operate at 3.3V, but a little slower. Detecting the presence of a GB cart instead of a GB cart could in theory be done in software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because it is very hard to make good quality pictures of a PCB unless you have a decent digicam or a scanner?
<br/>
<br/>
The points listed on Darkain's site are all valid, but none is absolute proof that it is a hoax.
<br/>
The sticker can be removed and replaced without much trace. The ground-connection thing can be because he had troubles with stability, decided to try to improve the ground connection and found it improved stability. In reality perhaps his stability problems could have been because of a loose contact that were fixed when he pulled apart his DS the second time, and had nothing to do with the ground connection.
<br/>
The fact that the patch is done on pins connected to the radio unit is no proof that thoose pins don't have multiple functionality.
<br/>
The difference in screen colors could be because legacy graphics are implemented differently in the DS compared to the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
All points are very valid, and indicate that this is very unlikely to be true.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By the way, I thought that it would be hard to get Flash Card chip inside a GB case. But the Idea of hotswapping it makes a lot of sense. The game would crash the image would remain on the screen. Enough for a picture...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay. Anyone want a *really* easy way to test this? Here's an easy way. Get a game you don't need or an unlicensed game like the ones Wisedom Tree makes. For this example, I'm using the Wisedom Tree NIV Bible. (I use the NKJ in church anyways.) Since Wisedom Tree makes their own game paks, their game packs are missing the edges that prevent licensed games from going into a DS. On a normal pak, you could just sand those down. Since the unlicensed game pak fits in the DS, shouldn't the DS detect the game as SOMETHING? (Either a DS Option Pak, or a GBA game.) Anyhow, when I put it into Slot 2 on the DS and turn the DS on....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just stating that the DS should detect that something is there. I think the DS looks for a checksum to validate a game as a GBA game or an Option Pak. No checksum on a GBC or GB game pak, therefore, no go. Most Flash Cards may have an irregular checksum. That may be why the DS sometimes thinks they are Option Paks. That would something inside the firmware, not just a physical lockout.
