now im not totally sure how exactly it connects but im assuming theoretically this could be used for DS multiplayer too although PSP multiplayer failed for some reason
<br/>
<br/>
a very useful idea i had was if we can figure out how to recieve from those we could theoretically help people use WifiMe from miles away! of course this would still require a wifi card or a wifi hot spot for the downloader but for those without access to a ralink card could save some money. not to mention from what i know about wifime it works like a ds download so multiple people can download at once.
<br/>
<br/>
please correct any impossible statements i made about uploading wifime</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
