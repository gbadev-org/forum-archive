    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was attempting to start work on some homebrew 3d coding, so recently downloaded some tutorials, and emulators. However, none of the programs seem to actually run 3d correctly on the emulators, although they do run ok when I run them on my DS with M3 DS. I've tried al the popular emulators, but none seem to run homebrew 3d. Is there something I've missed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately there isn't  a single emulator that emulates homebrew perfectly. Perhaps the official Nintendo emulator, but that one is not publically available.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you tried using DSFTP or something similar to upload your program to the DS every time? If this is too painful, then make a program using OpenGL targeting Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows, and port it to the DS later once the emulators become more accurate.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No$gba v2.3c runs e.g. Wright Flight, albeit very slowly. Anyway, the first emulator
<br/>
that does that, and the graphics (3D) work almost. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
