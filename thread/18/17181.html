    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am running my code on No$Gba, on DesMuMe, and on hardware...
<br/>
<br/>
1. On No$Gba, it runs as I would expect it to (but the Errors window shows about 120 errors per second)... expected output is several quads on screen.
<br/>
2. On DesMume, I see absolutely no output (black or white screen)
<br/>
3. On hardware, I see graphics, but with major flicker (there's a black stripe on the top half of the screen...)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
which should I pay closer attention to, DesMume or No$Gba ? Both? None?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can't remember the post/thread, but I'm sure I read somewhere that the reason why No$GBA is building up errors is because of some rearranging of the toolkits/libnds.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's basically because I had to do some memory layout rearranging for DSi.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In my testing with the DS version of Anguna, I found that things often worked fine in DesMuMe (which I primarily tested with), but failed on both no$ and hardware (And failed the same way on both).

Overall, no$ seemed the most reliable.  There were a few cases, though, where no$ was wrong (sprite blending, if I recall correctly).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, that bug on semitransparent sprites is the major problem, IMHO.
<br/>
But you should also remember that No$GBA doesn't emulate ARM9 caches (so maybe you won't see your sprite appear on the screens on the hardware if you write directly to OAM and you don't flush the cache...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, right. My mistake. I meant to say that before you DMA-copy your 'local' OAM memory to the 'real' OAM (in VBlank) you should remember to flush the data cache -or at least partially-.
<br/>
<br/>
You can 'forget' that on No$gba with no problem, because it doesn't emulate any cache. (mmm... I guess there are no emulators that emulate the cache...)
<br/>
<br/>
Right now, wm? ;D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
