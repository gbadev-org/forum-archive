<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am a bit surprised that the so big
<br/>
SDHC cards must be read through a
<br/>
little bus with bus commands.
<br/>
<br/>
OK! This makes the thing more
<br/>
portable and compatible with other
<br/>
devices.
<br/>
<br/>
I am programming in ARM assembler
<br/>
and wish to read/write sectors through
<br/>
the Super Card DS ONE. HOW?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I could link the existing
<br/>
"C" drivers. I could well translate this
<br/>
code to ARM assembler. Sadly, I
<br/>
have seen already 2 drivers in "C"
<br/>
with different bus commands... maybe
<br/>
it were for different Super Cards types.
<br/>
<br/>
What I would need, then is the bus
<br/>
control codes used by the SuperCard
<br/>
to read/write the SD flash memories.
<br/>
Does anybody know were these 
<br/>
bus codes are documented?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW. isn't there a faster, easier way
<br/>
using DMA block transfers or simple
<br/>
registers with memory mappings?
<br/>
Wasn't the GBA SC SD like this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
