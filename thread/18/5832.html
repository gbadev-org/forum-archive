<br/>
I'm not sure if this is the best forum for this question but if not I don't know where I can ask.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having problems with some programs with the touch screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
Some of them, like nibbles, duckhunt, smantouch, battleships, dsbonga are working properly.
<br/>
<br/>
But others, especially darkstar (darkpaint), mines, calc, nds wins paint work but not very well.
<br/>
<br/>
In ds paint you can paint properly in the centre of the screen but doesn't work on the borders.
<br/>
<br/>
It's only me or it's the same for everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my bad english.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It randomly draws wrong lines.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Touch screen calibrated and  everything is working perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
I have read about it but I wasn't sure and I couldn't find it in the forum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't been around the last weeks, but the last time i checked the touchscreen code for X/Y coords with calibration was correct. The problem was rather a question of "when" to read them. There is two variables Z1 and Z2, wich represent the pressure on the screen. Tough they hadn't at the time been figured out how to use them.  So when you press very lightly you'll get disorted results of X/Y Coords between your touch-location and the dead-point of your touchscreen. 
<br/>
<br/>
And most applications don't know how to discard theese disorted X/Y-coords and instead register them as a valid touches. 
<br/>
These disortions appear frequently when you press or release the pen, so simple taps on the screen will most likely give you corrupted coords.
<br/>
<br/>
This could be bypassed by inserting a little delay before the next X/Y read as soon as the coords leave the dead-point ,like some drawing apps do to give a better  precision with low preformance tablets. But think it's a pretty ugly way since the ds actually has those two Z values wich could give us unmached precision, if only someone were to figure them out. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I hope i did't give you wrong or outdated info. I haven't done my DS-homework  lately. Cheers!<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://manifested.ath.cx" target="_blank">http://manifested.ath.cx</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
