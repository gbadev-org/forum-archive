    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
i use to run oridignal demo with WiFiMe. Everything works great!
<br/>
Now i'm reading  Homebrew NDS DEvelopmnet (http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/index.html), and all the homebrew example don't run in WiFIME, i download correctly the rom, but then when NDS switch to the program, it freezes. NEither the Nintendo written is well done.
<br/>
Any idea? 
<br/>
thanks a lot 
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A bunch of the homebrew demos are designed for GBA carts (some need GBAMP or other peripherals). These demos cannot be run over WiFi. There are a good amount of demos that will run on WiFi and any little tests you code should be small enough to run over the WiFi. I would suggest investing in a good GBA flash cart if you want to get serious with hombrew DS development.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The homebrew codes won't run via WMB as long as you don'tn have Flashme installed on your DS to remove the Signature Check.
<br/>
<br/>
Official demos come with a proper signation and therefor run on an unflashed DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh thanks you. But i think it would be better, or just because it's faster, using WIFiMe. As example in the DevKitArm, there are few homebrew prog like the silly 256_color_bmp, thati would like run w/ WiFiME, but i'm unable.
<br/>
Anyway, do you know if exists a way to run them ?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks a lot, and sorry for my stupid questions</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MightMax just told you. You need to get a PassMe to flash the DS bios with FlashMe. I though before that you already had this, but I guess not. The PassMe is cheap ($30) and will allow you to run homebrew code. Just read the FAQ or do a google search on FlashMe and you should find what you need.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Allof my tutorial demos will run using wifime. Remember that you need to run WMB.EXE using the 'wifime' argument not using the nds file of the homebrew demo. This will boot the NDS file stored on the GBA flash cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to use WMB to send the NDS file directly you need to have a flashed firmware. Not all of my demos run this way as some access things from the game cartridge (GBFS archives for example).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
