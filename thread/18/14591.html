I have a netgear router with a 300ft radius. I would like to offer a few games with DS download play from my computer to my router to the ds. Is there a way I could possibly do that?[/list]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your PC is not capable to produce the needed NiFi frames on the AP, as these do not follow the "usual" way.

Well, I was thinking that if I set something like that up, it would be fun to have around the house, because there are alot of people with ds's on my street
<br/>

would it be possible to host multiple games on a DS with linux then?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes exactly that, unfortunately it's only released in Japan so far, but it is due for other regions shortly (so we're told). It also covers Wii demos and movies too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
