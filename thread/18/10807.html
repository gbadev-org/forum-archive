<br/>
I was thinking about trying to create a simple mod for my supercard lite, which ultimatly would result in a blue LED being added to where the current DS Lite ones are, which flashes on and off when the SD card is being read/writen to.
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if this is feasabile really or where to start, i'm guessing theres a curcuit in the supercard that gets current passed down which the LED could be connnected  to? but would that current be enough power to light the LED I ponder?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.genericlan.net" target="_blank">www.genericlan.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
