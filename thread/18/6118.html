    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">are there any easy to understand tutorials for guys like me that are new?
<br/>
(not the one Chris wrote, no offence but I can't seem to understand everything it says due to my primary language being Dutch)
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried to use Chris' tutorials but I can't understand them, so are there any others related to DS coding?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm happy to host translations if someone wants to contribute them. I'm always modifying the tutorials to fix up errors in my understanding and better ways of doing things though. It might end up a bit of a pain for the person doing the translation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

normally I can understand english just fine (if it isn't for a few words), but I can't keep my head straight.

sorry to bother you all with this post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
