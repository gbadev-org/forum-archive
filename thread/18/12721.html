Memory. Just as each 2D core can see only 128 sprites at once, the 3D core can see only 6,144 vertices at once. If you draw a quad as a quad rather than as two triangles, however, it will occupy only four vertices rather than six.

Strips are supported on the DS, strips of quads eat up 4 vertices for the first quad and then 2 vertices for each following quad. Quads seem to eat up Polygon RAM faster than Triangles so you can only fit about 1700 quads even if you use one giant quad strip.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, clipping increases both ram usages. because of that and depending on your game, you should always leave a fraction (like 10 or 20%) of both rams free for clipping compensation.

despite of that you can create quite complex scenes and the hardware will still run quite smoothly.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to clarify, there are plenty of times when you do want to use quads.
<br/>
<br/>
You can only use about 1700 quads, and since many times it would take twice as many triangles to make the same mesh you do want to use quads, because you only get about 2000 polys if you use triangles. If you are making things with flat quad-shaped sides it is better to not break up those quads. If you make cubes it would take 12 triangles or 6 quads; both triangles and quads eat up the same amount of vertex RAM in either case.
<br/>
<br/>
I end up with strips of planar quads in my models quite often (i.e. tubes). Strips of quads are the most efficient way to draw stuff on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If you only use triangles then it doesn't make much difference if you use strips or not since you will run out of vertex and polygon ram at the same time. If you make good use of quads and strips then you can get quite a bit more performance on the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by gabebear on Sun Mar 18, 2007 12:24 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
I'm mainly familiar with Blender(which I'm pretty sure can't do this), but any modeler that can be made to only use planar polygons would be REALLY useful. I was thinking about making a "simple" model editor for the DS that lets you easily maintain planar polygons and some other DS-specific features. I'll almost certainly never get around to making it, but it could probably make some money.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Probably plugins exist for the popular modellers (Max, Maya, etc) to check if the mesh is "correct". If not (I don't know, but I never needed it, so I didn't do any research), writing one would be a lot less work than doing a full blown modeller, imho. And probably, graphicians will prefer to work with a modelling package they already know :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://shashemudev.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://shashemudev.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
However, most people won't work this way... it's probably better to do this instead:
<br/>
<br/>
In Maya, after you have created your model, select it and go into Face mode.  Now open the Select Using Constraints... tool
<br/>
<br/>
(In Maya 8.5, it can be found in Select &gt; Select Using Constraints)
<br/>
<br/>
In Constrain, choose "All and Next"
<br/>
<br/>
In the Properties section, choose "Non-Planar" in the Planarity option.
<br/>
<br/>
All non-planar faces will then be highlighted.
<br/>
<br/>
You can then either make them flat (difficult), or triangulate them (recommended).
<br/>
<br/>
Leave the rest as is, since they are planar.
<br/>
<br/>
IMPORTANT: When you're done, click "Close and Reset" in the Select Using Constraints window, or you'll continue to only be able to select non-planar faces.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd love to know the answer to this, too.  I'm not a modeller, I'm a programmer, and I'm having a really tough time with full-on modelling suites.  Even when I do get something made then I have to use a maze of exporters which usually a) muck up the texture coords, b) muck up the normals, c) crash, or d) just plain don't work and e) all of the former.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking on the net for low-poly models hasn't helped me either as a 200-300 low-poly model is still way too high for my use.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end I wrote a dumbRenderer (tm) routine that takes simple coords and builds a really dumb model by making huge assumptions.  So I get wasteful, blocky models, but at least I get something :|   However, it's so low-poly and fugly that I can't in good conscience leave it that way.  It's useless for creatures too, so I'm reduced to using 3d 'sprites' (which has no future as I haven't the ram free for the necessary amount of creatures and animation).
<br/>
<br/>
What I need is a dumbed down modeller for ultra low-poly models and low-res textures with a 100% working exporter and/or importer for the DS.  Not asking much, am I? :)

Unfortunately your not going to be able to get models really any lower then that if you want them to deform and look at all resembling anything like a human. I don't have any experience doing DS models, but I have modeled for a long while. I'm just curious why you don't use the program with the best exporter (I don't know what this is). But there has to be one of the big programs out there that is able to do DS stuff since it's all out there on the market.

Some basic features that usually make up a good base for a modeler:
<br/>
- vertex, edge, boundary-edge, polygon and shape edit modes
<br/>
- extrude polygon(s) - by polygon-normal and by vertex-normal
<br/>
- bridging edge-loops - with twisting, subdividing, and scale-biasing
<br/>
- inset / outset polygon
<br/>
- cap holes / automatic edge loop filler
<br/>
- directly-on-mesh cut-tool that should detect and visualize what you're cutting at - vertex, edge or nothing.
<br/>
- automatic uv-mapping
<br/>
- a comprehensive uv-mapping editor with support for stuff like uv-relaxing, pelt-mapping (yeah right kusma)
<br/>
- skinning with support for weighting based on bone-distance (and preferably a way of adjusting the falloff of the distance to the bone for both end-points -- something like the feature in 3dsMax would rule)
<br/>
<br/>
(Basicly I'm listing up the editing-features I use the most in 3dsMax ;))</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wasn't taking about planar polygons, but polygons in the sense that 3ds handles. It's just triangulated behind the artists back in a simple way, and if they get very distorted, they are visualized wrong. It's just sometimes simpler to keep polygons on a higher level, and do the splits yourself when you need to define edge. In 3ds you can still edit the triangulation if you want to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS is only able to draw planar quads correctly. So if your model uses quads they either need to already be planar or be triangulated. Most 3D tools use triangles for everything, so it can be difficult to maintain planar quads.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS supports ~6000 vertices and either ~2000 triangles or ~1500-1700 quads. If you mix quads and triangles you get somewhere between 2000 to 1500 polygons. If you triangulate all your quads into triangles then you are wasting a lot of the power of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
1500 quads = 6000 vertices / 4 per quad (not using strips; runs out of vertex RAM)
<br/>
1700 quads = hard limit(runs out of polygon RAM)
<br/>
2000 triangles = hard limit(runs out of polygon RAM)
<br/>
<br/>
You can see how fast polygon and vertex RAM is filled up by looking at the RAM_COUNT(4000604h) register.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't like Sketchup because I have no idea how to access it's file format, and the $500 for the pro version is kinda steep. Sketchup is really cool for doing Google Earth stuff, but I'd never use it to make models for a game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

agreed, plus there's no low-level control you'd need to be efficient enough for the nds.
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i know the other stuff already (even though i messed up recently), but never mind. :^) just wanted to know what ppl were talking about, because i know planar polygons as sets of triangles with a (constant) shared normal. that's pretty much the same thing that kusma described (if i got him right - although it was gabebear who started the planar thing).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ya, the term "planar polygon" is ambiguous, and it gets really weird when you start mixing terminology from different 3D programs. To me "planar polygon" means a polygon where all points lie on one plane(any arbitrary plane) and obeys the regular constraints that individual polygons are supposed to obey(a.k.a. not concave or twisted).
<br/>
<br/>
In the terms I'm used to dealing with I'd consider a group of triangles that are all using a constant normal as a face.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Though it's barely relevant to this discussion, keeping neighboring polys coplanar is important for autopartitioning BSP collision.
<br/>
<br/>
If a couple neighboring faces almost lie on the same plane, but are slightly askew in a convex manner, the plane of one poly will cut under the other, making a very thin volume.  Such volumes wreak havoc on fixed-point math.
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't a technicality or academic concern.  Wobbly geometry can cause serious headaches for collision detection.  When modelling geometry for autopartitioning BSP collision, artists should delete all redundant edges and have the editor highlight non-planar faces.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I said earlier, the Google Earth file format (.kmz)--which the free version exports--is a zip file with a .dae file (collada) inside it.
<br/>
<br/>
I would not model a game character with Sketchup, but it would be nice alternative for level editing.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently using Silo (http://nevercenter.com/) and I'm very happy with it. It has good polygon editing tools. Texture mapping on the current version is weak, but the 2.0 looks promising on that area too. Unfortunately it is modeling only. And it is cheap.
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples, how about contributing to Blender instead of building an editor from scratch? Even if Blender has a bit nasty workflow sometimes, I think you would be able to make larger impact that way :) Plus you would have quite solid ground to work on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because I don't think I could single-handedly shrink Blender to run on the DS. And would Blender work well on my six-year-old PC?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

i'm having no problems with meshes. just take any source format (i work with cinema 4d, my modeller buddy works with lightwave or something) import it into milkshape (30 bucks isn't that expensive!) and export it to a format my so-called engine reads. my exporter recalculates some stuff like normals and optimizes it (like eliminating redundant vertices).</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Because if you have any quads in your level they need to be planar, otherwise they will get broken into two triangles. Triangles are always planar, quads may or may not be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Every quad is theoretically made of two triangles, each of which defines a plane. The angle between these two planes is called the "dihedral angle", labeled φ. Of course, you can't always have perfectly planar quads (φ = 0.0000000000?) due to coordinate roundoff error. Within what dihedral angle would a quad be "planar enough" for the DS 3D hardware to render it correctly?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
