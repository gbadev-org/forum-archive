    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another newbie DSi question: Is there anything known about its internal 256MB FLASH storage, or about its external SD card storage? I/O ports, transfer protocol, filesystem, and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, they are both controlled by the ARM7, and only either one can be accessed... so they are [probably] using the same transmission protocol?
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to boot executables from that memory? And if yes... then it does probably require some encryption or authentication to prevent piracy?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
