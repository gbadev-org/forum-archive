    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know if there is currently a way of communicating between the DS and a host PC during execution? I'm thinking of things like printfs, or even rudimentary debuggers, being possible.

As far as I know, the serial IO stuff is inaccessible from the ARM7, otherwise a solution involving the old MBV2 cable might have been possible. Alternatively is it conceivable to perform such comms over wireless?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did something with a Wonderswan years ago - modified/built a cartridge so that a certain range of addresses didn't go to the ROM chip and instead were re-routed to a DB25 connector and into a PCs parallel port. Wasn't perfect but did kinda work ok.

If you could modify a GBA flash cart then the same sort of thing might be possible??? I know sweet FA about gba carts but it'd be cool if someone could do one.

Edit: Yes, I vaguely remember something about the WS already having a kind of link to PCs - but I was just mucking around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree that a PC connection Option Pak would be useful to Nintendo DS developers until the Wi-Fi is cracked and the the DS is made to talk telnet. It's too bad that the EFA can't talk on the USB and GBA connectors at once.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
