    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">..that's my question, as I would like to display my 3D scene using a projection matrix, then change to an othogonal one with a different viewpoint to display some text/2D-style sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible? (there's no info on that on the GBAtek reference..)
<br/>
<br/>
thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I got the answer by myself (testing): IT WORKS, that's a really great news for me (as I don't want to bother with the 2D harware, 3D is soo nice ^^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While it's much easier to draw text using quads, I recommend you at least start learning how to use sprites to do so. That'll give you 128 characters which can result in a max saving of 256 triangles (enough for a whole extra fairly detailed 3D model).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't need those triangles, and I can't use sprites, since I'm using 3D on both screens with 2 VRAM Banks assigned for textures. I know how to use sprites to display text, but that's just not adapted to my usage...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
