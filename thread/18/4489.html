-Easy calendar cycle functions, instead of going in the settings to see what day of the week Xmas falls on this year.

-And also all the wireless changes mentionned are all what i expected the machine to do.

A question remains.  How flashable is the bios? If it's not embemmed rom in the cpu , i'm sure it's still rom , and not flashable.  So any updates would cost us..?  Anyone has a slight idea about this?  With all the pictures of opened DSes , did anyone locate the bios chip?  
<br/>
<br/>
Finally , if an online petition was to start , where you would enter you DS serial number and all for those changes to happen , i would definitely sign it.

Except for the fact that the DS is the ONLY handheld I have ever seen with a persistant epilepsy warning, and there's nothing special about the DS that makes it more or less dangerous to its users.  So it's true some people might get upset, but that's why Nintendo includes warnings in all their systems and all their games, and label them in some fashion to "Read me before playing!".
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think the warning is redundant, but I would be happy if it just stayed up there for the duration of the DS logo and DIDN'T require touching the screen every time.  Wouldn't everyone be happy then?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nah, the DS detection only draws extra power when your DS is in power-save mode. I don't see any reason to put the DS in power-save mode instead of shutting it off completely unless you wish to be able to detect neraby DS systems.
<br/>
The DS detection is most likely off when playing a GBA or DS game (unless the game specifically support it).
<br/>

So, if you don't want to drain your battery: Don't use the power-save mode instead of powering off the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My understanding is that there is no DS detection at the moment and that they didn't implement it because they didn't have time. 
<br/>
<br/>
A detection system - to be useful- would have to alert you when you are playing a game as well as in sleep mode.  But to do this would mean that it would have to be transmitting all the time - except when turned off.  This would consume a lot of power.
<br/>
<br/>
A detection system that was only active in sleep mode would be pretty useless.  Firstly you have to think, how many people with NDS are out there?  Then how many within 100 feet of me?  Then how many also with their NDS asleep?  Then of how many of those people will even notice that their DS has detected another DS and how many of those will psychicly know whether to go to pico chat or try and start a multiplayer game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Quake III Arena also broke compatibility whenever it had a "protocol upgrade". Perhaps different language versions just have different protocols.

About 1 out of every 12 people in the us own a GBA  which is a fairly large number when you think about it, especially if you were to go to a mall or a stadium, ride public transportation, or just walk in a general urban area.
<br/>
<br/>
Putting it in sleep mode would mean it would actively search using nintendo proprietary signal which takes up almost not battery life. It would in essence be similar to a cell phone, likely allowing the DS to goes days uf not a week at a time for a single charge in that mode. Remeber cell phones only get 3 hours talk time but can survive for several days in their "sleep mode"
<br/>
<br/>
using the DS to communicate with people you dont know would be great, kinda like an ice breaker thing. Think about ths, in future 1 in 10 people have a DS, say you get into a semi crowded subway car with 100 people, your DS starts going off because there 10 other DSs in the area, their Dss also go off, say only 3 open their's up, the 2 want to just use picto chat, and the other just want to play a game, The one has ridge racer but you dont, you can still play him anyway with the single cart mode, all without ever seeing any of these people's faces.

Now you get to wait 4 months for the DS :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you use the Alarm function on the DS , and you put the DS in sleep mode ,  you suggest the DS lasts at least 24 hours in sleep mode, with "wake on alarm" mode on.   Well i thought for sure pictochat was shipped out with "wake on wifi" so that , if i'm in pictochat , alone or with someone , our DSes constantly send out the "wake on wifi" signal , making your DS sound much like the alarm buzzer (which is loud enough)  and have you join the conversation when unflipping the DS , turning the screens on.  Your DS would sound everytime someone's in pictochat , and your in pictochat sleep mode, this is what you would want , if you left pictochat in sleep.. right?  Then from pictochat , a menu to select which multiplayer game to play .. but since that is too much to ask for , just tell people to go in download game , and wait , and then the server just starts the game .. no big problem there.  So , just a wake on wifi , in pictochat sleep would of been fun.
<br/>
<br/>
According to nintendo , the DS is in sleep mode when green LED flashes slow ,   emitting in wifi when flashing green fast.  When the alarm turns on , and the DS is closed , the light goes solid green , but screens are still out until unfold the DS.  I know if you go in sleep mode in pictochat , it says Resume communication ? when you return to pictochat.  Haven't tried to go to sleep on someone's conversation, but what would happen then ? my DS would ring telling me someone's in pictochat?  What would we do then?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As mentioned on that site, the health warning should be enemy #1 in the list of mods for the DS.  It's tediously annoying to be there every time we turn the machine on; it's functionally useless because it doesn't so much inform as it directs stupid people to read the manual like they should anyway; and it's unnecessary for those of us who are in fine health.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm at a loss to understand why we can store our birthdate in the internal software, but can't set an option to remove that warning.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I like the analog clock.  If Nintendo implements a digital display, hopefully there's a configuration option to accompany this change.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see button configuration for the GBA compatibility.  Selecting which screen display isn't good enough--we should be able to configure our buttons.  For example, considering that they've rearranged the buttons to straight perpendicular angles, I prefer my thumb at a more vertical than horizontal angle.  The Y should be B and the B should be A.  Other people might prefer other settings, so between the XYBALR buttons we should be able to set them any way we choose.  I'm not certain if that can be done strictly with a firmware update (can the DS firmware even be updated?) but it's definitely something the GBA compatibility needs.
<br/>
<br/>
A touchscreen-driven RGB selector for setting the so-called dashboard color scheme would be a nice touch, instead of selecting from a limited number of prearranged settings.  It's not like it should be any different since it most likely calculates the gradient anyway and there's nothing unique to any of them.
<br/>
<br/>
If Pictochat can be modified through such an update, a simple paint tool to fill in areas wouldn't hurt.
<br/>
<br/>
That's about all I have off the top of my head at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#30381 - Joat - Tue Nov 30, 2004 8:47 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off: It's pretty unlikely that the firmware will be reflashable, and while a lot of the 'mandatory' requriments sound nice, some aren't particularly realistic (e.g. the persistant dashboard with LED blinking, thats simply not possible unless the hardware and all games were designed for it to begin with, and I imagine the LEDs are driven by some fixed-function hardware).  Having said that, I sure hope nintendo make the stupid-ass health warning on a timeout or disable-able in the DS 1.01 if they change nothing else.
<br/>
<br/>
Second: As far as searching for a game in standby mode, the DS doesn't last very long in standby mode (at least whatever mode SM64DS uses when the lid is closed), certainly well under a day, and that is with the wireless DISABLED.  Actively sending a hello signal would require at least the wireless unit to be drawing power, and if the wifi module isn't particularly smart, you'd also have to power up the CPU occasionally to craft such messages.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't tested the standby duration in any particularly scientific manner: but I had a freshly charged DS, played mario for maybe half an hour, closed the lid, and the battery was dead the next afternoon when I went to play some more (had forgotten I had left it in standby).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

Well, that doesn't give us much information to go by. If the DS lasts 15+ hours in standby mode (probably more), then I would consider that pretty good since I can't think of a reason why you would need to leave it in sleep mode for so long.

Highly unlikely.  I suspect that if the system has firmware system menus, you can only get at them from under the hood.  Arcade mainboards use dip switches.

Let's see... A, B, X, Y, L, R, Select, Start, Power, Touch, and Microphone (Yell into while turning on?) would be 11 bits, so I get a maximum possible combination of 2047...

The time I'm spending figuring this out could be used better on anything else..... :-) but ok, what the hell.
<br/>
<br/>
First off forget the touch screen, and microphone. I honestly do not see Nintentendo reps testing some kind of uber secret Firmware screen by screaming into the mic. Nor do I see the touch screen being viable because of all the multiple places to touch on the screen. Power button is also out of the question....possible,yes...but highly unlikely unless if used as a combination on boot up. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So what's left:
<br/>
<br/>
A ,B, X, Y, Start, Select, L Trigger, R TRigger, and 8 directional pad.
<br/>
<br/>
So 8 logical buttons, all based on boolean base 2, and an directional pad base 8.
<br/>
<br/>
So :   2^8 = 256 * 8^1 = 2048 - 1 that mymateo stated for no combination = 2047. 
<br/>
<br/>
Same exact number, just more of a waste of time.
<br/>
<br/>
For the hell of it, 2048 * 2^1 = 4096 minus mymateo's 1 for 4095. Why not minus two? Just incase if simply holding power is sufficent. 
<br/>
(<span style="font-style: italic">Which by the way doesn't work</span>)
<br/>
<br/>
It's too late, I have insomnia. Good night.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Update:</span> Whoops, damn I suck at math :-)
<br/>
<br/>
it would be base 9 for 8 logical directions, and one more for nothing pressed at all
<br/>
<br/>
2^8 = 256 * 9^1 = ....2304  Fuck you, Abscissa!
<br/>
minus one for mymateo's no combination = 2303 HA, our work did contribute to something...useless.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like you, I did assume that power, touchscreen, and mic didn't count.  But if you wanted to get really technical, what if the touchscreen not only did count, but required a specific part to be tapped?  Or maybe even a gesture?...A gesture in a certain corner of the screen?  Or a specific syllable or phrase in the mic? Or something like "Hold A while entering the sequence B, B, Up Left"? Or a combination of everything?  Plus a Starbucks hotspot ping sensed on the WiFi...

If it exists, it will be a button combination and nothing more.

Touchscreen and microphone are doubtful.  The microphone isn't going to magically work on it's own and would require code to interpret the command, so where would this be stored?  The touchscreen would be too complicated for most people without something onscreen to actually touch.  It's out of the question.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
