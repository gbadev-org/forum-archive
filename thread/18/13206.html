I have tried to launch the DLDI Tester from Chism, with no more success, just says "initing FAT...fail". :(

Any idea?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I call it at the very beginning of the program.
<br/>
- it fails if just after something like Game=new Game();
<br/>
- it works if just before.
<br/>
If someone has an idea about that, I'd be glad to hear it :)

One more thing, I was wondering as everything is in ROM space, is there a way to get data bytes address directly rather than using fread ( I did that before when using GBFS but had to change due to GBFS data size limitation )?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What GBFS data size limitation? The only limitation on GBFS data size is the 32 MB of GBA ROM. If you have more than 32 MB, then everything isn't in ROM space. G6 contains 32 MB of RAM plus a naked NAND flash chip (the same thing as an xD-Picture Card).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, as you said, 32 MB size limitation.
<br/>
I have to 'stream' a big file on my xx Gb card, and past the 32 MB limit, everything goes wrong. It seems I misunderstand things about ROM space and all that stuff. I thought xx GB WAS ROM space, am I wrong? How does it work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it's a solid state disk implemented with flash memory.

The main memory in a G6 Flash card handles like an <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XD-Picture_Card" target="_blank">xD-Picture Card</a>. Like CF and SD cards, xD-Picture Cards are <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/block/" target="_blank">block devices</a>. A program can copy a sector at a time to or from RAM, and libfat abstracts block device access into (more convenient) file access by implementing the devoptab interface.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
