    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, this should probably go elsewhere, doesn't really deserve its own thread, but I wasn't sure where to post it so...whatever. A while ago (about 4 years ago I guess - I was 12 at the time) I wrote a raytracer in javascript (example output see <a href="http://www.wraypa1.f2s.com/wrayal/Sphere.bmp" target="_blank">http://www.wraypa1.f2s.com/wrayal/Sphere.bmp</a>). I always planned to port it to C++ but never got round to it. Of course, then I got my DS a couple of days ago, and wanted to do some development! So, earlier today, I hacked a really simple tracer together. Sphere's only,. no shading or any of that, just simply collision detection and stuff. That's all cusomizable in the source, but unfortunately I don't have that with me, and I have to go away for about a week in about 2 minutes :\. Just thought there might be someone who would find the binary interesting. Takes about 3 seconds to render on a 2.8ghz machine on dualis3. I'm totally pro open source, so I would be releasing the source now if I had it with me. If this contradicts any licenses I'm very, VERY sorry!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm sure it will be very cool once you add some more to it, the bmp was very nice, but the ds demo just draws three flat circles. I guess this is due to not having implemented shading yet?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yeah, it's cos of the lack of shading - sorry. By the time I'm finished it'll look like the bitmap. Plus, hopefully, it'll be dynamic. Render an animation perhaps? Yeah, they are just "circles" - the unshaded 2d representation of a sphere.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As has already been said, was a bit basic. Looks nice though, shows much promise. Are you releasing the source? I'm after as much DS code as I can get at the moment... will you share the love? ;)
