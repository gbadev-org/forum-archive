    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What do you guys think the chances are that developers could use the second screen when people play GBA games on their DS? Use it for something like an area map, or statistics, a splash, or something else that wouldn't be interacted with but could be useful in some way. Of course the same data could be accessed normaly, but if your on the DS you could use the option menu to select something to be displayed on the second screen. That would be a cool if not gimicky way to drive some more sales the DS's way, plus it wouldn't really deteriorate playing it on the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only if Nintendo has allowed a way for such a thing to happen. And the chances are about 50/50 I'd say. But there are good reasons NOT to have something like this happen. They want the DS to stand on it's own, be a true "third pillar".

But pillars don't depend on other pillars to stand, right? :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If GBA programs could have DS extras, then the pirates might package an entire DS game as a DS extra for use with a GBA flash card. I would imagine several reasons why Nintendo would want to close a hole that the pirates would exploit, which I'm guessing is part of the reason that GBA games don't have significant GameCube extras when played on Game Boy Player.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

They also want developers to buy devkits and not just play it safe on the GBA. They are hoping to see some really unique uses of the DS, somehow just enhancing GBA games would only prove the point Sony fanboys are constantly trying to make: "the DS is just a Game Boy with a second screen".<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
