    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys I recently updated my devkitarm from v20 to v30 to try a little DS 3d enguine development. All of a sudden,things don't work too well.
<br/>
<br/>
For my GBA demo, things compile fine but the bin image itself doesn't work.
<br/>
For the DS, the DSTool itslelf gets an error when I compile. 
<br/>
<br/>
When I returned to v20, the GBA demo worked just as before. Of course the DS doesn't compile at all because some of the tools are outdated.
<br/>
<br/>
So any info on this? And until what version is devkitarm compatible with windows 2000<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I compiled an example given to me by a poster here, and it compiled on my work computer(heh) running windows xp. 
<br/>
<br/>
I tried the same at home and ndstool gets an error. I tried compiling one of my GBA projects under r30 and it compiles but the rom image itself doesn't work with the emulators.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course back at the office my GBA projects compiles and runs correctly under r30 as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
So the only reason I could think of is incompatibility with windows 2000. Of course I could be wrong cause I know some of the posters here use old computers as well but there is no other apparent error I could think of.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: My bad. I recompiled my gba project with devkitarm r30 on an xp machine and it didn't work also. I suppose something r30 doesn't like with my code but that is for another time if I can't solve it on my own. However, ndstool might still be incompatible with windows 2000. It says something like

at the end so compilation itself seems fine but when ndstool is required is when things go boom for me.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah I think so. I used the updater to do the installing. Unless its because I didn't update msys along with devkitarm? I only checked devkitarm during the install and I haven't tried updating msys but I didn't do so on the xp machine so I didn't bother doing it on the windows 2000 machine. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the GBA project error, it might have something to do with my makefile cause I don't use the standard makefile, so I'll have to recheck that. Its just the ndstool that 's giving me problems.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suspect it maybe your makefile then as I think the way ndstool looked for the arm7 binary for arm9 only projects changed recently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
