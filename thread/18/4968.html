    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since it has been shown to be possible to load NDS code from the GBA game slot I was wondering if it would be possible for developers to create GBA games that would have DS features when played on NDS?  i.e. Allow the use of the additional buttons, utilize the lower screen or wireless features.

For one thing, the current Nintendo DS booting methods require a card in the Nintendo DS slot. A GBA game can't currently boot the DS by itself.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the main question that still needs to be answered is if a GBA cart can contain a DS cart header or such information so that when the DS runs code from the GBA port (without help from a DS cart or passthrough setup) _CAN_ the GBA cart have access to the additional hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
Does the DS only limit the GBA hardware access to save power when it sees a "standard" GBA header from a commercial cart, where it knows the cart doesn't have code to use the extra hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
We know that when the Mpeg4/MP3 player is released, it will have an SD card adapter that uses the GBA port.  But, will it also require a DS cart to boot from?  OR, will it simply be a GBA cart and not use the additional features of the DS?  Same question for a GPS receiver (if it exists).  Or any other GBA port "accessory" that will use the DS touchscreen or wireless.  Do they _HAVE_ to boot from a DS cart?  Will all accessory manufacturers that use the GBA port be required to have a DS cart to boot off of to have access to the additional hardware?
<br/>
<br/>
I guess we won't know for sure till A) someone leaks this kind of info, B) a product is released for the DS that is only in a GBA cart package, but has access to the touchscreen/wireless, or C) someone is able to hack a header together that allows the DS to boot from the GBA and access all hardware (without a DS cart or passthrough setup).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Likewise, the GBA game can get the Bios checksum, which is different on the DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's possible : look at NDS game packages. They come with both an NDS and a GBA cartridges slot.
<br/>
<br/>
As for whether it's technically possible, I have not investigated the question. Maybe Nintendo planned to do this when they designed the game cases/boxes but they may have been retreated since ...
<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
About the GBA slot in the NDS package : i guess it's for future special module. For example a DS game could include a rumble pack wich will fit in the GBA slot of the NDS (apparently when some flash cart are inserted in the GBA slot, the nds thinks it's a rumble pack). Moreover if you look at the DS manual, it says the GBA slot is an "Expansion slot".
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with TJ as i think the GBA slot (when used without any ds cart or passthrough) can not take the control of all the ds functionalities.

Have the GBA slot with the media player.

<br/>
DS slot has ds cart in it.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS cart runs the software for full touch screen support for accessing
<br/>
the media content on the Media cart in the GBA slot.

<br/>
You would have FULL Video/audio support for tracks/scanning.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Easy. Make a DS passthrough card that redirects to an Option Pak in the GBA slot. This Option Pak, similar to the Supercard, would contain decoder software and an ATA interface for reading a Type 1 CompactFlash card.

Once these passthroughs get commercialized, somebody will probably hack a Supercard to do just this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That is probably just a simple check in the BIOS for detecting which system you are running on. It's one thing to be aware of whether you are running on a GBA or DS, but it's another thing to be able to actually use DS features through just the GBA cart if the DS is detected. It would be nice if it were ever possible, to enhance the experience of a GBA game on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
