    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Feel free to discuss the Nintendo DS in this section of the forum.
<br/>
<br/>
Since the DS will not be released for another 6 months, having a separate forum for it might be a bit over the top.
<br/>
<br/>
When we see a big increase in the DS part of the forum, we might consider moving all the posts to its own forum. Until then I think this will do fine =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Given what some versions of Space Invaders for Game Boy could do (full Super NES game hidden inside for use on SGB units), I'd imagine that Nintendo may want to include a way for the GBA side to "multiboot" the DS side.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Perhaps you could tell us if the DS is capable of multibooting over 802.11, or if it only multiboots over the N proprietary powersaving wireless protocol? Pleeease ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Truthfully, I've only read through the DS Docs stuff a few times thus far and currently am not on a DS title so I wouldn't be able to answer big questions anyways.  I'll keep watching the boards though and help where legally possible though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Homebrew development is a larger threat than full scale piracy. With unlicensed developers giving away games for free, or developing without giving Nintendo any money - Nintendo will lose out.
<br/>
<br/>
Also with the scope of Open Source - <a class="postlink" href="http://www.linux.cu/documentos/archivos/halloween.html" target="_blank">which microsoft see as their biggest market threat </a> - developers will be battling to compete with FREE games that will be of the same quality as theirs.

In the end homebrew may not just bring forth the end of monopolised formats, but the re-birth of quality games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now that's a topic I'd love to debate later this week in the off-topic arena.  I don't have time to formulate a good rebuttal at the moment, but if you could create the thread, I'll get to it as soonas I'm done writing my JPeg Compressor/Decompressor</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I can get that going 50 times faster with better coding techniques (first pass was decoding RGB streams to slow ram then combining and loading into mode 3), but sheesh that's slow.  And that's not even using full huffman for the DCT stream - just a hacked up 1-byte RLE scheme.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the code from the independent JPEG group compiled beautifully on my PC with no effort - kuddos to them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could try a more optimizing compiler as well. But better coding techniques is of course the most important.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
