<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there is any known moonshell version that is known to compile and work?
<br/>
<br/>
I have compiled 1.71 and 1.6ffb3 but they do not work after compile (1.6 works in emu!)
<br/>
<br/>
I have here a short docu about my moonshell compile attempts, and extra info is welcome
<br/>

I have compiled moonshell 1.5, 1.6 and 1.71 successfully. you need older devkit versions as documented (for each moonshell a specific devkit version).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

well I also compile all those version succesfully, but all of them only make white screen on NDS, ok I try again with R17
<br/>
<br/>
but I am curious, you compiled 1.71 with RVDS and it worked ???
<br/>
how come did you fix the ipc3.h ?? there are many errors with it
<br/>
at least, and with devkitpro its real pain to compile 1.71 at all
<br/>
<br/>
PS I have not double posted, I have posted once, and replied to some elses old posting, thats all</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SUCCESS - traversing back the moonshell revisions 0.99 compiles
<br/>
and works
<br/>
<br/>
versions between 0.99 and 1.5 are not tested yet, maybe some newer on then 0.99 also works.
<br/>
<br/>
still interested why 1.5 and 1.6 do not work at all..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
