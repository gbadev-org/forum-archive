I'm assuming you mean "What do I need to flash my firmware?"
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, first you'll need either a *PassMe* or a Wifi card compatible with *WifiMe*, and a GBA cat, or as of...today, a GB Movie Player with hacked firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
The *PassMe* is probably the more straightforward way right off the bat.  Basically it's a hardware passthrough device...needs a commercial DS game inserted into it to work.  It tricks the DS into running DS code from the GBA slot instead of the NDS card.  If you flash the NDS code to the GBA cart, look for an NDS.GBA file (or if using a hacked GBMP if I understand how it works right it would load the code, in this case having the extension NDS from the root directory of your compact flash card), then when you start up the DS with a PassMe inserted, it'll boot that code...so if it's the flashing program, get ready to start flashing, and read the instructions on FlashMe's <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">Homepage</a> carefully.  You'll need a paper clip or something to short that connector, and make sure you are good with the power...if you don't at least finish flashing the secure part of the firmware, you just turned your DS into a nice looking coaster.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so your other option is *WiFiMe*.  Basically this is like a virtual PassMe, it works the same way.  Go <a class="postlink" href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.  You'll need the custom drivers and the WiFiMe data located there...also, it works only with specific wireless cards, this driver.  Look at the compatibility list on the download page...you're in luck if you have one of those cards, then you can get started right away.
<br/>
<br/>
After you flash your firmware, you can also use this to send DS homebrew straight to your NDS via the download play option...which is quite cool. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and another thing...the difference in an NDS file and an NDS.GBA file is this...
<br/>
<br/>
The NDS file uses the standard NDS format...good for sending via WiFi and in Darkain's Multi-NDS loader.  You'll find all official demos in this format, although it's easy to conver them to the other.  The NDS.GBA is this with a loader wrapped around it making it possible to use from a GBA cart using PassMe...it even has a GBA header so that the flashing programs can muck with it all they want and not cause a fuss.  You can find this loader on Dark Fader's <a class="postlink" href="http://darkfader.net/ds/" target="_blank">website</a>.  Look for NDSmall.bin.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by The 9th Sage on Mon Jul 18, 2005 5:12 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Ah, well it doesn't work with a router anyway.  You need a PCI or a PCMCIA wireless card that's compatible. 
<br/>
<br/>
You'll just need to do it one of the other ways then if you don't have or can't get a compatible wireless card.  The cheapest way is probably to get a PassMe, then get a GBA Movie Player and flash it's firmware.  If you have the money get a flash cart though, IMHO.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Er, well find out their model numbers and check them against the list <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.  No I can't do it for ya. :P
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
If the card in question has a * next to it, it may or may not be compatible...it means they changed the chips it used at some point (to where it wouldn't work the custom software, so you may just have to try it and see, not sure how to tell the difference.
<br/>
*end of edit*
<br/>
<br/>
A flash cart is a programmable Gameboy Advance cartridge in this case...you can put GBA homebrew on there, like emulators and stuff if you want, or the numerous public domain games out there, or you can use it for NDS homebrew...I got mine from a site called easybuy2000.  The X-ROM there requires a GBA to flash it, but it's probably one of the better priced cards around and I've had no problems with it at all.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, by the way, you want the set...you need that USB cable.  You do have either a GBA, GBA SP, or GBA Player right?  You need one of those to flash this particular flash cartridge.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">jakerayfiel, you'll never get an answer unless you ask questions in good grammatical form. You should also have correct spelling. Don't use abbreviations, use proper case, use commas and periods effectively and you might get an answer.
<br/>
Also as noted before, you sound like you don't know much about computers in general, and doing these instructions will most likely make you ruin your DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Jake, you can do the leet speak, just keep it to circles that prefer it (not here). On hacker boards like this you just need to revert to proper English. You are also kind of expected to do the simple searching yourself. People came down on you mostly because of the annoying leet speak, but also because the answers to your questions are out there and you can find them by using Search on the forums.
<br/>
<br/>
9th helped you anway and generally you might be helped with easy questions if you're polite about it. chism told you not to try it and he mean that in a polite, considerate way. Hell, I wouldn't try it myself, and I have a half-clue about what to do! None of us want to see you kill your DS, especially if you lack the discretionary income (or the allowance) to finance a new one.
<br/>
<br/>
See if you can save enough for the right equipment (PassMe or PROPER WiFi card, see elsewhere for more info on what works) and a GBA cart. You can pull it off in under $90. If your parents might be unwilling, present it to them as a learning experience kind of thing and see how they react.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...in forums you go to. In every forum I visit there is no leet speak unless someone is screwin around jokingly. As I said, speak it in circles that use it (and many do on the net), but don't annoy us with it. If you think that the majority of good programmers love the leet speak then you're terrible mistaken.

Ah, you should thank 9th Sage for answering your first 10 questions. Learn to search.
<br/>
<br/>
The reality of it is, only a few people really know the answer to your last question. Most of us would have to search for it which is something you are rude to ask us to do. As your post has the "I have a noob question" subject line your chances of being answered by one of those few people is really low. Brush up on your forum etiquette; newbs are welcome here. If you look around there are dozens of posts here with even more newbish questions that were answered very swiftly. Polite, understandable English goes a long way.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
To run DS homebrew on a Nintendo DS, you'll need either a compatible Wi-Fi card (which costs money) or a PassMe adapter and a flash card (which costs money). If you want to use Wi-Fi to run homebrew, and you only want to load homebrew when you're next to your PC (and possibly keep it in sleep mode elsewhere), then you'll need FlashMe. If you don't have a flash card, you'll need to find somebody else who is willing to flash your DS, either through the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=5718" target="_blank">FlashMe Meetups thread</a> or through the paid service that was advertised in some thread either here or on Pocket Heaven.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But once you've made and programmed your PassMe, what are you planning to do with it? Are you going to build your own GBA flash cartridge too?

Of course to install that you will need either a PassMe and either a gba flashcard or a GBAMP or WiFiMe and a compatiable card (forum search for ralink).  If you have none of these and are poor, the PassMe and GBAMP solution is cheapest.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to flame you here but I'm a little curious to your end goals here.   You don't strike me as having the patience for ds homebrew, your creditantials might have been a little more impressive you you spelt perl right, way back when I was 14 I could spell.  As far as I know you can't run commercial DS roms from flash yet, except of course some of the wireless demos gathered from conventions.  The people here were trying to give you some sound advice, even if had a nasty tone most of the time.  Whatever 'hacker' forums you have been to are'nt the real thing, forums like this are, keep that in mind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I tried to help you with a lot of questions, but you want to be led every step of the way, not to mention biting the hand that feeds you isn't really the best way to incur sympathy...in all seriousness, if you just try a bit you'll realize this stuff isn't that hard, especially if you have as much experience as you say.
