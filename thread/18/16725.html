I'm a total newbie and I'm trying to make my first application, I'd like to do something with the wifi, but don't know enough about wifi and wireless, so I'd like to know where can I find a good tutorial about ds wifi programming (for newbies like me). Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">did you look at the dswifi examples that install with libnds? that is a good place to start. that will show you how to init the hardware and send and receive packets when connected to an access point. there currently is not a good/feasible/reliable solution for direct ds to ds communication without an access point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
