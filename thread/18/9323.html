    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just started porting a game I made for the GBA to the DS and I can't get the rotoscale background to do anything. I'm using mode 1 and I can see all backgrounds fine, but when I change the registers (REG_BG2X_SUB, REG_BG2Y_SUB, REG_BG2PA_SUB, REG_BG2PB_SUB, REG_BG2PC_SUB, REG_BG2PD_SUB), nothing happens. Does it not work like on the GBA? How do I fix it? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The information from this tutorial (http://www.dspassme.com/programmers_guide/tutorial/modes.html) says that BG2 on Mode 1 is a rot/scal BG. I believed this to be true, but after looking through this (http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dsvideo), it says this...
<br/>
<br/>
  Mode  BG0      BG1      BG2      BG3
<br/>
  0     Text/3D  Text     Text     Text
<br/>
  1     Text/3D  Text     Text     Affine
<br/>
  2     Text/3D  Text     Affine   Affine
<br/>
  3     Text/3D  Text     Text     Extended
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
BG2 on Mode 1 is just a text BG. I just set it to Mode 2, where BG2 <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> a rot/scal BG and everything worked great. So, that tutorial should be fixed. Also, Dualis doesn't appear to emulate rot/scal backgrounds at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
