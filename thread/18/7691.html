    <h4>#62747 - ebbott - Mon Dec 05, 2005 11:44 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I was thinking if it's possible to create an application that can send and reiceve, through a Railtek compatible wireless network card, Mario Kart DS ghosts [that ones in Time Trial mode].
<br/>
The software should be able to reiceve data when we touch "Send ghost" dumping it into a file; viceversa when we touch "Reiceve ghost" [I have the Italian copy so I don't know the right terms in menu] the application should send the file with the ghost to DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a really good way to share our best times all over the world, and confirm exactly if we've done a good record without making a video or screenshot to our DS.
<br/>
<br/>
In your opinion is it possible?
<br/>
Thanks ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that's officially the best worst spelling of Ralink ever!<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e", 
<br/>
7 is not a "t",

Anyhow, it'd probably involve setting the card up in monitor mode, but then you'd need a second DS to capture the transfer.

Dump the EEPROM with Rain (i think that's the proggy) and explore that is probably easier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

More like a confusion of Ralink with Realtek.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- Who?

You won't need a second DS if you let your computer act like another mario kart copy.. but I guess sniffing it would be easier, yes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That wouldnt matter, as long as you send it in exactly the same way as it is originally, it should have the same result. Unless its encrypted with a time stamp, in which case youd have to work it out, decrypt it and encrypt it every time you send it.

I have the means to help, if you need. Let me know<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://downtou.ne1.net/" target="_blank">http://downtou.ne1.net/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
