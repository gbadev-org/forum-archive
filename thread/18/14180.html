    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to set up code on the arm7, and I need my own IPC region.  So I set up something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
//occupy ram past the end of devkitpro IPC @ 0x027FF000
<br/>
#define NEOIPC ((volatile TNeoIPC*)(0x027FF800))
<br/>
<br/>
Whenever code on the arm7 side touches this struct, it seems to freeze the system.  Both the arm9 and the arm7 stop working.  All tests are done on a real nds.
<br/>
<br/>
The arm9 can access it just fine.  The arm7 can access the standard devkitpro IPC just fine.  Is there something I'm missing?
<br/>
<br/>
[edit]
<br/>
Just thought I'd add that TNeoIPC is 12 bytes, so I don't think I'm overflowing memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seems I solved my own problem.  I just have to wait a while on the arm7 side before touching NEOIPC.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still curious as to why I need to wait though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
