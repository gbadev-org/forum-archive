<br/>
I wanted to know, what's the format of paletted textures. Since I tried my best using it and gfx2gba, but nothing:( Is there a prog out there that does this work?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx a lot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Unfortunatly I did not actualy write that demo. There are no public tools to put the textures in the correct format although the conversion should be strait forward. 
<br/>
<br/>
For simple transperancy in textures all you need do is use color index 0 for 256 color images as the transperant color or leave the alpha bit clear for 16 bit textures on the pixels you wish to be transperent. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the more advanced texture formats with alpha componants you will need a custom tool which allows you to combine an alpha map with a low color bitmap and sets alpha bits and texture bits accordingly. This is actualy very strait forward and if I have some time this weekend maybe I will whip up a couple of tools to do this.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Since I thought I did exactly this, but didn't get it to work, I'm trying to do things in an other way right now. (Which is more elegant when it comes to my program's visuals anyway.) If this is any help to you, and you can get it to work, let me know how you did it (using what tools etc).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
