Stupid question for the mac devs out there. Is there a DS emulator for OSX, or should code be tested the hard way ? In that case, what hardware is needed, beside the DS ? (lost in all the passme, wifime, etc, etc options)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You need all the stuff tepples said but these are the mac specific things
<br/>
1. A F2a or F2a Ultra card and linker cable are the only mac compatible cards still produced

<br/>
<br/>
2. Passme from lynx's store

<br/>
<br/>
3. A gba or gbasp (f2a cards need a gba to write to the card)
<br/>
check ebay if you don't already have one
