    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a question related to DLDI. I just recieved my R4 and libfat seems to bail out although I had tested it with an DSXtreme and it worked. I also see that there's some wierd calls at one time in my sound code that uses the FIFO although I didn't even start the streaming.
<br/>
<br/>
I've looked quickly at the R4 code and I see code related to 'commands' that looks like the arm7/arm9 communication. Also, in card.h there is:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">CARD_DATA -&gt; REG_IPC_FIFO_RX</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
which seems to hint libfat might use the FIFO.
<br/>
<br/>
So my question is: is there any special precaution to take if using the FIFO &amp; libfat at the same time ?
<br/>
<br/>
And if I'm dreaming all of this, what are the steps to debug why r4tf does not work while the dsxtreme did ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any pointers.. I have no way of testing my code at the moment :(
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers
