<br/>
it appeared to me that not only were they all jamming together with their DS', but that each DS was playing back all of the sounds mixed together.  Either that, or they had each DS miked -- it sounded pretty loud to me, even as the camera moved around the group.
<br/>
<br/>
If all of the DS units were playing back in synch, it makes me wonder how they solved not only the issue of sound latency, but also network latency.  I'm assuming that they used some sort of network broadcast, with timing info attached to each message.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW -- does anyone else have any info on this title?  Is it just a demo?  or is it something that's actually going to be commercially released?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you look at the ground in front of the grey-suit man, you will see a speaker, which is hooked up to his DS. This means that he is probably the host for the group link, and all that everyone else is doing is playing notes for specific intruments that are sent wirelessly to his DS, integrated with his own notes and intrument, and his DS outputs the group's combined data out to the speaker.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I actually invented that thing too, about 3 weeks when i was trying to fall asleep. "There's one thing that the gba lacks, which it could be done, that's mod trackers"  last thing i remember is deciding on the tone layout  which was quite identical to their choice.. Of course, it was initially a rip from Zelda: OOT's ocarina system...
<br/>
<br/>
Well then again i would like to see some an more advanced version of pictochat, ( few layers , watercolor , airbrush , color-palette) . It's a bit sad that there isn't any pressure sensitivity, but well you can do some very nice stuff without it too. Given that you have access to brush-size and brush-opacity sliders.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually i'd settle with pictochat that has a save image feature. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://manifested.ath.cx" target="_blank">http://manifested.ath.cx</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
