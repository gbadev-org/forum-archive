    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well...
<br/>
Im experimenting with liblobby, which is used in the same way as libnds...
<br/>
and I want to use both screens as text output...how do I do that ?
<br/>
(without having to manually set the pixels on the upper screen...)
<br/>
<br/>
PAlib has this option, but I have no idea how to put liblobby to work with PAlib.. the arm7 and arm9 builds from liblobby confuse me...
<br/>
<br/>
and it would be nice if libnds and liblobby were better documented or the documentations better accessible...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
gonna try it out...
<br/>
<br/>
but still, how DO you print text on the 'main' screen... ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What is text? Text is a string of objects called <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_%28computing%29" target="_blank">characters</a> that convey meaning. When they are fixed on a page or screen, the characters are represented as lines of graphic shapes called <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph" target="_blank">glyphs</a>. To learn how to draw these glyphs, see <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=6775#6775" target="_blank">Graphics: How do I write text?</a> in the FAQ, and see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm" target="_blank">TONC</a>. I could walk you through doing all this in libnds, but you're using PAlib.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, I know what text is...
<br/>
yes, I know how to print to the main screen on PAlib, since its frigging documented
<br/>
and no, you still haven't answered how to write to the main screen using a predefined function like printf or iprintf (libnds) instead of doing it manually ??
<br/>
(and no, I dont care about your ancient links do GBA development..)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you know how to puts() to both screens, have you considered using siprintf() followed by some device-specific puts() workalike?
<br/>
<br/>
And there was a reason that I linked to GBA stuff: over 90 percent of the video-related concepts still apply.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks
<br/>
<br/>
but still, no I have no idea how do use puts to write to the upper screen, perhaps writing to a specific stream 'related' to the upper screen.. like stdout on linux...
<br/>
<br/>
but..sorry, google didn't help...
<br/>
<br/>
and as for the GBA links... I know the same principles apply, but when it comes to printing to dual screens...which GBA didn't have.. I guess the GBA dev won't help (unless I know what is diferent in the two devs..which I don't..)
<br/>
<br/>
and Ive searched for the prototypes of the output related functions in the libnds include folder...but nada...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a post where some dude got printf() working for both screens, by using the advanced consoleInit() functions to setup the console to use a different screen map and char addresses. Keep searching the dev forum and you'll find it.
<br/>
<br/>
But it was using libnds's console stuff, I don't know how that'll apply to PAlib, nor if PAlib allows you to choose which BG the console text will be printed to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
