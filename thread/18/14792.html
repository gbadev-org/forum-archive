    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was wondering if it is possible to use my supercard lite micro sd slot 2 card as external ram, if i buy a supercardDS ONE sd? 
<br/>
if it is possible, is it as easy as plugging it in or do i have to put special firmware or what? will i have to use my sd card (1mb) as the ram or is it built in? 
<br/>
<br/>
sorry, but i have absolutly no idea about how ram works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep it's easy - just plug it in and any homebrew app can use the memory, assuming it supports slot-2 memory. I leave my ez 3-in-1 RAM permenantly plugged in.
<br/>
Don't forget to hold down select though when turning your DS on (with the supercard one plugged in) to boot from slot-1.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok thanks, thats good to hear.
<br/>
Will i need to use the SD card(1mb)? as i only have the one at the moment, and not realy bothered about extra storage, and would rather take the SD from slot 2 and use it in slot 1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You just need the card plugged in. You won't need an SD card in there for it to function.
<br/>
HOWEVER, I do find sometimes with the memory in the Supercard that it will just refuse to work until I go into the card's menu then reboot to my M3 Simply and it'll be fine... I think the menu sets something up. It may not do this set up if there's no card in there. 99% of the time though it'll be ok to run without a card.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i'm pretty sure that you don't need to do this unless your DS is flashed :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK there's only three homebrew applications which use Slot-2 for extra RAM at the moment, QuakeDS (which you already know about), Moonshell uses it for larger images/mp3's (I think) and DSLinux.  Be warned that Slot-2 RAM isn't particulary fast compared to system RAM hence it isn't the magic 'cure-all' bullet for the DS's low RAM, but it is significantly faster than streaming from media.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SNEmulDS and moonlight's ImageViewer also can use it i believe.
<br/>
<br/>
however no applications seem to rely on it to the degree that they can't run most functions without it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
