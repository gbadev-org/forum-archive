my name is Tomer. I used to do GBA coding (Quake 1 demo for GBA).

i wanna do some DS, but pretty confused with what's going on.

It seems that the emulators can't render 3D, am I correct? . Does libNDS implement all of the GPU functionallity?  Where do I start?

Me and ny friend's goal is to design a commercial 3D engine for a game,

iDeaS emulates some of DS 3D capabilities, but the best way to test is to try everything on hardware. 
<br/>
<br/>
To get familiar with implemented in libnds 3D stuff, take a look at it's  documentation, source code and examples - there are 11 lessons of NeHe converted by Dovoto.

It's perfectly possible to do proper 3D rendering in fixed point. It's just quite inconvenient :)

thats just silly...fixed point is actualy more accurate than floating point (in the same number of bits)...the only advantage to floatng point is speed (not an advantage on any system with no or crapy fpu) and convenience.
<br/>
<br/>
That out of the way,  there is no fpu on the ds.  All math is done in fixed point allthough there are floating point gl wrappers for many functions...to get a feel for gl on the ds look at the nehe examples which use float then compare 10 to 10b as 10b uses much more DS appropriate code.  Fixed point is definatly a pain in the ass at times but it is very usable once you get used to it.  You will loose a bit of accuracy (as the DS fixed point has only specific formats) but these inaccuracies will not be very noticable on the small screen and will be much less anoying to you than the DSs lack of texture filtering.
<br/>
<br/>
There are some aspects of 3D that still have not found it into  the library such as the compressed texture format, a few miscelanious texture formats (which i have info for but have not found the time to test), and hardware fog and collision which we are fairly certain exist.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know about the frustum thing, but this isn't true.  Floating point has the very important property of distributing representable values so that fractional precision is reduced for large numbers and increased for small ones.  The significant digits are spent exactly where they are needed.
<br/>
<br/>
In fixed point, you have to spend 12 (or whatever) bits on fractional precision even when you're dealing with numbers measured in tens of thousands, and you have to spend 19 (or whatever) bits on integer precision even when you're dealing with numbers measured in a few thousandths.
<br/>
<br/>
You might argue that you could allocate a different number of fractional bits depending on your range of expected values, but this limits variations in scale.  If you want your world to have worms crawling on the surfaces of barrels and clouds soaring over entire islands (to steal an example from an engine demonstration for Black &amp; White), then you'll want your coordinate system to have a wide range.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But the farther you get from the origin of the coordinate system, the less precision you have. Wouldn't players notice if worms inhabited the northwest corner of the map but couldn't leave it because of roundoff error that increases as the coordinates get bigger? You need the precision spread out evenly over the map, which is only possible in fixed point.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I wouldn't necessarily say that... Floating point loses accuracy as it gets farther out, but fixed point just overflows and doesn't work at all.

<br/>
Actually, vertices are transformed directly from modelling-coords to clipspace/viewspace, so they never get quantised to a worldspace fixedpoint grid. By putting appropriate scales/translates into your modelview matrix you can create models as finely detailed as you like, and position them miles from the origin with no loss of precision. What's more, you can embed these translates and scales inside display-lists (the DSes native model format) so they happen transparently to your rendering code. With a good enough art-pipeline, the issues you're concerned about basically disappear.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, a worm sat on the surface of the earth gives you around a 1,000,000,000:1 ratio in sizes, which is quite doable with 32 bits of precision for scaling. And I don't think the B&amp;W planet was *anywhere near* the size of the earth.

Not quite, that will involve storing 64-bit positions and doing 64-bit math.
<br/>
<br/>
What I had in mind was for the characters to handle AI/collision detection/etc relative to their sector's center, so their positions are always small enough to fit in eg. 32 bits.
<br/>
<br/>
Then when rendering, subtract the camera position from the sector center, and add that to the position of the characters in that sector.
<br/>
If sectorCenter-camPos is too big (will cause the chara positions to overflow), then that sector is too far away to be drawn anyway, so don't.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

Add oldSectorCenter-newSectorCenter to his position. Sector positions would probably all be integer coordinates, or scaled down even further if necessary.

The subtraction there would be 32 bit, and then you could shift the result up to fixed-point (assuming sectors are close enough together that the difference will never be huge).

Since the camera would probably have to be done in 64-bit for a system like this, the subtractin would be 64-bit as well. No big deal compared to doing ALL your game logic in 64 bits.

If you're going to split the 64-bit coordinate system into sectors at bit 32, then why not split it into subsectors at bits 16 and 48 too? Heck why not split it after each bit? This representation is called the "quadtree" or "octree" representation.

Hmm, that could get complicated... might need to make the characters aware of the 4 nearest sectors, so you can swap them out before they get close to the boudary.

No-one's suggesting that FPUs are a bad idea, only that the lack of an FPU doesn't limit what you can render as much as you think it does.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't say a thing about rendering.  What I will say is that we have 3 different vector length functions: one for vectors that are known to be short, one for vectors that are known to be long (more than around 720 units), and one for vectors of unknown length that checks the maximal component against a threshold to determine whether an overflow is possible and then forwards to the specialized version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are some aspects of 3D that still have not found it into  the library such as the compressed texture format, a few miscelanious texture formats (which i have info for but have not found the time to test), and hardware fog and collision which we are fairly certain exist.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Hardware collision? I want to know how that's supposed to work. Does Mario 64 DS use hardware collision? You mean collision detection right?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
