    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering...When playing a game with my GBAMP, I have noticed lagging in both the games I have tried, both patched. My Max Media Player does not do this. I have a 2GB CF in my Max Media Player, and only a 32MB in my GBAMP. Is the size difference affecting my read speed so much as to where lagging occours?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Like tepples stated, other files accessed by the .nds program can be larger than 4 MB (for instance, running a 10 MB mp3 file from Moonshell), so perhaps if the card speed is slow, lagging could occur.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried swapping the cards?  Or just using a completely different CF card for your GBAMP?  It could be the device or it could be the card or it could be faulty programming of some sort, but until we isolate the problem it will be hard to fix.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For your information, I was running DScent and Doom for DS. Two games that are very well above the NDS's 4mb of ram with all the included files. You need to pull the stick out of your ass. Thank you Dan for your help, I am going to try a 256mb card. I thought it was impossible to run commercial roms on the GBAMP, but since you jumped straight to piracy, I suppose you know how to get around that little flaw? Apparently you do, or else you're misinformed about what I'm talking about. And by the way, what commercial games use DLDI patching? That's what I thought.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But anyway, what stuff are you finding lagging? My gbamp is my favourite flash card and I'm finding it *very* non-laggy. It could be your CF card?

Hehehe, the part about the GBAMP was actually the reason why I asked you to give us more info, rather than assume you were a pirate monkey (Although that was my initial impression...)
<br/>
<br/>
DoomDS doesn't always run fast because the engine hasn't been ultra-optimised for the DS. The frame-rate can be rather variable.
<br/>
<br/>
DScent is pretty new, so I'd expect the frame-rate to improve with releases...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

1) it's been known that the GBA MP can run commercial romz for.. oh.. what?  2 months after Chishm released the firmware patch?  He did it just to prove that CF isn't to slow, and that it could be done.  He never released it, but others have released their own patchers..
<br/>
<br/>
2) Where in your original post do you even mention DLDI?  So, normally when someone mentions patching.. they aren't talking about DLDI.
<br/>
<br/>
I appologize for assuming you were talking about illegally downloaded warez romz, but 9 times out of 10, that <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> what people are talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
I played DSdoom downloaded from DSOrganize homebrew database (shareware .wad?) and haven't seen any lag..
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when you play &gt;4MB MP3s, do you here any lag?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any problems with my 2GB CF card in my GBA MP..

Any user can see if a post has been edited by the original poster, but not by a moderator unless the moderator leaves a message at the bottom of the edited post (like I do when "subject line fairy" visits articles). As a moderator, I don't see any additional message for posts edited by a moderator either. Nor do I know whether admins can see whether a moderator has edited a post.
