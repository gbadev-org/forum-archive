    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many games played better on Spectrum. The first that comes to mind is "stop the express" where the spectrum version was  by far the best for me. C64 obviously had the better graphics and did not suffer from the classic "Colour clash" ahhh those were the days</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm helping to beta test DSpec, and it's very good. 
<br/>
<br/>
It emulates a 48k spectrum and will load .SNA and .Z80 files (no .tap support yet) By default the controls are set up as a kempston joystick, but you can reconfigure them to anything you want, and then save a config file for that specific game. 
<br/>
<br/>
TheHive has made great use of the touch screen for when you want to play adventure games or games that require a lot of typing.
<br/>
<br/>
It also has the option of doing real time save of the game to your card, but this is very buggy at the moment and it's hit and miss. 
<br/>
<br/>
All in all it's looking good. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I assumed that thier would be one built from the ground up as opposed to a port.

But thanks. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
