    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi folks, I posted this over dswifi forum as well but seeing as that is a rather dead forum, I decided to ask here.
<br/>
Basically I tested the dswifi download speed downloading from a local server and then on my vps. The speeds were quite dramatic in their differances. I then tried downloading a file over http and got the same result as with dlong from my vps. I can condirm that one other person has experienced this as well. Does anyone know a solution for this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't say really fast, although it does seem to perform better.  When I'm using scp to copy stuff (secure, so it uses more CPU than plain old ftp) I see around 100kb/s burst which then falls to around 40-50.
<br/>
<br/>
It may be due to the different FIFO/IRQ implentation in DSLinux rather than libnds's
