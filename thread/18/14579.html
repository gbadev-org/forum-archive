    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Me an my friend were talking last night about all the homebrew and mods made for/to the DS, when i came across the idea of getting 2 DS's, taking the touchscreen from both, and putting them together, to make some sort of double touch screen DS. possiblilities are almost endless with duel touch.
<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if anyone has ever thought of this, or if it is actualy a possible thing to do.  anyway, just an idea.
<br/>
<br/>
(i saw the video of the bloke who modded the ds to work on a massive touch screen, and i think this is much better... in ways)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by jay001 on Wed Nov 28, 2007 6:00 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Neat idea, but I don't see it really being practical for the most part.  If you wanted to just swap the top screen with a touch screen, you would also need all the required hardware to interpret that touch.  Now, you might be able to hook the touch screens up in parallel, which may give the user the ability to use either touch screen, but it won't really add any functionality, that is, if the communications with the touch screen is dumb (as in passive) enough to let you take input from both screens at the same time.  
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you wanted them to operate independently of each other.. that's a whole different story.  You'd need all the supporting hardware to interface with the second touchscreen as well as software to be able to talk to the second touch screen.  I think, for the most part, it would have to be like an option pack where homebrew knows to read from the second touchscreen (like homebrew knows to read from the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndsmotion.com" target="_blank">NDS Motion Card/Pak</a>), it wouldn't work with commercial games.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, you have melw's idea of:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">You could just use 2 DS's, read the touchscreen on both and exchange local (wireless/serial) data between them? </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Which would probably be the easiest way.  Of course, it won't all fit into a nice package like the DS-Lite, but you could build your own case that basically was the bottom half of two DSs using either WiFi to communicate between them, or hardware something between the slot-2 ports.  Take off the extra controller parts and put the original DSs speakers on top of them.
<br/>
<br/>
But, with most mods.. when you get done, you have $260 worth of hardware for what?  A second touchscreen?  Doesn't seem worth it to me.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
