    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I was looking at the FCC photos from the following link:
<br/>
<a href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=477796&amp;native_or_pdf=pdf" target="_blank">https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=477796&amp;native_or_pdf=pdf</a>
<br/>
<br/>
When I looked at the P9 connector.  Nothing too exciting there until you flip it over and see the following indications.
<br/>
<br/>
VIN  (Video IN)???
<br/>
SW  (On the reset of the board SW stands for Switch)????
<br/>
VGND (Video Ground)
<br/>
<br/>
I strongly believe there is some video out perhaps composite.
<br/>
There wouldn't be audio out, because that would be done through the headphone jack.
<br/>
There are 6 connections and two of them are used for Power.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>_________________<br/>│?ig │

All of this is research. You are going to see theories come and go. Things you think can't be done, will be done. But because you are here, you'll be the first to know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also the extra pins in the power connector are identical to the GBA SP - they are for GBA SP headphones.

I dont see how it would be good using the DS on a TV anyway.

Videos on game sites. Which makes me wonder how IGN.com and GameSpot.com get direct feeds for DS games. And during the Nintendo Gamers Summit, they had a cable coming from that port. Now, I doubt it was used for power as the demonstration they showed only lasted an hour so it must have been for something else...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most likely it was a specially made unit, possibly a special edition dev unit, that allows for things like TV out.  In that case, the plug would be VERY different, allowing for extra connections without crippling the original functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
But one thing is for certain:  that little port on any consumer unit does NOT allow for TV out... only power in and audio out.
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it have been cool if they allowed the DS to be smart enough to detect speakers plugged into both the front and the back, and allow games to use them for true surround sound (as long as the game was programmed to use the feature, obviously)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I figure they're debug/testing machines (screenshots for bug-replication process), either that or they have some sort of additional chunk of hardware added to them that dumps framebuffer to memory cards.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And about the interference.  The video is displayed on the TV but it is static.  If your calculator does this the same, then when you press 2 you would see 2 on the tv screen.

The TV signal, as generated by a game console's video chip, has 640x480 pixels. A hypothetical DS-on-TV adapter would use two stacked 256x192 pixel windows.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That was the "Nitro Emulator" made for the Dev Kit, which is built by "Intelligent Systems". They also made the "WideBoy Advance" as well as many popular Nintendo games.

Factor5 has been making the MusyX audio driver for every Nintendo system N64/GBC and later.  On all systems, surround sound is possible, using only 2 analogue channels (left and right), and still has very good quality (a good test case for this would be to play Star Wars Rogue Squadron and do the TIE Fighter audio test).  Theoretically, it would be possible for a commercial GBA game to have surround sound capability, provided there is a surround sound system that could plug into a headphone jack.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

heard of dolby pro logic II? (used by almost every first party gamecube game) it creates virtual surround using just stereo inputs. i've got cables that go from headphone jack to 2xRCA, so it wouldn't b that hard to wire it up, except u lose ur portability

ne one want to help me develop a set of headphones with two speakers mounted on each side and a dolby pro logic II decoder chip somewhere between the headphone jack and the speakers? ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
