Of course everybody does a few spelling/grammar mistakes once in a while, but newcomers, PLEASE take time to check through your posts, and concentrate on you writing. I often run into posts in this section that is hardly understandable, which makes coming here a bad experience compared to the rest of the forum.

Now the people that nitpicked his post were probably US/GB but they were just noting his errors as hypocracy.

<br/>
I am american, and I bet you it is mostly americans that are using the improper grammar/spelling.  I use a broswer with spell check so it makes my typos a little easier to catch.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as proper dutch, I think most dutch people speak great english.  I think Amsterdam is a great place for an english speaking person to visit on their first trip to a foreign country.  You get exposed to a country that speaks another language, but pretty much everyone also speaks english which makes it less intimidating.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I don't know, can non-Americans stop always assuming that Americans have feelings of superiority? Its becoming a tired cliche to a lot of generous and good hearted Americans. If the situation were reversed and Americans were making such generalizations, I can just imagine the response. :) :)

But anyway, this is getting off topic. I think the main problem with spelling has less to do with origin and more to do with age. Some of the posters around here are very young, either in highschool or even earlier. You don't tend to respect spelling at that age and the mind races to type. I am an old man by comparison and I recall those days.. Maybe a little bit more dilligence would serve the average visitor. But in the end its not such a big deal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you're right, and its a fair point. Its one thing to have an unchecked spelling or improper grammar, and its another when its obvious people are abbreiviating and rushing through their email that it flat out doesn't make sense.
<br/>

Unfortunately its always been this way on the Internet :) *sigh*...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I usually refrain from any post that criticizes people, but in this case I think it is truly constructive criticism. My intention isn't to hurt anyone's feelings or to get on a soapbox.

Every post you make to any forum adds to a mental picture that others in the community form of you. People are less likely to help you and listen to your opinions if they don't respect you. There are dozens of people on this forum who I hold in very high regard because of their "keyboard" personality and their willingness to help, and I have never met any of them. They could be younger (dagamer) or seasoned professionals (miked) or whatever. It doesn't matter to me. In this space you get to define yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
If your purpose is to share an opinion or to receive help, you will get a better response if you *at least* capitalize your sentences and use basic punctuation. None of us are grammar nazis, but run-on sentences are hard to understand and they make you sound like a child. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is a fact that many individuals on this forum have been offered jobs in the game development industry based on their reputation and project contributions. If this is something that sounds desirable to you, then write every post as if you were writing it to a prospective employer. :)
