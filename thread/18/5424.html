<br/>
<br/>
Also, how do I print an integer using consolePrintf(), or should I use a different function?  Thanks for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't know the answer to your first question, but to print an int with printf, do something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
int i;
<br/>
consolePrintf("The value is i is %d",i);
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
and it will put the value of i where the %d is. YOu can also do this with more that one variable, like so:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
int i;
<br/>
int j;
<br/>
consolePrintf("The value is i is %d and j is %d", i, j);
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
and it will put the variables into the %d markers in the order they are listed</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yay, thanks very much..  I'd tried using %d but I'd forgotten the integer name had to go after a comma...  D'oh..   For the while I was using consolePutInt() which wasn't fun, trying to guess X and Y values..  But now I don't have to, thanks for your help..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the example programs (eg hello world) near the start of the arm9 main function you'll notice some functions are called - can't remember the names exactly but along the lines of SetMode and SetBank - involving BG0. there are *Sub versions of some of the functions, and SUB_ versions of some of the definitions - I'd suggest looking up all the calls that look like video initialisation in ndslib/include/NDS/arm9/video.h - thats how I figured out how to do it :) I'd give you some code if I were at home, but I'm at work at the moment so I don't have access to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently you can not print to both screens at the same time as there is only state variables (cursor position and that sort of thing) for one screen at a time.  You can however print to either sub or main display and any background layer as long as you specify the correct color depth to the init function.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
