    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How does the DS handle software interupts in DS mode? I know that for GBA linux that had to modify the way the OSs software interupts(system calls) worked. Is it necessary to do this for the DS or can we actually define these software interupts where they are sapposed to go? If it is necessary how would one do this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">swi interupts are directed to the bios.  As far as i know there is no way to overwrite or redirect them to your own code.  NDSLIB allready contains code to access most of the bios software interupts.  You can check the user guide if this is what you are looking for.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
