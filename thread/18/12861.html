    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can try dropping "frame buffer" mode and using "extended rotation" mode, which does everything that "frame buffer" mode does plus more. The big caveat is that you have to set bit 15 of every pixel. Or is there a reason that your project cannot use "extended rotation" mode?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, in fact, i'd like to know if it's possible to flip horizontally or vertically the display directly ( not using BG_... or sprites or extended stuff, but with VRAM_***_LCD ).
<br/>
Maybe with the window coords?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about your project precludes the use of background- or sprite-based flipping? Are you trying to flip an entire screen, including its sprites, its 3D scene, and its raster effects?
<br/>
<br/>
Window coordinates only determine which backgrounds are present at which parts of the screen. It's not like the "window upper left corner" in a GUI, which is more like a sprite position or background scroll position than the "windows" of the 2D core or the "window" of the Game Boy Color.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it's possible. The framebuffer is a very limited mode, that let's you do all the rendering.
<br/>
<br/>
Like tepples suggested, use extended rotation backgrounds. It is basically the successor of the framebuffer.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
