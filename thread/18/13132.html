    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI, 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to this forum, and new to DS developement. i want to make some bike racing game in DS. i want to emphasize more on physics sysm of the game rather than on rendering of the game. 
<br/>
<br/>
sice there is no floating point calculation in DS i've to go for fixed point calculation. this is worrying me a bit... i'm afraid that i'll get weird results of physics with this fixed point calculation. Is there any way to make the calculation better to get good results?? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could use block-floating point, meaning you have normalized fixedpoint directions, and store magnitude as a separate exponential value. It's not easy to implement efficient on the first try, but once you have the needed classes set up etc, it shouldn't be that tricky.
<br/>
<br/>
Also keep in mind that you _can_ use floating point. It will be emulated, so there is a speed penalty, but perhaps for something as simple as a single bike it won't end up being a bottle-neck?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With 16.16 you can get fractal steps of 0,0000152587890625. I don't think it's that bad. Even if you have a few imprecise calculations, the low screen resolution will forgive it. You could even go 8.24 if you really need to.

Check out my not-so <a class="postlink" href="http://www.box.net/shared/at6hsza9lh" target="_blank">impressive tweening demo</a> with fixed point calculations. Not that it has multiple results within 1 calculation, but it does show that fixed point allow for decent gaming accuracy. Press left and right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
