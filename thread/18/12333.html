No, that'd be <a class="postlink" href="http://project2612.org/" target="_blank">VGM</a>... (I'm not sure that the DS can handle decent YM2612 emulation, though, if I had time I'd find out...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GYM is the old Genecyst sound log format. VGM is a newer format supported by Kega, still logged. All logged formats have trouble reproducing only the music from games without a sound test because the sound effects get in the way.
<br/>
<br/>
Is the YM2612 more complex or less complex than Super NES's SPC700+DSP?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don`t think there is a choice, because there was no standart of storing music data in genesis games.
<br/>
But you could still disable sound effect in most of the games.
<br/>
<br/>
Don`t know about VGM, but I was testing St–πphane Dallongeville`s GYM emulator, few days ago &amp; results are not so good. Even on ARM9. With rate of 22050Hz more then 1 sound channel would give a slowdown. Switching to the 11025Hz gives fluent sound, in the cost of quality(very bad). Also tested emulator from MAME, which performance is even worse.
<br/>
<br/>
I still think it`s possible, but some optimizations needed. (Maybe continued version of Picodrive has them, because I heard it runs with sound? Probably not.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My GBA VGM player is (1) ugly and (2) only supports PSG, so you'd be limited to Game Gear, Master System, Colecovision, Tandy, BBC Micro, PCjr etc for your music.

Getting YM2612 emulation gong on the DS is an issue, as is the possibility of decompressing GZipped VGMs on the fly, but having FAT support would certainly offer some great possibilities.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
