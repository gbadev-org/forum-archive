    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't found any. But I think (correct me if I'm wrong) libnds is just a collection of defines, not something that could have a documentation such as Java... 
<br/>
So I _think_ you're off best with some tutorials and/or examples which show you how it's done. But official libnds docs would be nice :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, it wouldn't be a lib if it was just a bunch of defines... there are also some functions and structures that make it easier to program the nds. so there COULD be a doc like java has. i know ndslib had one, didn't find a libnds doc, though. (ok, i didn't really care that much to look for one ;p)
<br/>
<br/>
but libnds being open source you can just open some headers and sources and check out what's going on... normally one wouldn't need the sources, just the headers that come with the lib (.a) should be enough to take a look at which functions are available and what functionality they have. also, most are named quite clearly.
<br/>
<br/>
just check out the .h headers!
<br/>
<br/>
and i agreee a doc would be a nice addition to the good examples! ;)
<br/>
<br/>
happy coding!
<br/>
<br/>
ps: you might find the ndslib doc helpful sometimes...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

unfortunatly, there is like no commenting in the source code at all.   
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best resources I've found so far are this set of tutorials <a href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/index.html</a>   which won't compile using the methods described there by the way since these use an outdated devkitpro and ndslib, you need to change all references to arm-elf-g++ into arm-eabi-g++, and some of the functions are not in ndslib anymore so it could be quite confusing to new people.. like myself.    
<br/>
<br/>
then there's the example code that comes with the latest DevKitpro, much of which is really well commented.... 
<br/>
<br/>
and through that source code I found this resource here <a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com/documents/DS/ndslib.htm" target="_blank">http://www.drunkencoders.com/documents/DS/ndslib.htm</a>  which is a sort of half baked reference for ndslib.    
<br/>
<br/>
With those things you might have a decent chance at getting up and running fairly quickly.  Best tip is, look through and use the example code, templates, and makefiles in devkitpro... and load the whole Programmer's Notepad projects from the examples to see how it all fits together.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still very much a work in progress. A few more donations might allow us to pay someone to extend this further &lt;/hint&gt; :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
