    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been crawling for info on doing alpha-blending between background layers, but i cannot get it working on my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
basically, 
<br/>
<br/>
* i have SUB_BG0_CR= ...|BG_PRIORITY(1)|BG_256_COLOR, which i'd like to remain "solid" pixels
<br/>
* i have SUB_BG1_CR= ...|BG_PRIORITY(0)|BG_256_COLOR, which i'd like to have translucent, on top of BG0, but which simply stays "solid".
<br/>
<br/>
then i do
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
  SUB_BLEND_CR = BLEND_SRC_BG0|BLEND_DST_BG1|BLEND_ALPHA;
<br/>
  SUB_BLEND_AB = 16 | (4&lt;&lt;8);
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
and there, nothing actually happens. I tried toying with other values for A and B or to swap BLEND_SRC_* with BLEND_DST_* ... 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone knows of a demo / tutorial or whatever which would explain that with a bit more details on what the "source" and "destination" actually means here ?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance.[/list]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">okay ... first of all, my emulator didn't support alpha blending (oh dear).
<br/>
Then i found a demo for sprite-over-BG alpha blending in PA_lib (fun to see the author saying "no idea of what BD_TARGET is" where it's obviously the backdrop, btw :P)
<br/>
<br/>
And that worked fine on my DS. So i guess i'll just study that code to find out how BG-to-BG blending works.
<br/>
<br/>
posted my findings on <a href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/," target="_blank">http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/,</a> if anyone is interested :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

VisualBoyAdvance does. Get α-blending working on the Game Boy Advance platform, and the knowledge should transfer to the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm a bit late with this post as you seem to have figured it out already... :) But I made a blending test once and decided to share it now: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.vilminko.net/henri/nds/dualbg_blend.zip" target="_blank">www.vilminko.net/henri/nds/dualbg_blend.zip</a>

You can play with the blending factors and see what happens... The source code is heavily commented so I hope it might help someone learning to handle backgrounds and other basic stuff too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
