<br/>
I can load and display an MD2 file fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I have created the models in Lightwave, converted them using QData but the skins are funny sizes, if I use a tool to stretch the skins to 128x128 and apply them and then convert the pcx files using pcx2tex and load them the textures are still a little unusual.
<br/>
<br/>
The colours are fine but the mapping just seems wrong. It's not just stretched or rotated, it seems broken into bits... any advice?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have figured out what is wrong. I have a lwo and I convert is using lw_qdata to an MD2 with a forced skin size of 128x128.
<br/>
<br/>
I then convert it using md2todsdl.
<br/>
<br/>
I then use the 128x128 skin bin and the md2 bin but the skins are not quite right.
<br/>
<br/>
This image shows what is wrong... only half the mesh is being mapped. I have tried using maps of different sizes but still things are not right.

<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if I have a fault with the version of qdata or md2todsdl....
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else done similar conversions?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if this would be any help but when i wrote my TGA to my own crap DS raw format convertor I found that i had to flip the image so it was upside down before exporting it and in my DS code (i'm using libnds) i had to swap the u and v texture coordinates around.

<br/>
give that a go and see what happens...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem I have is which tool is wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
I think lw_qdata is mapping both sides to the 128x128.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if the d2todsdl tool is only mapping on side to 128x128 OR if the code I am using to show the MD2 is only mapping one side to the 128x128?????
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
