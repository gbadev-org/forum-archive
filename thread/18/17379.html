    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning to upgrade my PC in the following days. Right now I'm using Windows XP on a single core 32bit CPU. I installed a virtual machine with Windows 7 in order to test my toolchains and see if everything will work fine on my future rig. 
<br/>
<br/>
I had bought a copy of NO$GBA 2.6a with debugging options. I'm using it all the time. SoI tested it on Windows 7, and it keeps asking me the registration password. Everytime I enter it, it works and launches the emulator. But next time, it will ask it again, which is a real pain. I tried to configure NOGBA.EXE to execute in XP Compatibility Mode, but no success. It seems like it can't write the registration information in the registry, or something like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Would someone have a trick to make this wonderful tool work again? I feel really lazy creating a Windows XP VM just for my NDS development toolchain.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That happens also to me on Windows XP. Sometimes it just asks the password again. Everything else works fine...
<br/>
<br/>
It seems that it's just too strict on the key stuff...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, if someone finds out why it's happening, i'm interested in the solution too...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the fast replies. I tried running it as administrator, even tried making this a global setting for all users, but it's always the same. Are you using it under Windows seven?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But the thing was sooo close to being the best thing ever.  he had the emulation near perfect and the debugging near perfect.  Just a few little adjustments and I'd choose it over dev hardware.  Which is probably why he stopped working on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wouldn't it be something if he was gone this whole time because Nintendo hired him to help in developing a GBA/DS emulator for the 3DS (so they could start with a fresh hardware layout without needing prior hardware for backward-compatibility)? This wouldn't be the first time, as the author of jEnesisDS was contracted by Sega to make Sonic Classic Collection. The author also left the DS homebrew scene when he was contracted.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
