<br/>
Someone can say for me wich program I use be able to capture the Download Station RAW data and how I disassemble the data???
<br/>
<br/>
And someone here are intesrested in Download Stations Dump for development purpose? I got here some dumps with the FWNitro 1.6c but I dunno if it's working (yes, some download station is only a DS that only sends demos. ).
<br/>
<br/>
I don't even know if the Dump is a perfect clean dump. Is there a way to confirm if it is a perfect clean Dump? I tried to run in my M3 CF using start button but it's not working.
<br/>
<br/>
If it isn't succeful I will try to capture the RAW data from download station of all demos that has in Vol. 1 ~ 4 US ver...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Well... At <a href="http://wiki.akkit.org/DSDemoCapture" target="_blank">http://wiki.akkit.org/DSDemoCapture</a> It only has the vol. 2 us ver pack.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually I dunno what have in all the dumps that I got...
<br/>
I could't boot the dumps actually.
<br/>
If I had a way to get them boot I would somehow know... ^^; But I think that you have all demos that I have here in these 4 us-vol...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From Download Station that I know I think you forgot to get the Ouedan JAP ver... But this you can get it from the original card... (EBA have different musics from Ouedam)
<br/>
<br/>
In your site in the download section some rows in the table are messed up... oo; Like Magnetica... I?m using Firefox 2.0 in Linux...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Err... Can you say what program you used to be capturing RAW data of these demos?...
<br/>
And how you did?
<br/>
Do I need do anything else after capturing these demo?....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
