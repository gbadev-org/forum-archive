Not necessarily. It might not use any DS features at all, it's most probably just using the GBA functionality of the ARM7... It wouldn't need anything much faster would it?

Sucks that it's Japan-only for now though...

<br/>
<br/>
but if it works with the sp and mpeg4 and mp3s it must have embeded decoders, so it doesnt matter how fast the machine is as long as it can display video from a buffer off of the cart which the gba obviously can.

Well,they can check to see if it is running on a DS at startup and apply certain extra functions from there.
<br/>
<br/>
But I just thought of something. If a GBA/DS can read a SD card, why not also write to it and make it like a REAL memory card for storing additional games saves, downloadable content and such. That would really make a competitive product with the PSP and ensure a good chunk of sales all to itself.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA Movie Player VS Play-Chan!
<br/>
<br/>
PRICE!
<br/>
Lik-Sang sells the GBA Movie Player (GBAMP) for $24.95 with no Compact Flash Card. Play-Chan looks to sell for $49.95 and may(or may not) come with an SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: GBA Movie Player.
<br/>
<br/>
FEATURES!
<br/>
GBAMP plays Text files in nearly all languages, NES roms up to 192kb, specially encoded movies, specially encoded music, and it displays photos as well. The Play-Chan plays MPEG4 movies, and MP3s. No word on photo or text support. Although I doubt it.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: GBA Movie Player
<br/>
<br/>
FORMAT!
<br/>
Play-Chan uses SD cards, no one knows if it will support up to 1GB. GBAMP uses Compact Flash up to 4GB. SD cards are cheaper and smaller. Compact Flash cards are sturdier and in higher sizes.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: Tie.
<br/>
<br/>
MUSIC!
<br/>
The GBAMP plays only 8:1 stereo sound in a WAV like format. It makes files huge. Play-Chan plays VBR MP3s with a bitrate of 32 to 320 and allows you to use normal headphones on your GBA SP without an adaptor.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: Play-Chan
<br/>
<br/>
BATTERY!
<br/>
The GBAMP uses the same amount of power as a normal GBA game. The Play-Chan draws more power than a normal GBA game, cutting battery life in favor of better looking video.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: GBA Movie Player
<br/>
<br/>
MOVIES VIDEO QUALITY!
<br/>
The GBAMP software cuts files down to about 32KBPS when converting. The Play-Chan lets it fly at 1+MBPS.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: Play-Chan
<br/>
<br/>
MOVIES AUDIO QUALITY!
<br/>
GBAMP = STEREO. Play-Chan = MONO.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: GBA Movie Player
<br/>
<br/>
MOVIES TYPE!
<br/>
The GBAMP software will convert anything and everything if you have the drivers to support it. It will convert Real Player files, and Quicktime files straight on. It will also do the same thing with VOB files. The Play-Chan appears to only support a specific format.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: GBA Movie Player
<br/>
<br/>
STYLE!
<br/>
GBAMP is in Famicom-ish Red and White. The Play-Chan is in svelte black. If you imported the Famicom GBA, the look of the GBAMP in it is really cool. Yet, the Play-Chan is still smaller, and nice looking.
<br/>
<br/>
Winner: Tie
<br/>
<br/>
CONCLUSION!
<br/>
Well, so far it appears to be that the GBA Movie Player is a better buy currently. The Play-Chan isn't on the market yet, so who knows? Both devices are cheap enough for people like me to buy both and love both.<br/>_________________<br/>Evilish!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">one other good thing about the gba movie player is that you can read an e-book and listen to music at the same time. music wise tho, the play-chan would be better, as it features a sleep mode if there's no button presses for 30 secs and under this the battery can last for 15 hours (thats in the IGN article too btw)
<br/>
it might be a smart move for nintendo to release a ds card that uses the play-chan and capabilities of the ds so that we can have touchscreen navigation, full 256x192 display on the top screen instead of the 250x160 of the GBA and anything else they see fit, cos the DS is capable of reading from both slots alternatively in a single session (feel the magic for example)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know about you, but devoting both media bays of the DS to playing MP3s is something I'm not willing to do.
<br/>

I was wondering, does anyone know if this plays audio through the actual system speakers?
<br/>
<br/>
Logically it would, but I noticed that the media player not only has a headphone jack on it, but I have never seen a picture of the device in use without headphones plugged into it, and the IGN preview only mentions sound quality from the headphones, and never mentions sound from the system itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i always thought the only way to load homebrew on the gc because of sega was funny. it must be because of the old sonic/mario wars. j/k

<br/>
very true. but so far i havent seen any other proof that they can. 
<br/>
<br/>
also does anyone know if this is going to replace the tv tuner that supposedly nintendo is making? from what ive read about the tv tuner, there will be 2 of them *the pictures i saw of the DS tuner looked to be specifically molded to fit the ds* again it would be very unwise of nintendo to release a tv tuner for DS that doesnt even take up the whole screen. *if* it is a specially made tuner for ds, and *if* it takes up the whole screen, then theres two ways of making that happen.
<br/>
1) ds card, and the tuner works as a "ds option pak"
<br/>
2) it actually is possible to get full screen on the ds through the gba port.
<br/>
<br/>
again if the answer is 2, we would be seeing this technology with the media player. i guess it also depends on how nintendo will market this product, a gba expansion that just happens to be compatible with ds?
<br/>
it will be nice to see what comes of all of this.<br/>_________________<br/>[ds.hack][/ds.hack]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But then how would it remain backward compatible with the GBA SP? This is a GBA product that happens to work with the DS, not the other way around...

<br/>
but the tv tuner is the same size as the base of the ds, the same color as the silver ds, and you can see that it enters the gba slot, and not the ds slot.
<br/>
<br/>
if it wasnt for the fact that the system was molded for the ds, i wouldnt have any of these speculations at all.<br/>_________________<br/>[ds.hack][/ds.hack]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't see why the BIOS would need to be different.  All you'd need is some DS-specific registers mapped to memory addresses that were unused in the GBA (which is almost certainly the case). Then you could check that one bit in the BIOS that did get changed to determine if those DS-specific registers/memory addresses are valid.  Pretty much anything you can do on the GBA you can do without ever touching the BIOS, the only exceptions are interrupts, getting into low-power modes and perhaps some boot-up code.  But none of those would need to be changed in order to allow access to extra memory-mapped registers.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the only issues would be if the ARM7 is just not connected to the DS-specific stuff, if it's intentionally blocked from DS-specific stuff, or if the DS-stuff is just not activated in GBA-cart mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or simply have a register type key sequence much like what GBA games do to detect the presence of a GB Player.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Balloon Fight is 24 KiB. Super Mario Bros. is 40 KiB. Pipe Dream is 64 KiB. Dragon Warrior is 80 KiB. Castlevania, Contra, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid are 128 KiB each. Many homebrew NES games and demos are &lt;= 192 KiB in size as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if probably pirated classic NES games aren't your style, if you hack the GBA Movie Player's pocketnes.gba driver the right way, you can get it to load GBA multiboots rather than NES games, giving you things such as TOD.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
