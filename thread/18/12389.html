Oh, and I'm talking about the actual flash memory, not just the SRAM memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. Do you mean a NAND card in an adapter (easy with libfat and DLDI) or a NOR card (more difficult)? NOR card writing procedures vary per make and model of flash device. Typically, your program has to establish communication with the card's ASIC and with the NOR flash chips themselves.

A lot of GBA flash cards are designed to be flashed inside the GBA, with the data going over a cable between the PC and the serial port between the L and R buttons of the GBA. They need only 3.3 volts to rewrite a sector, but they use (comparatively) a lot of current while doing this, so make sure your DS's battery light is green first.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well specifically, I was hoping to write to my FlashAdvance card. Its the older design, with an external linker - not the "in-the-gba" style of newer cards. I've been looking for some information on my card, but haven't found much of anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The actual <span style="font-style: italic">card</span> part of the old Visoly Flash Advance is nearly the same product as Flash2Advance. It's probably the most widely supported NOR card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples, do you happen to know if it's doable with a neo flash card? i ask you because you know so damn much about the gba/nds! ;) if it works, i'll have a look at the dldi lib.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
