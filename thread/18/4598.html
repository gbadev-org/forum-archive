I think some people have posted that it'll last close to a full day, but not quite.  I don't have a DS myself yet, so I can't really verify that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In some cases it seemed like I may have been able to go two days while it slept but I'm not certain.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it is purely game dependant.  each game can say how much of the hardware to keep enabled or disabled while in sleep mode.  check out metroid, the wireless and touch screen are still 100% functional in sleep mode, however things like pictochat shut off the wireless.  so, much like normal battery time is dependant upon the same, so is sleep mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

Thanks, that makes sense. Is the wireless active in metroid during sleep ONLY when in the middle of a multiplayer game or anytime you put it to sleep? Seems a waste to keep it active.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

wireless is only active in multiplayer mode.  while in wireless mode, the power LED will blink.  you can also test this via packet sniffing.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

I'd say that sleeping it MAY be very close to having it off, but I'd still like to know how long before the green light doesn't blink anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
