Is the 2048 limit on Verticles or Polygons?
<br/>
<br/>
There are many different opinions going around and i want to see some solid data and testing on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That makes no sense. No scene thats 2000 polys would require 6000 verticles to create. Unless the mesh was not joined perhaps.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a scene thats 560 polygons and has 296 verticles.
<br/>
Polygons are usually always higher then the verts.
<br/>
<br/>
I think we need some official data from the big N.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is quite possible that the DS does not store verticies in mesh form but as individual polygons. Although the hardware allows you to specify polys as strips it is likely being translated into indavidual polygons with vertecies being repeated.  This is just an assumption based on observed limits and the fact that specifying strips does not seem to increase poly output in any way.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS doesn't support indexed vert-lists, so the only way to share vertices is as part of a triangle or quad strip.
<br/>
<br/>
I seem to remember that the 2000 poly limit means 2000 *visible* polys, so backface-culled polys don't count towards the total.
<br/>
<br/>
*IF* that's the case, then you can actually have 4000 tris in your scene (assuming half of them are backface-culled). To draw 4000 tris while staying under the vert limit, you'd need your tristrips to be at least 4 tris long on average. The effective quad limit would be 3000 quads, but you'd need the entire scene to be a single giant quad-strip to stay under 6000 verts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
