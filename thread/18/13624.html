<br/>
<br/>
I am new in the Nintendo DS dev community and happy to be part of it ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
I use DevkitPro/Palib and I took a look on the 3D Part and when I look the tutos on the wiki, some of 
<br/>
them refere to PA_3D.h, and when I look in the PA9.h I can see that the 
<br/>
#include "arm9/PA_3D.h" as been replaced by #include "arm9/PA_3DSprites.h". 
<br/>
Does it mean that the 3D in now only handled by PA_3DSprites ? Because now, 
<br/>
for example, I can't find the PA_Init3DDrawing function.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank for you help on that in advance,
<br/>
<br/>
I use the June 15th, 2007 version of Palib
