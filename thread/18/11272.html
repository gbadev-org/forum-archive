    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I asked the author of the program for a peek at the source code, If I get it how/(can) I port the program to run on the DS. I am a beginner progrogrammer starting my sophmore year in college and this would be a great thing to get my skills where they should be. (I know a bit of java as I am in a class right now but it is going really slow and I want to start in c++, I have done a little in the past so I know a few commands) I have access to any programs that I might need, all provided by the CS department at my college. Help is greatly appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Haven't heard jack on this topic yet, if there is a fourm more suited to my question by all means link away. It took one hour for me to debug 2 lines of cod, its a combonation of being really tired, and me not knowing c++, a great learning experience. I am ready for anything after tonight!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is probably the right section, although I am not sure because I don't post things often here, I only tend to read interessting things like a port of MLCad.
<br/>
That's a great tool for building with virtual lego bricks! I would be cool to have it ported over to the DS and make use of the touch screen.
<br/>
I don't think it was an open source program, but if the author is willing to cooperate you might give it a go.
<br/>
<br/>
But what about your programming skills? Have you already done something like this before? Any experience with PC programming? GBA programming? DS programming?
<br/>
You might want to start with something smaller/simpler/easier before porting MLCad and get comfortable with DS programming.
<br/>
<br/>
O and perhaps this thread should be in DS Misc, because it's talking about programming instead of talking about programming code. But as I said I am not sure.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
