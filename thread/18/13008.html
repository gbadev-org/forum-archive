    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi devs,
<br/>
<br/>
After hours of searching and testing I'm ready to give up with the LIBNDS eeprom functions (cardWriteEeprom / cardReadEeprom)
<br/>
<br/>
Are they broken? I'm using devkitpro release 20
<br/>
<br/>
If so, could someone recommend a good reference on eeprom access (read and write).
<br/>
<br/>
If not so, would someone be willing to show a good source example of these functions working? :)
<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate any advise.  Thanks a lot!<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.hazardball.com" target="_blank">www.hazardball.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I recommend the "Cardme" library by SaTa. Cardme is officially distributed with the backup tool REIN; a version of Cardme that has been modified to work with recent versions of libnds is included with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/dx/RAC" target="_blank">RAC</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
I'll check them out and let you know how I get on. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.hazardball.com" target="_blank">www.hazardball.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I managed to get it working somewhat.  The cardme functions did the trick.
<br/>
<br/>
I was confused for a while as I'm using a supercard one and I didn't realise its behaviour of saving was to update the save file after a reboot back in to its menu (so for some time it looked, to me, as though it 'sometimes' worked)
<br/>
<br/>
However, I can't find any emulator which will emulate the eeprom with these functions?  Its not essential, but it would help my testing by a lot.  There's not much information on this topic :(
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the replies :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.hazardball.com" target="_blank">www.hazardball.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, not just me then :)
<br/>
<br/>
I've found its easy enough to call cardmeGetType, and if thats returning -1 switch to using SRAM for slot2/emus.
<br/>
<br/>
A few things I found though, cardmeWriteEeprom doesnt work unless cardmeReadEeprom has been called atleast once before it..  I could look in to it more to find out what is required to be initialised but its all working how I need now and its something I will get back to ;) Now my development can continue :D
<br/>
<br/>
