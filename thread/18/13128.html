    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! I'm drawing a ton of geometry to the scene, depending the object, and before each glBegin/glEnd, I glEnable or glDisabe textures using libnds call, depending on wether what i'm going to draw has textures or not.
<br/>
<br/>
The crap in this case is that in some frames, texture is enabled, and in other frames it's not and it shows everything in plain gray (what i assigned before in glMaterial colors).  I even foreced glEnable( GL_TEXTURE_2D ) right before the call to glBegin so anything has texture, but this behavior still persists.. i may move the camera around and all, and suddendly I get flashes (of 1 frame or more) of the texture being disabled. Texture is enabled most of the time, but it gets disabled by few frame-intervals.
<br/>
<br/>
So, is there anything that may be going on in here that I dont know, that can possibly disable textures randomly?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i found out what was happening, glEnable( GL_TEXTURE_2D ) and glDisable (GL_TEXTURE_2D )  don't work like in OpenGL at all!
<br/>
<br/>
it just changes a register that takes place at rendering time!
<br/>

This isnt mentioned in any docs i've seen, so it would be good to add it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
