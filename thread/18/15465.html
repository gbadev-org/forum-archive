    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Asking about the kit is a waste of time.  People who have it legitimately have to sign extremely strict NDAs.  The penalty for breaking one of those NDAs is that Nintendo will blacklist you, which makes you almost unemployable.
<br/>
<br/>
No official coder will answer you in private, let alone in public.  
<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, you would get answers.  This is a problem for the people who run the forum for two reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Half the answers you get will be people who don't know what they're talking about, are making guesses, or are outright lying.  It's more common than you might expect.  The reason for wanting to prevent that sort of thing is probably obvious.
<br/>
<br/>
2) The other half of the answers you get will be from people who stole the SDK.  They get banned, then they sign up new accounts.  What those people don't understand is that a lot of commercial people, myself included, got their starts in places like this, and gathering information like that from people like that makes you harder to employ.  It also lowers the legitimacy of this kind of place.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the long and short of it is, you won't get a usable answer because it's hard to sort out the people who are guessing from the people who are stealing, but because the people checking have the real thing, they know there are (in hypothetical) leaks in the place, and they start listing people as not to be trusted.
<br/>
<br/>
Laugh if you want; I've been told not to employ someone because of one of those lists.  I complied.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the reason we would prefer that you not ask specific questions about the kit is that, for possibly counterintuitive reasons, it's not just a risk to the people of the board and a risk to you, but it's also going to turn up a bunch of unusable data for you.
<br/>
<br/>
We would appreciate if you would avoid the topic in the future.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's unfortunate that it's not stated more clearly in the rules. After reading the forum rules and seeing the attitude with which they're executed I noticed that the issues of piracy and SDK talk are political first, and legal second. No matter what you think of the law, it's bad politics to practice otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
As StoneCypher said, it's directly detrimental to the forum to discuss these things here. There are two local places that develop for Nintendo that I may apply to in the future. I'm not going to do anything to ruin my chances and it would be a shame if other people made my association with this place a bad thing instead of a good one.
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from being the most innovative products, Nintendo's are relatively underpowered and the least expensive. Wii's are rightly said to "print money" not just because they're so popular, but also because unlike most consoles, they're not loss leaders -- despite being the cheapest. I almost felt bad for having more homebrew for my DS than commercial titles, but this practice allows Nintendo to all but support homebrew on their consoles. They provide no detectable opposition (beyond reasonable piracy concerns) where the norm is vicious opposition.
<br/>
<br/>
tl;dr We have it easy, don't fuck it up. They're playing nice, so act in good faith.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's the deal with the SDK for real.  It's not all that great.  There's nothing really in it to die for.  Like the compiler, the homebrew stuff is already more powerful in many ways and will continue to surpass the Nintendo stuff throughout the DS's life cycle.  It happened on the GBC, it happened on the GBA, it's happening now.  Think of the SDK is a basic starter kit with some very lame, yet have to follow rules that restrict you in many ways.
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing with SDK discussions: If you are a legit Nintendo developer, you already have easy official ways to share and discuss issues with both other developers and Nintendo.  There's just no reason for licensed developers to discuss SDK issues here in a public forum.  Anyone who does is either very, very stuck on an obscure issues or isn't legit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have any specific complaint and I don't know who did the moderating anyway.  My first post that got deleted probably did overstep the bounds by specifically mentioning leaked SDKs for various systems and I was somewhat cognizant of that as I was posting it, so I wasn't surprised to see it deleted.  however, I posted essentially the same questions again without making any direct references and I was very surprised that that one was also deleted, but maybe the moderator didn't notice that it was different.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, what I was asking was just how high level the official SDK is.  My impression from seeing various commercial DS games and perhaps from other sources as well is that it's pretty high level.
<br/>
<br/>
This was in relation to the discussion about PAlib and libnds and I pointed out that even if the official libraries are high level, doesn't mean that they'd be much like PAlib, but I also don't get the impression that they're very much like libnds.  I hoped that someone could say something to that point, but I nderstand the issues about NDAs and warez that make discussing official devkits difficult.

The argument isn't about highlevel vs lowlevel (besides the occasional zealot who says you should write everything in ASM heh). If a well written highlevel library came out, most of the experienced developers would probably be in support of it.

<br/>
Yeah, if you re-read my post, you'll see that I already made essentially the same point.  However, some other comments in that thread made me start wondering how high level the official SDK was.  I wasn't really trying to make any argument (I think if you re-read the whole PAlib or libnds thread you'll see that I often wasn't trying to argue about which was better at all, but people kept assuming that I was), I was just trying to expand the discussion a bit since it seemed like an interesting sub-topic.  But maybe it's not appropriate for this forum.

Nothing would be wrong with that, but looking at all the bad code is very discouraging. Also it's not "their" mp3 player or wifi library, palib maintainers simply found other people's libraries and added PA_ wrappers to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Either:
