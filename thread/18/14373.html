    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anybody know of any SVN clients for Win98?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to use CVS,
<br/>
as I am the only dev working on my SFB game.(which is
<br/>
the project I want to use with SVN)
<br/>
<br/>
I have one for XP,
<br/>
just not 98.
<br/>
<br/>
Using only the XP for this isn't an option.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I want
<br/>
to do this is to possiblely make
<br/>
sharing the source between my computers
<br/>
easier.(I'd have to put up with slow Dial-Up.)
<br/>
<br/>
Another reason is so I can store backups on a server.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The IDE I use,(for PC dev)
<br/>
supports use of the official CVS
<br/>
client.(command-line)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If there isn't any Win98 SVN clients,
<br/>
I guess I'll investigate CVS.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by yellowstar on Wed Dec 19, 2007 10:54 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

That's the SVN client I use on my XP.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try it out later.
<br/>
<br/>
(Both of my computers are being(started recently) played on all day,
<br/>
which makes doing any computer stuff very hard(mainly just
<br/>
getting on the computer))
<br/>
This means it will probably be awhile untill I can test it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well,
<br/>
I tried that.
<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to install correctly.(Unlike uninstall,
<br/>
it didn't display anything about updating config files on startup.)
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to goto a SVN server,(like the wireless lib)
<br/>
it was like it wasn't installed.(it only displayed the "Page not displayed" screen)
<br/>
<br/>
I tried uninstalling and reinstalling,
<br/>
but that didn't do anything.
<br/>
<br/>
I might try the repair function.

<br/>
That might be because of other reasons than of TortoiseSVN  - if the SVN-server has an address that starts with "http://" or "https://" (not "svn://"or "svn+ssh://"), you should be able to view the HEAD revision by just opening the URL in a web browser. If you're not able to do so, the repository might be down, or you might have something configured wrong in your firewall or something technical mumbo-jumbo like that. If you CAN view it in a browser, it COULD be be because the TortoiseSVN client is older than the SVN-version on the server, although I doubt it since TortoiseSVN always explicitly warned me when this has been the issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried the repair function.
<br/>
<br/>
That had the effect of uninstalling.(not a real uninstall,
<br/>
the SVN functions for right-click were gone.)
<br/>
<br/>
The server I'm trying to use is the wireless lib SVN.
<br/>
(protocol is svn)
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is,
<br/>
the tortoiseSVN icon
<br/>
dosen't show up on my favorite for this server.
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to start up the client manually,(after I open the main dir)
<br/>
I get something similar to the following error:
<br/>
"Can't connect to host '...': connection timed out "
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>

Another thing:
<br/>
<br/>
I have IE 5.5.

I didn't see anything about them on the about page.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With a old, slow, Win98,
<br/>
and Dial-Up, it takes longer.(the WebSVN method anyway.)
<br/>
(It's fast enough with my XP
<br/>
with a actual client.)
<br/>
<br/>
Once annoying thing about
<br/>
WebSVN,
<br/>
is, for text files,(like header files)
<br/>
I have to manually download them.(copy and paste to download.)

(Unless there is some other way that I don't know about.)

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>
<br/>
I am googling at the moment,

and I haven't found any

clients.(free ones.)(there's one that looks good,
<br/>
but it's not free.)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT2:</span>
<br/>
Is there Win98 IDEs
<br/>
which have SVN support?(they would need
<br/>
to commit and ect, for differen't projects.)
<br/>
(Projects which the IDE can't open the project file)
<br/>
(They would also need download support.)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT3:</span>
<br/>
I have found RapidSVN.
<br/>
<br/>
I found out that SVN clients
<br/>
on Win98 have problems
<br/>
with passwords.(This client,
<br/>
according to one web page, works.)
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly,
<br/>
It's not as good as Tortoise.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I just
<br/>
need to wait for it to finish downloading,
<br/>
and test it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Do you mean "in no way what so ever"? There is no direct integration between TortoiseSVN and IE, but there IS some integration between most SVN-servers and any web browser. Most SVN servers are based on the http or https-protocol and run <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV" target="_blank">WebDAV</a>, meaning that any popular web-browser can read the content of the repository in a primitive way without any hassle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does Windows 98 support that "web folders" thing? If it does, the Subversion documentation has a section on setting up a SVN server on Apache and allowing it to be accessed using "web folders". 
<br/>
<br/>
When you do so, you'll be able to edit your files, and every time you add or save a file, it will be automatically commited to the repository (that's the drawback: too much useless commits).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, TortoiseSVN doesn't integrate with IE (Internet Explorer). It integrates with the <span style="font-style: italic">Windows</span> Explorer, which isn't a web browser. You can use Firefox (or any other browser) to browse a repository, but it cannot do commits.
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to use the nice right-click menu in Windows 98, I don't see any other way other than using TortoiseSVN 1.1.7 and a matching subversion repository server.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The kind of integration I want is, the client would launch whenever

you want to browse a SVN respiratory.

(Like say, goto the liblobby SVN in Firefox)

I found a list of clients on Wikipedia.
