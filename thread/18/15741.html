<br/>
libdevlight v1.00 (C) Mikael Klasson 2008
<br/>
<a href="http://mklasson.com" target="_blank">http://mklasson.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Small library meant to be used when developing NDS apps/games.
<br/>
<br/>
It let's you easily download and boot your freshly compiled new version from a 
<br/>
web server, all from within the previous version. The whole process takes about 
<br/>
10 seconds for a small .nds file, from the moment you start downloading to when 
<br/>
your new version starts.
<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to check out the included example for info on how to use this lib.
<br/>
<br/>
The reboot functionality is provided by Lick's rebootlib v1.1r. It seems to 
<br/>
only support DLDI, so be sure to keep that in mind. I don't know how compatible 
<br/>
it is with different cards, but it looks very capable and works on my CycloDS.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Install
<br/>
-------
<br/>

As far as _I_ am concerned, you can use this however you want as long as you 
<br/>
don't expect anything from it or me. Seeing as rebootlib is GPLv2 licensed 
<br/>
though, I think I'm obliged to perpetuate that.
<br/>
So: GPLv2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt)

<br/>
You can get it at <a class="postlink" href="http://mklasson.com/libdevlight100.zip" target="_blank">http://mklasson.com/libdevlight100.zip</a>. If you don't already have a nice wifi-based dev system set up, feel free to give it a try. It sure beats swapping flash cards all day. :) I'm all ears if you've got better ideas on how to do some things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you meant that I could use the MIT license instead of GPL then I guess you're right. I don't know anything about the MIT license though... It's not that big of a deal; GPL is fine, unless I've somehow done something naughty by including rebootlib in my lib. AFAIK though, that's not the case as I've released the source code, and all copyright statements and whatnot are intact. I'm just trying to spread some joy, and banish card swapping to the dark corners from whence it came. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The so-called <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License" target="_blank">MIT license</a> is a simple permissive free software license, similar in effect to the BSD licenses and compatible with the GNU GPL. It originated with the X Window System, and the Expat XML parser, Lua interpreter, and PuTTY SSH client are under variants of the MIT license.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
