    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone point me in the direction of the simple source code to display sprites - built on libnds code?
<br/>
<br/>
I can not get these things working. Can't figure out why; and can't find suitable code to copy or analyse. There's no point posting my program because it's been messed on with so much that its probably a million miles away from working.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a little piece of demo code would be greatly appreciated right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">devKitPro comes with some examples. This one seems to be simple even, but I think you should also read a GBA sprite tutorial if it seems hard to understand. So on your hard drive, in the location where you put devkitpro:

Have you got a link to where I can download them?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But I've just found them on the devKitPro SourceForge site (thanks to Jasper and a very well timed post). Didn't see them before because I was only looking at the Latest File Releases section.

My own fault for not reading the web page properly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
