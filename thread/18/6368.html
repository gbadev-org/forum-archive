The other half of the wireless option is wireless networking. Nintendo didn't clarify which flavour of 802.11 networking it would support (either the 11Mbps 'b' or the 54Mbps 'g'), but even the former is likely to be sufficient, and Nintendo did expressly confirm that online multiplayer via wireless networking will be another tool in the developer's arsenal.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Is there anybody that tried using bluetooth to hack the ds?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I also found out this :

<br/>
all current wireless runs on an 802.11 standard, meaning that it uses the same modualtion, signal strength, and frequency range. the protocals are sompleetly independant. there are 802.11 b/g, bluetooth, and nintendo ds protocals. if they made a cartridge, lets just say a pda cart, it could contain 802.11 b/bluetooth protocals, so it would then be capable of that level of comunication. the ds is an amazing device, nintendo is wasting it right now. correction, wireless g is a difrent hardware standard then b/bluetooth.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's no Bluetooth built into the DS. The first quote (and you should include the source) was probably an article from before the DS was released, otherwise it's totally irresponsible and inaccurate. Your second quote confirms that Bluetooth and 802.11 networking hardware are different, so you can't just use a Bluetooth protocl on the 802.11 hardware present in the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, Natrium has built a Bluetooth device onto his PassMe <a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com/blog/?p=29" target="_blank">successfully.</a> So he's done something with it, but it requires additional hardware and hardware hacks to <span style="font-style: italic">add</span> Bluetooth for it to be used.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And I can also confirm what FourScience has said - the DS does not have built-in Bluetooth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, I'm starting to get even more interested in Natrium's further PassMe hacks. If you connect a Bluetooth device to the PassMe (or any networking device for that matter), I wonder if you can use the PassMe as a pseudo-cart by transmitting data from a PC through the networking device, using the PassMe as the adaptor for said networking device. I figure this may require a different version of the PassMe and I don't expect off-the-shelf devices to be adaptable. I'm curious if something along these lines might be possible, extending what Natrium has been doing with the PassMe hacks so far (keyboard and Bluetooth).
<br/>
<br/>
So maybe there is life for PassMe after FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's possible to transfer TCP over serial. For example one could use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/PPP-HOWTO/" target="_blank">PPP</a> in DSLinux. First we would have to write a serial driver, though. (Also, AFAIK one has to compile DSLinux with TCP/IP stack.)
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, the bluetooth module I am using has a much longer range than DS Wifi. Class 1 bluetooth has line-of-sight range of 100+ meters.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The reason the range is so low on the DS is a combination of the low power hardware, and the "antenna" which is little more than tin foil on a scrap of PCB. I doubt it is even tuned.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, your title says it all, really. "The nintendo ds uses wifi and bluetooth"? That's wrong. There's no Bluetooth on the DS unless you add a hardware hack, and even then it's not usable yet.

<br/>
<br/>
There's a difference between saying that you can add Bluetooth with a hardware hack, and saying that the DS uses Wifi and Bluetooth.
<br/>
<br/>
I think people are bothered that you have been speculating things that are not true, based on some really outdated information you dug up. Ideas are welcome but the way you have been suggesting them is likely to confuse the uninformed. If you want to make suggestions, ask in the form of a question. Then it will be clear, to everyone, that you don't know the answer and somebody will kindly confirm or correct you. I think if everything you "stated" was "asked", they'd be fair questsions and we wouldn't have to comment about this. ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
You did trigger some good discussion, but in the future be careful about how you suggest ideas or ask what is possible.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
