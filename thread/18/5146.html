    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I remember correctly Darkfader was trying to find the padding in the rom to find the 2 values needed for the encryption. So I don't think there is an easy way to remove the padding unless you figure out the encryption. I could be wrong though. I don't believe a tool is available anywhere either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I'm wondering is if anyone has stuck a 'scope in between the cart and DS to see how quickly the cart must respond with data to a read command and how quickly data blocks are transferred. Basically what I'm most interested to know is the time between the falling and rising edges of the  CLK line.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason behind this is I'm trying to decide if a microcontroller based passthrough is feasible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just realized that I read 'trimming' instead of 'timing' in your initial post. I don't know how I could have done that. Sorry about that.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I need to fix my scope or I would be able to provide you with the information. I hope someone else will be able to since I'm also interested in building one with a microcontroller instead of a CPLD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
