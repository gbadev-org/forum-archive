    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I want to play movies (with audio) in PALib. I thought the best way to do this was to extrapolate the DPG related code from Moonshell, but I'm not so much in NDS development, and I found that code quite messy.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone with more experience than me can do this, or propose an alternative solution, or has already done something that can be useful for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I can pay with money or goods for what I need. I will give details if someone is interested.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,
<br/>

I'm not a native english writer. 
<br/>
<br/>
In my experience in many cases it is much easier to deliver goods (through online stores) than money worldwide.
<br/>
<br/>
That's what I meant.

Thank you.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mollusk, dovoto, thanks for your posts. It seems that I found the right forum. :)
<br/>
<br/>
This is what I do: <a class="postlink" href="http://naturalinteraction.org" target="_blank">http://naturalinteraction.org</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested in applying the same kind of interaction design to NDS enabled experiences. The main technical obstacle is the lack of (audio)video playback in PALib. 
<br/>
<br/>
I try to put down some more specific requirements (take them as a wishlist, I will adjust my needs to what is feasible):
<br/>
<br/>
- Playback quality as in Caiman Codec or Moonshell.
<br/>
- MPEG2 or better compression factor.
<br/>
- I don't need to handle multiple video and audio codecs, one single combination is fine.
<br/>
- I need the source code.
<br/>
- No problem if the code goes open source then...
<br/>
- Resolution up to 256x192 pixels.
<br/>
- Not less than 16 fps for fullscreen playback, 20 would be better
<br/>
- C functions compatible with the last PALib distro, to open/play/pause/close movie
<br/>
- Guidelines to encode audio and video (on Windows) so that it does not saturate the CPU when playing back at fullscreen (bitrate etc.).
<br/>
- setVolume to fade in and out audio when needed
<br/>
- I will put my movies on a R4 Revolution, DLDI support would be great
<br/>
- Functions to play the movie fullscreen on one of the screens and to provide the uncompressed framebuffer to a 3D sprite texture
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, DPG functionalities in Moonshell cover most of these points (as far as I can say). I can go in further detail if needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Yours faithfully,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, DPG and Moonshell are opensource. But as said, the Moonshell sources aren't very readable, and using DPG format outside Moonshell would require some amounts of work. However if someone made an external lib of DPG, that would be ace. Not just for PALib but for any homebrew development. If you're not up for it, keep asking around in the development community or directly from Moonlight (the author of Moonshell).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I mean, this must not be done in PALib, it should just *coexist* with PALib, even accepting some limitations (e.g. no other disk access during movie playback...) and tradeoffs... do you think this is unfeasible even in this case?

That is, unless some variant of the official ARM7 binary includes some variant of audio decompression, or unless the movie player is modified to use a sequenced soundtrack (as is the case on a few PS1 games).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
