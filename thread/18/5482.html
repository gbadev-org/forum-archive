Is it possible (through NDSLib?) to save data (data from a running app) onto the GBA flash cart, and reload it later? If so, can anyone point me in the right direction to find out how, size limitations etc. etc?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just thinking about this... the addressable limit for cart SRAM is 64K isn't it? I think it was mentioned in another thread that you could do bankswitching like in the old days on the GB.
<br/>
<br/>
Is that possible using the compact flash adapters and PassMe?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Obviously I meant adapters/carts which PassMe supports.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The pogoshell source code has the handshake for other flash carts as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hence the comments on the filesystem thread about building in support for the different manufacturers.
