so it seems that you can sign homebrew files now (but not with the nintendo signature,so you won't be able to boot homebrew code without passme or flashme).<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Crack the Wi-Fi and you'll be able to do so. You can start by disassembling the <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario 64 DS</span> stub, which comes with WiFiMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
