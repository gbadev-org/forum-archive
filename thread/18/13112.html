Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try loading the entire text file, finding all newlines, replacing the second line in memory, and writing out the text file. I'm writing a text editor right now, so I know some of what you're dealing with.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That method will work, but if you want to deal with large files, it'll be slow and will limit the size of the file to the amount of free RAM. Keep that in mind if you plan to do anything involving files over, say, 512K on the DS. A way you might do this without this restriction is to only read/write a certain number of characters at a time instead of the entire file.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can directly overwrite a line in a file as long as it has the same number of bytes as the line you are replacing. Otherwise, you have to read/modify/write the whole file. If the file is bigger than RAM, you will have to read/modify/write to a second file, delete the first file, and rename the second file to the first file's name.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
