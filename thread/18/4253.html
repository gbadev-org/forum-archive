    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone point me to an online seller that will allow me to purchase more then one DS unit? Since it sounds like the number of units in stock this holiday season will be low, I thought I could at least try and recoup the cost of my own DS unit by selling a few extra online when the holiday season is here and those few desperate parents with $$$ will do anything to get bobby or sue a new Nintendo DS for christmas. I'm not talking like 100+ units here, since I do not have that kind of money, but at least 5 units would be nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I completely agree with what you are doing.  This is how I got my Xbox.  I will be doing the same thing with the DS.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I would like to point out to the people who "think fondly of us when the stores are out" that while there will be stores that are sold out, there will also be stores that have stock sitting on the shelves for weeks with no one buying.  It's all about location, supply &amp; demand.  If you really want a unit then drive three hours to the Wal-mart in the middle of nowhere hickville.  This is how I always get my new systems.  I don't even go the day they come out.  I go there the weekend following release and there is always a stack of like 10 systems left and the stock boy will tell me that I'm only the second person to buy one of those.<br/>_________________<br/>"Oh yeah, so what kind of warrior are you?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Buying a DS and selling it when the shops are out of stocks does nothing for us but raise the prices for us !?!
<br/>
<br/>
But I remember when Zelda Ocarina of Time came out .. me and my friend travelled all around West London; to all the big stores and found nothing. Then we came back and visited our local game shop and there it was !!! ZELDA !!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, you are much to kind! I'd absolutely LOVE to take a three hour drive so that you can buy those extra DS's and sell for profit. You are such a true gentleman and all-round good guy. I really feel like giving you a big ol' heart warming hug!<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
