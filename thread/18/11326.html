    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using PAlib 060917 and I can quite fiqure out how to have a laser fire from a space ship and move across the screen. I can post my code if you wish, but then you will also need the gfx file from the PAlib and somthing to use as a laser, as I made mine in Paint.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess I can refrase it. I want to fire a laser from a spaceship. I currently have the laser as one sprite and am trying to increase the y-position. I end up with it coming out and freaking out. I want to move the sprite up from the x-position of the ship and move stright out to the top of the screen but this is my problem. If there are any games that use this concept I would love to see some source ad I have been unable to locate source for games thus far, and if they where written using PAlib even better (as tha is what I am using)

EDIT I got it figured out I need to relay the coords that I stored to a PA_SetSpriteY so it would move the sprite then I added PA_WaitForVBL so it would snyc real nice like and my while loop worked like a charm!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
