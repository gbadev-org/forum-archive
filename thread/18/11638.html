Damn, so is there any DS coding Platform that's similar to Flash? Or any code that would help out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Most DS code is C, with some C++ floating about here and there...
<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe Flash is C-based at all...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most flash games are actionscript based. Which is slightly familiar with c. I has if functions, for and while loops, t++ operator works, etc..
<br/>
<br/>
But flash movies are mostly timeline based, which can be used to move a sprite around the frame by tweening. Or the sprite can be moved around the frame with actionscript like xpos++.
<br/>
<br/>
But the engine definitely requires to be rewritten to work on the ds, even if you've the source code, although that would make it easier because you can just use the actionscript routines with a slight change, instead of a big rewrite.
<br/>
<br/>
But loading sprites, backgrounds and other objects have to be taken care of by yourself instead of flash doing that.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, but most langs have if,else stuff, for/while stuff and increment/decrement operators...
<br/>
<br/>
Jenswa, I think what you may be trying to say that it's possible to derive pseudo-code from the ActionScript code and turn that into C/C++ code.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that numerous AS functions probably have no direct counterparts in C, though, just copy-and-pasting the source and hacking it about would probably be unwise...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
