    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody, some queries which, if possible, id like some help with.
<br/>
<br/>
im trying to sort out a way of making a slot 2 interface for the DS that is going to enable me to connect it to external electronic stuff. essentially the same as DSerial but for slot 2.
<br/>
<br/>
for a start any information would be great. have looked around but its a little tricky.
<br/>
<br/>
my further question is, how similar is Slot 2 on an NDS to the slot on a GBA. i have seen a few interesting hardware hacks around that are interfacing the GBA with external hardware, and im wondering how many of these might work with the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
any help would be appreciated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
im essentially wanting to be able to add hardware midi in/out ports to the NDS and to have some sort of serial or parralel interface to start playing with other things.
<br/>
<br/>
also if i dont have to use FPGAs that would be helpful. hate programming the buggers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And AWESOME!  ...but doesnt seem to work well on vista :(
<br/>
<br/>
However it does come with simple io configurations so you can just read and write memory mapped io.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are other options for io on the DS.  If you can find a DSserial that is a cheap alternative.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also a homebrew friendly cart coming our way soonish that has full io breakout capability.  I will post an update in a bit about that.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSerial ive seen but alas id really like things to be using slot 2. i dont really want to be having to do cartridge swapping tricks to get things working. also im guessing itd be tricky to get hold of one as they're not being producedat the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
the cart you're talkinbg about soundsmost intweresting. id definatelly like to hear more when its available</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It's basically just a CPLD and a couple of resistors on a PCB. The CPLD can be programmed by the NDS, so you don't need any external programmer or anything. No good for interfacing with analog stuff, like the DSerial could, but it'll let you interface with pretty much any reasonable digital device you want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
