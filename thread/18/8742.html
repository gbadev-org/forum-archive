    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if it was possible to have a quad with a texture, of which the part of the quad overlayed by the "transparent" part of the texture is not shown.
<br/>
<br/>
It becoming some sort of a sprite, but being able to give it x, y and z coordinates.
<br/>
<br/>
Or is there an easy way to do the same thing with a sprite? (Haven't looked into that yet.)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm creating a 3D environment, and such a thing would come in handy as it would reduce the need to model quite a few things (which I'm not capable of doing yet anyway).
<br/>
<br/>
I've searched on transparency and textures and such, but could only find alpha blending (which is for the entire quad, right?) and obtaining an alpha-bit from a texture (which can probably only be used for alpha blending the entire quad). 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for your reply. The demo looks quite nice and is exactly what I've been looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm facing a problem however. 
<br/>
I've tried converting my pcx-texture to the required formats (a texture-bin-file and a palette-bin-file), but using these two files in the demo gives me transparency where I want it but the non-transparent part is glitchy (as in: showing garbage). 
<br/>
Is there something specific I need to do to obtain proper files for a "GL_RGB32_A3" format? (The comment on this format says: 32 colour textures, 8 levels of alpha)
<br/>
<br/>
The way I've done it now is to just save the palette with Photoshop as a pal-file, and renamed that to bin... and converted the pcx file to a bin file and renamed that to a bin as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Do I need to do something to make the pcx-file 32 colour? What am I doing wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
greets,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, as stated above, I'm doing something wrong though I do not know what it is exactly.
<br/>
<br/>
To convert a pcx to a bin file, I used a graphics tool which can be found at drunkencoders (which can also convert md2 files).
<br/>
For the palette, I just saved it with Photoshop and then renamed it to bin... though that might be my problem. Maybe I need a program to convert the pal-file created to a bin-file instead of just renaming... anyone know a program to use for this goal?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I've noticed, but only when using 8bit.

I've tried that and it had the same outcome (garbage colours, but what needed to be transparent is).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Dark Knight EZ:The tool you're talking about is dsutils(texconv to be exact), but i think u can use it when u r converting to only a tex, not with its pal. Maybe dovoto or joat would know of a tool..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
