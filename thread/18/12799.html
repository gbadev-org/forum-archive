<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if Nintendo have activated the funstion in the Wii firmware yet as there are currently no games which use it.  I would just like to know if there are any homebrew programs that can do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well since Nintendo hasn't released any way to communicate DS to Wii, and homebrew code isn't running on the Wii yet, no. The only kind of communication that I would think possible is some kind of media streaming off of the DS using the Opera Browser, which would be really slow anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the DS's wifi can pick that up you can...welll....do nothing with it :p

Be a nice tech demo,but probably not possible.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

However, the Wii uses bluetooth to communicate with the remotes.  And although the DS could be made to use bluetooth through an external cartidge or other hardware, it is not able to natively use bluetooth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any way (homebrew, hardware, hack) to get two DS units to play a GBA game multiplayer or use the linking feature? similarly, is there any way to get a Wii or GC to link up (wired or not) with a DS for GC games like FF or Zelda: Four Swords?
<br/>
<br/>
That would be one extremely useful feature for the DSlite that I got when I "traded up" my GBA SP at EBgames. Unfortunately the fact that it wasn't multiplayer or gamelink compatible with GBA games wasn't exactly advertised...and I really don't want to spend $80 apiece for new SPs (no, I don't want to get old style GBAs)...but I really want to play my copy of Four Swords and Final Fantasy with friends/family.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. We don't know where all the link cable traces on the DS motherboard are.

I wondered more if it was...in theory...possible to get the raw singles from the ariel  and look for the bluetooth in the mess manualy?
<br/>
I guess it would be as complex as speach recognition.

If the Nintendo Wii use's Wifi for that....how many wifi connections can it maintain at once?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Given that the DS itself can keep 16 people in one PictoChat room, there shouldn't be a problem, unless there are complications from mixing Ni-Fi and IPv4.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
