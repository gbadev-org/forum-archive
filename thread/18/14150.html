    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The currently available builds of Mini vMac do not support DLDI and will not work on any cards other than the ones supported by the old gba_nds_fat library.
<br/>
However, the new version is coming along nicely and will have proper documentation to go along with it.
<br/>
<br/>
New versions will be sent out to testers and doc writers very shortly once I fix a keyboard bug, once it is stable I will release it for everyone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
