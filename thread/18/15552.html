    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On no$gba, when I try to initialize libfat, it fails. Now, I'm perfectly OK with this, as I know no$gba doesn't have any emulation for the slot 2 devices while in DS mode, and that's fine and dandy by me.
<br/>
<br/>
My trouble is that it doesn't just fail, it fails HARD, and I can tell from the resulting screens that memory corruption is happening everywhere because of it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I *think* the program is DLDI compatible, I'm using the latest libfat and I have strong faith that that's the case. I'm just worried if this memory corruption tends to happen on real hardware? I would ideally like the program to be able to recover and just work in a no load, no save mode if FAT cannot be initialized...
<br/>
<br/>
If it's just on no$gba that it fails, and not on real hardware, I can work with that. I've got a card that auto-patches the file with the DLDI (or it works out of the box one, I can't tell really) so I have no way of hardware testing it on different cards to see if a failure will indeed cause a massive crash like this.

Thanks!

I was being silly and not loading a blank image when it failed. My bad, please ignore this post, libfat failing on no$gba does not cause any issues whatsoever.
