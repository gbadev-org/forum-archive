<br/>
<br/>
It's got a full 6 degrees of freedom (+xyz,-xyz), as it's called.
<br/>
<br/>
Descent takes a bit of getting use to but it's incredible fun once you arse used to it, since combat in it is pretty interesting and very hair-raising at times. Also, the race to the end of the level before it explodes is very cool and tests your ability to navigate in 3d...
<br/>
<br/>
If you loved Tie Fighter but wanted a more tricky job of flying things then Descent is the game to play :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Original source would be more of a pain to port, IMO. It doesn't include any sound code, as it was licensed from another company. Also, it's full of x86 asm code.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, Descent looks like fairly difficult port.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Maybe, although porting a port introduces it's own problems...
<br/>
<br/>
The x86 assembler would be a pain, as Doom5 says, but might also encourage a more complete re-write, rather than a "re-comile, tweak and re-compile until it works, but only just".
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the lack of sound code in the original source could be useful, since sound is usually handled a little differently on the DS anyway and hence a major re-write would be in order anyway...
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say start with the original source but use the Descent Rebirth source as a reference guide and means of working out potential solutions to th problems that arise...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
