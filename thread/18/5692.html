    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's just an idea, but should be possible (i think). I'm not much of a coder and don't know much about the technical speczs of the DS, but is it possible to create a code and load it on a PassMe or whatever flashcard you wanna use and that it will connect to a server were all the game file's are on, so it loads from server.. just an idea..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.picfront.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">www.picfront.com [ Upload your pictures ]</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now that the new firmware has removed the encryption checks it should be possible to boot directly from wireless by having your pc host the game. So you wouldnt need make code access the wifi adapter.
<br/>
<br/>
Ive been out of the loop for a while so i dont know whether the new firmware removes encryption or just modifies the header so that code executes from the gba slot (does what the passme does).
<br/>
<br/>
Im not sure what the big players have been working on lately, things seem a bit quiet. Ive seen Loopys snesadvance and i hope to god he is porting it to the ds with sound.
<br/>
<br/>
I am encouraged by the fact that most of the questions in this forum are now about coding for the ds which means people are working on various things. As soon as my exams are over I may actually try to start developing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">with the new firmware that just came out, you can use the Download Play to boot any homebrew .nds you want, without using a flashcart. Downside is you need a flashcart to update the firmware in the first place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, the firmware patch is available, but they have yet to release any technical information about  the firmware, which is what my "moaning", as linus so eloquently put it, was about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The new firmware has removed the encryption so it is now possible to download code from a PC hosting the game. I dont know if such a server exists or whether Tims WiFiMe can be adapted to serve a homebrew app.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes tim's wifime server can serve up to 16 homebrew .nds files, and then you can pick them from the download play screen on your DS.

Either you checked the wrong site or it was being updated when you checked. As Ethos says, check <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be concerned about the firmware program being "unreleased" or unavailable anymore. It used to be a smallish concern of mine, as you needed to be registered and had to use getID to download a firmware specific to your DS. Now there is an install and uninstall program for the new firmware, without getID or registration. Even if they stopped hosting the firmware program, it is already out there in a form that anyone can use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
