    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which emulator should I use? I've read the best things about iDeaS, but when I click the first result of a Google search for <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ideas+emulator" target="_blank">ideas emulator</a>, it redirects to <a href="http://www.rascalboy.nzone.it" target="_blank">www.rascalboy.nzone.it</a> giving me "The connection has timed out". Is there another non-pirate site carrying a recent version of iDeaS?
<br/>
<br/>
Or should I use one of the emulators that doesn't emulate the ARM7?
<br/>
<br/>
Or do most people on this board follow the following procedure after making each build of even the simplest program? I understand the importance of testing on hardware, but every build? <ol type="1"><li>Remove GBA Movie Player from Nintendo DS </li><li>Remove CF from GBA Movie Player </li><li>Insert CF into CF writer </li><li>Copy .nds file to CF writer </li><li>Unmount CF (My Computer &gt; right-click CF writer icon &gt; Eject) </li><li>Remove CF from CF writer </li><li>Insert CF into GBA Movie Player </li><li>Insert GBA Movie Player into Nintendo DS </li><li>Power cycle Nintendo DS </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True, but your flagship product is a GBAMP bootloader, one that inherently requires other files on the CF card. If repeated pak swapping is necessary even for "hello world" class programs that load entirely into RAM and do not read or write the CF card at all, the amount of manual labor caused by lack of usable emulators may be enough to dissuade people from developing for the Nintendo DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have yet to get an emu to run any of my code (with out sending my working rom to an emu author and asking him to see if he can fix his emu and make it run).  Although, i have not actualy played with the emus in several months.  As far as I know none of them will emulate the GBAMP or any file based flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Personaly i use the xport which is programable in place.
<br/>
<br/>
But wifi also is nearly as nice, especialy if you find that wifi rom that is floating around.  It sits on your flash cart and performs the same function as the firmware wifi multiboot but much faster.
<br/>
<br/>
GBAMP is not much fun to dev with unless you need the file system.  Same goes for most flash carts.  If only they would make one that has front loading flash.  Perhaps the MK2 will turn out to be a good platform in this regaurd.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't have a flash setup for the DS yet, so I've been working on my ds 3D engine using the iDeaS emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, so good, and the gba file system found in libnds works like a charm.  I'm having no problem loading text files, graphics, binaries, whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
I created a hybrid programmer's notepad based project that was initially a combination of the nehe lesson10 code and the arm7/arm9 template project.  Of course it now resembles neither of these, but that was a good starting point.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or use WMB. I just set up a batch file that will build my project and then send it to my DS via wireless multiboot. The only time I worry about loading it onto hardware is when I need to test SRAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't have room in my computer for a PCI wireless card, and USB cards emphatically do not work.

<br/>
I just tried iDeaS 1.0.0.5, and it didn't even work correctly for the "hello world" example that comes with libnds. It just drew the three lines of text at the top and didn't draw the touch position part at all.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I never tried that particular "hello world" app.  I get the same lack of touch-screen position display as you do.
<br/>
<br/>
As an alternative, try the hello_world app in "templates\combined".  This one does what you want it to do, and has the advantage of being structured as a hybrid ARM7/ARM9 app.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
* Lack of a decent emulator (the situation is hopeless if you don't use Windows)

Not owning a DS has helped disaude me too, but if the above 2 problems were non existent, I'm sure I would have bought the console already. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nice to see your getting into deving the DS. It is really nice really, even with all the hasstle of getting stuff running on h/w

I'm using Windows 2000 (which is probably the same as Windows XP in this respect). However, it's not a network mapped drive but a USB storage device. When I try <span style="font-weight: bold">net use H: /delete</span> I get
