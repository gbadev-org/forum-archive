    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello guys, was just wondering if any of you had an idea of the difficulty of porting a game developped with currently available homebrew libraries to using the official sdk?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm imagining that with the nintendo sdk, there is less low level programmation/memory management and more system/function calls?? Maybe I'm way off and the sdk nintendo offers is similar to what is available for us via homebrew libraries... So I thought i'd ask here see if anyone has an idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Currently the homebrew libraries are hugely different from the official SDK to the extent that it's probably a major rewrite. It might help if you used an abstraction layer that uses the relevant library but it's still a fairly big job.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">one thing to take in consideration is that you can't have any own code in the arm7..  atleast that's what I've read on this board<br/>_________________<br/>go back to coding and stop screaming wolf :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmmm yea it would probably be a good idea to code in a way to isolate hardware interactions... so you only have to modify that part if you ever get your hands on an sdk.

I'm assuming that Nintendo does not condone the publishment of games that were written using non-official libraries eh!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Jaleco's NES classics collection for GBA is essentially the PocketNES emulator with a few NES ROMs built in. PocketNES was developed with unofficial tools. The difference between Nintendo's GBA policy (as long as the binary runs on Nintendo flash cards it's approved, no matter how it was compiled) and its Nintendo DS policy (for example, it must use an ARM7 binary developed by Nintendo) likely has something to do with FCC regulations (and foreign counterparts) covering the Wi-Fi transmitter in the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is actually the only sad thing about the DS homebrew development.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of writing a game that reserve space for the official SDK. That menas no sound programming, and only empty network routines.
<br/>
Writing directly to the registers for making sprite show up will still be valid on the official SDK.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If so that's also a sad thing since it kinda limits what you can do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A GBFS file converted to binary using bin2s piped into arm-elf-as will always work.
<br/>
<br/>
Appended GBFS, on the other hand, is for GBA programs, as the DS game card interface is a lot more like a GBAMP's CF slot than like a GBA ROM. As long as you load information using MS-FAT over GBAMP/M3 (and not an appended GBFS), you shouldn't have a problem adapting your code to load information using Nitro-FAT on a DS card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
