Say you have 1 MB of emulator, 1 MB of emulated BIOS, VRAM, and the like, and 2 MB of emulated RAM (640 KB conventional + 128 KB upper + 1280 KB expanded). That should be enough to run most XT or AT era programs.

Neither issue was a big problem for FluBBa, the developer of SMS Advance and several other emulators that run on GBA. The Intel 8086 CPU used in the IBM XT is actually rawther slow for its 4.8 MHz clockspeed, comparable to other 8080 derivatives such as Z80 (SMS Advance) and GBZ80 (Goomba).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off, people talk about running DOS games as if it's just DOS that needs porting. Most of these games don't use DOS at all, they merely run under DOS because it's the same as running under no OS at all, almost. It's the x86 and video/timing environment that goes with it that needs emulating, and that's much more of a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, people say it's a simple matter to rewrite a game that was designed specifically for one hardware platform, to run on another. I'm currently rewriting a certain project to incorporate more portable code, and even then it's a pain to get it working across different platforms; and these platforms share most of their common characteristics. A 16-bit PC game is very difficult to move over to a 32-bit handheld.
<br/>
<br/>
And finally, someone mentioned planning a software project before you just dive in and code. Believe me, I know the pitfalls of just diving in; it's one of the reasons I'm rewriting DSemu now, with a little proper design behind it this time instead of code thrown in random directions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Really? If one can emulate an NES, SMS, or even a Super NES on a GBA, or a Lucasarts game on a Nintendo DS, it surely can't be that much of a bother to emulate a 286 PC on a Nintendo DS.

The major issues I have are with compilation, being unable to link on different platforms and such; and that's after very careful consideration of portability issues. I doubt the coder of the average EGA game gave much thought to their code working on Amiga or ST.
<br/>
<br/>
As for porting those games to the DS, a plain rewrite wouldn't be the easiest thing ever, but not massively difficult. What would be substantially difficult is to emulate an x86 processor with all its assorted PC peripherals, at any kind of decent speed. I know the horrors of the x86 encoding, so I wouldn't want to be that guy. (I can barely do an ARM emulation right.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
