    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, if that is true, I would think that dozens of angry third-party developers would be enough to change their minds.  After all, Nintendo is trying to build up better third party support - not destroy it again.  Nintendo does have a history of being rather draconian - it's the only part of the big N that I don't like.  The book "Game Over: Press Start to Continue" by David Sheff has some details on a lot of that stuff (Very good book, btw).

The explanation that article gives about having to take apart the CPU, Wi-Fi, etc. to get to the sound layer doesn't make much sense to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
First of all we know that the DS is going to be able to play GBA carts. Doesn't the GBA currently us a ARM7 processor? Wouldn't those carts be accessing the ARM7 processor? Wouldn't that mean they would be using the ARM7 in the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
And if not, wouldn't they be using the other processor in the DS? We already know that the GBA uses these sound engines. So if the DS is backwards compatable with GBA games, doesn't it make sense the this will still be available?
<br/>
<br/>

I talked to the person who owns the website. He is a good friend of mine and has been for many years posting 99% accurate news on whatever site he runs. The person who submitted this news to them is a long time friend of their website and he is a developer fo some company.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It depends on Nintendo's definition of the scope of the "sound engine".
<br/>
<br/>
Optimistic: Nintendo will provide a mixer (or an interface to the hardware mixer) as part of the DS operating system and will not allow licensed developers to write their own mixers or otherwise pass raw linear PCM to the hardware. This will probably shut out only those developers who want to include heavily data-compressed vocals (Puzzle Fighter and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/gsm/" target="_blank">GSM Player</a> anyone?) and real-time-synthesized instruments (music games with TB303 or other VCF based synthesizers?) in their games.
<br/>
<br/>
Pessimistic: Nintendo's sound engine will just take MIDI and wave files and then let the game make only volume and pan (no frequency change) adjustments to the wave file. Remember that if you can change the playback frequency of a wave file, you can make your own music engine.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems implausible to believe the arm7 cpu would be accessible magically for GBA games but not DS games.  Indeed, this, along with some other clues point to the possibility that GBA games will run on the ARM9 chip, and not the ARM7. ARM9 is at least vaguely backwards compatible with ARM7, and perhaps completely. And the ARM7 chip is double the clock of the GBA one, so you'd think if you wanted true backwards compatibility you'd have had the same chip.
<br/>
<br/>
Additional wild speculation on Nintendo's reasons for lockout: The FCC requires that they do so, because the wifi controls can't be allowed to be modified. This is currently the problem Intel is having in open sourcing wifi code for Linux.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure what Nintendo would gain by doing this.  Have there been lots of problems with sound code on the GBA (or the GCN)?  Why should Nintendo care about how a developer handles music playback?  I can understand that they might want a developer to use a hardware mixer if provided, but if there is a reason why a developer might not want to use the hardware, why would they want to stop them?
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I think it would be insane not to at the very least provide two PCM channels (hopefully 16-bit) for the developer to use.  If those channels are two of 16 channels that are routed into the mixer, that's fine by me.  But they pretty much have to be there, IMO.
<br/>
<br/>
Imposing artificial limitations on developers for no good reason seems like a sure-fire way to piss off the very people you depend on.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't see why people would complain anyway, unless Nintendo screws it up. But I don't see them messing up their last chance of redemption. If the DS succeeds, it will probably give the revolution some momentum too.

To me, that would point toward no way in the API to open an audio stream (that is, restricting the API to just converted-.wav and converted-.mid playback) rather than to an audio streaming API similar to what, say, the <a class="postlink" href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Allegro library</a> provides.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
we can't reveal too much about hardware because of the NDA with Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
However, i can tell you some things.
<br/>
<br/>
Sound Quality of the DS can even surpass CD quality. Nanostray will use
<br/>
our DSX soundengine. If you ever heard what we pulled out of the GBA
<br/>
with Iridion2 you can imagine what is possible on the DS. Compared to
<br/>
Iridion2 we doubled the mixingrate (from 21khz to 44khz), doubled the
<br/>
resolution (from 8bit to 16bit) and doubled the soundchannels from 8 to 16.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS Graphics hardware is VERY clean. With correct programming you
<br/>
don't have any graphical glitches. In comparison to a N64 game there is
<br/>
a much higher framerate (N64 had usually 20-30 frames, Nanostray has
<br/>
60fps). N64 games used to have very blurry images due to a couple of
<br/>
hardware drawbacks. Nanostray has high resolution textures and an
<br/>
absolut crisp look.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards
<br/>

Well, the Playstation succeeded, and considering the alternative system at the time, I guess most developers would have rather used Sony's API than to have huge size constraints on the Nintendo 64.
<br/>
<br/>
But really though, this thread needs to die. No developer has publically complained about how Nintendo wants audio done (Miked0801 view's aren't exactly public) and seeing as how few of us are actually making a commercial game on the system, it shouldn't effect us either, at least not right now.
