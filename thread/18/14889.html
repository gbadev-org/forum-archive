    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now why would you do that? The best you'll get from that is a probably hard to read disassembly, while there's plenty touch screen and graphics sample code all over the 'tubes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pulling apart and then understanding a program which has no debugging info (eg code) is very difficult. If you do want to have a go, extract the separate programs from the rom with objcopy and then convert them to elf files. Then fire up IDA Pro (not cheap though) and get going!
<br/>
Make sure you have a pen and paper handy to take notes.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unlike most commercial GBA games, commercial DS games have a file system (commonly called NitroFS) appended to them. Because of this file system, it might actually be easier to find the assets (models, textures, maps, sounds, text, etc.) in a DS game than in a GBA game. But gbadev.org isn't a ROM hacking site, so I'll leave it at that.

If you want examples of some specific coding technique, and the libnds examples available through devkitPro Updater aren't enough, please let us know.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
