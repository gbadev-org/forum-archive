    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to update Mr  Jandujars DSGo with  current GnuGO sources using his playing surface. Well the requirements for the heap and stacks have not grown less:
<br/>
<br/>
/usr/local/devkitPro/devkitARM/lib/gcc/arm-eabi/4.1.1/../../../../arm-eabi/bin/ld: address 0x24e26b0 of build.elf section .bss is not within region ewram
<br/>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
<br/>
<br/>
Just 4 fun I extended ewram in ds_arm9.ld to 8MB and voila the build loads in desmume emulator and blanks the screen ! However Jandujars dsGo 1.2 works there.
<br/>
So I'm not sure if all my debugging work in phase 1 was already in vain.  Are there too many build objects ? Lies the problem in the huge GO tables with static and/or dynamic pattern data ? (3MB)
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to find similiar problems here and there is one:
<br/>
<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13055&amp;highlight=ewram" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13055&amp;highlight=ewram</a>
<br/>
<br/>
However the message for ewram meant full when it was full. I got a wrong address not within region. 
<br/>
Still some hope for a new GnuGO 4 NDS ?<br/>_________________<br/>with kind regards,  euer Dieter, still or again 8th kyu GO ranking

<br/>
<br/>
GnuGO uses several MBs of pattern matching game tables in opposite to chess that has few 100 Ks of opening tables. 4MB would not be enough. So the 32MB of the cartdrige RAM are required for GnuGO pattern matching of the thinking engine. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the only topic that helps me would be Lick's extended RAM API. First I was surprised while reading here about so many capacity problems whithout mentioning cartridge extensions in most cases. I felt that most people doesnot like it for performance reason because they develop fast games. However GnuGO and Chess are "thinking machines". Performance is only for secondary prio. 
<br/>
<br/>
My final question therefor should be if Lick's extra library is the only way to access memory above 32M anyway ? I understood that the linker even with ds_cart.specs cannot link my M3 RAM to the main RAM and therefor no compiler directive wouldnot give direct access to it (right ?). 
<br/>
<br/>
P.S: I wonder how the DSLinux people managed the 32M extension that is shown by the free command. GnuGO is a typical Linux project. Maybe it is easier to use DSLinux to realize GnuGO.<br/>_________________<br/>with kind regards,  euer Dieter, still or again 8th kyu GO ranking

<br/>
Well if you're just pattern matching, I assume each pattern is actually fairly small.
<br/>
<br/>
Why not just page in a bit of the table at a time? 
<br/>
<br/>
What it sounds suspiciously like is you're still thinking in GBA land where you need to fit the tables into "rom" which is accessed from the upper regions of address space.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS doesn't work that way, anything you want to read in has to come in over a "IO" layer like libfat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should definitely consider breaking that table into multiple files and dynamically load/unload them as you need them. 
<br/>
<br/>
As you just said, it's a thinking game, the extra time spent in traversing the tables sounds much better than having to require an extra RAM cart for a table game. 
<br/>
<br/>
Even if you use the RAM expansion, you'll still need to keep your table in a file and load it manually, since your ARM9 binary cannot exceed 4MBs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Though I agree for some kind with the latter 2 suggestions I would be still interessted not to waste internal M3 RAM. 
<br/>
<br/>
However both of you should consider that your hint silently require to rewrite GnuGO coding. Yes there is some kind of pattern db in GnuGO. But I'm not so sure as you are because I'm no so sure about memory mgmt inside a complex program. I prefered your GBAlandish model because every future GnuGO update would be easyier to adapt:  namely as long as GnuGO doesnot offer interfaces for file/memory mgmt itself as part of its PC version. 
<br/>
<br/>
Since many patterns tables change during every move (e.g. opening, attack, defense ...) now I'd like to know how performance of libfat compares to the one with RAM ext. ?<br/>_________________<br/>with kind regards,  euer Dieter, still or again 8th kyu GO ranking

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello ,
<br/>
<br/>
Now I got some infos about the trade-off: 
<br/>
GnuGO builds without EWRAM restriction an 4,5 MB ELF-Binary (that wont fit). I guess during a game 1/2M should be additional available.  The patterns have 2.8M from 25 files with more than 25 tables . 
<br/>
<br/>
These patterns increase steadily during GnuGOs development since GO is _the_  pattern matching game since 4000 years. 
<br/>
<br/>
 On the other hand we have 108 .c-files with more than 300 functions. All calling different patterns at different situations. 
<br/>
<br/>
My GBAlandish approach was to load all patterns at the beginning while filling their struct pointers as it would be like having enough space. The program starts almost without any modification at this point.
<br/>
A Game has typically between 150-170 moves (only of the machine) each matching 100s of patterns. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure but exchanging those 25 patterns 1000 times in memory via libfat requires one or more  complete new handler for disloading and reloading the  patterns . There is not only one central matching function nor one only pattern structure.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I will have to ask the GnuGO dev-scene about a GnuGO-MMU that make sense in this case.<br/>_________________<br/>with kind regards,  euer Dieter, still or again 8th kyu GO ranking

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Too much honour, although I really missed the game and searched many places not only sourceforge.  It sounds a bit silly, but man against machine seems to me the first alternative. Man2Man should be best from Jandujars DSGo, 1.2 where it is already usable. Of course only on the same device player beside player and very limited.
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of eastern our discussion here in comparison with all possible new outviews revealed following ranking to me:
<br/>
<br/>
1. DSLinux:  comes with the best development environment for 32 linear memory to compile the original tarball from GnuGO. No problem within hours. Together with cgoban everything goes.
<br/>
<br/>
2. GnuGO with the RAM_API: Unfortunately the ram_api from lickcr.org is missing (lickcr.org is missing) . It would be great help to make ram_api available. It means less work without original code modification. I cannot see why it is slower than 3):
<br/>
<br/>
3. GnuGO with pattern overlay memory region as it was recommended here. The charme would be a gnugo with only 4MB extending the radius to more slot-1 devices. This means really work because I have to find out when to drop the big fuseki patterns and how the remaining puzzle of patterns works  for attack, defense, eyeshapes, josekis ... endgame (many more)<br/>_________________<br/>with kind regards,  euer Dieter, still or again 8th kyu GO ranking

Yeah I would have gone for a disk-based approach (by modifying the original code to only load bits of the tables on demand) which then wouldn't require extra RAM. It'll probably pay off in the end. Getting non-trivial programs to use slot-2 RAM is such a *chore* that you'll probably need to have access to all the different RAM cards to confirm that it works the way you expect. Each flash card has its own quirks...esp the M3!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I compared with the compileflags given here but wanted to try to include DFA pattern matching.  Means that I tried to use all original flags. 
<br/>
Making mkpat as the requited pattern compiler (subdir patterns) fails because the linker complains about multiple definitions of an int array (meaningless-white-moves) that is included several times by liberty.h in several c-files . Means to me that my x86 gcc overcomes such things by less restrictions during compilation because there it works. For me the arm compiler is right because in include files there should only be declations and no definitions that allocate an array more than one time.

Hoever I understand now the -no-dfa flag given here in the forum when it disables the mkpat call during crosscompiling. Now I will use these flags but I wonder what gnugo means without some of its intelligent pattern matching routines.

I tried to change cache size but I have no idea how to speed up efficiently.  I really would like to know how "Many faces of GO" (Igo) has been brought down to NDS. Maybe the scret lies in using both processors arm7 and 9 concurrently. Interesting enough is memory consumption. It's about 13 MB in dslinux. Since the biggest pattern samples belong to the most important ones there should be no real chance to get by on less memory e.g. without extra RAM pack.

Any Idea about other extra RAM ? I believe many people waited for a fast porting not for a fast game.Also I think that move duration should be compared to games like DSChess.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes while my precursor here took 1M for gnugo 3.6 I extended to 3MB but crashed with 8MB. Performance depends first on the commandline option for gnugo --level 1-10 . I use level 5 on13x13 and still get reasonable moves in 2.5 minutes. There should be more control about the steps the engine climbs until a move is found. These steps need to be made visible which seems to be quite possible with an open source development. More profiling should be made on  x86-gnugo  but its a problem that no arm emulator emulates RAM card extensions. Maybe I can pump up my desmume emulator with PC-RAM only for glancing at the effects while manipulating arm-gnugo.

I enabled the new dfa pattern matching without knowing any performance effects. The limits for owl and semeai nodes seem to be rather critical and I know pretty less about it. My precursor may have more information about the critical options. However fast enough is saving and reloading of existing games so that a game maybe resumed when I enter tram or bus again on my way back home.

<br/>
However my next project is of course CGoBan for grafical frontend especially for 2-humans mode and of course remote connect to another fast GO playing machine.<br/>_________________<br/>with kind regards,  euer Dieter, still or again 8th kyu GO ranking
