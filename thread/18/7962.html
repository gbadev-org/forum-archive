    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I finally got around to making a webpage for an rts I was working on a little while back.  Hopefully I'll find time to fix some of the bugs, and add more content.
<br/>
You can find it at <a class="postlink" href="http://atow.atspace.com" target="_blank">http://atow.atspace.com</a>.
<br/>
It's far from complete, currently it has rudimentary AI, a minimap, fog of war, 4 unit and 2 building types among other things.
<br/>
It doesn't have a very intuitive interface if you haven't played RTS's before, but I think it works quite well once you get used to it.

I have trouble with creating new Barracks and Houses.  I occasionally am able to drag off the letter to build a new House (or Barrack), but most often I end up with the red selection rectangle, and no House.  The corner of the rectangle is in the same spot as where the letter was before, so I don't think that it is a calibration issue.

Sektor: I just put up a new version with improved lefty support.

SeanMon: That's most likely my bad interface, you probably didn't have enough resources to place more buildings, so the buttons are disabled and there's no indication that they're turned off.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure if I like it or if it'll stick but it's "A Touch of War".
<br/>
I was looking for a name with similar properties to the "Be Sharps" and I figured it was especially appropriate given the current state of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the red alert, AOE thing, I played with the scale a bit, and found I like the sprite size the way it is now, hopefully big enough to have detailed units if ever my awesome pixel art gets replaced.  And given the limited screen space it's hard to make ranged units that don't shoot or can't see too far offscreen(vertically mostly), so I think I'll stick towards melee ranged armies as much as possible.  Although, I haven't really given much thought to unit types and environments, maybe robots, pirates, ninjas, and zombies? wish I had the sprite space...

You have room for about 1500 sprites on the main screen (assuming a lot of shared graphics) if you dont mind using 3D quads...just a thought.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, what I meant was ram for sprites, I'm actually trying to keep the entire game in ram, with no streaming from the cart, so eventually I might be able to send the game to another ds for single cart play.  Even then, I'm really abusing ram right now, with my 16 color sprites stored in 256 color format, but then again, I have 2 frame animations and everything faces 1 direction :&gt;. I really should do the math someday.
<br/>
<br/>
As for what you said, Interesting thought, I never considered using the 3d hardware for sprites.  Currently each tick, I'm figuring out which objects are on screen, sorting them by their y position, and placing them in OAM, and I'm doing all this using the easiest, most inefficient code to write.  I think the game currently drops in framerate when you scroll over an area with tons of trees.  And if there are over 255 sprites on screen, I just stop drawing them.  If I used 3d quads, I could probably skip the sort, let a z-buffer do the work, and not have any sprite limits.
<br/>
<br/>
I just tried a few of the 3d samples in ndslib, and they all crash the emulators, your nehe ones work fine of hardware, and I couldn't get the 2 misc quad ones to work on hw.  Does any emu currently do 2d and 3d? I'm not well setup to code/debug on hardware.  And can textures be paletted? I'm currently using extended palette's on my sprites for the red and blue teams.
<br/>
<br/>
I should be doing research on my own for all this instead of bugging you with questions :&gt;. But thanks for the suggestion.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ya, got way ahead of myself with that one.  I was actually being quite selfish, I've been flashing a bunch of my friends' ds' thinking eventually if I get around to networking my game I could play it with them without having a flashcard each all running the same version of the game.  And I also figure if I do attempt to network it, it'll probably be lan only, since coping with internet lag, and trying to keep even 2 people in sync in an rts sounds too much like a full time job.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, too bad about the new firmware in the red/etc ds', I'm sure it was just a matter of time before someone figured out how to transmit the wifime boot code from one ds to another, then all you'd need was a flashcard with flashme on it and a screwdriver...

I probably won't be spending too much time working on the game, and I'd rather spend the time getting all the technical stuff done, like finding ways to have more units in the game without destroying the framerate, figuring out a way to show visibility in the minimap, taking a look at what Stephen Stair has done with the wifi stuff, and even looking into Dovoto's 3d tutorials which may cause me to change the game's base tech.
