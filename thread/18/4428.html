I've said this a lot, but I've been waiting since July 15th to get MY DS.  I was waiting before, but that is the day I pre-ordered and paid.  It's been painful, waiting.  It's gotten to the point where I'm having a hard time believing that I'm actually going to have it in my hot little hands.  9 hours.  9... hours...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
