That most likely will not be a problem. Alot of PDAs and such have similiar buttons, and you have to hold them down for a few seconds to turn them off. Also, Nintendo has mentioned about sleep mode and such, so one could probably deduce that you may have a series of taps on the power button (off, sleep, standby) or you may have to hold another button at the same time to power down. With the obvious time and effort that Nintendo has put into this project, I am sure they have thought of this problem well before hand.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
More importantly however, the next few years in handheld gaming should be very exciting - there is worthy competition and that means more games for everyone, whatever side of the fence you happen to be on.  I will purchase both the DS and PSP of course, and I hope both fare well, because as I stated above, more healthy competition will give us more exciting new games (a strong competitor makes it less likely to resort to making the handheld a dumping ground for old and stale remakes - I'm sure we will see a few, but hopefully not many)

I find it very interesting when people say that they will purchase both systems. Are you made of money? First off neither company has indicated an official price for either system, but let's average it out, based on the rumors - say $500 plus tax for both systems together. Then you still need to purchase games. Lets say $100 - 1 good game for each system. So now your up to $600 plus tax. You must have an awfully good job!
<br/>
<br/>
Listen, I'm not saying you can't do it, and you did make some other good points which I took out of the quote. However, let's be realistic. MOST PEOPLE will not purchase both systems, but WILL MAKE A CHOICE on one or the other, and invest their money there. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know, alot of people who have two consoles, but they were not purchased at the same time, they were purchased over years or shared between  roomates, siblings, whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, let's be fair, it's fine and dandy to say "I'll buy both Systems" , but lets be realistic. YOU will probably choose one system and then down the road, MAYBE, purchase the other!

That's not sitting on the fence. THAT is an honest answer! Hear! Hear! No bull crap in that answer. You are quite clearly stating that you are interested in the system that provides the games you find enjoyable! Not the system with glitz or gimmicks, but the system that will be most fun for you!!

The point that I was making was that everyone is mouthing off how they will purchase both systems. Easy to say when your pockets are empty and your just shooting the shit. 
<br/>
<br/>
IF you are a hard core gamer - WHICH IT APPEARS that you are - If I read correctly through all the crap. Then Hear! hear! You probably save all your money for your hobby, and that is great. I salute you! THEN SAY SO! <span style="text-decoration: underline">Don't be like the rest of the sheep</span>. In the future, it is guys like you that will be able to give a honest comparison of both systems. You will have first hand - long term test - to use them both. 
<br/>
<br/>
I on the other hand, am a casual gamer, I will choose one system, probably the DS. I probably could afford both systems without saving, but it is unlikely that I will purchase both.
<br/>
<br/>

Personally I've rarely seen people say they intend to buy both the ds and psp.  To the contrary, I've seen people quickly polarize, support one console, and bash the other to feel good about themselves and their (intended) purchase. This is the behavior I've typically seen through the years since the amiga/st, nes/sms, snes/genny days.

<br/>
I on the other hand, am a casual gamer, I will choose one system, probably the DS. I probably could afford both systems without saving, but it is unlikely that I will purchase both.
<br/>
<br/>
In closing, the point that I was making was, don't just be like the rest of the teeny boppers and younger who don't work for their purchases and still rely on mommy and daddy, and say I will get both. State why, how, ect...
<br/>

I'm far too old to be a teeny bopper.  I've been writing games since the commodore 64 era, and that might give you a clue to my age bracket.  I've likely been around longer than many here have existed.  I'm also here because this is a developer board (last I checked), or is it a playground for <span style="font-style: italic">casual gamers</span> only?  (Pfff... And I wonder why my colleagues fuck off from public developer boards)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll entertain ya, porkchops:
<br/>
<br/>
Why: I like the games both Sony and Nintendo have given me throughout the years.  I've worked on some of these very same consoles.  Call me greedy, but I'd like to have the best of both worlds.  My company may develop for both so that leaves me no choice but to get acquainted with both anyway. (at this point in time we do not have plans to develop for DS, but that will likely change)
<br/>
How: <span style="font-style: italic">I have a job.  I can afford both (simultaneously, if need be!)</span>.  Good lawd have mercy!

It depends on how long you have the game. And it isn't opened at all (meaning, you'll probably want to buy 2). Who knows, in 30 years, you can sell a new, unopened game to some sucker on eBay and make a fortune off of it!!

If you look at my first post - I did say you made some good points - maybe I should not have left those out and elaborated more. The PSP is a very stylish and slick design. Nintendo did come back with a design that should hold its own, and I too, also believe that there may be some healthy competition, which can only be a good thing. In fact, this should stimulate the video game business and help to push gaming forward. And by casual gamer, I ment that I prefer games that are a little more fun and a little less involved then some off the games which require time spent relative to a second job. If you want to continue pursuing this way of posting, I also can humor you, but I prefer to dwell in more positive areas. (The second post was supposed to be complimenting.)

Yeah, I tend to stay positive about new consoles, and I do honestly think we're in for some good gaming.  Even though Nintendo has abolished the competition in the handheld arena, I'm not convinced yet they'll be able to pull it off this time (nor will they lose, either) - and this isn't a bad thing at all.  They can duke it out, and in the end developers and publishers will have to fight hard for consumer dollars.  More games for all of us.  More jobs for developers.  Everybody wins.  (Maybe foolish thinking, maybe not, we'll find out soon enough anyway) :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DracX, Still interested in what you think the strong points of each system are.
<br/>
<br/>
When I originally posted, I probably should have said something like - "<span style="font-style: italic">Yes - but  what system would you pick first, <span style="text-decoration: underline">most</span> people won't buy both no matter what they say. They will pick one over the other</span>"
<br/>
<br/>
I really, really like the PSP. I like and own some Sony products. However, one of the products I have is a Sony Clie PDA. It is okay, but just okay, and I am not impressed with the life of the rechargeable lithium battery, at all. The PDA has no moving parts inside and battery life is kinda lousy. This, in my mind is a <span style="text-decoration: underline">really</span> big issue with a portable device, regardless of price. So as much as I think the PSP is very sweet, I have some real concerns about battery life and price (of course). Smaller issues would be durability, price of software and Sony's memory sticks. 
<br/>
<br/>
The DS, although technically less powerful, has big fun factor written all over it, with no real concerns about battery life, durability, and price (I hope) due to Nintendos track record with handhelds. And of course backwards capabilities don't hurt them by any means. I also haven't even mentioned the new innovations put into the thing, that make it stand out and open a whole new realm of possibilities. However, Nintendo, in my mind has always had a drawback due to their tendency to stick soley to their own special hardware contections and priopietary software (not sure I am explaining myself clearly here  - hope you can understand what I am getting at) 
<br/>
<br/>
So if it isn't obvious, I am leaning heavily towards the DS, although I am keep my eyes and hopes on the PSP, if at the very least to help drive the gaming industry forward. I believe strongly that handheld portability is the future and if what these companies are presenting bodes well, it will untangle us from the cables that currently tie us to our tv's in years to come.<br/>_________________<br/>Age is only in your mind!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You have the option at some stores in Canada to put money down (as little as $10, some places) on a DS or pay the current list price - $340 - this is not the actual price but a speculated one. The store will refund you the difference when the official price is annouced and you receive your DS. I know it sounds absurd, but $340 is about what they have the pre-order price at right now in Canada.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the US dollar equals about $1.25 - $1.30 Canadian, give or take due to flucuations in the market.  If you do the math, that doesn't work out either if you consider a $199.00 US pre-order price I have seen on websites for US stores. (works out to about $245 Canadian I think)

And make it at least twice as expensive to play games. Remember that an extra handheld is much more expensive than an extra controller for a TV based console, especially when kids come over just to play <span style="font-style: italic">Super Smash Bros.

I am not familiar with the DDR game.
<br/>
<br/>
What I ment by priopietary software/hardware was Nintendo has been the most guarded with their products compared to other companies. This obviously is the nature of the business. However it is easier on PS1/2 and XBOX to copy, ect... Nintendo has made sure that even if you crack their code you don't have disks available for copying too! Even cable conections are unusual, so you must purchase their stuff. I am not condoning pirating. I am talking about using standard equip., ect.. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am kinda finding it hard to explain, what I mean, but maybe a comparison between the PSP and the DS will help. Although different they both essential have the ability to do some things the same. EG. - play music files. Sony will offer you memory sticks to do this and will actually pursue this avenue for profit. Nintendo, on the other hand will not pursue this, nor are they likely to make it easy for you to pursue this on your own, even though essentially it is possible on the DS. It is more or less just an observation. In the post I ment this as a very minor point.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as handheld portablility goes - I still stand by my statement.  Although, price and certian harware applications are valid arguements at this time. I still believe the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">future</span></span> will prove different and in the future, new hardware will allow more options, in terms of what you can do and where you can do it, at comparable prices.(it is only twice as expensive today - in the future it could possibly be cheaper) Wires? - yes they are a problem, but many industries are vigourously pursing wireless options, that are reliable for the future. I don't think we can look at old sytems of doing things and current handhelds and say that it is not possible in the future. There was a time when flying was not possible either, until someone invented an airplane, and even then it took some time for the technology to develop and to continue to develop.<br/>_________________<br/>Age is only in your mind!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I said that your index and middle fingers would represent your legs. It would be kind of fun. And the top screen would show what needs to be pressed, the bottom touch screen would kind of represent the game pad.

While it is true that you can only press one point on a touch-screen at a time, most touch-screens I know of returns a kind-of averaged value if you press more than one point, so while it is not possible to detect the exact position of the two points, it might be possible to use the "averaged" value to determine which fingers are currently pressing the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
On another topic... There is no picture of the back of the DS. Will it have a GBA-compatible link port or not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If that is true with the average point of two or more points, then it could be done, since if one finger were to press on the screen, it's location could be stored, and if the other finger is pressed onto the screen, then it would take the average between the two.
<br/>
<br/>
Example: 2 presses, one on the left, and one on the right. Both are to be pressed. The first finger presses on the left. It's location is stored. Now in order to get input cooresponding to the right side, with the left pressed, it would be looking for some value right in the middle of the two, or center. The 2nd figer presses on the right. The average of the 2 is done, equaling the middle. Therefore in order to get 1 left press and 1 right press, it would have to read a location on the left side, and in the middle, or one on the right and in the middle (if the right side is pressed first).

But how would you be able to tell when there was a single point, and when you are getting an average?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IMO, chances of being able to press on the screen with 2 fingers at the EXACT same time is pretty slim. Therefore 1 finger would touch the screen first, that location would be stored, and the other finger presses, and the average is stored, and since the average does not equal the 1st location (unless you have extremely thin fingers, like the end of a stylus), it would assume that the screen is being pressed in 2 places. With using the 2 points and a little trig, they could identify where the 2 press is.
<br/>
<br/>
Now with sliding both fingers across the screen sounds like a different story. I wonder if Nintendo will try to section off the screen so that maybe the left side has its own input, and the right has its own.

Yes.
