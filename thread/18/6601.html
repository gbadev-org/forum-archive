This has been out for a while, it is a port of Quake to several handheld processors/OS's, it's been ported to MIPS, <span style="font-weight: bold">ARM</span>, and SH3, - virtually all the major handheld processors, there is also the source included on the website.  
<br/>
<br/>
I know nothing of programming, and probably never will, but I've recently been thriving off of the DS homebrew scene, and the 2 recent FPS ports have been the subject of my attention recently (.-. I don't have a GBA Flash Card) but I'd love to see a more recent FPS be ported. 
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't speak for others, but the reason I haven't tried porting Quake is primarily the high memory requirements. There are solutions for everything you'd likely encounter (some at the expense of performance), but it would be a rather long and arduous process.
<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the N64 version of Quake you will see the atrocities that had to be committed against its level geometry just to get it running on there, although the DS might excel beyond the N64 there as long as you can keep the vert count below the hardware limit.

I personally think that it <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> be able to run on the DS- however much work this entails, I don't know, because, as I said before I know nothing of coding. I just noticed that this Quake port ran on another ARM chip, and that the DS runs on an ARM chip- and I decided to bring this to everyone's attention on the offchance someone thought they could do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It's entirely possible, but you'll be taking a slight speed hit have to either swap assets from rom or just use them directly. That's also ignoring the fact that with the current 32mb limitation the full version of Quake would require compression to work, making it unreasonable to access assets from rom on the fly. The shareware version would be fine, though, or you could split episodes up between seperate images and probably have enough room for each individually.
<br/>
<br/>
On top of all that, you'll be converting the renderer to use a fixedpoint system, which given the renderer's architecture is actually a lot easier than it otherwise might be. But still by no means trivial.
<br/>
<br/>
Then on top of that, you've got geometry counts. If you're using hardware rendering (which is the only reasonable way to go here for speed) you have a vertex limit of 2048 per frame. This does not equal tri/poly count, but tri/poly count can be some inidication of the verts used in the scene. Turn on r_speeds and just run through e1m1, and you'll see there are areas where this easily shoots above 3500. So yeah, good luck with that too. (see my comment about N64 Quake)
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you think I'm wrong and that it should be very easy, feel free to get started.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that seems pretty clear to me what dont dont you understand?
<br/>
In any case i recon the only real practical way of doing it would be via the m3 with its own ram and cf ability it wouldnt be too hard to load each level individually off the card.  quakes rendering engine is very basic and had very little in the way of optimisations (it doesnt even have backface culling) so there should be plenty of room for improvement i would imagine.

Unfortunately this is beyond my knowledge since im predominately a java programmer so i'm still a way off anything this large.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ahh, my misstake then.

However, a straight port might now be possible, but you actually needs to do a remake, somewhat like the developers of DoomDS are doing in a "larger" scale.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Really? I'd be well interested in hearing what games people would want to see ported. My personal shortlist of things I'd be looking into if I had any time is:
<br/>
<br/>
Tekken 3
<br/>
Descent
<br/>
Something loosely based on Uplink
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Quake, the PS1 and N64 ports of Quake and Quake2 were massive engineering efforts. Eg, for Q2 on the Playstation, they had to:
<br/>
 - Reimplement most of the codebase
<br/>
 - Rebuild every level from scratch
<br/>
 - Rebuild every character to use skeletal animation</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I took a look at this a few months back...it's the nastiest codebase I have ever seen; reimplementing the game-logic from scratch (with some cut'n'pasting) would probably be easier than a straight port.
<br/>
<br/>
I got as far as extracting and converting the models and levels, and writing enough code that you could fly around levels (with placeholder collision), but then I hit a busy period at work and never went back to it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think quake could be ported to the DS quite easily. From an art perspective i can tell you that there are MANY areas of quake  that can be optimized. 
<br/>
<br/>
The model textures for example have some of the most unoptimized skin bases i've seen, they could easily be halved and still have higher resolutions. They would of course need to be almost completely remade though.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall texture use could be improved alot with a shader system which would reduce the memory needed for animated textures greatly.
<br/>
<br/>
The quake1 engine did not have an entitie called a func_areaportal which was placed inside a door and would stop the engine from drawing what was behind the door even when it was closed. Engines these days incorporate this function automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
Level designs can be improved apon alot and take into consideration the way the engine draws its levels alot more.
