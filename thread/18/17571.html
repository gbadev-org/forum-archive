    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i am ready to begin programming for ds.
<br/>
<br/>
so, can someone give me some clues on where to begin?
<br/>
i have tried PAlib, but that piece of poop has too many problems.
<br/>
so if libnds is my only option, then can someone link to a getting started guide or tuorial?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I am referring to the examples that are installed with the devkitpro installer. There should be an examples directory under your devkitpro install directory. If it is not there then run the installer again and make sure you install the examples in addition to devkitarm and libnds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
