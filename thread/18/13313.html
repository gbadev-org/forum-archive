    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Howdy.. i hopee i'm posting this in the appropriate section.. seemed like a good idea at the time =)
<br/>
<br/>
was wondering.. is there a ds app that allows file transfer between 2 or more ds's? i was thinking of scoping out the ds ftp client.. seems like a bit of overkill for what i had in mind. 
<br/>
<br/>
it just happens sometimes when chillin with the wife or buddys we'd like to send a file to another person, ie mp3's, nds files, ebooks.. rather than go to the computer, break out the tf key and all that jazz. maybe i'm overlooking something obvious?
<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions? i think it'd be cool if beup allowed file transfers.. or if ds organize's file browser had a network neighbourhood kinda thing to get the job done..
<br/>
<br/>
thanks guys..<br/>_________________<br/>/ . <span style="font-weight: bold"> o 0 avid 0 o </span> . /

NIFI is just a custom 802.11 implementation, the issue is not to crack it or so, it's just that it requires some effort to implement the protocol and as it's not documented, you have to reverse-engine it by capturing packets and analysing them. Too much efforts here, so no one has done it.
<br/>
<br/>
But you can do DS&lt;&gt;DS communication with the current wifilib, you have to use raw mode to do that, filter the packets &amp; write 802.11 raw packets by yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone should make a template for that...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that's cool. i'm not sure how to go about that, as i'm still learning. i'm still somewhat new to the homebrew scene, i know a bit about  programming, but i'm not close to being a pro by any means. any chance you could outline how i might do that? =)
<br/>
<br/>
ok, well here's another thought.. 
<br/>
<br/>
is there something that does what i said going though an ap.. but without needing some app running on a machine on the network..  like 2 ds's in a room i have 192.168.0.100 and buddy has 192.168.0.101.. have some file sharing ability using the ap..?
<br/>
<br/>
hmm another thought is an optional app on a computer on the network that acts as a dump or a common place for files.. a file pool of sorts.. a good place to dump nds files, mp3s, movies etc, allowing ds users to connect and use remotely or download..
<br/>
<br/>
anything like that??
<br/>
<br/>
i've spoken to dragonminded (dso) about a few ideas i'm kind of hoping he adds things like this to dso.. as well as my idea for being able to listen to mp3's or streaming music WHILE reading ebooks, browsing the web, or chatting on irc (well anything u can do in dso) aka multi-task on the ds.
<br/>
<br/>
too many ideas.. 
<br/>
<br/>
=)
<br/>
<br/>
ps.. while i'm throwing things out there. i like the game defender of the crown by cinemaware. i used to play it on my c64 back in the day, then on my amiga.. then.. meh.. there should be a DOTC_DS project. anyone wanna sign up for that? =) lol.
