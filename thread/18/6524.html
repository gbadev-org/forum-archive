<br/>
I have started on ndslib yesterday and I'm creating a 3D game on the DS. It's a simple shooter like Hogan's Alley from WarioWare.
<br/>
<br/>
I am using a drawlist which was an md2 (thanks for the converter) but I get very strange colors when I apply the texture I made with the PCX converter included
<br/>
noisy rainbow etc.. but the rainbow pattern follows the U/V coords of the model so it must be a texture problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I have used the ready-made texture.bin which came with the library and the color are fine but i want to use my own texture.
<br/>
<br/>
I played with the color modes but still bad.
<br/>
<br/>
So I want to create a texture in the same way texture.bin in the arm9 3D demos was created.
<br/>

@md2 loader creators PLZ RELEASE THEM PLZ PLZ PLZ
<br/>
<br/>
THANK U

Please use propper English if you want to be taken seriously. I can only guess you are saying Wario Ware, but I can't be 100% sure.
