    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to get dpg video working on Moonshell 1.7x.  
<br/>
<br/>
For version 1.7b0, 1.7b1 and 1.7fb, the readme says to use same moonshell 1.6's folder (moonshl) and simply replace the <span style="font-style: italic">something_moonshell.nds</span> by the new one provided.  
<br/>
<br/>
On my Supercard Lite, I’am having those problems : 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1.7b0</span> &amp; <span style="font-weight: bold">1.7b1</span> (unstable)
<br/>
Sound from dpg was very strident,…  
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1.7fb</span> (unstable) &amp; <span style="font-weight: bold">1.71</span> (stable)
<br/>
Sound from dpg isn’t working at all.  
<br/>
<br/>
For dpg encoding, I was using <span style="font-style: italic">out of the box</span> settings under <span style="font-style: italic">dpgenc.exe</span>.  
<br/>
<br/>
To get Moonshell to work under my SCL (f/w 1.7a from Chishm), I had to choose for MPCF and patch it with the DLDI for SCL.  
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to help me out.

P.S. : Yes I kmow, the NintendoDS screens are too small to really enjoy a good movie.  But while riding from places to places in bus or subway, it’s kinda cool to watch Family Guy and stuff,…</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
