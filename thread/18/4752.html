    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think the only way to run ds code from the gba port is making a boot loader that runs from the ds port and tells ds to run code from the gba port. i don't think any shared pins could matter at all, the two slots are different.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt it since the GBA carts are parallel, and the DS carts are more of a serial-ish design. If they had any (important) lines shared, I don't see how they would be able to play nice with each other.  Especially since we know that DS carts can access stuff that's in the GBA slot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All of this is research. You are going to see theories come and go. Things you think can't be done, will be done. But because you are here, you'll be the first to know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes but that WAS by faking a bootloader in the DS slot and telling the DS to execute the rest of the code from the GBA slot.[/code]<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What would be the point of me trying to go into the details of how DarkFader did it when I only understand the basics?
<br/>
<br/>
I dont think I was implying it was simple, I was merely saying that it HAS been done but this wasnt purely with the GBA slot it DID require a patch of sorts through the DS slot.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, a patch of sorts. Didn't DarkFadar use ARM7 code to jump to the GBA slot and execute a rom dump of Metroid Prime: First Hunt?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
