    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI guys I'm Mushroomguy I just regged here. I'm curious about being able to connect my DS to my computer when I went to a DS dev site, but the only prob is, is that for it to work they say you should have a PCI card. I can get one, but is it possible for the DS to communiate via wireless router? Sorry if this has been posted before I looked for this just to be sure &gt;.&gt;

thanks for your help

<br/>
At some point in the future, once the WiFi hardware is reversed and a TCP/IP stack is implemented, you could communicate with a DS over the network with a wireless router for file transfers and the like.
<br/>
<br/>
But you would still need some method to actually boot the homebrew software, so there will always be the need for a PassMe-like device or PCI wireless card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
