<br/>
still very alpha and unoptimized no sound yet

includes embedded Neo Geo Pocket rom called Snake, I got from <a href="http://pdroms.de/file_details.php?fn=560" target="_blank">http://pdroms.de/file_details.php?fn=560</a>

thanks to mrnull on #dsdev(efnet) for the screenshot running on his DS
<br/>
<br/>
Only shows first screen in ideas and doesnt work in other emulators.

<br/>
BTW, why is everything you do based on the windows port of the dreamcast port?:P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you could use the two processors of the DS for that specific emulator it would be nice : the ARM7 processor of the DS could emulate the Z80 used in the NGPC for sound...<br/>_________________<br/>GBA,GC,NGPC,GP32,FPGA,DS stuff at <a class="postlink" href="http://torlus.com/" target="_blank">http://torlus.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'v uploaded a new binary and source code to my site
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://gpf.dcemu.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://gpf.dcemu.co.uk/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Now its using the CZ80 processor and added some other speed hacks that I got from the PSP NeoPop port author- Penguin . 
<br/>
<br/>
Still probably dreadfully slow, but untill I get a flashcard I have to rely on the kindness of others in #dsdev to test , since only ideas 1.0.0.5 displays the first screen before it just sits their. dsemu is black screen, and dualis crashes.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if its any faster than the first release.
<br/>
<br/>
Please download the source and improve it as well :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,

<br/>
only thing i can think of is I'm using R14 and latest libnds. (even though recompiled YaSFCaves and its still works with dscemu)
<br/>
<br/>
I had to use a lot of VAR_IN_EXRAM around many of the global array etc to get it to compile so maybe thats related.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that the source code to both my ports are on my site if you want to compare them.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
