    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just thought maybe the slot 2 can be made into a SIM card adapter to turn the DS into a phone? Would it even be possible to interface basic call/receive functions to the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
If it's even possible, would it even be feasible to attempt? One major problem that sticks out is that the DS will have to be on (but idling) non-stop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Another one would be that the DS is not a phone. I'm fairly sure that the DS has none of the required hardware (besides mic and speakers) for making calls.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

I assume (maybe horribly incorrectly) that he means that the adapter would contain the required extra hardware...cell phone transmitter/antenna, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just dream on... nobody can take that away from you... but I suggest you forget it instead... and not the type of forgetting that makes you come back with a "new" idea, which is the same old idea you have forgotten about...

GSM networks are very open, they all follow the same standard afaik. I still think connecting to it with a NDS is not very useful, but it'd be possible with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=479" target="_blank">something like this</a> along with a <a class="postlink" href="http://olimex.com/pcb/index.html" target="_blank">custom PCB</a> to interface it to the NDS. As you can see from the price, it's definitely not cost effective. On the upside though, the above module also includes a GPS receiver.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The whole GSM stack of a typical phone lies on a separate CPU that typically uses a variant of the Hayes Smartmodem protocol to communicate with the main CPU. That separate CPU would go in a SLOT-2 card. For (say) a Pandora, it might go in an SDIO or USB dongle.

Until you get into the service plans. Or do the GSM networks in the United States (AT&amp;T and T-Mobile) give customers a discount if they bring their own unlocked phone?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, in China there's tons of counterfeit cellphone units, which are much cheaper than the originals. It shouldn't be that expensive to get the basic hardware for making/receiving calls in place. But it wouldn't be cheap either (or even practical).

I don't know how it works in the USA, but I think it might be possible to get a service plan and get only a SIM card without a phone. Or get the cheapest phone possible and just use the card (it's the phone that's locked, not the card, right?).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's already a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol" target="_blank">SIP client</a>, no idea if it's actually usable atm.  Skype is extemely unlikely seeing as the protocol is closed, although I'd probably buy a Skype (tm) NDS cart if they made one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, that's how it works. As tepples hinted, most likely they wont give you a discount, so you might feel cheated that other people got a free / cheap phone, and all you got is a SIM card. But they are perfectly happy to sign you up and only give you a SIM card with no phone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
