Exactly how does your USB adapter see the DS?
<br/>
People seem to think that if you can see the DS in NetStumbler then its compatible.  ANY adapter will see the DS in NetStumbler, only ones with hacked drivers (currently only the one XLink are working on) can actually TALK to the DS, the rest can only hear what the DS is saying but not reply in a way the DS would understand.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not much. They haven't yet released the app which would allow for a coder to talk to the DS using the stick (all the low-level stuff would be provided), though useless to the average person.

Not ANY card will work with NetStumbler and see the DS. One card in specific, a Linksys PCMCIA 802.11b card, even when the properties are set correctly, can never see the DS on NetStumbler.  It is able to see my WLAN, and my neighbor's WLAN.  I wasn't able to see my DS until I used my Belkin USB 802.11b card, and then only with NetStumbler.  I wasn't even able to capture beacons with Ethereal.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess thats true, as all three of my cards work with NetStumbler it seems it has very high compatibility. What I was trying to say is that the majority of network cards (99.9%?) which CAN see the DS in NetStumbler are STILL not able to talk to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Belkin (Prism 2 based) PCMCIA card, AMD based and an Atmel based (I think its Atmel, its Belkin USB).  All three of those work with NetStumbler but it doesnt mean any of them will necessarily work to talk to the DS - even though I suspect at least the first two technically can do it if someone hacks the drivers.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

1:  Get a GP32
<br/>
2:  Install GP32 Linux with USB drivers
<br/>
3:  Insert WLAN adapter
<br/>
4:  See if you can see the DS on it
<br/>
5:  Report back :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">6. Wait for a linux application to emulate the DS comes out.
<br/>
7. Wait ages until someone figures out how to get it on a GP32 (Doesn't a GP32 have a fast enough processor?).
<br/>
8. Install Emulator on GP32
<br/>
9. Have fun!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GP32's ARM9 can go as high as 166 MHz on most units, and higher on others.  But even GBA emulation works crappily; can you imagine how hard it would be for this little system to emulate a two-processored handheld (with hardware 3D on the system being emulated but not on the host) AND run all of this on top of GP32 Linux?  I would be surprised if it was possible to get a single frame rendered at all, let alone a full 30-60 frames per second.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
