This is very very alpha. It won't show anything else but the splash screen and sos screen. In the future it will go into FB mode and the BLISS background.

Because they changed the name of MS-DOS 7 into Windows 95 Prompt, Windows 95 was an OS. So I agree. Also my favorite boot logo sequence (too bad I can't do that on the DS, and Windows XP's are much easier to produce... much cheaper) helped to convert the DOS startup into a more GUI friendly Windows OS.

Why? The only thing needed is VGA scroll simulation during SOS boot.
<br/>
<br/>
Sure dosbox may be great for the console during CSRSS time. But the console will probably just have some simple file system commands anyway. Windows XP isn't designed for DOS users. It's designed to give annoying balloon tips and a huge start-menu. And that's what we want to see on the DS!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dosbox is written in C++ and works like pretty much any other emulator by acting as an interpreter. There's no reason you couldn't port it to any platform you want, but I'm not saying it would run well without practically rewriting it. Because it wouldn't.
