    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi all coders!
<br/>
my name is Tomer! I've done some GBA coding (Quake1 GBA at gamedev.net).
<br/>
<br/>
-I see that emu comunity has evolved much, but:
<br/>
 can u emulate the 3d chip? if not then I think it's not really worth your time to spend. I mean these are old school technologies. Anyone really
<br/>
interested in 3d should do at least one or two software renderers, and
<br/>
then pass to GPUs.
<br/>
what I mean is do not waste time on garbage - get a job at a liscened DS developers studio. or at least put some 3d on Pocket PC.
<br/>
<br/>
- BTW, check my Pocket PC engine :

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm...first he states that he has done GBA dev, and then says we shouldn't worry with DS because its old technology?  
<br/>
<br/>
And how would getting a job at a DS dev studio make the homebrew scene better?
<br/>
<br/>
Odd....Odd, I am now sure this post was "not really worth your time"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
