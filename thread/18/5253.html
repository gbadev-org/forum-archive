    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This has been tested to work with Mario 64 DS, and this concept was created by me.
<br/>
<br/>
Step 1:  Find a heavy ball (I used a fishing sinker, but make sure it doesn't have sharp points to scratch the touch screen) and put it on the touch screen
<br/>
Step 2: Place a box just big enough to cover the touch screen over the touch screen, to stop the ball from falling off
<br/>
Step 3: You can now play those games that use a 'virtual joystick' on the touch screen (like Mario 64 DS) by simply tilting the DS!
<br/>
Step 4: Write a Marble Madness clone that can be played like this for me :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All of this is research. You are going to see theories come and go. Things you think can't be done, will be done. But because you are here, you'll be the first to know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is "Yoshi's Universal Gravitation", but that's Japan-only.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It was released today in the UK (although I had some trouble convincing the bloke in the shop that this was the case, they still had "preorder me now" boxes on display).
<br/>
<br/>
The Yoshi sensor is smaller than the Wario one because it doesn't have the rumble feature that Wario has. So if someone's thinking of hacking a tilt-sensor cart, I'd suggest hacking the Wario one as it's much cooler with the rumble.<br/>_________________<br/>---
