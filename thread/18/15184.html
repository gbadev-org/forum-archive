<br/>
<br/>
After doing some research, I found out that it was not possible to temporarily disable the depth test on the DS. So, what I would like to know is : are there any alternatives ?
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, what I want to do is draw a 3D triangle that would overlap EVERY other poligons which have already been drawn on screen. I suppose it's possible, but I can't seem to find out how to do it with the DS's hardware...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit : problem solved by playing with glOrtho. Sorry for those who have encountered the same problem, no code since it's pretty much specific to each situation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
