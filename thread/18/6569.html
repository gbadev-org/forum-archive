    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I showed the latest version of tetris (giant tetris) to my girlfriend today and she had a great idea for an easier 2 player match at tetris.  We tried playing 2 player the way it is, and it was really hard to get comfortable with.  She made a good point that it would be easier to flip each player to fit its own perspective.....well, you'll see. Look at my mock-up.
