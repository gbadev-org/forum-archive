    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't seem to figure out how to initialise the DS for wifi. I've copied the c file from the wifi_lib_test and use that for my arm7 code. For the arm9 (which is in c++ as opposed to c) I've copied out of the wifi_lib_test arm9 code everything to do with initialising the wifi. However, Wifi_CheckInit() always returns 0.
<br/>
What could I be doing wrong? The wifi_lib_test itself compiles and runs fine.
<br/>
How can I test to see if the reason is that the arm7 has crashed or the arm7 code isn't properly integrated with the arm9?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You could add a cookie string and look at the file in a hex editor to make sure it is</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
