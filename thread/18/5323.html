I haven't heard if Warp-pip and Nitro are still working on it, let alone if they've successfuly tunneled it and made it available to the public.
<br/>
<br/>
Any info at all, thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Aww damn. But are Warp-pip and Nitro still working on it? Because I remember Xlink successfully had Pictochat and MP:H demo working, so it must be at least possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even if it did work, it would only work with specific WiFi equipment. Mainly, you'd need a WiFi adaptor that indirectly supports RAW data transmission and reception at both ends.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have that figured out and set up, all you'd need to do would be to intercept, package and transmit at both ends, blindly and continously.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">would it not be possible to develop a GBA cart which worked alongside for eg Metroid and converted the NiFi packets into TCP packets? To explain better:
<br/>
<br/>
A homebrew GBA cart with a TCP/IP protocol - you'd use the GBA cart to launch the DS cart and it would then intercept the NiFI 802.11 data and encapsulate it with a TCP frame.....just a thought from someone with limited knowledge of DS dev :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure what you mean by "homebrew cart", but in any case you'd probably still need to patch the game to send the data to the GBA cart, so why not patch it some more to use TCP/IP directly instead?<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By homebrew cart i mean a GBA flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
As I see it you would access the DS cart by using the GBA cart - therefore the GBA cart would be controlling the system and therefore would intercept all transmissions so no DS game modding required.... maybe :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as tunnelling multiplayer non-online games goes, yes.  But don't forget that future games could be made TCP/IP compliant to talk to normal wireless hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
And I think the_angry_monkey was probably thinking something along the line of launching custom code using a GBA flash cart that acts kinda like an interpretor, taking commands from the DS card, sending any non-wifi/nifi data to where it's supposed to go, but modifying any wifi/nifi data into TCP compliant packets and sending them off on their way.  Correct me if I interpreted you wrong, monkey.
<br/>
<br/>
However, that (to my knowledge) is not possible for two reasons.  (1) Launching anything straight from the GBA slot without some kind of device like the PassMe causes the DS to go into GBA mode, disabling all non-GBA DS features, like wireless and touch screen.  (2) It would be like emulating a DS on a DS, meaning everything would run about 1/10 the speed that it should (number taken from the emulation rule-of-ten).
<br/>
<br/>
Nice thought, though.  Maybe someone will find out a way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, something like that may be possible, if you used passme + the game you wanted to modify. You could have it jump to your custom code first, that puts a small routine in memory, then jumps to the main game. the small routine would watch for any commands being sent out over the local network, and instead send them out over the internet. any replies it recieved from the internet, it would translate into the format the game expected, and then insert them into memory as if they had come over the local network.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you'd need intimate knowledge of how the wifi worked, so I don't know if this would be practical. But it wouldn't be 'emulating' a DS so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">mymateo - that's exatly what  I meant - thanks. I see now how there would be problems, but I deo remember Nintendo saying that the DS would be able to use peripherals in the GBA slot whilst running DS games - maybe this will be Nintendo's solution to the wifi upgrade?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#38846 - mymateo - Fri Apr 01, 2005 11:27 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I doubt it.  The built-in wireless hardware should be able to do anything a person would need a portable game console to do, plus more.  It's all just a matter of what the software tells it to do, really.  But, yes, if there were to be some kind of improvement needed on the wireless, then a wireless nic gba card could be made.
<br/>
<br/>
On that note, I wonder if the DS's wireless is hardwired to only transmit at 2 mbps max, or if that's just for the nifi protocol and it can really go as high as 11 mbps at reduced battery power?
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I think tunnelling the old games isn't going to happen, and if it does it's going to be tricky to get it to work smoothly.  More likely we're just going to have to wait until games start being made to go online.  If the rumors I've heard are true, then Animal Crossing will be the first online DS game, and that's being released on DS's first anniversary, Nov 21 2005.
<br/>
<br/>
November 21 is a date that will haunt me forever -- the date that the only game AND system I've ever wanted so bad I could taste it is released.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Animal Crossing will be great but I really think that they need to make WiFi a surprise earlier release. Ie. we all think it will come out in Nov with Animal Crossing, but it's actually ready for summer.....just a dream :D Would be a great way to combat PSP tho.
<br/>
<br/>
On the 2Mbps transfer rate, network stumbler has reported my UK DS as transmitting at an occasional 11Mbps, however, its SSID is all gobbledygook so it could just be a slightly scrambled interpretation. My idea was that NiFi saves power by transmitting at 2 Mbps under normal operiation, but can step up if needed to 11 Mbps - although there is little t4chnical knowledge to base that upon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
