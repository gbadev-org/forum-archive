Ofcourse, as i'm sure everyone else here is, i'm eagar to get into developing for the DS as far as homebrew goes. With the state that public tools are in, what should someone like me be doing at the moment? There aren't any compilers for DS roms or anythinglike that are there?

Here is the state of things:
<br/>
1) No emulator, even though one has already been stolen,
<br/>
2) No compilers yet, but you can try ARM9 ASM code, theres a list of registers that have been leaked somewhere
<br/>
3) The NDSwiki contains a lot of information.
<br/>
4) Currently the NiFi front is stuck (I think it's got to do with Auth stuff, but I might be wrong), you might want to fiddle around with it: If you have can make drivers/firmware for your WiFi card, that is. The cart front is going pretty well, though (Passthroughs that can be used to develop in ARM9 ASM by modifieing the header on an original cartrige to point to the GBA slot and using a non-multiboot rom). DarkFadar's working on the encryption, which is needed before flash carts can be made properly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Everything needed to compile code is available. You can set up your dev environment by following the instructions on the front page of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds" target="_blank">NDSTech Wiki</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Emulators are being developed. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hyperds.com" target="_blank">HyperDS</a> already runs homebrew demos but is not yet released for public download.
<br/>
<br/>
The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/blogs/natrium42" target="_blank">PassMe</a> DS cart dongle will be built and tested this week. It allows you to run your DS demos from a GBA flash cart. A few people are planning to produce small runs of the board for homebrew developers.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You said that there are no compilers.  You said that there are 'linkers' for programming in ASM.
<br/>
<br/>
There is quite a bit of difference.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think the ARM9's faster and has some more internal memory. Or something like that. If you can use C++ with an ARM9 I don't see whats stopping you from coding with C++ for the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the DSP instructions (mainly 16-bit multiplies) are awesome for certain things. Basically gives you twice as many registers. I wish they would have made an unsigned version of smulxy though (x and y specify to take the top or bottom half of the argument regs), it would have been so nice to grab just the fraction of a 16.16 fixed number for free.
<br/>
<br/>
As for using C++, that was perfectly fine on the GBA too, just that you can accidentally write slow/resource soaking code more easily with it than plain C. No different on DS, just that you have more speed and memory to waste :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

From what I have read, the ARM9 has a deeper pipeline than ARM7 (makes higher clock frequencies possible, but decreases performance compared to ARM7 for a given clock frequency).
<br/>
There are also a few new instructions, but nothing too fancy.
<br/>
The cache/memory management is a bit more advanced.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
