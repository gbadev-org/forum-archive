I am in possession of a SupercardSD, a GBA SP, and a thirst for media. I originally wanted to run movie files strictly through the GBAFilm program that the Supercard website provided, and I was quite happy with that. However, after seeing the playback that my friend obtained on his NDS, I am eager to try the Moonshell videos for myself. 
<br/>
<br/>
The obvious problem: Moonshell doesn't work on a simple GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
My big question: Is there anyway at all to get these files to play, short of obtaining an NDS?
<br/>
<br/>
Even if no one has coded something like this, I'm looking for pointers in the right direction to possibly make something like this a reality. A standalone DGP player would be wonderful, but if wishes were horses, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your time reading this, and, again, I appologize if this has been asked before (or worse, if this topic should be placed elsewhere).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

More sophisticated codecs take more CPU time per frame. The Nintendo DS has a faster processor than the Game Boy Advance.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The thread title got me thinking: has anyone tried playing GSF on a DS? They're basically just the sound code ripped from GBA games, so virtualizing should suffice as they wouldn't use as much hardware or CPU power as an actual game.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GSFopt, available at <a class="postlink" href="http://gsf.caitsith2.net/ripping.html" target="_blank">http://gsf.caitsith2.net/ripping.html</a>, can convert a GSF file to a GBA rom, though the downside is that each converted file is the same size as the original GBA rom.  Trimming sometimes helps, but it's still not very optimal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
