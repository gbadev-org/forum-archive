    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Refer to this video I made of an example of my problem: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=lbR7EzJLzKU" target="_blank">http://youtube.com/watch?v=lbR7EzJLzKU</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll outline my problem here:
<br/>
<br/>
Almost every homebrew app I try on my flash cart that tries to write data to my microSD card, whether it be the saver files as demonstrated in the video, backup saver files from eepinator, or even pictures/text from DSOrganize, nothing works. Things don't write correctly when they're supposed to. Sometimes an app will create a 0-byte file and not be able to actually write anything to it, sometimes an app will try writing to an existing file and end up corrupting it, or sometimes it will just hang; all three of these outcomes are demonstrated in the video with SNEmulDS.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I've asked a couple of other people who have the same flash cart as me if they have these problems, and everything seems to work fine for them. So either my flash cart or my microSD is defective, I assume? Or maybe before I go and spend lots of money on a new flash cart or microSD, is there any possibility that maybe my microSD just isn't supported by DLDI or something? This is pretty annoying, 'cause I can't even use any emulators such as SNEmulDS like in the video.
<br/>
<br/>
However, whenever I try to save with a commercial DS or GBA game, and my flash cart attempts to write the saver file on the next boot, it's fine. No problems whatsoever. Nothing is corrupted, everything works. This just happens when an app tries to access the microSD directly.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, if I try to use a buildable emulator such as PocketNES (or was it NESadvance? One of them) that saves in the same fashion (write to the flash cart's PSRAM, flash cart writes it to the file on next boot), it also works perfectly. I can save states and such perfectly on that particular emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
Specs:
<br/>
<br/>
EZ Flash IV Lite Deluxe
<br/>
Transcend 512MB microSD, AND Transcend 2GB microSD; slightly varied but overall non-functional results
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So would this be a hardware problem or a homebrew coding problem or what? Any help would be appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Case closed; I tried a SanDisk card today and it works beautifully. Looks like Transcend just isn't supported properly. Thanks for the help, everyone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
