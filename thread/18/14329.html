    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Got Vista-x64 and would really like to be able to compile under it. I understand there is a hack but wintermute said that this should not be relied upon. Any other ways to compile, or should I simply restore my XP Home image on another partition and boot it up whenever I want to do some programming?
