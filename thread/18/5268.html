    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im not sure if every one has read this or not but i was reading a translated chinese web page that says that the speed of the mask rom is only 150 ns... thats twice that of the super nintendo which was 70ns... 
<br/>
i've found flash rom thats 64Mb that is 90ns on mouser.com shouldnt this be fast enough to use as a flash cart and use the CLPD as an intermediate??
<br/>
<br/>
just a thought
<br/>
*Edit*
<br/>
