    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what you guys use/do when debugging your homebrew?
<br/>
<br/>
And when I mean debugging, I mean if you want to verify that certain variables are getting correct values.  Or testing your logic flow is going in the desired direction.
<br/>
<br/>
Because I'm developing a greater appreciation for debugging tools like gdb, ddd, and having the ability to trace through source code while your program is running.  Because it sure beats print statements...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can still find it if you look around on the Internet. It's a gdb stub which runs over the DS' wifi and allows you to run gdb (or something which talks to gdb, eg eclipse) on your PC and step through code, put breakpoints, inspect variables etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I remember masscat writing something similar too, so have a lookie.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Works great for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Sure, you can't do EVERYTHING that a full-fledged debugger can, but it still works great.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a quick tutorial I wrote:

As for the the GDB in DesMuMe, the last work I did on it is the one used in the HOWTO that 0xtob linked to. You can get the source from <a class="postlink" href="http://digitalvault.bt.com/invite/login?c=3130353833&amp;i=160814-10ff6f1e0b7-gemini02&amp;t=4d08ae7c97a8c6aa&amp;r=mg&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">here</a> too.

As there is interest in the desmume I will tidy it up and put it into the desmume cvs. May even use it to debug the on hardware GDB stub and get that into a better state :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is great interest in desmume! How else are OS X/Linux people like me supposed to debug in an emulator? :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
