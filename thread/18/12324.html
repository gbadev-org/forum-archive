    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">afaik it's not devkitarm which has problems, but that Vista breaks gcc itself. I assume they will start working on it in ernest now that Vista has been released, but you may have to wait a bit. Perhaps you can run a VM with linux in it? (VMWare and VirtualPC both offer free versions IIRC)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got ubuntu running in vmware on vista for my compiling needs. The blame isn't 100% vista nor 100% gcc, it has to do with CreateProcess not being called in an expected way and vista not behaving the same as older versions of windows with this unexpected calling.  There are supposidly patches in the gcc / mingw / cygwin trees but I've yet to see the problem actually solved.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, microsoft claims vmware is broken on vista but I've not had any major problems besides escalated cpu usage. CoLinux doesn't work right either (compiling problems).
<br/>
<br/>
The best setup for working on vista I've found (ymmv) is a seperate machine running linux, with devkitpro installed, and your projects kept on that machine, shared out via cifs with samba to your windows machine. That way you can use your favorite editor (assuming it runs on vista) and still compile with dkp.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
