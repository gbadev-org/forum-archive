<br/>
I know theres no Mac OS X support for anything on the DS homebrew scene, but i think there needs to be some awareness, running virtual pc to do everything (if you can even get it) the little bit of Mac development done has faded into obscurity. The DPG conversion software for DPGs, which seems possible to get over the supercard software would be really useful as this means no movies and brings a huge flaw to  Moonshell. I hope this thread doesnt just fade into nothingness like other mac threads may have before it. Suggestions from anyone? (yes that includes you windows users, lol)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A basic VM, while maybe a pain to run, isn't so bad, since it does provide a nice closed work environment...
<br/>
<br/>
Having a dual-boot on your system isn't really a bad idea either. I'm paranoid so I always find it useful in case one OS manages to fry...
<br/>
<br/>
If you seriously want the stuff on you need on OS X, though, port it. If the source isn't available, try and get your hands on it for said purpose...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

huh? there's a version of devkitpro for mac, does it not work for you?
<br/>
<br/>
or do you mean that there are a few (very few) windows-only support apps? I never watch movies on my DS, and besides the dpg convertor, is there anything else which you need which is not available on the mac? I can't think of any (mainly because I'm on linux, and historically, mac gets better support than linux, and I haven't had any big problems that I can think of.)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, there was that one 'win2ds' app, but I heard it didn't work that great anyway, and I don't have a real use for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, i was referring to apps. There was win2ds also the supercard patching software, I think there was a couple others but my memory sucks, i need to go look them up, i know it doesn't seem like a lot but things like moonshell are one of the things ive seen a lot of requests for, id also like to use the thumbnail picture viewer thingy. My DS is like my new iPod (stolen, lol) that does everything and more. But no integration with my Mac lol, I wish i was a mac, or at least a new one with intel, then i could dual boot and have a nice little linux partition :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Luckily, this software is not needed for any homebrew at all, (at least, i've used lots of homebrew and never had to use the supercard offical software), so you're not missing out much there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless you have SuperCard Lite and you need to patch programs that use the FAT library with the so-called "moomshell patcher".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
i don't know if this is the right place to ask for this but i can't help giving it a try. excuse me if this is not proper.
<br/>
<br/>
i've been trying to set up everything needed to work with PAlib under Mac OS X Tiger, but i'm just uncapable of doing it. i would fully appreciate if anyone could help me a bit with it in case any of you have done it before.
<br/>
<br/>
if none of you use PAlib, could you tell me which is in your oppinion the best platform to develop games for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
i'm halfway developing a game on PAlib but when I've changed my laptop the project has entered an unlimited pause state.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks a lot for your attention,
<br/>

You can look at the source and figure out how to run it. Probably make a shell script to actually run it easily.
<br/>
Twolame and mencoder can be used natively on Linux, and that's all it really uses.
<br/>
Well, except the headermaker, but the source is provided for that, so you can port it over to Linux or something. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
NDS development works *fine* under OS X; it's my primary environment.  I had to patch the build scripts for devkitpro because I wanted to build from scratch, but the precompiled stuff installed and worked fine before that.
<br/>
<br/>
I only used PALib briefly, but, IIRC, it built pretty much with just a few tweaks.

Does Dualis (the only DS emulator that I've found to be worth a poop even for 2D) work on a Mac? Or do you recommend DSFTP or musical cartridges for each build?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
