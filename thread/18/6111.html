    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if this section is appropriate, but I want to introduce my game concept, which I'm going to implement on NDS (as fast as I get one :) )
<br/>
<br/>
I want to get your opinion about it, so here it is: <a href="http://cb.revo.pl" target="_blank">http://cb.revo.pl</a> - there is some Windows implementation, that AFAIK works on WINE (with gdiplus.dll).
<br/>
<br/>
There are some bugs, but I'm not going to fix them - NDS version will be fully reimplemented, so there is no sense.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious what do you think about it :&gt;<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by revo on Wed Jul 06, 2005 5:30 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a great game.  Not very easy to control with the mouse, but I bet that could be fixed with the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Something else that bugs me is that you need to control where the screen moves.  I was thinking there could be a little imagionary box (about half the size of the scren) where the ball can move without forcing the screen to move.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, good job, and good luck on the port.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It works pretty good on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.double.co.nz/nintendo_ds/dsemu-0.4.3.zip" target="_blank">DSEmu 0.4.3</a> (on 0.4.4 slower), on IdeaS is too slow to test, on Dualis touch screen isn't working :(
<br/>
<br/>
Waiting for your opinion - it's my first DS 'demo' ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm curious why it got slower on DSEmu 0.4.4 or why it's slow on Ideas. How are you doing the main loop? Are you using switWaitForVblank? Or looping on the VCount register? If the latter, DSEmu definitely runs slow in that case.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can track it down from the emulator side.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, I tested on thing and it's working faster on emulators ;)
<br/>
<br/>
It was so stupid - I put all code into vblank interrupt handler, but I thought, that it should work correctly. Now, when it's moved to main loop it woks fine: <a href="http://dscode.revo.pl/demos/cbt1_2.zip" target="_blank">http://dscode.revo.pl/demos/cbt1_2.zip</a><br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yah, the VBlank interrupt should really only be for graphics code and the like, and leave the rest of the processing to the main loop. Otherwise, your VBlank code gets bloated very quickly the more complex it gets, hence the slowness.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
