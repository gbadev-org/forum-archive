<br/>
<br/>
I've had a little problem using ADPCM on the DS... I tried tons of different conversions and playing options, but nothing seems to be perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
I converted my sounds to raw dialogic ADPCM with Switch, tested most of the sample rates, and alos tested .wav IMA ADPCM.
<br/>
<br/>
Concerning IMA ADPCM, it didn't sound that good, as I had a few chops all along... I read on the forum that it would come from multiple headers in the wav files
<br/>
<br/>
So I tested in raw format, and the result was pretty good, except that when the volume in my sound was under a certain level, I wouldn't here it at all (was just cut out for some reason). When replaying the sound on PC, it didn't do that. When I tried with the headphones instead of the DS speakers, I could hear that the sound hadn't stopped, but it's volume was very low... and when the sound is louder again, the volume becomes normal.
<br/>
<br/>
I tested this for mono and stereo sounds (just in case), at 11025, 16000, 22050, and 44100. 16000 didn't work, 22050 and 44100 had the problem with the low sounds not being audible, and 11025 was ok (still a bit low when the volume goes down, but it was audible), but the sound quality wasn't that great...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have an idea on how to solve this problem ? It's really annoying when the sound has a fade away or such in it, as it seems to just stop...<br/>_________________<br/>PAlib official forum : <a class="postlink" href="http://www.palib.info" target="_blank">http://www.palib.info</a>
