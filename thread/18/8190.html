    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently using this setup for development:
<br/>
   DS Hardware for testing
<br/>
   EFA-Linker256 for loading code onto
<br/>
   FlashME or whatever it's called for the firmware patch
<br/>
   GBFS for filesystem type stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
That works fine for me, but if i give my nds's to anyone else, they get blank screens and stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
What would the people here recommend in the way that i compile data into code, handle interrupts, filesystems and other stuff to ensure that it isn't just me who can run my code.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Either way the best way of solving a problem is following the exact same procedure on the second device as you did the first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
