<br/>
I have been noticing that a lot of people have been using some wierd
<br/>
7-day free internet site...and almost all accounts have expired...
<br/>
so........
<br/>
I have 150 megs of space to use and wanted to know if anyone
<br/>
needed hosting space for their demos and tools..
<br/>
if so, email me at:
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">zerotri@gmail.com</span>
<br/>
with the subject of
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DS-Dev Hosting</span>
<br/>
and the attached demo/tool
<br/>
and I will try to add your file to my webspace and send you a reply
<br/>
with the link, etc.
<br/>
