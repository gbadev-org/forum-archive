    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The world hobby fair is going to Tokyo next week, where gamers will be able to download a demo of the DS game Meteos.  Does anyone here live in Tokyo, and would they be able to get to the show with a laptop and try to capture the packets being transferred?  Yes, I'm crazy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sounds like a good idea, just need someone that either lives in tokyo or is going to tokyo (next week) as you stated. although i don't think you'll find anyone, too bad.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you *seriously* want someone, try an "ask slashdot" to see if anyone would do it, and post the capture.  i have found that that is possibly bar far one of the fastest way to find nerds anywhere in the world.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-
