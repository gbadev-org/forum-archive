Thank a lot!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for adjusting these, there is a video floating around of a DS that someone has seemingly overclocked. It shows Mario Kart playing at 200% speed, as well as 50% and 25%. It's entirely possible, but the games are tuned for the default speed.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Specifically, the ARM7 is probably specified as 33.55 MHz (2^25 Hz) plus or minus about 30 kHz, and the ARM9 is twice that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't say clockrate gives an image of a device, it's really quite misleading. Higher clockrate is not equal to better performance, it depends on lots of stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want more info about overclocking, I'd suggest you contact Furre on IRC, Efnet, #dsdev.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But Yes there is much more on which depends speed. Of course a 8bit cpu with 10mhz cant do that much like a 16bit version with same speed. Also the floatingpoint plays a role (espacialy for 3D opperations). But thats still not all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well the ds's clocks are not very good indicators as most of the function you will be using are buiylt inro the actual hardware
<br/>
<br/>
you have sprite and background layers done on hardware making parallax scrolling very fast, if this was done in softaware based framebuffer mode it would be very slow almost still if done on both screens
<br/>
<br/>
The ds's 3d core also runs on the arm9 its a weird core that runs at 60 fpsaslong as you adere to the poly limit
<br/>
<br/>
you have 4mb of ram
<br/>
656kb of vram
<br/>
<br/>
the vram buffer are nice for some special effects....
<br/>
<br/>
the gfx are copied directky to the vram which keeps your 4 megs nice and free unless you decide to do frambuffer graohics
<br/>
<br/>
If you are starting out try palib (infact even pro should use it, iussualy have to use some ndslib functions if i need to do some manualy vram bank manage ment)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
