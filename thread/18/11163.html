    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can check out <a class="postlink" href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/index.php" target="_blank">The Freesound Project</a>, everything there is under an attribution creative commons license, so basically as long as you give credit, you can do whatever you want to(and with) the sound effects.  There's a link to ccmixter on that site, a creative commons music site.  I'd never seen it until about two minutes ago, but it looks like the music on that site is under a variety of CC licenses so you'll have to pay more attention if you find something you like there.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you might want to check "catch that goblin" and "2nd reality" (and the like) by Skaven, or maybe the .MOD that came with "Pinball Fantasies" and "Pinball dream". they should have the bloops and swooshes you're looking for. I don't know too much about what licensing would apply, but at least that would get you bootstrapped.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks guys, that site seems a little useless for what i want. PypeBros - I never thought of ripping open mods to look for samples, thanks for the tip.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
