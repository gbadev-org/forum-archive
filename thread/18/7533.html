<br/>
<br/>
I am making a class for exporting 3D data from various formats and the vertex resizing "problem" makes me wonder some things. 
<br/>
Does the use of glScale have some impact in performace if the scale is by a big factor? I ask this because in opengl I have noticed that if I pass big values to glScale things move worse (seems to drop performace). 
<br/>
<br/>
And as for fixed point question, wich operations are overloaded for f32 and the other fixed point structures? Beacause I have tried using * instead of mulf32 and the result is not the same.
<br/>
<br/>
I know I was forgetting something. How can I print a float with iprintf (if it is possible)?.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
