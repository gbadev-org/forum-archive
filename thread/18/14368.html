    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if this game has come out in Europe or the the US yet... I saw no sign of it in London a month ago... but I picked it up in Japan a couple weeks ago. This game comes with a "slider" that's basically a wedge shaped optical mouse that jams into slot2 of the DS. I can take photos if anyone wants them.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone had worked out how to access this thing yet? I lost my R4 on a plane and haven't gotten around to getting a new one, so I haven't been able to do anything with it myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To be honest the game is complete kack. But for 4000 yen with the mouse thing I suppose it ain't bad. The mouse part is pretty well built, and is an offical nintendo device, i.e. it has their logo on it.
<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I get another R4 I'm going to build an etch-a-sketch app with it or something :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think anyone is interested... but I'll post my findings here anyhow;
<br/>
<br/>
Pins in use on the Slot2 board;
<br/>
<br/>
/WR -- Used as a clock for the flip-flop. So writing to slot2 causes a clock.
<br/>
/RD -- Runs into the nand, it goes into a gate on the nand.. I'm not sure what the other input on that gate comes from. But the output goes into one half of the gate connected to AD19
<br/>
AD0 -- Not sure, I suspect it goes in to the nand.. 
<br/>
AD1 -- Second input of the flipflop, from tracing the circuit it seems to be connected to the Serial IO CLK signal on the A2030.
<br/>
AD2 -- Third input of the flipflop, Bringing this high and clocking the flipflop brings the A2030 to life. So I think this is connected to the PD signal of the A2030 which according to the data sheet is used for syncing with the host MCU and powersaving.. 
<br/>
AD3 -- Forth input of the flipflop
<br/>
<br/>
AD8 -- runs into the rumble section of the board.. pulling it high and clocking the flip-flop will turn in on, low/clock off again.
<br/>
<br/>
A19 -- runs into the nand, the output of this gate runs up to the buffer I think.
<br/>
<br/>
Parts on the boards;
<br/>
"Agilent ADNS-2030 Low Power Optical Mouse Sensor"
<br/>
"7400 - Quad NAND"
<br/>
"74273 - Octal D-Type Flip-Flop"
<br/>
"74125 - Dual Bus Buffer"
<br/>
<br/>
Without some basic equipment like a multimeter or logic probe, I can't do much more. I know that the A2030 needs a clock signal via SIOCLK that is apparently on AD1. I have the instruction set for the A2030 here, so if I could work out what the remaining pins do I could start programming the A2030; I think one is for the SIO pin itself and the other two are for controlling the direction of the SIO, i.e. from DS to A2030, from A2030 to DS. I think controlling the direction of SIO has something to do with A19... it's on a non-muxed pin (address or data) for a reason. I think the reason is that if you read from slot2 offset+a19 offset you put the bus into read mode? /rd is going into the nand as well..
