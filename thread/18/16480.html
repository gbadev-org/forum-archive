    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to make a title page as the game start.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to upper screen's title to be animated and I want the bottom screen to have words that can be highlighted by d-pad.
<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much a typical look for any game.
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to game development. What is the approach/design I should understand and look into in order to achieve this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What tools are you starting with?
<br/>
<br/>
Upper title animated can be done by displaying a different Bmp per game loop, different sprite frame, different palettes, or all 3.
<br/>
<br/>
Highlite via dpad the same way, though changing palettes is probably the easiest for that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And if what Mike said didn't make sense or didn't seem helpful, then you need to go back and read some general tutorials on GBA/DS programming.  Most of us recommend <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/" target="_blank">TONC</a> -- even though it's for GBA programming, it's similar enough to be quite helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have the general techniques for GBA/DS programming down, a title screen should come fairly easily.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
