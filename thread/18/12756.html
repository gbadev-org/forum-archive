<br/>
I read some posts about it, but no clear answer. Well i decide to create a topic :).
<br/>
So, i bought the DS Browser, with the memory expansion. I have a M3 simply, and i would like to know, if I could use this memory with my linker, to play homebrews, who need more memory.
<br/>
Thanks for answer !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Last time I checked, the DSLinux guys were interested in trying to get the Opera browser usable, asking for people who had both a slot-1 flash cart and the Opera ram pack.  In addition, I believe Moonshell already uses the RAM pack to help render very large images.

<br/>
I don't think it can be used with things like SnezziDS though, at least not yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
