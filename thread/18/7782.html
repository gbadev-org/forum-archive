Actually, I am running on the real thing! Since the update, I removed the function call, and the touch screen is not responding.
<br/>
Before that, it was working with the same exact code. Maybe I need to change something on my code?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok... on a closer look I seemed to be using still the old way of reading touchscreen instead of the touchReadXY() - i.e. IPC-&gt;touchX and IPC-&gt;touchY give me readings without any problems. Testing quickly touchReadXY() didn't. But perhaps it's better that someone involved with libnds development comment on this. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, after some searching in the code,
<br/>
<br/>
I can see that the initKeys is no longer needed. Problem is that using the new standard method I get really wong readings (they seem to be expanded, scaled up).
<br/>
My solotion for now is to go back to the previous version of the library.
