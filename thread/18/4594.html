<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at the multiboot thingie from the mario game, and I see it accesses addresses like: 0x03806E94. That address isnt specified in the memory map's i've seen for the DS. It loads the word at that address into r2 and then bx r2.
<br/>
<br/>
What could that be? Some kind of jump table? Adresses to OS calls?
<br/>
<br/>
(is it legal to post a bit of asm of that kind of things?)

I think it depends much on which country you live in. It is often a gray area.
<br/>
In general I think it is supposed to be perfectly legal make short quotations from a copyrighted piece of work, as long as the quotations are short enough and the original copyrighted work is properly referenced.
<br/>
But IANAL.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The ARM7 copies code into its private WRAM and runs it.

ector: "This information gained by attempting to run the thing in a prototype emulator that is pretty damn useless atm otherwise" was that a statement or a question? I'm considering writing an emulator, yes...
