The DS display list can include commands such as swapping textures or changing the transform matrix within the list along with the geometry. Assuming you only have one bone per vertex you can define the entire model. At that point animation consists solely of setting the bone matrices to the right values prior to submitting the list.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I'd need some more info on <span style="font-weight: bold">DS display list</span>.
<br/>
Looking at the FIFO section in libnds <span style="font-weight: bold">videoGL.h</span>, I can't see any macros specfically for texture swapping, or matrix operation.  
<br/>
Precisely : can I simply use GFX_MATRIX macros in FIFO stuff ?
<br/>
Generally : what can / can't be done with NDS display lists ? Are we limited to those few operations the FIFO_xxxx are showing us ?
<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find answers in the forum, so I'm asking. Feel free to redirect me to the post if I'm wrong -but that should not be the case.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You are correct that you can only do operations that can be built from the registers in the core control section.
<br/>
<br/>
However that definitely DOES include MatrixRestore, since I've used that, so I bet you can do all of the other Matrix operations as well. Just define the new values with REG2ID() and try them out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
