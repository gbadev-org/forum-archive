    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eh. I try use this scheme:
<br/>
<br/>
0. Write simple crossplatform engine (PC and NDS).
<br/>
<br/>
Pipeline:
<br/>
1. Make program on crossplatform engine, compile and test it on PC (in VC++).
<br/>
2. Compile .nds and test it on Dualis emulator.
<br/>
3. Copy program on flashcard and test it on DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok. But here is some problems with performance speed. Code based on low-level DS-architecture is much faster (in particular direct arm-asm code for game logic)! Sux. :( That's make some troubles with logic-debugging. You must make two programs. One on PC and one on DS- and here is almost no possibility to automatize this developing pipeline. 
<br/>
<br/>
How you resolve this pipeline-problem? How you develop and debug your homebrew programs?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
