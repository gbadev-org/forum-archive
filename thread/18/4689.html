    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only a few days now before I travel to the States and hopefully pick up my DS. Just a quick question to ask if anybody has imported from the US to Europe. Do the European (or UK) Gameboy SP power cables work with a US DS system? I read that they were the same, but obviously I want to check before I try and blow up my new system.
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody tried it?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As long as it supplies the same voltage, it should work.  I believe there's only one model of SP, and so all require the same power.  The same goes for the DS.  Therefore, all SP adapters should work in all DS'es.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I confirm that everything is OK. I was lucky to leave the States on Nov, 21st in the afternoon so I got a DS back with me (woke up a 6:00AM to get it at Walmart ;).
<br/>
I am in France an everything is working fine with my french SP power adaptor. Plus I have now a complete US/UK/JP/EU power supply for my SP/DS (as the US power supply is 110-220V, IIRC).
<br/>
<br/>
Having the same power supply between the DS and the SP was really a great idea from Nintendo!

Incidently, not to sound like I'm plugging or anything but if you buy a DS from Liksang, you earn enough reward points to get a free USB charger...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
