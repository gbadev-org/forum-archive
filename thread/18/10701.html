    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While fooling around with 3D, I stumbled upon a rather nasty problem with transparent textures:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the GL_RGB32_A3 texture format that has a 5-bit paletted color + a 3-bit alpha value. I have two objects, which are just quads with a semi-transparent texture.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I encounter now is that the depth test seems to be inverted for semi-transparent textures. That means if object A is before object B, object B is still in the foreground. And when object A is behind object B, object A is still in the foreground. I switched the order in which the objects are drawn, which had no effect at all.
<br/>
<br/>
When using a texture with non-transparent, as well as semi-transparent and fully-transparent texels, then <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> the semi-transparent texels show this strange behaviour.
<br/>
<br/>
What could be causing this? Am I getting something wrong about the DS's alpha blending?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!

the polygonal "priority"(think of it like bg's) depends on the POLYID in the POLYFRMT</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool, thanks very much, using poly-ids fixed it!
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not quite sure what they are for yet. The object to which they are assigned (i.e. object A = 0 and B = 1, or A=1 and B=0) does not seem to have an effect, as long as both objects have different ids. Is that correct?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the quick reply. This kept me figuring for hours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess reading interview is useful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
