    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd recommend downloading some videos of the games in action from sites like IGN and Gamespot. They also have in depth impressions and detailed facts about them. I'd also recommend <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nintendoinsider.com/" target="_blank">this website</a> which I used for most of my news during E3. Most of the information out is impressions and whatever they played at E3. Not too much more information has been released regarding the DS. Hope this helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
