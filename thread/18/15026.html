    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can someone confirm my thinking on the sprite limitations?  I want to be able to show 42 64x64 8-bit color components on one screen, and seeing as they're movable I thought I'd let the hardware do it and use sprites.
<br/>

I quickly discovered the addressing issues when I hit my ninth sprite, and from my reading I *think* that if I set DISPLAY_SPR_1D_SIZE_256 and use two VRAM banks I can get away with it, yes?
<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I'm asking in advance rather than just doing it because I have to do some laborious manual positioning work for each component and it's slow going, I've only done 9 so far :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just take your head and some do some easy maths:
<br/>
<br/>
1 sprite 64x64x8bit = 4096 bytes
<br/>
<br/>
- 1 bank = 128K =&gt; 128/4 = 32 sprites
<br/>
- 2 banks = 256K =&gt; 64 sprites
<br/>
<br/>
yes that's possible if your use 2 vram banks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the memory allocation wasn't what I was unsure about, it was whether the addressing would work properly so I could get under 1024 tile locations - the only relevant post I could find seemed to indicate the smallest amount I could increase my tileIdx by was 32.  But no, I can use 16 and everything is working fine now.

I'm loving this hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
