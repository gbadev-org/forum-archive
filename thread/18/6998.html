    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now, don't start flaming me just cause i have an idea for an app that i dont' know how to make (nor have the skills to create).  I was just thinking...would it be possible to make a tool to alter gba games so that they save to the ds slot?  The reason for this being that my gba flash cart won't save anymore, but the ds roms i play save because they're patched to save to the ds game in the ds slot.  Is anybody interested in pursuing such a feat?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Definitely looks like it...

Note the constant links to P0cketH3aven (where tepples is quite active, it seems) and other hints given to people obviously planning to pirate...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ok it's sad if it is true.. but I havn't really seen any signs of it yet.. I mean like in this thread where is the piracy talk (except for the complainings)?
<br/>
just b\c YOU think he is going to use it for his evil w4r3z masterplans.. that doesn't mean that it is what HE is going to use it for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This doesn't sound like he's playing homebrew roms to me, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

EDIT: For example, I take this post to mean "I admit to pirating DS games occasionally, but I want to run GBA games (possibly homebrew, possibly pirated) and have them save to a DS original cart."<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Some of the newer flash carts come with replacement backup batteries so you wont run into the same problem again.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
