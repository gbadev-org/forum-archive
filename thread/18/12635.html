    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm making an app (which could become a firmware replacement if I knew how to make the flasher program.) for the DS that works with the Max Media Dock. It's based of FWNitro (Since I can't seem to compile it because itwas made withan earlier version of DevkitARm and libnds) and CreeboMe (Which won't release its source code!). 
<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem. I want to know how to launch .nds files in the programs code. I got a program called DS Launch.nds and I'm not able to find its source. With this it allows you to launch the DS cart in slot-1. I will also need help with the GBA launching but I dont think that is nessisary just yet. I will definatly need help with the Homebrew displaying (stupid PAFS not supporting MMD even with the GBA_NDS_FAT driver!) but I could just look at the moonshell source.<br/>_________________<br/>Flashed DS Phat (FlashMe v7)

The largest reason is because it still is in beta and its not quite all stable yet... Anyways if you are looking to load .nds files specifically by their file name, I can't point you in any direction. However I will tell you that the homebrew cart loading in my firmware and FWNitro is not by loading a .nds file. It simply loads a gba flashcart into DS mode. Also, libcartreset by Lick does this same thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

what do you mean "into ds mode"? BTW, libcartreset doesn't support MMD which is why i am not using your firmware<br/>_________________<br/>Flashed DS Phat (FlashMe v7)
