    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i' ve got an idea: ds can not emulate <b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b> because it isn' t more powerfull then <b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b>; but if i convert the <b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b> binary to arm9 bin?
<br/>
the <b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b> ram is 4MB(without expansion); so shoul be possible to load rom.
<br/>
I' ve just found in internet a program very similar to nds tool: it let you to get 
<br/>
<b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b> rom bin. But the problem are here: i must re-compile the bin for arm.
<br/>
How can i do it? is possible to get the sound bin and put it into arm9 bin?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Theres people trying to make Xbox games work on the PC by convert the xbox exe's to standard pc ones. While its still early days I think they proved the technique was doable.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, with an decompileing and recompileing to get an <b style="color:#FFA34F">N64</b> game to work would be far harder. And it would probably take a heck of a lot of manual tuneing per game to get it even remotely playable. 
<br/>
(and this is ignoreing the controlls, screen, and framerate issues)
<br/>
<br/>
But i wouldnt say the principle was impossible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It probably is possible, actually, but with a LOT of work, most of which couldn't be automated (you'd have to do it all by hand). Most if not all commercial <b style="color:#FFA34F">N64</b> games are programmed using Nintendo's standard library, and as such, a lot of their code is very similar. If you could write a program that would find and identify the common code in each game, and write DS versions of this code, you'd probably have a good portion of the work done. However, you would need to port the rest of the code by hand, and porting ASM - especially <span style="font-style: italic">compiled</span> ASM - from one platform to another is NOT easy. You'd need to know pretty much everything about thr <b style="color:#FFA34F">N64</b> and DS hardware (which tend to be poorly documented), and it would simply be a heck of a lot of work. You'd actually be best off trying to decompile your target game into C, and then edit that to work for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Xbox games can be ported to PC because both use X86 processors. Xbox is basically a stripped-down PC. <b style="color:#FFA34F">N64</b> has a sinlge ~93mhz R4300i, while DS has a 33mhz ARM7 and a 66mhz ARM9. <b style="color:#FFA34F">N64</b> also has a floating point unit, some sort of coprocessor, higher resolution, more buttons, and I think it may have more VRAM and A(udio)RAM. The only real feasible thing to do would be to extract all the resources from the game (possibly modifying them, like reducing polygon count and shrinking images and sounds) and write a new game engine for the DS that plays the same as the <b style="color:#FFA34F">N64</b> game does using those resources. Of course that means needing to know just about everything about the game.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are crazy enough to do this, I suggest you start with a later game such as Zelda or Diddy Kong Racing. (Oh, for a DS port of DKR... :() Earlier games like Mario 64 and Mario Kart have crappy programming (early versions of their compilers and libraries, I suppose) that will make it that much harder to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is called "high level emulation" and was used in the UltraHLE emulator.

You'd need to work for Nintendo to have access to that. If so, then write a proposal for a port and give it to your boss.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
It just takes an awful lot of time and effort to make it work, along with some disgustingly intimate knowledge of the source and target architectures.
<br/>
Plus a lot of time, and even more effort.

But sometimes it costs more to determine who owns exclusive rights in a game and to find a financing publisher than it costs to do the actual port.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ya true,  I think that coming up with something original that is based off something you liked on <b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b> would be a better idea.  I think this would be a near impossible project to do.  It's like trying to make your own <b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b> hardware so that it's small enough to be portable yet be exactly the same as an <b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b>.  I mean, you could do it, but how long would it take you.  And for both projects I think you would need to have very intimate knowledge of the <b style="color:#FFA34F">n64</b> hardware and everything else on the programming end as well.
<br/>
<br/>
What he is proposing to try doing requires a hell of a lot of knowledge about both systems, which if you had those skills, could be put into working on something a little more feasible.  Like right now people with tons of skill are trying to work on small things like transfer programs, and msdos ports.  Just seems like it's shooting a bit too high.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
