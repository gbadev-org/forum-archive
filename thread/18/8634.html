<br/>
I was thinking about writing a .sdat player. It seems that a lot of games use the same version of the sound format so it should be able to playback the sounds of a lot of different games.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm working on figuring out how exactly to playback the files and I'm wondering if anyone had any code samples on how to read data from the cart in the NDS slot?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
