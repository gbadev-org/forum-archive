    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm sorry to ask, this may be waste of your time,
<br/>
but i still haven't found any _good_ information about video handling.
<br/>
i'd be pleased to know how can i put my sprites to touchable screen.
<br/>
currenty i'm copying those sprites to OAM_SUB, which seems to be at 0x07000400.
<br/>
it seems to have no effect if i changed those parameters for that sprite.
<br/>
should i tell [what?] to use [what?] bank or something?
<br/>
currently i'm running out of ideas what to try next and i'd be very thankful
<br/>
if you'd point me some source of information where to look at.
<br/>
<br/>
i really like this machine and want to develope something for it.
<br/>
and yeah, this ain't my first platform. i've been coding for several years.
<br/>
this is first one for a long time when i'm feeling newbie :)
<br/>
<br/>
thank you for your help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sprites are exactly the same as for GBA, except there are two screens (which are completely separate, generally). Look at a gba technical document for the details (like gbatek or cowbite spec - google for them, i'm too lazy to look up a link). Or find a gba sprite tutorial if you need a quick walkthrough of the basics.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have sprites on top screen, but i'd like to have some sprites at another screen too.
<br/>
i've never coded anything for gba or any other nintendo device, so this is
<br/>
quite a new stuff for me.
<br/>
i'm familiar with many concepts of that device since i've programmed for
<br/>
couple of other specific machines.
<br/>
<br/>
i know those screens are separate, main problem for me is that how to
<br/>
tell sprites where i'd like them to be drawn.
<br/>
i've tried to copy those to another bank and use that with touch screen, 
<br/>
but i seem to miss something inportant since i didn't succeed :)
<br/>
it's easy to grab screen address and draw them manually, but that isn't what i want.
<br/>
sprites give me "free" scaling etc</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Let's see, steps should be:
<br/>
1. Turn on power to bottom screen (probably done).
<br/>
2. Turn on screen and sprites in sub disp control (bits 16 and 12, I think).
<br/>
3. Allocate some VRAM for sub OBJ.
<br/>
4. Put some image data in sub OBJ VRAM (0x6600000).
<br/>
5. Put some colors in sub OBJ palette (0x5000600).
<br/>
6. Set up sprites in sub OAM (0x7000400).
<br/>
<br/>
Unless I forgot something, that should do it. 
<br/>
Actually not incredibly more complicated than GBA. Just the VRAM allocating causes the most trouble. And having to turn the screen on in two places. I still haven't found what motivation the hardware designers had in that one.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

<br/>
If you turn on only one of those bits and view the screen under a light that's bright enough to make the original GBA Castlevania playable, do you get a faint image? Perhaps one turns on the screen and the other turns on the backlight.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
