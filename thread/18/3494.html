Ok, I think I deserved that.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, tepples, maybe I wasn't clear. I wasn't asking for the documentation . I was only asking if they had released the information about the system to the public yet. Too many people are referring to the "leaked" document and I was only asking if they had given out that information at the E3. I was assuming that since they revealed the system that they would tell about it's specs too (like processor speed and amount of RAM). 
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like they didn't. I learned the hard way. I won't talk about it again.
<br/>

Sorry. I use Mozilla and did not notice onUnLoad="procreate()" because Mozilla blocked it. Apparently, keldon's Opera installation is set up to block window.open in onunload handlers as well. I went back and fixed the link to go directly to the .swf, which doesn't attempt to spawn new windows.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
