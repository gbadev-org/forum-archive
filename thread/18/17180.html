    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello. I am trying to port my game to Nintendo DS, and I wanted to implement sound. The best option for me, is to keep using SDL_Mixer (so I have same code on all platforms). Do you guys know if it work? I did tryied using it to play wave files (directly from the card, not raw appended to binary ones), but have no sound.
<br/>
<br/>
If it does not work, is there a good alternative to playing background mp3 music and wav files?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>_________________<br/>Iuri Fiedoruk
