My wager was that they got about as far with their technical knowledge as starting a <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nitro" target="_blank">project</a> on sourceforge.

They didn't even bother to make a page for it with their sf space, which says a lot about the validity of the project.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
