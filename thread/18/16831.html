    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm coding an music player at the moment. I use maxmod now for streaming, but i want to code the streaming myself(cannot pause the music stream with maxmod and i want to do some things which are now not possible). but there's one little problem: I do not know how you keep track of the amount of samples that are played. maybe with a timer? but can timers on the nds measure things like this?:
<br/>
for example the music has a samplerate of 22050hz. that would mean that 1 sample takes 1/22050 of a second to get played or 4,5351473922902494331065759637188e-5 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
ehm. that number above is a bit tiny, i mean really tiny:) that isn't measurable I think. so say i have a buffer of 1kb(512 samples) how can I know when the buffer is empty and needs to be refilled?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, timers are the way to go. Sound channels run on timers that tick at half the rate of CPU timers, so you can match them exactly by setting the CPU timer period to channelPeriod*2. Then cascade another timer off that to count how many samples have been played.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Master clock: 16756991 Hz (approximately 2^24, but not quite)
<br/>
You can't really do 22050 samples/second, the closest you can get is 22048.67 samples/second (a timer period of -760).
<br/>
<br/>
Two things to know about timers:
<br/>
* Timers run off the same clock as the sound channels.
<br/>
* Timers can be run in "Count-Up" mode, where it cascades to a previous timer.
<br/>
<br/>
When you set the period of a timer, you tell it how many cycles it will take before it ticks up.  So for a 22048.67 Hz timer, you use a 16-bit value of -760, because 16756991/22048.67 = 760.
<br/>
<br/>
If you run that timer in Count-Up mode, the previous timer ticks up whenever the next timer expires.  So you can use this to set Timer #1 to have a period of -760, and run it in count-up mode.  Then timer #0 increments whenever a sample is consumed.
<br/>
So, let's say you want the timer to go off every time 1024 samples are consumed.
<br/>
You would set timer #0 to have a period of -1024, and timer #1 to have a period of your sound rate.  Have timer #0 generate IRQs so you can call your code to fill the buffer.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now some facts about how to do the buffering:
<br/>
You want to use a ring buffer, one that loops back to the beginning when it finishes playing.  For example, let's use a buffer size of 8K, using 16 bit samples.  Every 1024 samples played, 2048 bytes are consumed.  So this buffer has 4 slots. (You can get away with 2, but I'm just using 4 as the example here)
<br/>
At the beginning, before you start any audio, first pre-fill the entire buffer with the first 4 blocks of audio.  You load 8K into the buffer, then tell it to play sound, and start the timers.
<br/>
When your timer IRQ fires, it's an indication that 2K of data has been consumed.  You will want to replace the most recently consumed slot with new audio.
<br/>
<br/>
An illustration of how a 4-slot ring buffer might look:
<br/>
at beginning,
<br/>
&gt;xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx (buffer pre-filled with 4 slots of audio)
<br/>
 ****&gt;xxxx xxxx xxxx (first slot has been consumed, and an IRQ fires)
<br/>
 XXXX&gt;xxxx xxxx xxxx (first slot has been replaced with new audio)
<br/>
 XXXX ****&gt;xxxx xxxx (second slot has been consumed, IRQ fires)
<br/>
 XXXX XXXX&gt;xxxx xxxx (second slot has been replaced with new audio)
<br/>
 XXXX XXXX ****&gt;xxxx (third slot has been consumed, IRQ fires)
<br/>
 XXXX XXXX XXXX&gt;xxxx (third slot has been replaced with new audio)
<br/>
&gt;XXXX XXXX XXXX **** (fourth slot has been consumed, IRQ fires)
<br/>
&gt;XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (fourth slot has been replaced with new audio)
<br/>
****&gt;XXXX XXXX XXXX (First slot has been consumed, IRQ fires)
<br/>
YYYY&gt;XXXX XXXX XXXX (First slot has been replaced with new audio)
<br/>
etc...
<br/>
<br/>
You can also get by with only 2 slots.  The ring buffer does not necessarily need to use fixed sized blocks, or be a multiple size of fixed sized blocks, it just makes the math much easier, nothing needs to be split and have some go to the end and some go to the beginning.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

really thanks for all the detailed answers.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">edit:</span>
<br/>
okay I looked at the answers and from what I'm understanding I have to do this(be warned i've never worked so with timers before so it can be totally wrong:)) :
<br/>
<br/>
-setup two timers:
<br/>
<br/>
timer1 with a period of 1024(which will count the samples consumed and will say if the buffer needs to be refilled) and timer 0(a 22048.67 hz timer) with a period of 760(which counts the time of a sample) in count up mode.
<br/>
so every time timer0 has reached 760(the time of 1 sample) timer1 will increment(this is because of the cascade mode isn't it?). and if timer1 has reached 1024 i've to set it to 0 and fill the buffer with new samples.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When we set TIMER1_DATA to -BUFFER_SIZE it's the same as setting it to '65536 - BUFFER_SIZE' since the hardware treats the value in the TIMER1_DATA register as unsigned. It will then count up from there until it overflows ( at 65536 ) and then it will reset to '65536 - BUFFER_SIZE'. We want fillEnd to be a value between 0 and BUFFER_SIZE instead of '65536 - BUFFER_SIZE' and 65536, so we convert it. I hope that made any sense.

No, soundPlaySample() sets the timer of the sound channel it assigns the buffer to ( see <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dssoundchannels015" target="_blank">gbatek on sound channels</a>. ) That timer is only used by the sound hardware, you have to setup one of the cpu timers to match it ( in my example that is timer 0. )

<br/>
Signed numbers use the most significant bit as the sign ( it is set for negative numbers. ) In the case of 16 bit numbers ( the timer data registers have 16 bit length ) numbers 0 to 16383 are positive weather they are treated as signed or unsigned. However, 16384 to 65535 become -16384 to -1 if they are treated as signed numbers and so, naturally -16384 to -1 will become 16384 to 65535 if they are treated as unsigned.
<br/>
<br/>
This might give a better picture:

<br/>
Unsigned: 0...16383        16384...65535</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
65535 is the largest value you can store in 16 bits and 16383 the largest you can store in 15 bits ( for when one bit is used as the sign. )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
the 65536 is now clear to me, normally you could only put 65535 in an u16 but the situation you gave me in the example was when an overflow occured and then it becomes 65536. so the example will only fill the buffer when it's completely empty(or isn't that right?)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For stereo sound, you use two buffers, and two hardware sound channels.  Tell one hardware channel to output to the left channel, and the other to output to the right channel.
<br/>
You don't need to use two sets of timers, the same timer that tells you to update one buffer is the same timer you would use to update the other.
<br/>
<br/>
Usually stereo WAV files are interleaved, so you get one sample for the left channel, then one sample for the right channel, etc.  The NDS does not have any native support for interleaved stereo audio.  You'll need to split it yourself into the two buffers.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes. Basically you simply read you stereo sample one sample (halfword or byte) a time and you load it in your 'left' or in your 'right' buffer. Then you play both with playsample, giving full left panning to the left buffer and full right panning to the right buffer.
<br/>
<br/>
If you need to stream from a stereo wav file it's a bit more complicated (you need what's called 'double buffering') but the idea is the same, because NDS hardware audio channels are MONO, with panning.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
