    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">﻿Imagine a device that snaps over the DS's touch screen. This device looks and feels like a joystick. The bottom of it touches the screen just like if you were using your finger/stylus. The best part is that it actually feels like a joystick with feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is the controls would be inversed, unless someone makes it different or games would have to have a special option to support it. Of course you'd have to take it off when you close the DS, but what a small price to pay. What do ya think? Shouldn't be too hard to make eh?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suppose making it out of a clear material or make it as small as possible but still useable. But in the kind of games you use it in (FPS,etc) you really dont look at the second screen much anyway. Like in Hunters, you don't look at the map that much, well i don't anyhow. 
<br/>
I still think it'd be nice to have though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On a helpful note, you could probably "correct" the controls by using 2 sticks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They could always make a separate attachment that hooks into the GBA port that only sticks out a little bit so that they can place the analog stick just below the DPad. While they're at that, make a 2nd analog stick that is under the buttons on the right. That way if you don't want to use it, just take the attachment out.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm afraid so. The touch-screen can mimic an analog stick as it would have more flexibility, but not completely vice versa, as the analog stick always has a specific center point.

The wifi devices for input sounds like a good idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wait! We weren't supposed to do that?!?!?!?!?!?!
<br/>
j/k obviously.
<br/>
<br/>
For the option of a hardware attachment, it looks like you'd have to remove it when closing the DS, unless they figure out a way.
<br/>
Heh, maybe it won't be an actual analog stick at all, but rather a very thin analog nub so that the DS can close, except then the hardware extending to each nub from the main part in the GBA port would have to be thin also, resulting in an attachment that is pretty fragile.
