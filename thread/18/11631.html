    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am having issues with my sprites on the main screen. I want to have only VRAM_B set to MAIN_SPRITE, but I either can\'t figure out how to set the tiles (likely) or I am copying the data to the wrong place for some reason (unlikely). 
<br/>
<br/>
If I want to use the first tile in VRAM_B in 16 color mode, what tile do I need to have my sprite access? Also, what memory address does VRAM_B get mapped to when you use it as MAIN_SPRITE?
<br/>
<br/>
I am using real hardware, of course. I\'ve managed to get it to work fine in VRAM_A, but B is giving me grief.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I am relatively certain of two things. (1) I am copying my data to the right places, and (2) I had the mode set wrong. I figured out with some reading that you cannot use sprites in the framebuffer mode. Easy fix though.
<br/>
<br/>
I still cant get anything to show up from VRAM bank B. Works fine with A, and I am seriously considering re-working my code to just use bank A only instead. This really bothers me though. Is it even possible to use B without using A as well? 
<br/>
<br/>
With every calculation I have tried (assuming the tile size is 8x8) I should be needing to use tile 4096 to effectively skip over the VRAM_A section which I have mapped somewhere else. If this is incorrect (I have tried 0 as well, and some other stuff, still no show) please let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
This is really starting to bug me. I cant design my drag-and-drop toolbox if I cant make the sprites work for the whole dragging part...
