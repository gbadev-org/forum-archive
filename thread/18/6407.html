    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have to agree with SolidSnake on this one.  I just read this little topic here, and all he seems to be asking is what the roadblock is between where we are now and running commercial games.  I didn't read anything about him asking how to run a commercial game.
<br/>
<br/>
I love this forum, and I wholeheartedly agree with keeping things legit, legal and homebrew only, but sometimes I fear we take that too far.
<br/>
<br/>
So SolidSnake, I will answer you to the best of my knowledge.  Yes, in theory, if you flash a commercial game to a flashable DS card then it should work properly.  The only thing is that Nintendo may have found and implemented a way of detecting writable cards then it may not work.
<br/>
<br/>
Then the issue you run into is how to get a commercial ROM from a cart intact.  NeoFlash is working on a DS card reader, but right now it only grabs random data (which causes me to think that maybe it doesn't even grab data?  How do we know it's not just randomly generated gibberish?  I dunno, that's not my bag).  Plus the issue of how to make a writable DS card.  I believe it will happen, but it's not going to be easy.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's my $0.02.  SolidSnake, I hope you don't take too much offense at the "warm" welcome you've received here, but all the regulars here are against piracy, and some (many?) are getting sick of 2-post-people coming in looking for a way to pirate.  I'll just piss off now. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

OMG! this was the fucking thing i was wanting to see... o/
<br/>
<br/>
This is what i want to know! WHY DOES THIS pseudo random number cyper work? and WHY the homebrew works with GBA flash carts and comercial roms with GBA flash carts doesnt? the passme is used to bypass this at homebrew right? and why doesnt it work for comercial roms too?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#49192 - mymateo - Wed Jul 27, 2005 6:57 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm taking a guess based on what I remember reading before...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The DS card holds the encryption information, but the DS Card header is NOT encrypted.  When using a PassMe, the PassMe takes the header, modifies the code to point to the GBA slot (instead of DS slot), and then the DS takes over.
<br/>
<br/>
And as was said before, this works only with non-commercial (aka homebrew) roms because they don't have anything telling the DS to load from the DS slot, therefore any homebrew off a gba cart runs quite happily.  However, a commercial rom on a GBA cart being loaded using PassMe would, at some point (probably before enough gets loaded before the game actually starts) would look to the DS slot and not find the ROM, therefore crashing.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know exactly how the psuedo random cypher works, but I'm pretty sure that it is going to take a very long time to crack it, at least well enough so that any joe blow can copy a commercial rom.  And even then, it's most likely not going to work on a GBA cart, it will still have to be in the DS slot which, for now, is only possible on a commercial game.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps what will happen is some kind of PassMeAndComeBack (PMACB) card that will allow you to flash your ROM to the PMACB card, and all you need is a commercial DS card inserted to supply header information.  In more simple terms, the PMACB card tells the DS to load from the DS slot at an offset where the PMACB card will pick up on this and load its own rom.  I dunno...
<br/>
<br/>
And PLEASE correct me where I'm wrong (not if, I'm sure something I've said is inaccurate to some degree) so that we may all share in the truth.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, missed this one... here's the answer, though.  It's a slot you put your DS card into and plug into your PC.  But I think for now, all they (NeoFlash) want to do is use it as a save game backup/restore utility.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
No, not in the BIOS (which is stored in the DS) but on the actual card itself.  At least, that is my understanding.
<br/>
<br/>
And from here, this is just a guess, so don't take thisas fact.
<br/>
<br/>
But I think the DS reads the header, gets the information about the game, including where to find the encryption information.  This data is probably encrypted, but if it is then it probably uses a NON-random encryption.  The DS takes this information, and uses it to decrypt the rest of the data as it comes from the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
And that's all I have to say tonight, I'm going to bed, and I leave everything I've written to the mercy of people smarter than myself to correct just in case I'm leading some poor soul astray.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not exactly random, at best it would be pseudo-random, and that means if you can isolate all the variables and determine the algorithm, you can predict it.
<br/>
In this case, because we have access to the hardware (even if only some of us are skilled enough and have the equipment to take advantage of this), it is technically possible for all variables to be isolated.
<br/>
I'm not clear if anyone pinned down the specific algorithm being used or not.

The entropy sources are the real-time clock and the keys that went into it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">good, here we have two possibilities:

<br/>
1 - the rom is encrypted and ds uses a scheme of public and private keys do decript it (i guess its not this way, becouse emulators can play comercial roms right?)
<br/>
<br/>
2 - the header is encrypted and ds decrypt it, checks if its a valid Ds game (like with the E3 demos) and play it..
<br/>
<br/>
but how octopusfluff said, its a pseudo random cyper. But nintendo DS dont have many sources of salt to generate numbers, probably only time, battery status, etc... so its TEORICALLY possible to bypass it.
<br/>
<br/>
So these two things could be possible?
<br/>
1 - if the the encrypt information is at the rom, a patcher could solve this
<br/>
2 - if at the ds, a BIOS patch would solve this (if the N was stupid enough to make this patchable)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#49207 - Kate - Wed Jul 27, 2005 9:04 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From my understanding then:
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo use Public/Private key encryption on the header, this is verified using a hash of the header and if OK then the cart is booted, same is true for downloaded Apps. This is what FlashMe bypasses to execute code.
<br/>
<br/>
All you need is an image of the cart as is, there is no pseudorandom number generator/whatever, heaven knows where that came from. See the hash key generator here:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/" target="_blank">http://users.belgacom.net/bn967347/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Some clever people have already done a lot of work.
<br/>
<br/>
So now you have your cart image, you can burn it onto a flash cart but it still wont work.... why... couple of reasons:
<br/>
<br/>
1. The cart slot is 32MB memory mapped space, so if your DS cart is smaller than that then there is no issue on size.
<br/>
<br/>
2. The real problem is that the DS Game cards are sequentially accessed and have a pseudo file-system imposed on the top to allow loading etc. This is done via Nintendo libs that are supplied with your legitimate development system.
<br/>
<br/>
What you need to do is to re-write those libraries to map the loading functions onto the Memory mapped GBA cartridge, then your new libs have to be appended to you dodgy game image, and finally you have to go and patch the game image to use your hackified file management functions rather than the real ones.
<br/>
<br/>
Once thats all done then it should work just fine..... Not an easy job reverse engineering those libs, lots of time &amp; effort needed or someone to leak the APIs/libs/docs.

that?s the ideia. i live in a place where you must pay like 60-70 dollars for a cart, so i REALLY will want to play a game, before buy it..
<br/>
<br/>
I have a F2A cart, and I play both comercial and homebrew roms. Maybe this can be piracy, but its like Murdock said, its better play a game a for a while, and if you like it, buy it.. i do this way. If you want to download a rom, play it and dont buy it, its YOUR decision..
<br/>
Anyways, i really would like to see a DS Flash cart..
<br/>
<br/>
So i have more questions yet :P
<br/>
1 - Does emulators run commercial roms? i told that but i never tried this before o0
<br/>
2 - Teorically, for a DS game work in a GBA cart, all you have to do (not saying that is easy) is to map the flash cart loader to "send" the game to the DS memory instead of the GBA memory?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, to comment on 1...they can't run commercial games, but iDeaS at least I can see some images from the games before they crash, on like maybe 1 or 2 of the games I dumped that I tried.

It's been established that RSA is for wifi, that's what the 1024bit signature is for, and the firmware hack removes the code that checks for the signature on   WMB (wireless multiboot, aka download play) files, allowing us to boot our own homebrew over wmb.

One of the best (IMHO) features of FlashMe is that it lets you send homebrew via WMB, or the Nintendo DS's download play function (bypassing the need for a GBA flashcart).  It has the PassMe functions built right in also.

Well, you see, the reason you NEED the firmware update to send homebrew via Download Play is because the official demos are RSA signed...homebrew is not and can't be.  The firmware update changes it so the NDS no longer checks for that, and so will just download the program anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
So, without modding the firmware, your options are thus:
<br/>
<br/>
A GBA cart or a modified GBA Movie Player and...
<br/>
<br/>
Either PassMe, or a combatible WiFi Card and the WiFiMe software.  The reason you can send WiFiMe (this 'virtual PassMe' type software) via WMB and get it through Download Play and download with no problem is because it uses a hacked bit of code from some data captured from a Super Mario 64 DS wireless game, and therefore is signed, so you wouldn't need a modded DS to download it.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could say that, yeah...WiFiMe is an app telling the Nintendo DS to load whatever Nintendo DS program is on the GBA cart.
<br/>
<br/>
You send WiFiMe using the WMB program on your PC, your Nintendo DS can download it, and *bang* if you got NDS homebrew on your GBA cart you're in business.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As already said, you were not so well received here because you were asking questions that only relate to piracy. This is all the more true as your post count is quite low for a person asking questions about such subject. Show you are interested : read and search the forum, answer questions from others before asking and claiming that people are flaming you.
<br/>
<br/>
People on the thread were kind enough to make a sum up of things that were already said on the forum. Please make your job as well and show that you already tried to find information. Obviously you did not (I saw no links in your post showing you found some scattered information on the forum).
