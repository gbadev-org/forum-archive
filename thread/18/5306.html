Nope

Correct me if I'm wrong but arn't the n64 roms are around 16 MB while the DS passthrue uses the DS memory(4 MB).<br/>_________________<br/>Comming Soon: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.spyingwind.com" target="_blank">http://www.spyingwind.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Though we aren't really supposed to talk about emulation on this board, SNES emulation is a lot more plausible than N64 emulation. You don't try to emulate a 733 Mhz Celeron on a 3.0 Ghz P4. Sure there is an increase of processing power, but not nearly enough for emulation.
<br/>
<br/>
Always remember the 10x rule: To emulate a system, you need to have at least 10x the processing power. You can get away a little bit with that number if the architectures are the pretty much the same (GBA &amp; SNES) but don't expect anything phenominal. And there aren't even enough buttons anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also note that the DS has only 4 megs of RAM. While a standard N64 has the exact same amount of RAM, you're forgetting about the aditional RAM the emulator uses up.
<br/>
<br/>
A Playstation emulator on the other hand might work. If you used WiFi to stream the ISO, that is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the reason no touchpad is cause you play on both screens.<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, it may be possible to emulate N64 on the DS with a LOT of work, and maybe making the emulator on your PC change all the N64 opcodes into DS ones, and convert all the graphics, sounds and such. I will always have hope that emulating the N64 on the DS is possible. Note that I mean by possible, not 60fps and sound and like that, I mean a game that will run at a playable speed, and without sound.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

O.o k, now i?am more intelligent

EDIT:: Snes Roms have just a size around 1-3 MB! Is it able to emulate snes roms over w-lan? To stream the roms from the computer on the ds?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yes, but the 1-3 MB roms work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if my memory serves me correctly, the passme has to use a gba flash cartridge, and in gba programming you can run everything off of the flashrom since it is fast.  in our case doing so would be faster than running a ds cartridge.  I think the ds cartridge is a  block addressable memory.  so even in the snes games are like 3 megs, most flashroms are around 4 megs, and the ds has 4 megs of memory, which should mean you wouldnt need wlan for snes emulation, since the flash cartridge is a fast enough memory to run stuff off of.  But you may be only to have one game on it at a time, unless you had a huge one like the one gigabit ones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
