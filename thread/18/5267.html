<br/>
Two things.
<br/>
First, the 11 mbps WiFi connection is slow as it is. It fades compared to the speed of Ethernet.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, and this is the main reason, the DS does not have a slow-ass DVD drive it reads from - it reads from lightning-speed ROM. It depends on data to be available instantly. That's why you generally don't have loading times in cartridge-based systems. Trying to match the speed of ROM with a slow WiFi connection is impossible, and if attempted would result in your games playing exclusively in Bullet Time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The BBA in the GC tops out at 27 Mbps due to the speed of the bus it is on, but is used in 10 Mbps mode when streaming games, so 11 Mbps would be more than enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

According to the 802.11 beacon frames I've seen the supported speeds are 1 Mbit/sec and 2 Mbit/sec. 
<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't exclude support for faster speeds but you would think they would use faster speeds if they could considering how long it takes to load the download play code on to the guest DS.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But, like Sandymac mentioned, they would use faster speeds for download play if they could.  Sure, faster speeds may use more battery power, but it would get the download completed faster, which should ensure the same amount of battery power is consumed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
