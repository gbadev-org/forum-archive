    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Posting this before going to sleep, so I'm keeping it short: a few weeks ago I suggested <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=14187" target="_blank">OpenTTD for NDS on another forum</a>, it didn't catch too well though a few people were interested on it. So I push this to your knowledge, in case there happens to be someone who would like to give it a try.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the skills or the time for this kind of project myself, otherwise I'd be doing it. Or for the least trying to.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it is unlikely a transport game like this comes for NDS, so that's why I thought it would be worthwhile to bother people with this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I saw this topic I began to think about FreeCiv. I haven't played that game since I sold my Amiga 4000 back in 1998.
<br/>
<br/>
FreeCiv would be great on the DS with multiplayer support :D PalmOS and PocketPC versions are already available.

I'm going to download it today on my Windows machine just to try it out :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ouch, would be terrible in the resolutions we're talking. Great game, but for the DS? I don't think it would work...
