I remember Miked0801 (a liscenced DS developer) say that it would take at least a year and a half before we got things running like this on a DS. I guess you proved him wrong, huh?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's beautiful... great work my friend! If you do decide to release the source, sign me up! I don't know about everybody else on this forum, but I really prefer seeing "proper" games as opposed to tech demos. Well done!

<br/>
The touchscreen hotspot seems to be a bit off centre on Dualis. Is this a emulator thing, or a battleship thing?

<br/>
<br/>
If you hit your opponents ship, do you get to shoot again?  Cuase that's what it looks like the computer does.. Or something like that..
<br/>
<br/>
If it hits one of my ships, the next turn, it sinks the ship.  Even if it should have 2-3 more shots to sink it.  It's sunk the next turn.  :(
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what a quick search of the rules found:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is yet another battleship variation.  In this version, if you hit a ship,  you can fire again immediately,  until you miss.   So when the computer hits your aircraft carrier,  he then goes on and applies another shot.   When the ship is sunk, he gets one more turn.   In the absolute worst case, he could end up sinking all of your ships before you get your next turn,  and in absolute best case, you could end up sinking all of his ships, before he gets his first turn.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think it's been tested using a PassMe yet, just emulators (despite what it says on his website).<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also made a correction to the 2D and 3D examples so that they work on hardware. There seems to be an issue with swiWaitForVblank so i commented it out for now.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
