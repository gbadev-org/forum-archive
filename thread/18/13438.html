<br/>
On the GBA slot, it has an adapter with an USB port. I want to use this port for homebrew development, for sending and receiving data. The chip inside is
<br/>
a philips SP1581BD (which has open, detailed specs), so i figured i could make a serial-like driver to communicate with the PC. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, i have no idea how to access this chip from my code. The BIOS of the flasher uses it to receive files like an usb stick, and they also let you use it as a mouse to control the PC mouse (??). In the specification, proving/initializing the device seems to be easy, but i have no idea where the registers are located.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think is the best way to try to find where the device is mapped, and how can i reach the registers?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It doesn't use FAT, or at least it shouldn't, so it probably already works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

no it doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
you will need a udisk implementation for philips SP1581BD. then it is very simple to convert the block commands (block read/ blockwrite/block verify) into DLDI block commands.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
