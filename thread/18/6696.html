    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a few questions about the DS's wireless capabilities. 
<br/>
<br/>
-Why haven't we been able to tunnel it yet? We can send, and recieve information from the DS, could we not just send the captured packets to the other people's computers unaltered, and relay them, out the other person's modem. 
<br/>
<br/>
(Bleh, I'll have an illustration in a bit to explain that.)
<br/>
<br/>
-What does utilizing the DS's 802.11x capabilities entail? What are they looking for? A bit of ram? Is anyone working on this?
<br/>
<br/>
-Would the DS be capable of VNC, I noticed the PSP has a port, and now I am quite envious.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its a lot more complicated than that, the ds is very pickey about timing and if it takes too long the connection is lost, routing a packet over the internet takes time and hence its doesnt work.  No ones cracked wifi yet because these things take time and we have to understand the hardware before any software can be written.  Once the control registers are properly understood then it wont be too long before a tcp/ip stack is written and homebrew will be able to use it.  The ds could be capable of vnc but it would be totally pointless unless you find someway to make windows run at 256x190 res.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

run linux...you can run a vnc server at any resolution you want.
<br/>
I would suggest running at double (or maybe 150%) the DS's resoultion, and then scaling it down to fit the screen. most stuff will still be readable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont see why browsing the internet on the DS would be such a problem. I mean, I can check the net on my 3 year old B&amp;W cell phone as well as various Pocket PC systems that have less pixels total then both DS screens. Sure we might have to check the "mobile" versions of the sites, but whatever. As long as I can check Slashdot and Gizmodo and google works, I'm happy. A VNC client would be awesome. Though it may be some time before we see that come to light. 
<br/>
<br/>
   Also, dont know if you guys have seen this, but some dude put a web server on the GBA. Its a hardware hack, but still impressive:

You could get one screen to show like a "map" of the whole (for example) 1024x768 screen and when you swap the screens, you'll be able to move around that map by clicking wherever you want to go. The map doesn't even have to actually show anything but a rectangle which indicates where on the real screen you are.
<br/>
<br/>
I think scaling is a bad idea, especially when you can do something like that.<br/>_________________<br/>Packin':
