    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think an N64 emulator for DS would be awesome. I wouldn't really care what it's like as long as it would work. It could be like a port of 1964 or Project 64 on DS. Or just a completly different thing. Or could you at least convert certain N64 roms to run on the DS without an emulator?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
you are right, it would go to some extend, but wouldn't be anything worth playing.
<br/>
<br/>
and why do ppl thing they are the first person in the world to think of that, when the system is about three years old and the forum is even older!? i don't get it! i hope anybody getting that "fantastic" idea (without having a slight technical understanding of any of the systems) will first *search* the forum before posting. i'm getting bored of this. i know, i can ignore it, but... geez, whatever.

Actually, Daedalus on PSP is a port of the PC Daedalus. Also the version in that video is r8, when r11 is the most recent I believe...
<br/>
But yeah, more likely would be something that converted the roms and downsized the textures and broke the DS's RSA encryption and revealed all of Nintendo's source codes and made hell freeze over.

But it also had a huge word-addressed memory using a seek/read protocol much like that of GBA ROM. A DS running from SLOT-1 doesn't have this.

hmz..I wouldn't call the Gameboy Color a proper step up though, kinda a half step as most games were dual-format with the GB.

I think the DS is emulating the success of the original Gameboy, and we wont see any real improvement for quite some time.

A few revisions maybe, but a new system is two years away at least, possibly longer.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

By the time the next portable comes from Nintendo, solid state will be crazy cheap.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sort of a side topic... I always wonder why Nintendo doesn't transfer some of their most successful franchises over to portable systems? For instance mario party on GBA, I believe this was released at the time when Mario Party 6 was new? I never played it much but I heard it was a far cry from the console Mario Party games. And I don't think they did anything with GC to GBA connectivity either.
<br/>
So Nintendo tears down all these homebrew SSB projects, but we don't even have any corporate-based rumors that there is even an official english version of Jump! Superstars coming across the pacific.
<br/>
Also kinda like Paper Mario and Mario and Luigi. I'm wondering why Nintendo didn't keep the franchise name, and therefore made a whole different game, not to mention I'm sure lots more people would have paid attention if they saw the title of Paper Mario on GBA. (Not to mention Mario and Luigi wasn't even developed by nintendo...)
<br/>
I can only think of a few modern handheld&lt;&gt;console franchises... excluding classic remakes and such. Mario Tennis and Golf both had GBC versions, but the newer Strikers and Baseball don't even have any handheld spinoffs. Oh, just remembered about Animal Crossing (good think I did, or tepples would be correcting...) 
<br/>
I can see reasons for not porting some stuff. Look at the PSP, Sony was pushing the "Hand-held Console" idea, and now look where it sits. But a game like SSB, or even a classic n64 SSB port would sell phenomenally on the DS. Heck, just get Hal to do it, Nintendo's fully involved in Brawl, I guess you can use that excuse...
<br/>
So I guess I'm done ranting...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

<br/>
<br/>
back on topic (note: flaming ahead): those of you, who'd ever heard of the infamous RSP (n64's "reality signal processor" / aka the co-processor) and it's "microcode straight ot of hell" know this would require multiple nds'es to emulate in realtime. speaking of just that one chip.
<br/>
<br/>
so kiddies, please: cut the crap and better do your homework!
<br/>
if it's ever going to happen you'll be pissed off by the performace anyway. i can practically hear stuff like "that n64 nds emulator is &lt;woops, bad word&gt;! it is a like it runs with 0 frames per second or something! who would, like, even want that!?". oh, how that makes me sick already!
<br/>
<br/>
ps: there should be a sticky thread saying "NO IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN ENJOYABLE N64 EMULATOR FOR THE NDS (NO, NOT EVEN FOR THE GODDAMN NDS *LITE*)! ... AND IT'S DEFINITELY NOT POSSIBLE TO *CONVERT* (GOD! LIGHTNING - MAKE LIGHTNING STRIKE THEM DOWN!) ROMS! SO, PLEASE STOP BOTHERING AND ANNOYING FORUM MEMBERS WITH YOUR OH-SO GREAT IDEA (THAT ONLY *YOU* - OUT OF &gt;6 BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD - HAD)!"
<br/>
<br/>
ok, there's not enough topic space for that, but at least i'm back on the "calm side of life" again. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
pps: there really should be such an autobanner like on the facepunch studios' forum. the sole purpose of it would be to act as the lightning i wished so hard (s.a.). "n64" + "emulator" = &lt;ka-woom!&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ps: i might also add that i, too, don't expect another nintendo handheld sometime very soon. at least not long before the next home console cycle, as the nds goes along with the wii. just like the gba and the gc or the gb(c) and the snes/n64 (oh, oh! two generations of the same gameboy adapter? at least the n64 wide boy wasn't official. but there was a way to link n64 and gb pok?mon games via a controller pak or something). but that's offtopic.

<br/>
The only way I can think of doing full speed N64 on the DS is (here we go...) for you to emulate it on the PC and then pipe the results to the DS ;-D
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, it's a no-no.
<br/>
I don't think it's not emulatable though - but just not at real-time rates. And I'm still thinking about whopping out an emulator port just to make the point, once and for all.

well, what i mean by "not possible" is that you would have to recode so much of a game, that you'd eventually end up just using the art assets and virtually none of the unmodified code. do that for one or two games and you're done with it, to never touch that subject again. it's a lot of work (i guess porting over quake can be consideres first grade compared to such a task) because the hardware designs are so differnt.

&lt;lol&gt; actually nds games have higher resolution textures than the n64! the n64 has only a 4kbyte texture buffer. that's like 2 64x64x4bit textures. the nds is overall more powerful than the n64, imo.
<br/>
<br/>
the point of my statement was that those ppl who're *demanding* n64 emulation would not use such an emulator if it wasn't playable. so besides a proof of concept (i really encourage that! in a technical and intellectual way, though.) i don't see much sense of such a project. besides just posting a link to a "working" emulator whenever someone asks the ever same question. thinking of the bitter disappointment such a person would have makes me smile. ;^D

oh, sure, the DS is a lot more powerfull, imo. (Mario64 on the DS is clearly suppiour graphicaly, as is Metroid Hunters compared to say, Golden Eye).

and what did nintendo do with mario 64? i mean it's *their* game, they for sure *do* have all sources... so what?

<br/>
you can still disassemble and use a 5-year-old autistic boy to read the code and convert it to a higher language... pointless. but you *can* replace certain portions of executable code (that's how cracking works) that you have reverse engeneered and make it run that way. although you'd have a sh?tload of work to do.
<br/>
<br/>
and really, reducing those n64 textures is next to removing them. you better cut out all the next to nonexistent audio, that'll save much more memory. at least all allocation/loading (and freeing) and playback instructions.

Why you ask? There are more games I enjoy playing for longer periods of time on the NES, the DS doesn't have enough buttons to do some games justice, and I'm pretty sure if an N64 emulator showed up Nintendo would crack down harder than they ever have before.

So on the part of nesDS multiplayer... Has anyone done the PocketNES multiplayer with a link cable? Is there any latency? Does it correct the latency (do the games get out of sync with each other)?

Not to mention a very advanced sound chip for it's time. On the GP2X Amiga emulator, the speed increases incredibly if you turn off the sound emulation. It's not just 320x200, the workbench and some others use a resolution of 640x480. No way a good amiga emulator can be made for DS, as it doesn't run fullspeed even on a GP2X!
