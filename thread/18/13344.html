    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just dug into developing for the NDS and it's great fun, but the memorystick switching with using M3 and a microSD is a bit waste of time. I tried searching for ways people have been using Wifi to update their executable and found DSFTP (2.4) where you could incorporate an ftp server into your app. That sounds like a great way to speed things up. The problem was that it didn't seem compatable with the newest libnds. Am I wrong with this, or is there a better way to do the same thing?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Couldn't you do the opposite, like having a stub launcher which downloads and executes a binary from a FTP/HTTP server? 
<br/>
<br/>
If your binary is small (and you keep your art assets in a SD card, instead of loading them from the LAN) it could be much faster, but could become slower than card-switching if you're loading large files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just have a look at this, that might answer your question:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But, as I have just learned, DSFTP is using buggy gba_nds_fat... 
<br/>
So be careful and make copies all the time before you use it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for all the good suggestions. HTTPexec sounds like a good way to go for me, and I've been spending some time trying to get it implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
Since I'm new to this I ran into some obvious problems, like finding out what dldi is and why I need it to get libfat working. With that fixed I've tried to get the Wifi lib up and running. The arm7/arm9 usage was interesting, and it took me a while to understand how to make them link together. Now my app gets as far as the HTTPexec test-application, which is that it never gets past ASSOCSTATUS_SEARCHING.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried looking at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/index.html</a> and tested the wifi examples listed there. Surprisingly, the .nds included in dswifi_lib_v0.3a_full.zip has the same problem while the .nds that you get from "Latest DS Wifi Lib Test" works like charm. Is the "Latest DS Wifi Lib Test" built from a never version of the lib or something, and in that case, where can I get hold of that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To answer my own question. Yes, there is a newer version of the wifilib at devkitpro's sourceforge, but sadly it didn't solve my problem.

You can do this with the ARM9 monitor I developed a while back (see <a class="postlink" href="http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/debug_stub.php" target="_blank">here</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10765" target="_blank">here</a>). There were a number of restriction placed upon the ARM9 code you downloaded and I have not worked on the code and set up for quite some time so cannot remember what state it is in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm. But I've tried 0.3.1 as well which I assumed was the lastest one. Your post mentions 0.3d. Any chance that 0.3d would work better?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

0.3d is the only one that will work (with my DS Lite)!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried 0.3d but it still never got past 'searching'. So, I tried some already compiled apps that was using 0.3d as well from the list/post wandafritsch pointed me at and they had the same problem. Still, the "Latest DS Wifi Lib Test" works, which gives me hope, but since I can't find that example and compile it myself (just one based on 0.3a, which doesn't compile anymore) I feel handicapped.

Oh well. Who needs Wifi anyway!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can give <a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/wifi_lib_test.zip" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/wifi_lib_test.zip</a> a blast. You'll probably need to copy &amp; paste that link into your browser rather than clicking on it directly.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't linked to it from devkitpro.org yet because I want to split it down into smaller sections and provide a default arm7 binary for wifi with dswifi at some point soon. Far too much to do at present unfortunately but hopefully soon.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

The link seems to give a 404 error - both using wget or copy'n'pasting to Firefox. Are there any significant changes in the wifi_lib_test application compared to version that was spread along dswifi 0.3a release?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Depends what you call "significant" really. The changes are minor but it builds and works where the one with 0.3a does neither.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSFTP 2.4.1 is out and compiled with last Lib but i recommend you  to have a close look at <a href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/lilou/" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/lilou/</a>
<br/>
Cftp 0.5 is NDS FTP client and  FTP server ( sources not yet avalaible but dev says it will release them ).  Version 5 is update with wifi lib 1.3.1 and is really impressive and shall perhaps help you. It is reported to work better than DSFTP by some users. Others complains the graphical interface of DSftp is better but who cares...
<br/>
<br/>
I tested it with CycloDS and it works just fine with some quick settings for repetitive tasks.  This new version allows you to transfer files between 2 DS, your computer and a FTP server on Internet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
