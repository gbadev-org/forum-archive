    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I know about the two methods, WifiMe and PassMe, and I think I understand their basic function (WifiMe needs software and a compatible wireless router, while PassMe uses homemade hardware and a GBA flashcart, right?) 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have a big question. 
<br/>
<br/>
When Nintendo launches their Wifi service, they're supposed to start selling those USB Wifi things to reach the DS, right? 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, won't that pretty much remove any need for a WifiMe or PassMe? Will we be able to start using those devices to load homebrew on the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as we know the USB device is merely a standard wifi adapter. They will allow the DS to connect to online services through a standard tcp/ip stack  provided with the games/applications that require it. Any wifi adapter will suffice for this purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
Loading homebrew on a DS requires a special driver which will only work with some wifi cards.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yet. Someone has to write the raw driver, and WMB will work for both wifime and official demos.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As far as I know wmb will never work with usb adapters. Last I heard the latency problems were insurmountable. This may change but I doubt it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the DS is playing an online game, it is going to be using standard TCP/IP.
<br/>
<br/>
There won't need to be special drivers for the USB device, nor would it have to be a Ralink chipset.
<br/>
<br/>
The USB adapter will be working like any normal WiFi device, and so will the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The only reason you need a Ralink chipset and special drivers for WiFiMe is because WiFiMe needs direct access to the hardware to mimic the DS's proprietary protocol on a standard PC WiFi device.
<br/>
<br/>
Since the DS won't be communicating with the Nintendo USB adaptor in anything but standard WiFi, direct access to the adapter won't be needed, and it will be like any other USB adapter under the sun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
