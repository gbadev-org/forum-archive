    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Let me start off by saying the wmb.exe v1.0 WORKS but none of the other versions do.  The problem is that v1.0 doesn't let me specify the name of a file to upload... (or does it?)
<br/>
<br/>
The other versions (more specifically, v1.4 beta 1) says "Sending multiboot beacons &amp; waiting for authentication" but the DS won't see it what-so-ever.  
<br/>
<br/>
I know it's not a problem with my network card (WMP54G v4) because wmb v1.0 works.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody else had this problem?  Does anything else know how to fix it?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the echo test program also does not work... (the program runs sucessfully but the DS does not see it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've only ever used v1.4, but every once in a while my DS has a hard time finding it. Usually only takes about 5 seconds or so, but sometimes it will just sit there for 5 or 10 minutes first. Probably not the most helpful response, but maybe yours was just having a bad day :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that happens to me too. I get download errors pretty much every time if another DS in the house is using NWFC, but they connect to the wireless router while I use a wifi card in my PC for WMB (and nothing else).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try changing the channel...
<br/>
It defaults to 7, and maybe your channel 7 is overloaded with something..
<br/>
<br/>
sometimes, that helps (at least for me)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
