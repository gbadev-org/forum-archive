    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oamtable is a copy of the oam registers.  oam state is used by the api to track cumulative aspects of oam attributes (such as rotation and scale).  
<br/>
<br/>
To use the api you dont need to use either of these, the oam* functions should provide access to all oam behavior (or that is its goal). 
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a more specific question on usage that might be easier to address.  As in "how do i do blah with the new api?".<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll probably have more questions as I progress, but for now that would be enough. Thanks for the reply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
