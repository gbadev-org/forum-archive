    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using a SuperCard SD rumble, and I have difficulty getting most homebrew to run at all. I can get moonshell and DSOrganize both running. Moonshell has the option to boot other code, and fails every time I try. DSOrganize had the ability to boot other code, and works wonderfully.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if it was possible to load the DSOrganize loader on a regular .nds file, as it is a bit of a pain to have to wait for DSOrganize to load up every time I want to change one line of code. (an on-DS compiler would be nice too now that you mention it, but that's a whole 'nuther ball game and not something I really wish to discuss here.) 
<br/>
<br/>
I've heard of "DLDI"? but I'm not quite sure how to use it, or if it is compatible with PAlib, which I am using currently. If I could get it to just run the code happily without a loader that would be great too. Any suggestions?

Did you select the right option when installing?
<br/>
<br/>
If not have you tried patching it with the DLDI for your card?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I'm not having any particular problems with the shells, I just want to be able to boot my <span style="font-style: italic">own</span> software directly from the SuperCard's Boot menu, and I can't for some reason. (dual pretty white screens. Well not that pretty...)

There's a bug in SuperCard Rumble firmware that prevents programs made with devkitARM R20 from booting, or there's a bug in devkitARM R20 that prevents SuperCard Rumble firmware from booting programs made with it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Now I have to go off and buy a better card I guess. Drat again. Oh well, I can make do with this way for a while.
