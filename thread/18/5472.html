    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hope I'm not asking a really stupid or common question (did look around the forum but couldn't find the answer I was after). I've just started playing with DS development using NDS Dev Env and Dualis. Don't yet have a PassMe to try the stuff out on the real unit.
<br/>
<br/>
What I can't work out is what I can do with the ARM7. I know it controls the touchscreen etc. and the sample code I've got all has C++ files for both the ARM9 and ARM7 cpus. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thing is: if I change code in the ARM7 files and make the project, it doesn't seem to have any effect in Dualis. I'm guessing at this point that because you use the ARM9 bin in the emulators that they (Dualis) use standard code for the ARM7? So you can't code for that CPU if you're using an emulator?
<br/>
<br/>
I hope I'm wrong. But if so, what should I be doing so that I can code for both cpus and run them? If I'm completely off base here then could it be a problem in the makefiles?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I find that iDeaS works OK for running both processors. You rename your .nds file to .pme and it should run all your code. I'm yet to have any luck with Dualis at all!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dualis emulates only the ARM9 processor. Additionaly, it puts information into the IPC structure -- just like the ARM7 code from the template.
