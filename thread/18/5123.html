    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I was shoping for games on the net and as a result
<br/>
of the majority of japanese games I got an idea that just might be possible.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to do some code which will be stored on a gba flash cart or similar.
<br/>
Now when you put a japanese game in the ds slot, a translation file will replace the japanese text with english. Kind of like ISP patching the game.
<br/>
The ultimate would be to make some sort of dynamic translator on the rom, but the most reliable and best way (even though it will take manual work) is probably the easiest thing to make.
<br/>
<br/>
Would this even be possible? kind of having the rom on the GBA cart work as an OS and launching the ds game through it, filtering the text so the output is english.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this would also be great</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by oxymen on Mon Mar 07, 2005 2:22 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">for Japanese games on my PC I tend to use "texthooker". This is a program that "hooks" text in the program, connects to babelfish, translates the text in real-time, and then re-inserts the text into the program. It's VERY glitchy, but it gets the job done. I suppose that using translation files instead of a real-time translation service shouldnt be a problem. With texthooker it has been proven you can make a generic program for several games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not sure if this apply to the DS roms, but normaly the text is stored in special registers or similar.  So by knowing where the text is stored it should be (at least theoreticaly) possible to write a code similar to texthooker which reads the text directly before or as the game runs and change it.
<br/>
One approach could be to make a similar register or what ds uses on the flash cart and override the ds to read the these registers from the flash cart but the rest of the game from the official game. This should result in a game with translated text.
<br/>
<br/>
The optimal way to do this IMO would be to make the translator-rom contain a dynamic translator part like texthooker/babelfish. But a posibility to add translator files per game. This would open for:
<br/>
- Fair gaming of games without translator files
<br/>
- Perfect gaming for games with translator files and
<br/>
- Good gaming for games with partial translator files as the rom could translate the parts which is not in the file, dynamicaly.
<br/>
<br/>
I am personaly not experienced enough to write such a code, but I would think it should be very possible to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">most consoles do not have built in fonts or an equivalent to pc ascii
<br/>
instead we load tiles and then make our own print type code to display
<br/>
text in an organized manner somewhere on the screen. IPS patching
<br/>
could be done and could probably be done real time as long as the game
<br/>
didn't already stress the system by itself. An example would be a nes
<br/>
emulator on the DS could probably handle this. The disadvantages 
<br/>
 /differences in this method would be that the translation itself would have
<br/>
 to be done before hand/we couldn't use an online or built in translator in
<br/>
 this method unless someone dumped the script and then a built in 
<br/>
 translator translated it on the spot. The issue here is this would take more
<br/>
 processing power and the translation would end up the same each time
<br/>
 (unless you want to be silly and have it randomly choose the translation)
<br/>
 so it'd just be better to have the ips file already include the translated 
<br/>
script. Essentially this is not real time translation since by the time you get
<br/>
it here you have all thats necessary to actually translate the game without
<br/>
any need to do it "real time" or "in-game".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
