<br/>
<br/>
many homebrew games/apps doesnt include the code that will turn off the backlight while closing the DS lid..
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible (just like the pepsiman loader) to make a batch file thing that will add the code by yourself?
<br/>
<br/>
well.. anyone? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">write a patch that includes this code as a easy-to-use function to libnds, and submit it to the libnds maintainers. this will probably get more people to use it, if it's just a matter of calling 1 or 2 functions to init it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not every app needs it either. For example, I didn't put it in GBA Booter because I can't really see it being likely that someone needs to close the lid for a long time while using it. Generally you'd only be using it for a few seconds at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
However I do agree that a lot of apps should have this but don't.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thought i'd mention...there's a function in PAlib that does this quite easily.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: it's PA_CheckLid(); ....it returns 1 if the lid was closed, and if the lid is closed, it pauses untill the lid is opened...though..i'm not totaly sure if it turns off the backlight or not..maybeit doesn't..i have never used it ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
