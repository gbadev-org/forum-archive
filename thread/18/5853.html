it feature modal buttons, for a "binary" choice, for instance PEN/ERASER selection, 
<br/>
<br/>
and click-and-drag multiple-state buttons  which zoom out a menu of buttons to choose state from.
<br/>
<br/>
here is a gif-animation where i try to demonstrate the UI:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">looks good, altho, i would suggest aligning your buttons to a 16x16 grid, so they will be easier to represent using tiles instead of having to use lots of custom paint code.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's probably one the best looking custom keyboard I've seen so far. Although I understand all the benfits of using a 8x8 tiles, I think that it ends up looking a little too cramped. I'm still a fan of the Pictochat style approach like this example by ohmushells.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would easier to allow for a an image made up of tiles but not necessarily one tile per key, and then use a map to set up key location/trigger areas. More complex, but a cooler keyboard IMO.
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone working on a nice keyboard system at the moment?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Oops Darkain, misread what you mean't - and yes I agree - align your graphics to 16x16 tiles to make life easier! Just needs a slight adjustment in Photoshop. Actually this keyboard might look nice 1 key = 1 tile :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Detecting which letter the stylus is on is as simple as comparing the position to a grid, since it's aligned to a bondary. No need for custom code.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could have a normal key and highlighted key, taking however many tiles as you like, and place the letters on a different background. That way your re-using the key tiles and can re-use the keys for different character sets etc.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice.  Although you could add like a scroll on the keyboard to scroll through different character sets instead. *
<br/>
<br/>
On the right hand side, instead of doing a corner then a slide down, why not continue it off-screen?  In my mind, it looks much nicer.
<br/>
<br/>
And about the tile thing, why not make every button 12x12, leaving about 8x8 left for the button face.  So every 3 tiles are 2 buttons.  Simple and efficient.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it OK if I were to edit it a little and post my modifications?  Or would you get mad.. hehe. :-)

&lt;-- since every key should have  a highlighted version, the best would be to have one key per tile.
<br/>
<br/>
anyway., thanks for the kind words everyone,,, what i had envisioned was just drawing the whole thing out as a bitmap and not worry about tiles,  since  it is not so performance intesive to draw a keyboard anyway, then have a lookup matrix of coordinates. but on the other hand, wasting video ram is evil :)
<br/>
<br/>
it would be a very minor and quick adjustment  to make the keyboard compatible with 16x16 tiles, let me now if anyone wants such a keyboard drawn or needs help pixling other stuff</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

because i would like to make the "highlight" more sophisticated than an alpha or tint... i want it to have apperance of a down-pressed key when i press a key :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I have another idea: make each button 16x16, then hardware-scale it to 12x12 (making sure that the tiles scale properly).  The buttons look neat, and it is easy to change the contents (push button, etc.).
<br/>
<br/>
A button idea: make copy and paste (like a square box or something), and put it on a stamp.  Or you could make it more like Mario Paint...
<br/>
<br/>
It's all up to you.

Edit: More spacious:
