    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen these things called range expanders for wifi wireless networks, basicly it's a repeater hub for a wireless connection that isn't in range. But I was wondering if it would be possible to modify one of these with some sort of antenna or sattlite dish to get maybe a mile radius in range.
<br/>
<br/>
This way we could find DS's within a mile of our homes and would be a great multiplayer thing for those of us in big citys</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A repeater might work. My preferred method would be to crack open the DS and solder in a BNC connector like that found on high-end routers, then attach a high-gain (&gt; +16dBi) antenna.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
1. If you could use one of those WiFi Repeater's which takes the signal from the air and sends it out boosted.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Well, there isn't an external Antenna hook up.  There is one on the inside which has one of those microbnc connectors.  You might be able to extend it that way.<br/>_________________<br/>│?ig │

I wonder if the DS had a large enough range it could act as a server and route other DS through it to another one outside the range of the first?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Huh, if it has Micro-BNC then adding a fullsize BNC connection wouldn't be too hard, and would require a quick drillout of the plastic and a pigtail.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Psh. After Christmas they'll be more plentiful than SPs after people return them thanks to the drought of games. Buy a couple, get drillin'.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Regardless though, it should be simple to add an external antenna jack to the DS. The antenna lead is easily accessible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes you can drive a signal as far as needed with the right equipment, well actually you are limited by the curvature of the earth, since wifi is basically line of sight. keep in mind depending on how far it is, you might need to build a tower with a huge dish sitting atop it. also the person on the other end would need the same setup to send the signal back to you. so ya have fun with that...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
off the FCC site is this PDF with some internal picts of some DS components: <a class="postlink" href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=457113&amp;native_or_pdf=pdf" target="_blank">https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=457113&amp;native_or_pdf=pdf</a>
<br/>
<br/>
scroll down and you will see some picts of the DS's antenna. either the antenna is the black wire, which i think is not the case, or the antenna is the half rectangular metal strip inside the circuit board. i have heard and seen antenna like this being used in small RF devices, usally the strip of metal runs around the perimeter of the device, and this design usally works good in small spaces. BUT this antenna in the DS looks unusually small, so to extend the range very simply and cheaply i would solder a piece of wire onto the current antenna and run the wire around the perimeter of the DS (big antenna in small space), like nintendo should have done. you can also do some greater antenna mods using different and more effective antenna designs, some of which have already been talked about here. then you can get into the repeates and signal boosters (even the cheap cell phone ones). but those have already been mentioned. extending the RF range is the first thing i'm doing when i get my DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wonder... What happens when 700 NDS are within range? Pictochat slurs? *5 minutes alter* What do you mean, timeout?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
