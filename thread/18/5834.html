Do you think it could be possible to develop something "? la Warpipe" for DS &amp; with Ralink WIFI cards so we could play online with wifi games ?

First off, 'assholes' is all one word...
<br/>
<br/>
And secondly, and I don't mean this as a dig, but what Nintendo means is that they are releasing new games that will allow for play over the internet. We've known this far before E3. Animal Crossing DS it slated to be one of the first internet-capable games. What the OP seemed to ask was about enabling <span style="font-style: italic">current</span> games for internet play, via some kind of tunneling system. 
<br/>
<br/>
The topic of tunneling has been asked time and time again (see Vixus's post and thread). There are some who are working on it, some who were working on it, and some who think it cannot be done due to latency issues, but the point I am making is that this topic is all over the forum.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">As for Nintendo and future tunneling plans, I for one am hoping the Revolution will allow users to tunnel existing DS games, but I also understand that it may not be possible in any form, again due to latency. </span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection extends Nintendo DS' range from your hands to the world: By the end of the year, owners of the dual-screened Nintendo DS will be playing Mario Kart DS, Animal Crossing DS and a new Tony Hawk title from Activision wirelessly with their friends worldwide. The new Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection portable, wireless video game service debuts later this year and lets players join in for no added Nintendo subscription charges. IGN Entertainment will manage the architecture and navigation of the service. DS players will connect at any Wi-Fi hub, whether in their home, at a coffee shop or elsewhere. The service will let friends join together as easily as if they were playing in the same room and instantly broadens the gaming experience to players worldwide. 
<br/>
<br/>
With more than 60 licensee titles due this year, Nintendo also seeks to expand the idea of what constitutes a video game. New software titles like Nintendogs and Electroplankton for Nintendo DS provide unique experiences beyond traditional definitions. Nintendogs lets users choose an extremely realistic puppy and form emotional bonds with it, while Electroplankton lets users create their own ethereal or pulsing rhythms using the touch screen.<br/>_________________<br/>Stop using those fancy terms!!

<br/>
The PSP runs pretty well over XLink, so I see no reason that a properly designed WiFi chipset and encapsulation program on the Revolution couldn't tunnel the DS at least as well as standard PC hardware/software does for the PSP.
<br/>
<br/>
If Nintendo would actually do that however, is another story entirely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
