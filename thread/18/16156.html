    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi~
<br/>
<br/>
1st a question: DSOrganize and Moonshell are using libmad, or ?
<br/>
Because I would like to play MP3s with a higher quality, but since I failed with helix and nowhere found a proof that its possible with helix, I wanted to try libmad.
<br/>
<br/>
But im doing something wrong, since the code Im using libmad now already fails at low quality the Helix decoder already could play fine.
<br/>
<br/>
It is realy laggy and there is a flickering all the time...
<br/>
<br/>
Here the code: <a class="postlink" href="http://www10.zippyshare.com/v/79718580/file.html" target="_blank">NDS-LibMad.7z</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone has some time to help me get this working I would be realy thankfull~</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DSOrganize&amp;Moonshell which uses libmad never had problems playing a mp3

Tell me one homebrew that plays any MP3 which uses helix~

But since DSOrganize uses an old Devkit and as I heard also an modified, it would be too much work to cut out only the sound part out of DSOrganize.

I have the feeling its the loop Im calling the decodes x_x

You're right. I had forgotten about things like slotMusic, eMusic, and Amazon MP3, which are available in <span style="font-style: italic">some</span> countries. But usually, these downloads are high enough bitrate that transcoding them to 96 kbps ogg won't introduce more artifacts than the DS's 10-bit PWM DAC and underpowered op-amp already introduce.
<br/>

This was the legit case that I was thinking about. Ripping makes wav, and OggDropXPd makes ogg.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
