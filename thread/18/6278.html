    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In case anyone wants it here, I did a quick framebuffer thingin in the sloppiest way I could that cycles RGB and B/W manually. Based on the "pixelfixer" video for PSP, I have no idea how close to it this really is as I have no PSP.
<br/>
<br/>
It starts up in manual mode, up/down to change colors A to swap screens. Start will change it to cycle mode, where right and left changes the delay that the screens colors are put up for by 33 millisecond increments (0-231, 33 being default). Start will put it into manual mode again.

<br/>
can you keep the DS screens on when the DS is closed? all the 'sleep' mode stuff is done in software when the game detects the lid closing (as far as i know..)
<br/>
<br/>
perhaps make it so it doesn't flash the screen until you close the DS.. and then it keeps flashing until you reopen it.
<br/>
this way you'd never see it doing it - thus avoiding any epilepsy based problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was suggested before, but it doesn't help people with an original GBA (no lid), a Game Boy Micro (no lid), a PSP (no lid), a desktop PC running an emulator (no lid), a GBA SP (no I/O register reflecting lid state), or a laptop PC (no I/O register reflecting lid state, and the operating system may turn off the screen without the app's knowledge or consent). I'm aiming for generality here.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
yeah.
<br/>
i was kinda just referring to the DS. :P
<br/>
i'm sure the DS version does other things the other ones don't too! - for example two screens?
<br/>
you wouldn't've said "oh, we can't have the DS version use both screens because the PSP etc.. only has one screen!" - so why restrict yourself unncessarily?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Needless to say, this is why I put it into "non cycling" when it starts up, so those with such disorders could still test their screens using the 5 colors....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a while back i made a pc version to try to fix a dead pixel on my flatscreen... i didnt have any luck but i only tried it for about 10 minutes :p
<br/>
<br/>
i didnt know about black and white tho does it cycle "RGBBWRGBBW" or do you have the option of "RGBRGB" or "BWBW"?
<br/>
<br/>
i can add B&amp;W support and post it and the window is resizable so you can leave it on one pixel (better for CPU and refresh rate anyways, you cant fix a pixel is youre monitor cant keep up with the flashing)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: i looked at the source code and it seems like RGBBW but i could add support for all methods, anyone interested?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
