Edit: Okay, I wasn't too clear here. Please reformulate this as a question, preferably giving some more context about what you wish to accomplish, and how you plan to do this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I read the question, there is an audio waveform stored as a raw PCM sample stream in a file that has been opened in libfat. Poster wants to know how to play this waveform on the DS sound hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The way to do this needs the ARM9 and ARM7 CPUs to work together. The ARM9 loads a chunk at a time (such as 4096 bytes at a time) into a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer" target="_blank">ring buffer</a>, and the ARM7 sets the audio playback hardware to loop over the ring buffer. Examples of how to do this are in the source code of any DS based media player, such as DSOrganize and MoonShell.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
