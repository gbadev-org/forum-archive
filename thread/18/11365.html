    <h4>#105134 - Defect - Fri Oct 06, 2006 9:52 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently upgraded to a DS Lite and love it, I'm now trying to test some homebrew software, but my usual methods no longer work due to the new firmware rejecting the old methods.
<br/>
<br/>
Early versions of WMB seem to be much more stable on my system and can be executed without the -data command line, which will automatically upload the multiboot to the DS. This is how i ran all homebrew software.
<br/>
<br/>
I would only use the "-data file.nds" command line when trying the kiosk demos.
<br/>
<br/>
The newer version of WMB that supports the DS Lite does not work this way on my system. Running WMB causes it to instantly close, rather then uploading the multiboot automaticlly.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a specific command line to upload the multiboot?
<br/>
I've had trouble tracking down any information on this.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm soon to receive a superkey and miniSD supercard, but untill then i must get wmb working again!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"wmb -data demo.nds" is the command for the current version.  It was only a really old version that didn't require the -data command.  I agree that it would be a better design to work without the -data command.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless your DS is flashed, you will only be able to play signed .nds files (just the official nintendo demos).  You can still associate "wmb -data" to .nds files, it's just slightly more work than if it didn't need the data command.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My DS is not flashed and will not be in the future, i dont intend to crack it open, i'd rather avoid it personally.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm assuming your using the "-data demo.nds" command as an example, as there is no demo.nds included with any wmb release.
<br/>
<br/>
So basically if my DS is not flashed, its no longer possible to run hombrew using wmb on the DS lite?
<br/>
<br/>
I currently use this version of wmb: <a href="http://dsdev.bigredpimp.com/archives/49" target="_blank">http://dsdev.bigredpimp.com/archives/49</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Technically no. It was never possible on any DS and it still isn't possible on the DS
<br/>
(the only thing you could do on early versions of the ds firmware was to boot in a passme like manner (wifime))</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

correct. The fact that he used wifime before, means that he has a gba flash cart. why he hasn't already used flashme, I dunno, it would greatly speed up his testing times 
<br/>
1. flash gba cart
<br/>
2. insert GBA cart 
<br/>
3. turn on
<br/>
instead of
<br/>
1. flash gba cart
<br/>
2. insert GBA cart
<br/>
3. turn on, select download play
<br/>
4. start download on PC
<br/>
4. wait for download to finish</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm well aware of the process involved in flashing the DS, and seeing as the battery cover must be unscrewed to take off, i think the term 'cracked open' is fitting.
<br/>
<br/>
People can brick the ds performing this, its happened enough times to be of some concern to me, i'm quite good with electrnics, but i can see this happening to me, its just my luck.
<br/>
<br/>
Ill have a look at it today though just to see whats invlved and see whether there is a risk involved or if the unlucky ones who have bricked their DS's were just not being careful.
<br/>
<br/>
FRZ:  you need to read what i wrote, its pretty obvious i was using some form of gba cart to store the homebrew data on, then using WMB (wifime) to upload the multiboot to run the code on the gba cart. Dont know what your on about.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you can use WMB then you don't really need the cart except for data files, which you probably won't be changing that much.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, how do i flash my DS Lite if wifime cant upload the multiboot, so then the DS will run the flashme.nds off the gba cart?
<br/>
<br/>
I dont have a passme or anything so its not possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Is wifime going to be a possibility for the DS lite in the future?
<br/>
<br/>
What is slowing down the progress?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You will need a nopass device to run flashme but if you buy one of those then you won't need to run flashme.
<br/>
<br/>
WifiMe will never work since the DS just doesn't allow the download play header to be modified anymore.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
