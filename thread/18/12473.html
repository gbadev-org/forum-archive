    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have done quite a lot of coding... collision detection, sliding plane collisions etc but they are all too slow. Maths is easy. I want to do BSP but am having  a lot of problems. Has anyone clever got a spare hour to knock up a simple ds program that converts a list of quad polys to a bsp tree. Then a ds program to display that tree.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is really appreciated because I have lot of documentation from the net but I can't convert it to nds... or at least make it display sensible results...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">An hour?  Hah... hahah.  No, BSP collision takes a while to get right.  But it is very fast, and worth the effort.
<br/>
<br/>
Check out the Quake 1 tools for an example.  He builds a few precalculated trees with the planes shifted for specific sizes of objects.  That way all the collision tests can use rays at runtime instead of boxes.
<br/>
<br/>
I do the plane shifting at runtime for arbitrary object sizes.  It's not that much more expensive, and it saves memory by having only one BSP tree.
<br/>
<br/>
Two books that helped me were: "Collision Detection in Interactive 3D Environments" by Gino Van Den Bergen and "Real-Time Collision Detection" by Christer Ericson.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot more issues that only become apparent upon trying to use BSP collision in a real game.  Let me know if you have any questions!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
