<br/>
<br/>
How fast is doing an HTTP request to the internet via wifi?
<br/>
With an homebrew program, I'm getting a page that is something like 37kb big in minutes (speed is something like 0,7kb per second), while a wifi local connection is 100 times faster.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using happyhttp.
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure I understood your measures very clearly, and you must be aware that long-range HTTP (or any TCP connection) throughput is affected by number of parameters including maximum end-to-end delay and amount of buffers available on the end systems.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the DS to have less such buffers thn other devices, meaning that it cannot compensate for a long end-to-end delay very well.
<br/>
Make sure you pump as much data as you can in each recv() call, too. Asking for only 256 bytes, for instance, lead to poor results in my experience, compared to e.g. 4KB chunks transferred from WiFi to FAT device.
<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I typically download stuff from a more or less local relay (e.g. same ISP, but not same network) through my DSL line (4Mbits download) and observe typically 20-30 sec. to transfer a 256-320KB file.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
