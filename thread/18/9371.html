    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are some requests for my project to be more accessible internationally.  So, I have some questions on how to make an app that can be localized:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Looks like there are some fonts inside of the firmware, is there anyway to access those directly?  I can get system language enum, but are there any other information that I can get from the system?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Looking at MoonShell's source code, looks like it has a settable codepage, and it does conversion between local code page to unicode when necessary.  Does the DS have a standard code page, or is it just a Nintendo specific thing?
<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if anyone can point me to any info/doc/links/tutorial/resources.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
