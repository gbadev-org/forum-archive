    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, this was quick and dirty port of AineBot 0.8.12, so maybe not everything works fine... it's just a showcase, don't expect much, she acts stupid sometimes (especially at the beginning), so please be patient with her... and please don't annoy her much, or she may stop talking to you.
<br/>
I am not responsible if she destroys your DS, memory card, flashcart, eat your children, burn your house... Try at your own responsability...
<br/>
Extract the archive somewhere
<br/>
Patch for your flashcart using dlditool
<br/>
Copy all files to card (make sure that "data" and "log" directories are in root directory on card)
<br/>
Run.
<br/>
<br/>
Before turning off your DS, type exit or quit (it will freeze then), that way all files will be closed, and no corruption can occur.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats great :)
<br/>
<br/>
conversations are very confusing and not really directed towards anything..
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Excellent release :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, not really, try to talk about some topic...
<br/>
anyway, i encountered a bug, which need to be fixed (in this release, there is a workaround, but that way, the starting conversation is pretty meaningless)
<br/>
I started working on second version, which will have more options, and better keyboard.
<br/>
Thanks for testing...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
