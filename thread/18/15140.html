    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the subject pretty much explains my plight, but I will talk a little on it anyways. I am new to DS dev, think it is cool, and wanna learn to make my own programs. I was just getting to the fun part (AKA tile graphics) of a guide, when it cut off. I am very new to C++, but I am learning fast as I have made many programs on my TI-83, as noobish as that sounds... then again, this whole post makes me feel like a noob. If someone could help me find a guide or just teach me some of the basics of this stuff, it would be much appreciated. The most complex program I have made for my DS presently is one that moves a 4 pixel block around according to keystrokes, and doesnt allow you to leave the screen (just so you know where I am at presently). wow, that was a long post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I won't argue there. I think it was more the sense of overview I got from it.

I'm not really experienced in gba programing, but what i can tell is that:
<br/>
- it won't teach you how to program.
<br/>
- it won't teach you how to design games.
<br/>
- it won't teach you the math required in games.
<br/>
- all math formula seems "original" in the mean that the authors wrote them and did not copy the same example (sometimes wrong) found on the net.
<br/>
- it is for the GBA and not the DS, trough I think a good deal would still be true.
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, even if I'm not able to judge it, it seems pretty good and you should take a look...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps: in the bottom right corner there is a "file" link where you can find the example source, binaries, the lib the author provided and downloadable version of the doc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True. And that's not what you expect from a machine-videomode specific tutorial anyway. That's what i'd expect from a programming/game design/math course -- or book in a library.

When it comes to tiled graphics, GBA and the DS are almost the same, with some small changes on maximum sizes, number of colours, etc. but the "mechanics" of tiling, spriting, rotations, flipping, etc. have been kept unchanged, and TONC is *definitely* a reference to grasp the concepts and the working of the nintendo 2D chips. I'd suggest its reading for people willing to dev on the SNES as well, imho (and then, delve into real examples, for the real hardware, but you know how things works).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is that guide teaching it wrong or something? also, what exactly is the command you use to manually map out the tiles? i get how to design them and stuff, I just dont know how to put them together because the example I used only really showed how to alternate tiles across the screen without mapping them one at a time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Patater's guide is a lot more fleshed out &amp; kept up to date, check it often for updates.

Tonc would be the gba bible, going into great detail that may be a touch confusing at first but very much worth understanding. The DS 2D hardware is almost identical to the GBA so the information there will serve you well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My opinion is that you should learn C first. I believe this in general but it's especially relevant to programming with libnds. I feel that C requires a better understanding of memory layout and management than C++ does, and that understanding will come in very handy when you're working with limited memory areas (such as VRAM banks.)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean that you shouldn't use C++ by any means, but the specific  understanding required to write C (vs C++) effectively is directly relevant to programming small devices. On the other hand, C++ does a lot of work for you, and you can use that knowledge to make C++ work in the right way.

Of course you could skip C and still do the right thing in C++, but my point is that it's probably easier to learn that aspect up-front as a language feature.

What he said.  Theres very little "object orientated" stuff in DS Dev anyhow, but C++ is worth it for just the simpler extensions and nicer compilers then straight C gets.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately there are no guides that teach both C/C++ and DS programming, it's generally assumed that the reader has some previous knowlege of the language.
<br/>
<br/>
There are some things I would recommend, firstly a good book on C as well as C++. There is considerable overlap between the languages since C++ is, at least in part, an extension of the earlier language. I have a personal preference for C on embedded systems but I'm not going to tell you to avoid C++, merely that it's good to know about the differences and overlaps.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgc/" target="_blank">http://beej.us/guide/bgc/</a> gives a reasonable grounding in C, I'd also recommend a proper book you can read away from your computer. Google "kernighan and ritchie" for a recommended text.

<br/>
Learning C first up will give you a solid foundation for moving onwards to C++, and it also caps what you need to learn in terms of syntaxing and concepting, since with C++ you can code in both OO (Object Oriented) and procedural style, trying to hit up both at once can overwhelm beginners.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For developing your own game tools (which'll come much later on, when you start building big games on the DS platform and u might need custom editors) I'd recommend learning delphi or C#.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
