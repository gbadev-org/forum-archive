i mean, letting the hardware emulate itself is really dumb, isn't it?

EDIT: this post is only about the use of the word "emulator". i think something like a "software passme" or remapper or whatever could be done. and yes, i think gba devs could benefit from it, although i still see very little use and MUCH, *VERY* much abuse! some kind of "wifi a gba rom to ram and then play it from there" would be much more (ab)usable, i think. yeah, noone has done that, yet, i know. just suggesting how to use more appropriate wording. ;^p

i thought of a nds program that would wifi a rom to ram. 4 mb should be fine for gba roms. (someone has a thread going on the topic. that person is trying to develop such a program, for nds roms.)
<br/>
then the rom is executed from ram, just as if it was on a flash cart, no multiboot code requitred.

this was just a thought of something that would benefit devs more than haxorz. it's no request, at all. ;^D

I think that's what s_c is talking about: use Lick's RAM API to copy a ROM from DS RAM to the RAM of a SuperCard or M3, possibly in small chunks for ROMs between 3 and 32 MiB in size, and then jump to it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@ tepples: nope, good try though.
<br/>
<br/>
my point was more like: have nothing in the nds, start wifi transfer, transfer a rom to main system ram, remap "stuff" (some sort of nds host program / loader is needed here, that is transfered prior to the rom, with the rom attached to it or whatever) in the rom (or however one wants to do it) to be runable directly from main ram, "soft reset" or start the system into gba mode, but preserve system ram and needed settings (remapping).
<br/>
<br/>
gba games are run from rom anyway, so if the nds could be "forced" to pretend its 4 mb ram are a 4 mb rom, there would be no need for extra hw.
<br/>
<br/>
i have no idea if this is doable, i don't even think i would use it (no$ with eventual hw testing is enough for me!) i just know there are very talented people out there and people who would appreciate such software.

If you have a machine with something built into it, emulating is becomes a completely useless idea, just use the hardware that's there.  There are plenty of GBA flash carts about, some slot-1 card now come with slot-2 expansion carts specifically for copying files from slot-1 to slot-2 for booting in GBA mode.

<br/>
that's right. because, last time i checked, the nds didn't have a snes build in, but sure had gba hw inside. emulating the gba wouldn't be more or less illegal than emulation the snes, but what's the point, if you *own* your games and can simply put the cartridges into the system and play? pirating.
<br/>
<br/>
the one and only exception from this are hb devs, but with super fast and sufficiently accurete emulators, that isn't a big issue any more.

not practical. and there are quite some gba emulators out there, have been fpr years. like no$gba maybe? or visual boy advanced? ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
again, to me, it makes no sense to emulate the gba on the nds (beause the nds is sort of a gba advance ;^D ) and as we don't know the secs of a possible future hw, starting to work on an emu for that hypothetical device makes no sense either.
<br/>
after all, they will NOT drop gba support in the nds. the hw of both systems is too close to the gba, it wouldn't benefit anyone to drop it. it's like taking out the game cube (R.I.P., my true love!) out of the wii: there would be only duct tape left! makes no sense!

not sure, but from what I remember it can only run gba games... and since it came out after the nds it prolly mean that the GBA internal was directly coming from the nds one... that's something to verify trough...

Seriously, don't expect people to invest a lot of time to help you save a little bit of money. Unfortunately in this world, most things cost money. And it's not going to change real soon, so you have to prepare yourself to make sacrifices.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, I'm not really sure if a GBA emulator is even possible to do properly without requiring a SLOT-2 RAM expansion (which again is pointless, since then you have a working GBA already), due to the huge (32MB) ROM-space on the GBA. Sure, you could cap it to only runn ROMs smaller than 4MB (minus the size of the emulator?), but that would prevent you from running a lot of software, including at least everything I've ever made for the GBA. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
So it looks to me like you'd only get around to make a half-assed emulator, which doesn't make much sense to me. As tepples pointed out, Nintendo might remove the GBA-support in the next generation of handheld consoles. But hopefully those handhelds will be powerfull enough to emulate it properly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you could always do a page swapping system into the slot 1 ROM since the gba ROM is not being accessed all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
as for the GBA drop in the next system....nintendo uses that slot for ds games also,so unless they want to drop compatibility for that stuff as well, I dont see the GBA being totally phased out till the DS phases out, they may just make a GBA emu on the DS the next time around<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

GBA games require a faster streaming speed than DS games, hence why  GBA ROM data is copied to RAM first. DS games run at a much slower stream, and therefore, can run directly from sd cards, which can stream that data fast enough for the DS to keep up. (even though I've heard some brands or speeds of SD cards can NOT keep up with that speed requirement.)
<br/>
<br/>
that's also why some slot-2 cards sux0rz. (RAM quality issues.) m3 perfect, for example, claims they use static RAM, which seems a bit un-fathomable to me. 32 MB of static ram costs alot more than 70 bucks. ALOT. more. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm no programmer, so I can't speak for how HB runs from said scenarios.

DS Game Cards are <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/block/" target="_blank">block devices</a>, returning 512-byte pieces of information just like CF and SD cards. GBA Game Paks, on the other hand, are word-addressed, meaning that the memory controller can seek to any 16-bit unit in the same amount of time.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
According to Wikipedia, GSF files are basically just GBA files with everything but the sound data removed, thus you'd need a GBA emulator to make even GSF files run at all.
<br/>
<br/>
The GSFOPT program can turn *.gsf files into *.gba executable files.  However, each converted file takes up the same amount of space as the original GBA game.  Thus, an idea Tepples brought up long ago was to use the GSFOPT sourcecode to create a program that converts the GSF file into a GBA rom, loads it into slot-2 RAM, and then boots it in GBA mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But if you're only emulating a music engine, you could probably get away with emulating the CPU at 20 percent of native clock speed and only a tiny subset of the video chip. DSOrganize and MoonShell both have an NSF player; notice how much simpler they are than nesDS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
