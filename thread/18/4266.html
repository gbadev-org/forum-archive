Good luck!

But you have to ask yourself why Nintendo are dragging us down so much. The sony divisions helped homebrew by not only allowing it, endorsing it and supporting it, but by giving them more information than they had before. Wouldn't it be nice ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not at all.  It comes down to simple economics with the PS3 on the horizon - If you look at just how many games were made that required the drive and consider that the PS2 Linux community is negligible at this point (not being derogatory here, it is a fact - everyone who wanted linux probably has it by now, and the community is small) you'll have to agree these cost cutting measures will save money and maximize profits while the PS2 is near the end of its lifecycle.
