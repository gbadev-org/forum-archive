    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a firmware update is apparently around the corner, I got thinking about how the DS is able to underclock one of it's CPUs to play GBA games. Does this mean the DS is technically able to change the voltage to the CPU's so it could potentially be overclocked for homebrew games and emulators? It wouldn't need to intefere with regular games as you could include an option to run the CPU's at normal speed in the OS.

Just a thought, I know everything about the bios isn't known yet...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think the underclocking involves a voltage change, just a clock divider change. Remember that the Game Boy Color's 8 MHz Z80-clone CPU could be underclocked to 4 MHz to play original GB games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
