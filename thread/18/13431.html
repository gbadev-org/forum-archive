    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Shouldn't someone go correct the function name differences between functions which do the exact same thing?
<br/>
For example, I just noticed that LibGBA has "void <span style="font-weight: bold">setRepeat</span> (int SetDelay, int SetRepeat)", while LibNDS has "void <span style="font-weight: bold">keysSetRepeat</span> (u8 setDelay, u8 setRepeat)".<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm in two minds about this being honest. I started renaming things in libgba to bring them in line with libnds &amp; added some of the more useful libgba functions to libnds.
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm considering just replacing libgba with libtonc since that is much better documented and has a larger feature set. Perhaps a merge would be better to maintain some sort of connection with libnds naming schemes where it makes sense.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
