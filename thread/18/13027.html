    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All of the listed functions work perfectly on two different DSes; however, when tried on DSLites, the functions are broken.
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
XY buttons - always read as being pressed
<br/>
Touch screen - X and Y positions are being multiplied by 16 and it always reads as being touched
<br/>
GBA Game Pak Cart Interrupt - Blanking cartridge has to be inserted before it works
<br/>
Rumble Pak - Not detected, probably because of the broken GBA Game Pak Interrupt
<br/>
There's also a few tiny differences in rendering - sometimes pink pixels appear on textures on the DS if I'm not loading transparencies properly, but they're blue on the DSLite.
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
I've not bothered making test programs - the fact that the same program acts differently is odd enough...  Emulators act like DSes.  I am using the R20 of Devkitpro.  Surely someone else has noticed this!  All DSes and DSLites are European versions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only software difference between the DS and DSL is the Power Management port #4. On DSL it's used as brightness selection (0-3) and on DS it will just shut the power down.<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It won't power off the DS Phat. It simply mirrors the SPI #0, though I'm not sure.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes it will, try it. writing any value to PM4 on DS will shut it off. 
<br/>
<br/>
-ALTHOUGH- on newer phat DSs, PM4 does exists.<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember, you have to read BIT(6) first, of SPI #4 that is. 
<br/>
<br/>
If BIT(6) == 1, then the DS is a Lite. If BIT(6) == 0, it's a Phat and you shouldn't write.
