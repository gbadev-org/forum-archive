<br/>
<br/>
The WiFi-Lib still has problems with ARP-requests.
<br/>
As soon as my PC sends a second ARP-request to the NDS (windows seems to update it's arp-tables every 10 minutes or so), the WiFi-Lib stops sending completely.
<br/>
<br/>
This bug is there since the beginning, and still is (lib 0.3d).
<br/>
Any way to fix it, other than giving your NDS a static ARP-adresse ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
