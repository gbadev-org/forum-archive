    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does the DS library have some equivalent of a malloc routine? I'm writing an image editor that loads files from disk, so it makes sense to only allocate the memory that I need, especially if I want to load more than one file at once.
<br/>
<br/>
I know the DS is crunchy on memory normally, but it should still theoretically be possible. I can manage if malloc() does, in fact, not exist, but having one there would be handy and make my code a little more portable.
<br/>
<br/>
I ask this in advance because I'm setting up the image class for this program on my PC, as it's easier to debug file operations and such on that environment. I just have to be careful and make my code easy to port. ^_^

Thanks!

Yes. Newlib has malloc(), and devkitARM on both DS and GBA uses newlib.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

TinuDS is one step closer to...no, I'm not going to say it. Bad gamefreak, bad.
