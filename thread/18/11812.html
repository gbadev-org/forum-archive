The text-input system may be interesting for others too - its all part of my "libpogo" library which I have cleaned up a lot lately and will probably release soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been playing with Frotz on DSLinux, but with the nice visual design and the writing recognition you have here creates a pretty nice setup that really makes it worthwhile.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Okay, I like what I'm seeing :)
<br/>
<br/>
The gesture recognition is really nicely done. I'm only having one problem with it at the moment:
<br/>
The directions seem really hard to draw, and so far I've only achieved writing a single direction (East) once. Could it be made a bit less sensitive for those ones?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow! I was actually starting to wonder if we'd get a frotz port. HHGTTH seems to work beautifully. 
<br/>
<br/>
Keyboard gives some incorrect keypresses sometimes, but I can't tell if that is human error or not yet (have not played enough) due to the "a line" not being aligned to the "q" and "z lines" on the keyboard (the missing caps-lock key makes the "a line" shift a bit to the left).
<br/>
<br/>
The writing recognition is a great feature... it appears very similar to the "inside of your hand" handheld device... which is at least familiar to me. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to display that useful .png recognition image on the top screen rather than the keyboard when you change to recognition mode?
<br/>
<br/>
Saving works too (I have only tried root as suggested).
<br/>
<br/>
Telephasic
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it appears from your .mov and my experiments that tab/autocomplete is a stroke from bottom-left to top-right, but you have drawn it in the png as bottom-right to top-left.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course, this was the intention all along, I just didn't get around to it in the first version.

its a modified version of "libstroke" which is very simplistic - I was looking for something better but others (like merlin) didnt allow for easy definition of gestures.

<br/>
The directions are normally very easy to draw - did you get that you need to draw back and forth, a double right-left line for east, up-down for north etc?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I usually include a TODO but forgot this time aorund;
<br/>
<br/>
Fix loading/saving for all interpreters.
<br/>
Switch between Keyboard, HELP (strokes.png) and Graphics (Magnetic Scrolls) on top-screen when text is at bottom.
<br/>
Improve gesture recognition.
<br/>
Scratchpad-mode - bottom screen turns into a scrollable bitmap where you can draw a map and make notes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure what Errabes is doing as of late, he might have even left the scene for the time being.
<br/>
<br/>
I really hope he comes back around though to release a polished, final version.
<br/>
<br/>
What he did release works good enough for now, so he's still my personal hero.  :o)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
