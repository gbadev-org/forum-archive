    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm new to programming and need some help getting started. I've found lots of resources on developing for the NDS but I won't always have access to <span style="font-style: italic">my</span> computer. I will usually have access to <span style="font-style: italic">a</span> computer though and was curious if someone could tell me how to setup a usb drive that would have everything I need to develop software. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
