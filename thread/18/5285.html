    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a way to draw both sprites and line art to the primary display?
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is I want to be able to draw a line with the touchpad that a sprite will follow.
<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten sprites working in MODE_0_2D and line art working in MODE_FB0 but can I do both at the same time?  If I attempt to set the mode to both simultaneously the line art works fine but only the edge of sprites are drawn. (this is with the dualis emulator)

Sorry, I'm very new to writing code this low-level.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The the GBA ran in bitmapped mode, it could only use the upper half of the tile indexes.  Try putting your sprite data at the end of the sprite tile VRAM area and see what happens. (Naturally, set up an OBJ to display the sprite data.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i don't believe you have any access to tiles or sprites in framebuffer mode, but i could be wrong. generally, framebuffer means you are writing directly to the screen itself, bypassing any graphics hardware. framebuffer is different than bitmap mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think I'll end up doing the yoshi touch and go thing of using sprites to draw lines.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
