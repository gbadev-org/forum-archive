    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I've recently bought a DS Lite with the intention of using it, besides gaming, for homebrew development. Seeing how there's a lot of information out there that's often contradictive, outdated or geared towards GBA's, I'm wondering if I could run my thoughts by you guys before I spend my money on something I can't use.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, what I intend to do is run some homebrew software (like ScummVM DS) and create some DS software myself and test that on my DS Lite. If I understand everything correctly, simply getting an M3 Perfect Mini SD (with included Passkey2) should do the trick, right? Simply put the files on the SD card and run the software? No firmware flashing or anything?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, In order to use DS software on the M3, I need the passkey and an original DS cartridge inserted at all time, correct?
<br/>
<br/>
It seems so simple, I'm just wondering why a lot of people are bothering with WifiMe, Flashme etc. so much if it's simply a case of saving software to an SD card and popping it in the M3. Surely I'm missing something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
WifiMe is easy if you already have the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
FlashMe eliminates the need to have a large PassMe block on the top of your DS all the times. If you have the hardware to do so, FlashMe saves a lot of time in the future.<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word. No space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds good. I guess I can see the benefits of FlashMe, but I don't feel like exposing my expensive DS Lite to unofficial firmware, even though there's virtually no risks involved.
<br/>
<br/>
So using the passkey, I should be able to run stuff from the M3 as if it were a regular DS cartridge, right? I'm not locked into GBA-only mode?
<br/>
<br/>
Off topic, does anyone know if ScummVM DS supports M3 Mini SD yet? I'd prefer to get an M3 adapter that doesn't stick out of the Lite quite as much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as NDS mode goes, the M3 has it's quirks, but it should work like an NDS card for most things.

This is so funny. This is exactly the sort of reply that I always get from 13 year olds. 
<br/>
<br/>
The question remains, why are you so passionate about how other people are 'ripped off' when you love your old DS so much? If you're so happy with yours, why care about what other people got for themselves?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how do you know that I got ripped off if you don't even know what I paid for the thing, or how I got it in the first place?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes? $100 is expensive for something that's effectively a toy. I really don't see your point. And I still don't see why you care so much about what devices I own if you're so happy with what you've got.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i can't understand it. i'm waiting for the lite to hit the stores over here (in germany) and i hope i'll have the money to get one by that time. but i would never ever pay more than 150$ for that thing. i'd likely wait till it's got a reasonable price! and dude, if you got yours for 100$, i congratulate you! one of the penny arcade guys payed more than 200$ for his one! just to get it as soon as possible. (i don't want to call him stupid, he preordered it and it somehow got rare - that means there were not enough units available - and who knows what happened then... but the black market price at that time was around 300$ for the JP version!)

I reccomend FlashMe. It doesn't actually change the firmware in negative ways like most console softmods.
<br/>
<br/>
- You can still use Wifi Connection.
<br/>
- You can safely store the PassMe.
<br/>
- You don't have a large brick sticking out the top of your sexy lite.
<br/>
- Nintendo won't know about it unless they actually run a test on your firmware (which would be worthlessly time consuming).
<br/>
- It adds recovery code to restore your DS if it becomes ker-skuffled.

Absolutely. But if somebody feels like paying $300 to get a machine a few months earlier, that's really their own damned problem, isn't it? I just don't see the point of getting all hostile over something that doesn't even affect you. Especially if you don't even know that they -did- pay $300 for it.

From what I gather from the replies here, yeah. But you also need the Passkey 2 device, with an original game inserted, if I understand how the passkey 2 works correctly. 
<br/>
So that means both a passkey sticking out from the top, and the M3 sticking out from the bottom. I don't care about that sort of thing either, though. I prefer it over flashing. I just hope that the passkey2 doesn't wreck the NDS slot somehow.
<br/>
<br/>
All the M3's I can buy here are by default bundled with a Passkey 2 device, by the way. Probably best to ask before buying to make sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The M3 passkey 2 is pretty big, and bends under the DS.  This makes it awkward to lay the DS down.  So, most people just flash their DS instead.
<br/>
<br/>
The Max Media Launcher is nice and small, so should be less of a hassle.

Why would that be better? Okay, it'd save you the trouble of putting the launcher cartidge in, but then again the launcher cartridge allows your original firmware and warranty to remain intact.

The Max Media Launcher is nice and small, so should be less of a hassle.  I saw a couple of reviews/opinions already, and most people still thought it was better just to flash their DS.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Why would that be better? Okay, it'd save you the trouble of putting the launcher cartidge in, but then again the launcher cartridge allows your original firmware and warranty to remain intact. I don't see anything that outweighs the advantages of the launcher.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I forgot to mention that the person that complained about the launcher said the DS won't go into sleep mode (close lid) properly with the launcher inserted.  So, he had to swap in a authentic ds game.  That sounded strange though, because I thought it's a hardware trigger in the slot, not something on the cartridge itself.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it's true...although I think it's safe to say that person was running commercial game ROMs, as the homebrew I tried didn't have this problem.  I just tested this myself with the Max Media Launcher.  It's like it tries to go into sleep mode but wakes right back up, then tries again...over and over.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
