    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as a noob to this level of programming, as i'm sure many others are, i was wondering if someone could put together a searchable appendix of sorts that lists all the functions available in NDSLib, their parameters and mayb a quick description and example of how to use them.  these sort of things have really helped me in the past when i've been trying to work out which function to use and how to use it, and i'm sure many of us would appreciate the effort to put something like this together</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was thinking more along the lines of what u get in Visual Studio where u go to help and search for the function and it gives u info on what it does and how to use it. would b good if it stood alone from Visual Studio tho for those who don't have it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree that a sort of "glossary of terms" would be helpful when trying to decipher uncommented demo code, but I prefer the tutorial format instead because not only does it tell you what a particular function/register/etc is used for, it gives an example of how it is used.  It also allows for a gradual increase in complexity from the basics to more complicated stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
That's all there is, as far as I know. But I'm sure they'll get better as people who are using it submit more documentation (hint, hint.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
