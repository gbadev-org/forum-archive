    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a slightly odd (and sort of OT question) about the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen all the pictures and video demos from E3, but what I'm wondering about is the actual design of the machine itself, the external aesthetic design.
<br/>
<br/>
Are the pictures we're seeing indicative of the actual final product? Maybe I'm nitpicking but I think that thing needs some serious work. It's uglier than I can bare to carry around. Compared to the crisp edges and slick design of the GBA SP, I'm a little dissapointed.
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that is a superficial view, the hardware is more important, but I have to say, style does count here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But I am still asking, is that the final appearance, or is there a chance it will change before its released?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is just a guesse because on all of nintendos website they have that image as being that and even in the latest nintendo power the have it splured on halve the pages. I don't think they will give this much promotion to the device if they haven't dechole case thingy yet.

I agree i doesn't look that nice either. but i also didn't like the orginal GBA shape when it first came out either but it grew on me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i'll have to see about creating a custom molding for a casing that beter suits my tastes, naturaly it would be roughly the same dimensions, but the outside edges would be much sharper and the bevels (what little thereof) much less pronounced.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well I'm not saying I won't buy it because of its "cover", nor am I saying its bad because of its looks, I'm just saying I don't like its looks. I'm keen on its contents..

However, the techs at Nintendo may have something up their sleeve about the current design, or perhaps a design for the DS SP (if that ever happens).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After all, they had to have something to show at E3, and as with most products, it should undergo a makeover. It looks dodgy in pictures sometimes, but if you see it in video (or real life..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, of course. I doubt they will completely change it, but i believe 2 things need to be addressed (not for me, so that it becomes more succesful) A), it needs to look better in pictures! This could be done by changing the design from being so curved at the edges (I like them, but..) and flattening the fron tedge a bit to stop it looking like it goes back so far and B), The control on certain games (Metroid for instance) Might have to be redesigned a bit, as it has been said by many a-website that the control fells 'weird'. Although, it could just be the new-ness of the touch screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well the good thing is that they haven't officially released the specs of the system to the public yet. If that leaked doc hadn't of gotten out, we wouldn't have anything to base our opinions on. Meaning, there is still a good chance things will change.

Uhm, I'm not sure what is so wierd about what I'm saying. It comes down to this basic fact, on the original GBA, the dpad and the AB buttons were nearly silent, on the SP version they are loud.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't state it any simpler than that. I don't know what keyboards or late night coding has to do with this, I don't do that in my own bed.
<br/>

Bottom line, I didn't appreciate the new noisier buttons on the SP, and wish they were left alone. Capiche? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo has already stated that Metriod has already been adjusted to give the user the option of traditional controls (button) or to use the new stylus/touchscreen.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, i do remember Nintendo saying that, but I <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">would</span></span> like to use the touch screen as the control. Perhaps a total mixture. for instance if you wanted to turn whilst shooting, use the d-pad to turn, and the stylus to shoot. But, i think Nintendo could do it where in you tap the screnn to fire, but you hold it down (whilt you are turing it) to turn, that way it shouldn't produce too many shots whilst turning. Also, i mean the fact theat you oculd only move about 15 degrees (does anyone know how to get the little o for the degrees?) at E3 (or so I am told by many websites + magazines) and  since i want to use the touch screen (you have to admit it would be cool) they should make something at the bottom, possibly adjusting the turn. God! There were alot of () in that sentence! maybeit is because I am to 'into' this new c++ project of mine (the amount of times i have to write () scares me!)!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

hold down alt

    <h4>#23454 - mymateo - Tue Jul 13, 2004 9:39 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My two biggest concerns with the DS system:
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I have not found anything stating that there will be two speakers.  With 16 channel audio and the two circular indents on the upper screen, it begs for stereo.  Nintendo has done a great job for the most part, but I fear accidental stupidity.  [rant]I.E. all the upgrades they had to do to the original GBA in order to make it from a really good system to an awesome system.  Sorry, but it should have been backlit from the start, not frontlit at middle-age.  And still, they managed to take away the headphone jack.  NOT to mention that with either GBA design, whenever I want to play FFCC or Four Swords, and I am using my SP as a controller, I cannot have it plugged in to keep a charge because the link cable covers the hole, and so far no attempt has been made to make a link cable that you can plug power into.[/rant]
<br/>
<br/>
SECONDLY (sorry, long rant back there) I fear that programmers (not sensible ones, like the kind found on THIS VERY FORUM) for the new DS will be too awe-struck with new features, and eager to exploit them to make their games more attractive on the box instead of in gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I do not want ANY game to use all of DS' new features in one game; it would get too complicated to try and manage everything.  Sure, touch screen capabilities in a game makes someone reading the back of its box drool over it, but imagine if the touch screen were the ONLY control you could use?  Not bad for solitaire, but in a shoot 'em up or racer where timing is critical, wouldn't you hate to drop the stylus pen??  And I do NOT want to have to learn to hold a pen while puching buttons just so I could switch between the two.  And forget about using the stylus alongside buttons in ANY game while holding the DS in the other hand, it's not going to happen.  I WON'T LET IT HAPPEN!
<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, I want two speakers (maybe a little more OOMF to them, sure size is a limiting factor, but modern technology is better than what the GBA has given us!), and I want programmers to test their games on real live people in real live situations, not simulations where nothing goes wrong.  If the game is going to be annoying to play, then it's not fun, it's work, and work isn't a game unless you like pain.
<br/>
<br/>

I did find such a cable once upon a time at either lik-sang or lan-kwei (my two favorite sites since I began dev'ing), but they were out of stock (I think it was lik-sang come to think of it) and I have yet to see them re-stocked.  If you know of any other stores off the top of your head, I'd be grateful to know them!

I hate to correct you, but <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">there are</span></span> Best Buy stores in Canada. It may just depend on <span style="font-style: italic">where</span> in Canada you live. There are definitely Best Buy stores in the metro Toronto area. I would be suprised not to find them around major cities elswhere in Canada.

So when I used <span style="font-style: italic">its</span> store locator, it asked for which state I lived in with no option to choose country, so I gave up and assumed Best Buy was only in the US.

Sadly, the closest store is a 4 hour drive away if you don't obey the speed limit, or 5 1/2 if you don't want a ticket, and I'm not big on spending $5 on shipping for a $10 - $15 item.  Plus, the .ca site doesn't have an oline store that I can find, so no guarantees that if I did want to drive for eleven hours that I'd even get it.  I'll just hope the DS has the same port for GBA compatibility, but can be pluged in to recharge at the same time.  There, I stayed on topic again!  lol</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as the DS is concerned, I do not believe you will be able to use it a a controller (if I understand you correctly). The pictures I have seen show it with a recharging port <span style="font-style: italic">ONLY</span>, and if I remember correctly, Nintendo has already stated that they intend the DS to be a stand alone platform, with no links to existing platforms. I believe they intend to use the GBA Cartridge slot on the front for perifrials (I think a spelt that wrong).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... that's odd
<br/>
<br/>
I remember hearing somewhere (I can't be sure where or exaclty when) that the DS was going to be built to work with the GBA and GameCube.  I mean, this was at least a few months ago, so even if I did hear what I thought I heard, things could have changed.
<br/>
<br/>
Any one else have anything to add to support or disprove the existance of a link port on the DS, similar in function to the one on the GBA?
<br/>
<br/>
Thx
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Maybe I should make a change here.  I just foundan image showing the back and underside of the DS (first I've found so far), but the un-confirmed model (I hear it's probably going to have some changes to it).  So I rephrase my question:
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone heard if the final design will have the old GBA style port added to it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On the same subject, I'm curious...
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a 4 player game (Let's say, Four Swords for the GBA, the cart that comes with A Link to the Past on it, not the GC version) that requires you to connect 4 GBA's together, will you be able to use 4 DS's through wireless, perhaps emulating a 4 player link cable, set up maybe through a soft bios?
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, I'm just throwing wild ideas around.  I personally think it would be a great idea, but knowing Nintendo, they'd like to see the SP still get a few more years on the market if possible, so they wouldn't make the DS 100% GBA compatible.  They'd want to make sure that the old hardware still had a place in people's hearts, at least until they felt they've milked it for all it's worth.  Not that I want to make Nintendo out to be a money-hungry ruthless corporation, but isn't that the way the cookie crumbles no matter who you are?

I think only new GBA games that support the GBA Wireless Adapter can be played multiplayer on the DS. Other than that, I highly doubt it. It'll be single player only for GBA games.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
