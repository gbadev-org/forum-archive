<br/>
Did anyone else have their DS PSU cable red instead of green?
<br/>
Its quite interesting as that makes it EXACTLY the same colour as the corresponding USB wire, almost as if it was intended to be used this way.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course red is just a common colour for positive but I found it odd that the tutorial mentions green and mine was red.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, im not sure if its an illusion but it seemed my DS charged up quicker from USB than the normal PSU.  I was wondering if this is simply because it has 500mA to chew on rather than the 350mA of the official PSU.
<br/>
Normally this probably isnt used but as I was playing the DS at the time I wonder if with more juice to suck up it can actually charge at full power while the DS is being used, whereas with only 350mA MAX it has to charge slower.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

Somehow, I'm getting a picture in my head:
<br/>
<br/>
Somebody plugging in the cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Their DS booting.
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of minutes later: "My screen looks a little bright."
<br/>
<br/>
A few more minutes: "The sound is a bit loud."
<br/>
<br/>
Even more waiting: "Oh great, my DS isn't working and I didn't save my game :(."
<br/>
<br/>
Somebody takeing the DS to a store.
<br/>
<br/>
"Sorry, you voided your warrenty by using a 500mA power cable on the DS, a device designed for 350 MAX."
<br/>
<br/>
"Is it fixable?"
<br/>
<br/>
"No, the power circuts blown."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not "sending 500ma instead of 350 ma", it's more "allowing the DS to draw up to 500ma rather than 350ma". That is, the amount of current that passes through the wire can't exceed what the DS needs, so it won't damage anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#32218 - gb_feedback - Sun Dec 19, 2004 2:17 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I often feel saddened by young people's understanding of Ohm's Law, and of electricity in general. The DS power supply (if it is really like the SP one) provides a voltage source stated to be 5.2V. It also states that it is rated at 350mA which means that it will remain at 5.2V (more or less) until more than 350mA is drawn. A USB port *may* be able to supply 500mA; the USB voltage is 4.75 - 5.25*. But current drawn depends on the device drawing it. In this case the DS will draw no more than 350mA. If it drew more it would not be meeting the specification of its own power supply.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, strictly speaking, you can only guarantee to be able to take a 'unit load' from a usb port (100mA). It is contrary to the usb spec to draw more without negotation with the host. Actually it is also forbidden to draw any current from usb without allowing yourself to be enumerated by the host, and specifying how much current you are taking. A lot of products are ignoring this (eg usb lights etc) but it *could* cause you problems.
<br/>
<br/>
* a 'low powered hub' may not be able to supply more than 100mA, and its voltage may be as low as 4.4V. These tend to be battery powered hubs though - I've never seen one.
<br/>
<br/>
And sorry Zlodo - I started this before you made your post...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
