    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
there is something strange, the link to the compilator devkitpro is the same that the link to libnds in the drunken coders website.
<br/>
then i have supposed that libnds is included by default in devkitpro. But the tutorial of doublecs say that I must unzip libnds and then do a make. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried a make but I have the error : arm-elf-g++ command not found.
<br/>
<br/>
someone has an idea ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
personally i used the 'combined' template and then looked at the code in the examples, and on doublec's site, and made my own hello world with that :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The error should tell you that it can't find the command 'arm-elf-g++'. A little bit of searching on your drive will show that this is in the devkitarm\bin directory of devkitpro. Adding this to your path will enable the makefiles to run.
<br/>

In fact, tutorial one mentions this:

I use the makefiles the way I did because I wanted to learn exactly what commands are used to generate the DS binaries. I'm familiar with GCC and wanted to know how things works.
<br/>
<br/>
The devkitpro combined templates hide a lot of stuff and made it difficult for me to find out what was going on. So I broke it down and created the makefiles and learnt about the ARM9 binary and the ARM7 binary, how to add binary resources, etc. Thus tutorial 1 and co was born.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually I get emails almost every day about it. I plan to revisit this tutorial to  make it clearer, or make tutorial one use the standard devkitpro templates and leave the discussion of what commands are actually run to another tutorial. It would save a lot of headaches for everyone I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To be honest, I don't know. I'm as much a newbie as everyone about programming the DS and the tutorials document pretty much the sum knowledge of what I know. That's why there hasn't been a tutorial for awhile. Still learning how things work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ill try the extended rotation thing then, if it doesnt work, i might try and do it all myself in framebuffer mode. wonder if i could use a tga image reader with gbfs...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll tell you a good way to do it genfish.
<br/>
<br/>
Use a regular tiled background, it doesn't have to be extremely big. Store your background image in ram, with a twist: you use a larger number of tiles than what should actually be possible. The map can contain lots of tiles, store them as 32bit containers or something, and you'll have some space.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to write code to make sure that the needed tiles are always loaded into vram when you need them, and to convert the 32bit map tiledata to data the DS will understand, that is, the tiles' location in actual vram, and not where they're stored in ram.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i am studying game programming at university. everything i have done in the past has been for the pc, so i told the university that for my dissertation i wanted to do a console game, so they bought me a flash cartridge :D
<br/>
<br/>
The ultimate aim of the project is to show that i can learn something new without tuition, so im making a few 'milestone' demo's for the DS:
<br/>
1. a simple hello world
<br/>
2. framebuffer demo
<br/>
3. display a sprite (using the oam method)
<br/>
4. a simple 3d demo
<br/>
<br/>
then finally i'll use code from the above to make a simple 2d game.
<br/>
<br/>
I think im going to be using the main screen in framebuffer mode and write my own drawing functions, loading in .tga files with gbfs (if its possible), then im going to draw sprites to the sub screen using the oam method, and use it to control weapons etc. The outcome i hope will be something like a basic version of Turrican from the Amiga :)<br/>_________________<br/>there is no rl only afk</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wish you success !

<br/>
we will also make a 2D game, I love them and I found it sad that most of the new games are in 3D. That's why I love "cave" for their splendid shoot them up ! I hope we will do a shoot of such a good quality.
