<br/>
<br/>
? TI-89 Titanium  (2004)
<br/>
The TI-89 Titanium includes all the built-in functionality and power of the original TI-89. It has an increased amount of Flash ROM which is now equal to that of the Voyage 200 except the TI-89 Titanium is in a traditional handheld design. Along with the Voyage 200, it is TI's most sophisticated calculator, with such features as 3D graphing, upgradable flash ROM, built-in assembly language programming, and a generous amount of user-available memory. It now includes a mini USB port in addition to the standard I/O port.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-84 Plus Silver Edition (2004)
<br/>
The TI-84 Plus Silver Edition is the successor to the TI-83 Plus Silver Edition. Its new features include a new built-in clock and a new mini USB link port in addition to the standard I/O port. The TI-84 Plus SE was the first calculator made by TI to include their new interchangeable faceplates and a kickstand, both of which add to the overall latest stylistic design from TI.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-84 Plus (2004)
<br/>
The TI-84 Plus is an upgrade to the TI-83 Plus. It remains completely compatible with the TI-83 Plus. Its features include a new built in clock, a new mini USB link port in addition to the standard I/O port, added clock speed over the TI-83 Plus and an increase in Flash ROM size. The TI-84 Plus has a newly designed case.
<br/>
<br/>
? Voyage 200 PLT (2002)
<br/>
The Voyage 200 PLT is the most advanced calculator Texas Instruments has made. It kept all the qualities of the 92+ while increasing the amount of Flash ROM to 2.7 MB. It also comes in the latest stylistic case from TI.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-83 Plus Silver Edition (2001)
<br/>
The TI-83 Plus SE is nearly identical to the TI-83 Plus, maintaining backwards compatibility but greatly increasing available memory. Like the 83 Plus, it allows for flash-upgradable ROM and calculator-based applications. It was the most popular among Texas Instruments Z80 calculators, but TI is now phasing it out in favor of the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition. The TI-83 Plus SE is expected to be discontinued within a year or two.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-83 Plus (1999)
<br/>
The TI-83 Plus is nearly identical to the TI-83, maintaining backwards compatibility but greatly increasing available memory and allowing for flash-upgradable ROM and commercial calculator-based applications.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-89 (1998)
<br/>
The TI-89 sports all of the power of a TI-92 Plus, but in a traditional handheld design. Along with the TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 it is one of TI's most sophisticated calculators, with such features as 3D graphing, upgradable flash ROM, built-in assembly language programming, and a generous amount of user-available memory. The TI-89 Titanium will eventually replace this model.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-73 (1998)
<br/>
The TI-73, like the older TI-80, is designed for middle school classes, but features flash-upgradable ROM like the rest of TI's newest calculators. It also improves upon the TI-80 with additional statistics functions and a link port for transferring programs and other data.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-92 Plus (1998, 1999)
<br/>
The TI-92 Plus is available as both a standalone calculator and a module upgrade to the TI-92. It adds additional memory, flash-upgradable ROM, and advanced mathematics software. A TI-92 Plus is functionally almost identical to a TI-89. TI is currently advertising the Voyage 200 in favor of the TI-92 Plus.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-86 (1997)
<br/>
Just as the TI-83 succeeded the TI-82, the TI-86 followed up on the TI-85's advanced functionality while adding a stylish new case, assembly support similar to that of the TI-83, and greater memory capacity, while still maintaining compatibility with TI-85 programs.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-83 (1996)
<br/>
The TI-83 was released as the successor to the TI-82 and featured a newer, more contoured case design that has since been used on all of TI's newer calculators. The TI-83 features backwards compatibility with TI-82 programs and some newer financial functions, but by far the most notable aspect of this calculator is built-in assembly programming capability supported by TI itself. This advance saved curious programmers the trouble of "hacking" the calculator themselves to achieve this functionality, and marked the beginning of TI's embracement of assembly programming. The TI-83 was a popular programming platform, but has now been largely replaced by the TI-83 Plus, an updated model.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-82 (1993)
<br/>
The TI-82 was released as a more user-friendly version of the TI-85, at the sacrifice of many of its advanced features, but with a lower price tag. It was long believed that the TI-82 could not be programmed in assembly, but, as with the TI-85, a loophole was eventually found, making the TI-82 a much more attractive programming platform. The TI-83 Plus and TI-84 Plus have taken the place of the TI-82 as the standard in math and science classrooms and the TI-82 is expected to be discontinued shortly.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DISCONTINUED MODELS</span>
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-92 (1995)
<br/>
When it was released, the TI-92 was a huge departure from TI's previous graphing calculators. It is held horizontally and has a larger display, computer-style QWERTY keyboard, graphical user interface, 3D graphing features, and a Motorola 68000 processor (previous TI calculators relied on slower Z80 processors). Programmers were anxious to make use of the TI-92 for efficient assembly programming, and a loophole was eventually discovered to make this possible. As a result, many impressive games and programs are now available for the TI-92. Unfortunately the TI-92 is rarely used nowadays, having been replaced by the TI-92 Plus (and later the Voyage 200).
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-80 (1995)
<br/>
The TI-80 was released with Algebra I and middle school students in mind. Like the TI-81, it has no link port and is not intended for serious programming. The TI-80's newer cousin, the TI-73, sports flash upgradability and more memory, and has completely replaced the TI-80 in everyday use.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-85 (1992)
<br/>
The TI-85 was designed as a powerful engineering and calculus calculator. It was the first TI calculator to have a link port and assembly programming capability (through an unintentional loophole). It has since been eclipsed by the TI-86, which features TI-85 compatibility along with more advanced features.
<br/>
<br/>
? TI-81 (1990)
<br/>
The TI-81, TI's first graphing calculator, was designed for algebra and precalculus. It has since been replaced by newer models which have faster processors, more memory, and popular features such as linking capability and flash upgradability. The TI-81 drew little in the way of third-party games and other programs, since the code must be typed into the calculator by hand.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Essentially, the TI82 series (82,83,83+,84+,83+SE,84+SE) are almost all identical.  Emulate one, and you can emulate them all.  The only differences are the port maps, and the amount of ROM, Flash ROM, and RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
The TI85 series (85,86) are almost the same as the 82 series, but they use a memory mapped display instead of a LCD controller port.

The idea behind the spacing is simple - having decent sized seperated buttons.. *extra padding around each key*
<br/>
limits the possible mistakes that could happen from misfiring keys.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly gives me room to clearly place the secondary function and alpha keys.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the Dpad/letter keys should replace the arrows..
<br/>
<br/>
A toggle to change the primary/secondary keys need to be made..
<br/>
if on the touch.. or using L
<br/>
<br/>
Keyboard should be seperate also.. using the R key and standard homebrew keyboard maybe?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

I would hate to have to keep switching back and forth between the screens. If anyone does go that route, please make an option to have a 'compressed' input screen as well, with all the buttons at once. That's the big advantage of fancy graphing calculators, that you can see all the buttons at once, and it's something you can't really do on most handhelds, besides the DS with it's 2 screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

umm... someone should see my topic, I seemed to be the first one with major interest in it, yet it seemed to be pretty unnoticed.
<br/>
<br/>
AND YES, the source code is there.
<br/>
<br/>
So as far as I know, I was the first to get it; :D

<br/>
<br/>
My name is James Montelongo. I am a TI calculator programmer. I'm affiliated with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.revsoft.org/" target="_blank">Revsoft.org</a>. I'm transitioning to the DS because I'm tired of writing 100 lines of ASM that 1 line of C can do. One of my more notable projects was <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/13/136/136239.html?p=1" target="_blank">Realsound</a><a class="postlink" href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/21/real-sound-1-0-rocks-tunes-from-texas-instruments-graphing-calcs/" target="_blank">[article]</a>. Currently Spencer Putt and I are working on a Windows based emulator for the TI-8x line called <a class="postlink" href="http://www.revsoft.org/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=32" target="_blank">Wabbitemu</a>.  So this isn't new to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, as far as a TI-83+ emulator on the DS. I started by porting the z80 core we had written for the windows emulator. Unfortunately it topped out at 4.5mhz. So last Tuesday, I switched to DrZ80 which brought it up at just above 12mhz. It runs TI-OS fully with out bugs, and even the most awkward programs I had didn't choke on it.  It supports App loading, but not variable loading(I haven't written the link code yet).
<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate donations, help pay for revsofts hosting. But even if you guys were joking about the bounty thing, it'll get released when I think enough is done for a first version. But I'm the kind of guy who likes the first release to be the final release.  Honeslty, I would just give the SVN link out if any one actually payed, so you all can stay up to date.
<br/>
<br/>
But since I've pretty much announced already, what features would you guys like to see?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I lost my stylus years ago and have been using a Q-Tip every since. I didn't want to use it in the video, hence the trouble I had pushing the buttons. It's quite usable in real life, with or with out a stylus.

Is there an IRC or chat some where? I could use some help with another DS project I'm trying to set up. I'm still new to the scene, the emu is probably the second thing I have ever compiled for the DS. So the hardware is still very new foreign to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How does DrZ80 compare with SMSAdvance's Z80?

I chose SMSAdvance's Z80 core because I had been working for a while on Smsadvance, and I know that it's good code.  From your post, it sounds like they are approximately the same speed.

If the touchscreen response is good, then I'd really like to have a hint of the function and alpha keys associated with each key (or even better - change the whole keyboard mask to reflect the changed functions)

The touch screen is already tight for space, you might use B or select, etc. to switch to a configuration screen.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it's too important to have it look exactly like the real thing. You could drop the arrow buttons and just use the D-pad. Maybe Y=2nd, X=Alpha, Start=Enter, Select=Clear, A/B=whatever, L/R=some less-commonly-used functions. You might also have an easier time drawing (not to mention coding support for) square buttons, that don't necessarily need any space between them. It's a touch screen, not real buttons, so you can bend the rules a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course you could also put the images and mappings in external files so users can replace them. That's my favourite method. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
If you're really strapped for screen space and don't have any buttons left, you could have tapping the mic do something. ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, because I am horrible at lettering, I turned it into more of a template.  I added some letters to provide examples.  The dotted boxes are where I originally allotted a certain amount of space for the 2nd and Alpha characters, though as you can see my example characters use less than that.  I left the dotted boxes in for some of them while others I removed, just to show both.

It needs a little work to remove some of the anti-alising to improve readability and the touch areas would be bigger than the button images .

<br/>
On the otherhand <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWG9nUK75-Q" target="_blank">(watching your demo)</a> the screen ratio for output is better the way you have it, so prehaps a selectable option?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A cfg file will be placed in the default device, pointing to the save state. If no cfg is present, you'll be prompted to select a rom. At which point it will be made in to a save state of the same name with different extension. I was planning to have it routinely save every so often(perferable when the calc is in a halt state), that way it will act more like a calculator and not lose info stored on it that you might need.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not to hot on the side ways layout. For gaming it's not gonna work, but for actual calculator use I see its benefit. It's a more natural layout, and the screen scale up would be 2:1 to fill the width(though the bottom half would go unused).
<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't be to much of a task to have it toggle between sideways, it would delay a first release so ver 2 would be more likely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could drop the arrow buttons and just use the D-pad. Maybe Y=2nd, X=Alpha, Start=Enter, Select=Clear, A/B=whatever, L/R=some less-commonly-used functions. You might also have an easier time drawing (not to mention coding support for) square buttons, that don't necessarily need any space between them. It's a touch screen, not real buttons, so you can bend the rules a bit.

Of course you could also put the images and mappings in external files so users can replace them. That's my favourite method. :-p

especially using the dpad as arrow buttons, and that you really don't need any space between square buttons. Larger is better, and space is only required in real life for accuracy purposes with fingers.

The way I check for key presses on the touch screen is by reading from a bitmap.  Each pixel channel says different information. The red channel tells me if a pixel is a button or not, the green channel tells me the group the button is in, and the blue channel tells me the bit that button is.  This lets me have non-orthogonal layout, and fairly easy time swapping skins and layouts. So the first thing I do is design the keymap, then the skin on top of it.
<br/>
<br/>
I say this because it's actually some what reasonable for me to import external skins that are nothing but bitmap files. Right now I'm just including it straight into the nds file and reading the format. I don't see it being much more of a task to read an external file into memory. 
<br/>
<br/>
Its writing the interface thats slowing me down. I got the emulator going in 2 days, but deciding how things should look and act is taking me a while. I'm real fickle about things like that. And finding out Desmume has quite a few emulation problems is hindering things.  I had the strangest experience with endianness and my unions. I truly do hate coding around emulator bugs, but I don't see a good way to test reasonably without doing so.

As you can see, I didn't add the button-captions. This is mostly so you can tweak this yourself, but also due to laziness ;)

Personally, I think the black/white button-captions should be displayed by default, and the green and yellow "sub"-captions could be visible when the "2nd" or "ALPHA"-buttons are pressed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GIMP 2.4's new selection tool adds several extra steps when dragging pixels around within a layer. In 1.x through 2.2, you just drew a box around the pixels you want to move, and then drag the pixels. In 2.4, you have to drag a box, then confirm your selection (press Enter), then you have to hold a few modifier keys while dragging the pixels. For now, I'm staying with 2.2.17.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I've just realised how powerfull, jim_e 's colour coded keymask is. I'd assumed the Function and Alpha keys would stay associated with the same the same key (ie. use the same keymask as the main image).
<br/>
If they could each use seperate keymasks, any function can be associated with any key just by swapping the colours about.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not what I'm looking for, but for anyone with alternative preferences a whole range of alternative layouts could be possible.

Thanks, kusma did the excelent photo realistic buttons. Jim_e's emulator is a new project so all being well we'll get to see it when he's happy with the user interface and menus.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my take on kusma's skin with the Alpha key pressed.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When I've done the main Keypad version I'll post both the .psd and .xcf project files as when I import / export .psd files Gimp loses the text info need to change the anti-alised fonts,etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Thinking ahead, I was wondering if I should make a photo realistic Silver Edition skin based round kusma's layout/keymask as it might go well with a white/phat DS unless someone has already started?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be, if we had the space and/or resolution to display both well (I don't think we do). It's choices like these that probablly make finalising the project so difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
If custom skin files can be loaded externally from the .nds then the apparent keysizes can be reduced to make space for the extra logos.
<br/>
<br/>
I will go back to my v2 draft design and clean it up and apply some photo realistic buttons, etc. if it looks like it might be of use but as I don't know what final design decisions will be made - at the moment all I'm doing is submiting ideas and resources that jim_e can use (or not) in the hope that it helps him get his project out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
When I remebered that the cursor displays the mode it's in, I realised that colour changing or animated buttons weren't necessary, (in fact, because of the bigger, backlit screen it's easier to see the keymode than on the real thing).
<br/>
<br/>
I had a go at animinating the 2nd Function but wasn't happy with the effect and kept it out (most of the key logos change anyway). I'll watch out for examples of how other people do it (no point in re-inventing the wheel) just in case it's something jim_e wants.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I think I've worked out why it doesn't work very well - if you notice, the highlights and shadows are much more prominent on the blue keys, so when one of those change it is noticable. The 2nd Function and Alpha keys have hardly any discernable highlights so a change is hard to see unless it's big and that then spoils the photo real effect.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I should have posted yesterday.
<br/>
<br/>
New features today are detecting when the 2nd and alpha are pressed and switching the skin for the text layout. I've already modified kusuma's BG to have all the text, but thanks though Ramzee. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've also added rotation, you can now Press L+R to rotate to Normal mode, Right-Handed mode, or Left-Handed mode.  These just scale and rotate the current BG and LCD so it looks a bit scrunched when the DS goes sideways.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the other day I got the File Browser just the way I wanted.  Sporting expandable folders a la Windows Tree View, Double clicking, grab scrolling, and a scroll bar.
<br/>
<br/>
I took a few frames in Desmume to show this off.
<br/>
<a href="http://jim.revsoft.org/FileBrowser_ani.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
So the Todo list now is:
<br/>
<br/>
*Menu's for Key Configuration, File (rom loading, saving, Var sending), and possibly skin if its not gonna cause a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
*I need to make the Save file and cfg file, I put that off to the end so I won't have to keep changing the save state format.
<br/>
<br/>
*Variable sending might do better with a progress bar. Right now its just a console printing the bytes sent.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm coming in on the home stretch for a release I'll be happy with, and you guys have been really supportive. So if there are feature requests nows a good time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, a really cool feature I was working on in my TI-85 emulator (and it was mostly working when I left it last), was using the flashcart to emulate infinite archive storage. basically, it would let you pick a ti85 ASM program (.85s) from your flash cart, and it would automatically:
<br/>
1. transfer the file to the calc
<br/>
2. run the file
<br/>
3. when the file exits, copy the file back to the flashcart (this last step is required, because almost all ti85 ASM programs store their settings inside their own program file)
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'm half crazy anyway, so I don't really advise that you attempt to add a feature like this. Also it's not needed so much for 83+, which has a lot more memory I believe. The TI-85 only has like 24KB available for the user.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

jim_e - when I've unpacked commercial roms I've seen what look like resource files stored in /data, if it's not re-skinable via external files could they be wrapped in the .nds file and accessed via an unpacker like dslazy?

I've no idea if it's possible as I haven't found any homebrew roms that store data there, so it may be undocumented or a feature of the official SDK only.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Ramzee on Mon Nov 05, 2007 9:42 pm; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

Thank you, I'd left them blurred to try and convay depth to the sharper forground key logos, but they probably are a little to blurry. So I'll sharpen them up a little as the anti-aliasing and reduced contrast might do the same trick.
<br/>
(Edit: Contrast re-done. )
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Edit: I see too many flaws and it lacks the finish of a commercial product. I'm happy with the layout (and as a first attempt) but if I was to do it again I'd use translations to re-size a photo with the key logos, etc. removed. I'll see what I can do with the wabbitemu image for the standard version.

As one else has posted any here are mine:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Suspend/Hibernate when the lid is closed so it can be used all day as a calculator with out killing the battery.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Alternative keyboard images for portrait mode (I can do translated images with correctly proportioned text for a stretched keymask if required).
<br/>
<br/>
3. Context sensitive help. I always keep the calculator and it's instructions together incase I use an advanced feature I'm unfamilar with. This would be nearly as big a project as the emulator requiring the program to examine the  TI-83 state/mode and then using a e-book type program to display the relevent help so I'm not expecting it.
<br/>
<br/>
4. If the source is available and devkitPro compiles it we can edit the resource files and make our own skins/key masks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I was thinking of something better than Catalog Help, a virtual hyperlink document. Something with the feel of the constilations star chart program but with a search tree and an awareness of the calculator state. It wouldn't be appropiate if the program is eventually able to emulate other models, but it was on my fantasy wish list.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes I'd love support for other models.
<br/>
<br/>
Another wish (more basic): TI-83 OFF triggers DS Power off with an auto save and this is then loaded the next time the program is started.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at DS85_R3 there's settings for emulator speed, gray scale mode and screen size which are all useful depending on whether it's being used as a calculator or to play games.

I have a question though.  I'm guessing this is a LLE meaning it emulates the TI perfectly(or as close as you can get) without the need of tricky code to get things working(HLE).  I ask because I own a dead TI-86 and wanted to know if it would be possible to add support for it.  Can other TIs that run @ 6Mhz-12Mhz run on your engine aswell?

But the 86 I would have to try to emulate on the PC emulator first so I can get to know its hardware. Meaning it would be a while if I did do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS is also subsidized.[1]

A lot of the price of a calculator is in the price of the proprietary software that it comes with. The TI-89 comes with a computer algebra system based on Derive. The PC version of Derive costs ?120 (roughly $240); compare to Waterloo Maple ($1695) or Mathematica ($2495). Does the price of a new copy of Microsoft Windows go down over the years? What about the price of a new copy of a music CD?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually since the first z80 calc, the same os has been used, but just altered and reimplemented for the different hw versions.  The 82, 83, 73, 83+ are essentially the same calculator with different memory layouts.
<br/>
<br/>
The price of TI calcs is fairly inelastic. They have almost no competition for the high school market. Text books are written for them and teachers only know how to use them. Almost a monopoly.
<br/>
<br/>
But like tepples said, once the calc is sold thats it. Theres no other profit any where else after that. They have to maintain the website and os updates.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got them a bit cheaper thanks to school deals, but yeah they really do have quite a monopoly in the graphics department in high schools here too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
