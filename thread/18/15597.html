    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking to add sound into my program, namely in the form of short alerts and clicks, so that my interface (namely the keyboard) is a bit better. I don't need to play music, I just need to play a few short samples, one at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
I can probably figure out how to use the sound functions themselves from the examples. My question is on sound format. What format do I need to convert my .wav files to for the function to use the binary data, and what should I use to perform this conversion?

when I did sound testing when I coded up a sound engine a little while ago, I tested sound at a few different sample rates. to be fair, I couldn't tell the quality difference between the DS's native hardware mixer of 32khz and my test samples at 22khz, 11khz and a slight quality loss at 8khz. so i picked 11khz since I could stuff more sound into my budgeted amount of ram for sound :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can tell the difference between 11Khz and 22Khz when wearing headphones, which I tend to do. However, I don't think I need quality for these.

<br/>
SoX sounds interesting, that's what I needed to know. Thanks!
