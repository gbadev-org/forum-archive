Also, what should I program first.(and don't say something simple, because I know that, be specific.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In tut1 it would be better if you pointed here -&gt; <a href="http://www.devkitpro.org/setup.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/setup.shtml</a> and recommended the installer package for windows. The installer sets up an environment which will allow people to create projects that work on any host platform supported by the tools.
<br/>
<br/>
In Tut 3 it's probably better to start with the base arm9 template found in the DS example code and ignore the arm7 for now. Using bat files is an extremely bad way to build a project. The template includes a project file for pn2 and allows the user to simply press ALT 1 to build ( or Tools-&gt;Make ). Notepad is *not* a suitable editor for programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Using your own headers in a tutorial rather than the libnds headers isn't really a good idea. Most people using devkitARM are going for the installer package on windows and using the provided libraries which are improving daily.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry natrium, that was just me being lasy, the index and ds sections have now been changed.
<br/>
<br/>
Wintermute, I will check the installer out, i have yet to use it myself, the reason i am using bat for now is so that anyone can come along and pick up the basics, does the installer set up minsys too? If so, this would be simple enough for anyone to do and i would change methods, otherwise, i may include both options so that the visitors to the site can choose.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback and i will take the advice into account next time i update.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the installer installs msys - it pretty much gives the user a stable working environment including a basic editor.
<br/>
<br/>
bat files are extremely problematic and not suitable for use with gnu tools. Amongst other things the only way to guarantee a working build with bat files is to rebuild completely from scratch every time you want to compile. .bat files are also not suitable for any system not running windows ( while the majority of users are indeed running windows a significant number are working on linux and os x)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thankyou
<br/>
<br/>
I completely agree, but wanted to keep it simple for all readers. Now that i know the installer includes msys, i will most likely include this method and remove bats.
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
