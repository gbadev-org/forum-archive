<br/>
<br/>
This includes the following:
<br/>
<br/>
-Texture converter (BMP,TGA, PNG, JPG) to 16bit and 8bit modes.
<br/>
(More modes to come, when I learn how to work with them xD)
<br/>
<br/>
-Mesh converter (Milkshape3D), that generates displaylists ready to be used in nds, multitextures per model, and also exports bounding boxes, for collision/visibility tests.
<br/>
(Animation data is going to be exported in the next version, I'm still unsure about the best way to export it for ds)
<br/>
<br/>
-Map editor
<br/>
This is a very early alpha, I only started today, but theres lots of stuff already there!
<br/>
Its a 3D tile editor, very easy to use, this version can already save to a binary file, or export in MS3D format. Also anyone can add custom tiles and textures.

<br/>
Includes a readme with all info needed, and explanation of the formats used by the programs. Any feedback welcome :D
<br/>
<br/>
NOW some questions.
<br/>
- no$gba only supports 16bits textures? I could get  the 8bit textures to work in real hardware, but in the emulator all is black.
<br/>
<br/>
- to use toon mode what data should be included in the displaylists? I'm currently using texcoords + normal + vertex, and setting up a toontable, but I'm not sure if the result is toonshading...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no$gba support for sure ( i use them ) : 16bits, 4bits, 2bits ... and probably all format :)
<br/>
<br/>
the only think I can see it's more a palette that is not configured correctly ^_^  16bit is immediate 8bit is paletted ....<br/>_________________<br/>-jerome-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
