Does somebody know a fixed point type library for DS including operators overloading and math functions like square root, trigonometric functions, matrixes, quaternions, ? ??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm working on one (for 2 days, so i don't have much ;-)
<br/>
It's based on macros and c-functions (or assembly), but no overloading (i guess that would be slower, but i'm not shure. It depends on how good the compiler optimizes the code. I could try that and run some benchmarks when i have some time).
<br/>
So far i just have:
<br/>
ADD (whoho!)
<br/>
SUB
<br/>
MUL
<br/>
DIV
<br/>
SQRT
<br/>
ABS
<br/>
<br/>
It's 16.16 fixed point numbers, but you can adjust that with one #define
<br/>
<br/>
What slows me down most is making shure the calculations are correct, so i'm coding like 3 lines of code for the fuction and 100 lines for correctness test and benchmark ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
I could share it when i have some more functions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But that is just a start. One place to find some fixed point examples &amp; libraries would be old (mid 90's) game and demo sources.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have some C++ classes for fixed point numbers and some classes for matrices, vectors, and quaternions. I haven't much faith in the optimization of the matrix, vector, and quaternion classes, however, and the fixed point classes could use some work. Nonetheless, if you want them, you may pick them up <a class="postlink" href="http://www.relpats-eht.com/files/fixedmath.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>- relpats_eht</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
