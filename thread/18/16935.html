It looks like a new Nintendo DS library will be coming this November,
<br/>
and it looks like it's more of an official one. That is really good for the
<br/>
DS homebrew scene, cause now we can see the full potential of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am still waiting like everyone else for the release.
<br/>
I hope it's good. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you by any chance Mark Bet? 0_0
<br/>
<br/>
He mentions that he's a "Nintendo programmer", so I would guess that he may be creating a library inspired (a little more) by the design principles of Nintendo's SDK.
<br/>
<br/>
But he only says that it, "might replace libnds one day" - so he is thinking in the long term. Well it's only a week to go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

there are currently 2 members on the libdual forum. one is Mark Bet, a member, and the other is atenzor, site owner. looking at the main page, you can see that the writer of the main page(I asume the site owner) is a friend of Mark Bet.
<br/>

I think that atenzor just want help his friend by promoting its libary.

if he's an officiel nintendo programmer (with an sdk and everything) then I don't think he's allowed to release information about the sdk. I'm not sure if that includes "libraries inspired by the sdk design principles".
<br/>
<br/>
or he meant that he is a homebrew programmer that develops for the nintendo DS.

ho boy. I may be wrong, but I get the feeling that he underestimates the amount of work that needed to create something like libnds.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well a quick Google of atenzor gives up some interesting posts:
<br/>
<br/>
1) A person with this name has been banned from at least 1 IRC network.
<br/>
2) How's the "ModGrafix Engine XM-F (PS3/X360/Wii/PC)" game engine comming along? (Gamedev account is banned now)
<br/>
3) Can I still apply for the speed bonus run bounties?
<br/>
<br/>
So unless atenzor is really unlucky in picking names for his account on here, I smell a scam.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and a google search for libdual shows up numberous posts on various DS Dev scene forums, with the exact same thing on them by the exact same username, including a wikipedia defacing of the libnds page that was reverted twice because of the URL that this library is on.
<br/>
<br/>
And please don't tell me that your not the same person as I'm pretty sure that the odds of atenzor being a common username for scammers from Reseau d'Informations Scientifiques du Quebec is very slim...
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and one other thing to think about, just becuase you can extract the .o files from a .a file and do the reverse it does not mean you can make something like libdual from the sources of libnds and get away with it easily.  There's a few of us in IRC that are looking forward to next week for the release just to see exactly what libdual is made from...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I am friend of Mark Bet, he is in Japan right now.
<br/>
<br/>
He is a licensed member from Nintendo and has rights to publish stuff
<br/>
from them.

SteveH noted this from a Google search:

<br/>
2) How's the "ModGrafix Engine XM-F (PS3/X360/Wii/PC)" game engine comming along? (Gamedev account is banned now)
<br/>
3) Can I still apply for the speed bonus run bounties? 
<br/>
<br/>
This is true, however, those were the times were I was just kidding, and now I want to learn programming stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, he didn't say that it will replace libnds the day it's released, but simply said "one day", perhaps it will eventually.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess you guys will have to wait the release date (November 1st, 2009) and then judge by yourself. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If that's the case he can not publish this libdual as he will be breaking the NDA that he signed to become a licenced developer.  Also I can not find any information on him, so please provide proof or some link that shows his credentials.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I learnt this from eve-online:
<br/>
<br/>
Once a scammer, always a scammer.  I very much doubt that this libdual exists, will ever replace libnds, or that anyone will use it.
<br/>
<br/>
You need to tell your friend to setup their own website on something other than webs.com with more informaiton on it, think of a sales website that has some screen shots, example code etc, otherwise, to me at least, this looks very fishy.  The forums are locked on your website, or they were when I was looking a few hours ago, so we can't post questions about the library.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I find that rather unlikely.

--- ** Ok, I'll be serious now.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are for real then let this be a PR lesson for you. A library is a pretty large undertaking not to have more details such as design approach, abstraction level, screen shots, or a history from the programmer (Mark Bet can't be found on Moby Games). On top of that it is attached to a brand that has a bad name (atenzor).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course I salute you in your effort in creating a buzz; I'm sure you will have plenty of hits on the first of November - so good luck on the release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ahh so he's making sure that the "libnds replacement" is a-ok with Nintendo, a company that has sent numberous CnD's to people that do fan created games of their IP, companies that make or sell flash carts, and are so protective of their hardware and software that they are utilising SHA1 1024 bit keys to encrypt their files that they save onto the SD card on the DSi?  I don't think Nintendo will sanction his library more than libnds will get the thumbs up from Nintendo...

OK, so I'll be nice here and ask a couple of questions that I've not seen asked or answered to a satisfactory level yet:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Who is Mark Bet, what previous games has he worked on, and which platforms?
<br/>
2) Why is it that every post about libdual points to your free hosted web site that has links to Yu Gi Oh music, and as my learned college DiscoStew stated also has information for other SDK's that no longer exist.
<br/>
3) Who is M-Duplex Corporation? Where are their offices based?
<br/>
4) If Mark Bets is a real person, why hasn't he signed up for an account on this forum and posted a response on here, with links to more information on the product?  The only person that's posted about this product is you on numberous forums, scene news sites, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm going to allow you some time to think up the answers to these questions and let you post the results, infact I'll give you until Vavle release the L4D2 Demo (current ETA October 28 @ 06:00am PST), after which time I will no longer care about the answers as I will be too busy playing L4D2, or I will be for at least 2 hours...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The approach that should have been done in the first place would have been with a screenshot/video of a short demo with a snippet of code showing how it works, because when we see something in action, that's when our attention is focused.

and he is absolutely, completely, positively sure that it will be ok with nintendo by november 1? what if nintendo decides that they want to cancel the whole deal, meaning that Mark can't release the library? seems to me that you want to wait with anouncing it until after nintendo OKs it.

    <h4>#170985 - SteveH - Wed Oct 28, 2009 1:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok Now my interest is peaked again - mainly as my BS meter has just exploided :(
<br/>
<br/>
some new questions, and please no stupidly short answers:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Why does Mark Bet not like using forums? taking into account that he's signed up to YOUR forum, and posted once, thus he uses forums!!!
<br/>
2) How goes it with your friend Mario, sorry billconti? Did the baseball bat to the face hurt? (in case anyone's wondering I asked him on IRC to hit atenzor with a baseball bat since he did not know who M-Duplex Corporation are, even though it's plastered all over his website...)
<br/>
3) OK you don't have access to the library, but Mark Bet does... so ask him to create a short video of the library in action and provide some example code (a hello world would be small enough example code to show it works).
<br/>
<br/>
Taking into account that there has been no official announcement from Nintendo about this official library, and the last time I spoke to an official DS dev about this library their response was "What? never heard of it...", and with this being for the homebrewers and legit etc, I'm sure that a lot of the big publishing houses and the dev's on warioware would know about it, I still think this is BS, but I am willing to wait the 4 / 5 days until 1 November 2009.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I second DiscoStew's question - how can a total nobody that does not know the first thing about publishing a game, never mind a new library system for a game console know the CEO?  I'm not going to assume you mean Shigeru Miyamoto, since you did not say CEO of nintendo, for all I know it might be Steve Jobs, or William Gates...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

2) Mario? I think drugs are not good for you kid.
<br/>
<br/>
3) I was about to ask him, but I had to reply to these questions here, maybe if you stop, I might just release a video.

If you are for real then again, let this be a lesson on PR. Just check my sig, it's said that for 2 years so nobody is waiting for this algo but might be curious - likewise nobody is waiting for the lib, rather they're waiting for a reason to lock the thread.

You might think people are being facetious, but are in fact being very kind. It's not been locked and the mods have all the reason to (which links into my theory with the motivations for lying).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Mario, billcoti, libnds, or what ever your friend's IRC persona is today has stated that he is currently stopping with you for a few days, and he is even accessing IRC from the same IP address that all these posts are comming from I bet.

I requested that he hit you with a baseball bat as last night I could not be arsed to post a reply to your comment about the company that is plastered over your webs.com site...

Well ask him, don't answer the questions here - you'll find that some people, like myself, love to find new tech and try and take it apart before it's released, and this new library means that any libs people are currently writing would need to be adjusted to work with libdual, and the more information we have about it the faster these libs can be ported, which will also help the lib become more used.  So as I've said a couple of times, you need to take a short PR course and explain to Mark Bet that the more information he puts out the better.

For NDS, you need to write to the filesystem using libfat, which comes with libnds.  Once you do, it's mostly as easy as writing files to any filesystem.  If you need more help, start a new thread about it and we'll discuss there.

Thanks! Isn't there anything on the NDS like what's on the GBA? I mean, is there a way to implement a save using no filesystems? How do the commercial titles do, then???</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This was somewhat of a test. I say "somewhat" because I really do want to meet Mr. Shigeru someday. The CEO bit was the test, and even a simple Google search can tell this.

But understand, we have nothing to cling onto other than from word of mouth. People are deceptive (just as I was with my test), and it's hard to trust anyone unless they've shown good intent. A person with no background "can" bring about something grand, I will say that. If it does get released, then fine, we'll see what it can do, but don't expect anyone to not peck at the library, because they will, and if they find that it isn't original code, word will get out.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by DiscoStew on Wed Oct 28, 2009 11:24 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

What makes this library any more "official" than libnds? We know that Nintendo insist their libraries are used for DS development and their NDAs forbid sharing with the homebrew community.

Why would you want to replace libnds? Is there some functionality missing that people would like to see?

OK so libdual is for the DS phat and DS lite, excelent only one problem exists here - How to get our stuff running on those machines without using a cart that uses piracy to get homebrew to work..
<br/>
<br/>
Is Nintendo going to create an Offical Homebrew Slot-1 Cart?  Where we only have access to the ARM9 and have to use a pre existing ARM7 code? or is there some other mechanic in the works to stop using this library / cart for piracy purposes?
<br/>
<br/>
I was initially excited about the posibility of some competion for libnds, but only from the point of view that a monopoly is bad.  No offense to WinterMute but some parts of libnds are lacking in features (one of the things I'm working on at the moment will hopefully help in this situation) and these missing features are slowly appearing, but if libdual has these features from the start then you should demonstrate these features in a demo along with some example source code to show how these features work.  Atenzor I'd sugest you contact Mark and get him to create a small demo of the power of his library, add in some screenshots, get some sample code and put this up on your site - this is called the sales pitch, it is what you need to provide for any product or service even if it's free.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's an example - Font support.  In the current libnds you are limited to 8x8 fonts using the tile grid, unless you use some exotic font system for your application.  So get a simple text demo done that shows the power of libdual and post some screen shots, and the code that generated them - as I said in a previous post Hello World would suffice as an example of the power of libdual.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just thinking. If it is an official library that requires an OK from Nintendo, is this meant to be used by homebrewers, or by official developers of the system, or both? Let's exclude the fact of where it's coming from, and focus on the library itself.
<br/>
<br/>
A library still requires a compiler for code that uses the library, therefore, is a compiler being bundled with it (and therefore, it's a stand-alone development suite), or is there a specific one that we will have to use? Any mention of Nintendo's own SDKs  as a requirement means we as homebrewers (though some of us, not I, are actual developers) cannot use it.
<br/>
<br/>
If it is stand-alone, wouldn't that conflict with Nintendo's own SDKs, that developers actually have to purchase? What profit would Nintendo see by using a free library when they've got their own that they actually sell? Theirs also come with hardware debuggers and such, which are probably specifically linked with their APIs, therefore, they couldn't use these debuggers with libdual.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The real question for competition like that is answered by the question: how easily can users get their suggested improvements added into the main distribution?  If users don't feel like they can (see the recent pidgin PR disasters), then competition or forks appear, which can be better for the consumer than a developer/distributor who doesn't "improve their product" (from their point of view).
<br/>
<br/>
Not that I'm saying you (as the devkitPro maintainer) do any of those things (As far as I can tell, you don't, and you do a great job), just saying that a lot of responsibility falls on you, the maintainer's, shoulders to ensure that competition/forks aren't needed .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

there is no need to have a lib rivaling libnds. that lib would have to create all those register defines that libnds already has. that would be a waste of time and effort that could be spend on other stuff. if there are features missing from libnds, then either add them to libnds or create a lib with just those features that is build on top of libnds.

Here's a question; what were the motivations behind your previous hoaxes? Have you received medical care for the issue, and what is your internal representation of hoaxes now? What are (and were) the gains of it?
<br/>
<br/>
Was it because you saw programmers as an elite group, and therefore making any sort of conversation gave you a sense of greater purpose (like some people do from the idea of meeting with or knowing a celebrity)?
<br/>
<br/>
If that is the case then be assured that we are all just mere human beings with a poetic twist. There are people who live their within the context of other people's imaginations, engrossed in their books, films, games; then there are those who create new worlds through poetry, music and games. Creativity is the only cue to what most people call great. Even a conman is using skills of creativity by bringing his ideas into your false positives.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you didn't want to risk finding out you were incapable of doing something for which you understood enough to have admiration; but be assured that anyone with the will to achieve something will eventually find a way. There are few people incapable of learning something they truly want to, so the question for you is whether you would like to learn some thing.
<br/>
<br/>
The answer to that question should always be yes; we as human beings should always want to be learning more; it is only at times of depression when we are happy to apply the brakes and see no progress.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think OP should spend more time learning coding rather than rolling out fake SDK's on forums.
<br/>
<br/>
While I agree coding is a creative artform it can also require quite complex out-of-the-box style problem solving and maths. What I love about coding is that it requires a combination of both left and right hemisphere's of the brain. And while anyone can pick up a paintbrush and paint a picture it does take a marginal amount of work to learn a programming language and to eventually write something entertaining or useful with that skill.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the OP is genuinly interested in programming but frustrated that he himself doesn't have the skill and/or patience to learn and would rather a much easier contest of conning his way into a community that eventually rejects him.
<br/>
<br/>
But I just think it's a game played by someone who enjoy's trolling and giggles to himself at a group of people whom which give him attention and iota of contemplation. But I do think this is a sick individual (despite duallib being true or not which I don't think it is). The more he is posting the more obvious this becomes and how many times does one have to say "wait and see".<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By stating this, you are saying that there is something about libdual that appeals to you that libnds does not. What is it?
<br/>
<br/>
You're saying that it isn't meant to compete with libnds, yet exclaim that libdual is superior, and that you hang on to it as if it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Why is that?
<br/>
<br/>
If this is for support of your friend, then it can be understood, because you want to see something be successful, but we don't know Mark Bet, and because we have never heard of him, nor have heard from him (except through you), we aren't as ecstatic as you are.
<br/>
<br/>
what I will say is that libnds is superior, even without knowing what libdual is capable of. Not because of what libnds can do, but what it is capable of because of the community surrounding it. Everyone here is familiar with libnds, which already gives it a head start, and multiple people are working on it and updating it, whereas libdual is being maintained by one individual.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's a bit of a grey area, this will black list you if you're time wasting again. Atenzor's last post gives good reason to lock the thread until a library is released.

@Atenzor: And you have not answered any of my questions; indicating that this is another scam and you have not changed. There is evidence of a scam from your recent posts in the screenshot from DiscoStew, so I suppose that was all he needed to be certain. Your response to my questions is all I needed to be certain.

No need to lock it. Just delete it completely. Nothing has been gained since it was created.

<br/>
I really don't care if it exists or not anymore. The "author" doesn't use forums, as said by atenzor, therefore, how can improvements be made without communication from those using it? Through atenzor, the middle man? The one involved with hacking and scams? Yeah right, good luck on that. If this Mark Bet does make improvements, it will be by him and his decisions on what he wants, not what the community feels is needed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Besides, in order to be an official Nintendo developer, there are requirements, like money, an office, etc., whereas what you are saying to get some official stuff is by "good reason"? Going by the old saying, "If it's too good to be true, then it probably is."
<br/>

Besides, if even one person got it, what prevents it from being shared? Also, what if we sent Nintendo the web address to your website?
