    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Man, that would be awesome.
<br/>
I was thinking about it a while ago (but can't code).
<br/>
I hope someone picks up the torch.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what is this game about? does it have any aim? or is it just a "sandbox"? (sandbox! you get it? *lol* ;p)
<br/>
<br/>
maybe i can help... just need to know what needs to be done. i've some experience with hardware drawn particles on the nds :)
<br/>
<br/>
post a bit more and maybe i'll take it.
<br/>
<br/>
greets!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well the physics aren't quite right, it seems to miss steam and stuff, and salt doesn't seem to be in either.
<br/>
there could also be an eraser option, and there are a lot of cool physics possible, check out the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fallingsandgame.com" target="_blank">FallingSandGame forums</a>.
<br/>
espesially <a class="postlink" href="http://www.piettes.com/fallingsandgame/download.html" target="_blank">this app</a> is a good one to test with because it has a lot of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fallingsandgame.com/viewforum.php?f=8" target="_blank">physics for download</a> that you can use with it, i guess some of these elements in the downloadable physics may bring you up some good ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
furthermore an increase and decrease in the drawing range would be cool, because now only squares are possible, so maybe round things will be better even more if their resizable.
<br/>
<br/>
thats about it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
