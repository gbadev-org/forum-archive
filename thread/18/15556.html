    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DevkitARM should contain a compiler.  You will need to know how to program in C or C++, and you will need technical knowledge of the DS.  There should be some tutorials to help you start out, but I don't know how up to date they are at this point.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If by "program" you mean an IDE to write end edit code, devkitPro comes with Programmer's Notepad (at least it did when I last updated), which allows you to open the .pnproj project files which comes with most of the examples. It has code coloring and allows you to run the makefiles to compile the code with a handy shortcut.
<br/>
<br/>
There's a post somewhere about a project that creates VisualC++ projects for your DS projects. I use VC++ (made a project myself that uses a .bat file to compile and run the emulator directly) and it's lots of help because you get code completion for the libnds stuff if the project is setup properly.
<br/>
<br/>
But if by "program" you mean something where you place 3D models and sprites around, like GameMaker or Flash, then no, there isn't one. Such tools are high level editors for existing game engines, while devkitARM+libnds and even PAlib are merely development libraries that allow you to write code. If you want a game engine and an editor for it, you must write them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i thought devkitPro Updater had an option for downloading and installing programmer's notepad? that seems to be quite popular, although you can use other IDEs (integrated development environment, what means it's an advanced text editor with build in compiler / build system support).
<br/>
for example, i use code::blocks (it's open source) myself, but others use visual studio.
<br/>
<br/>
you can also use notepad or anything else that can be used for test editing and compile via the console. i wouldn't reccommend that for you, though.
<br/>
try programmer's notepad.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Programmers notepad comes with a standard install of devkitPro. If you need a head start, in your devkitPro folder, there should be an examples/nds folder. Navigate around there a bit for C code examples of things you can do with DS homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
If you open one of the project files with programmers notepad (the file association should be there already, I think) you can immediately go to Tools-&gt;make, and programmers notepad will call gcc for you and compile the project. You'll get a .nds file from that, which you can load into any NDS emulator (I recommend no$gba) or write/SD/etc it to your flashcart to play on your real DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If the make doesn't seem to be working for you, then you might have had a path issue when you installed devkitPro, although I'm pretty sure they fixed those issues by now. (Actually, I remember having issues with it on Vista, but that was a while back when Vista was new. ^_^)
<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation is that you start with the "template" project in the examples folder I mentioned. It sets up a quick console and it a typical Hello World! program, and as a result you don't have to worry about managing an entire project at first.
<br/>
<br/>
You're definitely going to need very very good knowledge of C or C++. Don't despair, I learned most of what I know about C from programming on my GBA (and then my DS) and it's not terribly difficult to begin with. If you have no prior programming knowledge however, you're going to want to practice on a PC first to get the basics down.
<br/>
<br/>
If this is your first time with homebrew, I'd actually recommend that you start out on the GBA. The video on the GBA is a lot easier to work with, and 90% of it transfers over to the DS. (The DS has all of this weird VRAM mapping stuff that takes a while to get used to, and causes all sorts of issues if not done right.) GBA homebrew will get you used to working with backgrounds, sprites, and a complete lack of a divide operator, among other things, and once you have it down the transition to DS homebrew is a piece of cake.

For someone with no C experience, I would almost recommend JavaScript as a first programming language. All you need to get started are Firefox and Notepad.

I agree with everything you go on to say, with one catch: You'll need a SLOT-2 card compatible with GBA mode. If you have only a SLOT-1 card, the EZFlash V 3-in-1 is an extra purchase, and it's also an extra step to load a .gba file onto the microSD card and then copy it to the SLOT-2 card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hope it was too. JavaScript? That's OK for getting general basics down, but that's only if you're already VERY familiar with HTML and attributes of tags. Plus, JavaScript is like C without pointers, which kind of defeats the purpose if you think about it. The reason we still use C(++) in the gaming world is primarily because it lets us fiddle with hardware much easier than with a higher level programming language. Plus, it's faster as a general rule, especially when there isn't an operating system getting in the way of things.
