Starting at chapter 4 it almost reads like a complete recent tutorial for the DS. Might be useful for some. Note: I haven't read it thoroughly, just skimmed it.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I wonder if he got his master's or not...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seems like he spent quite a bit of time putting that together.  I do find it kinda funny that it's basically 100 pages of DS specifications and hardware info, and 10 pages of "oh by the way I'm making a program for the DS that benefits kids."  Almost seems like it should be the other way around, but then again I'm just a lowly undergrad so I don't really know what all a master's thesis really entails.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree with you, this seems woefully padded with information that I don't think is even appropriate for his target audience. Makes me glad I never had to write a thesis.
<br/>
<br/>
But it's pretty well organized and disseminated for people who really do want to get DS information. Content-wise it doesn't really offer anything beyond GBATEK (as you can see since it's the main source), but the wording might be a little clearer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
