    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, there seems to be some problem with picking and n0$gba, cant seem to get the picking example (or mine) working on the emulator, on the ds both work fine.
<br/>
Anyone had the same problem, and possibly a solution?
<br/>
(I actually sat debugging my app for hours untill i found this out... xD )
<br/>
<br/>
Second, simply put how do i transform PosTestXresult into world coordinates? cause it aint if im not mistaken..
<br/>
<br/>
Third, is there already a world to screenspace conversion function somewhere in libnds?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

no$gba doesn't support the GFX_POLYGON_RAM_USAGE / GFX_VERTEX_RAM_USAGE registers (they just return 0 on read) which the picking example uses</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think ideas supports GFX_VERTEX_RAM_USAGE in one of the latest builds. I know of no other emulator that supports these registers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
