    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi I have some question - I make some tests on Textured_Quad demo from ndslib, and I had 2 textures and changing betwen them on L,R button. It works well. I was wondering where DS store textures - I thought that in VRAM_A (in case of this demo). I know, that VRAM_A has limited size, so when I add some more textures, created in this way:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">glGenTextures(1, &amp;textureID[0]);
<br/>
glBindTexture(0, textureID[0]);
<br/>
glTexImage2D(0, 0, GL_RGB, TEXTURE_SIZE_128 , TEXTURE_SIZE_128, 0, TEXGEN_TEXCOORD, (u8*)texture); </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I got problem with displaying new textures (grey quad, some errors in displaying). 
<br/>
<br/>
So here is my question - do I need to recreate textures with glTexImage2D if I want to use a lot of them? I think there should be some other way to do it.<br/>_________________<br/>[ sorry for all mistakes, but my english isn't as good as I wish it to be ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
