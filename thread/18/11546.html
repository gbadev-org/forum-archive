    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I updated Rich's port of Hexen.
<br/>
<br/>
Added libfat support. Hexen can finally be played on GBAMP (in theory but I haven't tested it)
<br/>
Saving still doesn't work. I don't know why.
<br/>
Changed to more standard controls. You don't need to use the touch screen anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
It won't work with the shareware hexen.wad.  You will need the full version.

<br/>
On the subject of saves, I believe the original problem was that Hexen produces save files that are too big to fit in the SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Hence, they'd probably work best with FAT support.
<br/>
<br/>
One could also try introducing zlib or somesuch in order to compress the saves...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FAT support is what I added, it's the main point of this update.  The saves are created but they seem to be corrupt since they won't load.  It's probably just a minor error but I haven't found it yet.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it's anything like wolf3d, you'll need to re-write the save code atleast partially.
<br/>
Even still it writes pointers to disk which will change with each build, so keep an eye out for that in hexen since they probably do that in there too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
