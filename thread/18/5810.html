<br/>
I assume that by "12 MHz" you mean "11.17 MHz", which is one-third the speed of the ARM7, just as GBA EWRAM is one-third the speed of its ARM7. I'll also take an educated guess that for compatibility reasons (e.g. Feel The Magic unlockables), GBA carts run at roughly the same speed on the Nintendo DS as they do on the GBA: 4.2 MHz random, 8.4 MHz sequential, assuming 3/1 wait state settings.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Is knowing the pointer at runtime acceptable? Because that's what GBFS does. Pad your .gba to a 256 byte boundary (with the included 'incbin' utility), and then concatenate the GBFS file to the end.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

hmm, this one is going to be slightly problematic.
<br/>
<br/>
Since so many people were having trouble with uninitialised data being placed in dtcm the linkscripts with r14 now place bss in ewram. In order to use GBFS in memory (as you would need for a wifi app) you're going to have to pad the binary by the size of the bss segment. It should also be noted that malloc will return addresses which overlap the file system in this case.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I can think of doing is to provide a hook in the crt0 which would allow a function to be called before bss is cleared which would move the filesystem to the end of the bss segment and reset the base of the heap to the end of the filesystem.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm beginning to think there is something really messed up with something in DKarm R14/4.01 editions, should I actually be looking for a workaround for <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=49721&amp;highlight=#49721" target="_blank">my problem with pallette getting messed up</a> instead of seeking the cause of the change and adjustments I could make? So confusing as it still compiles and works great under R13 (even with additional padding).
<br/>
<br/>
Problem being: even once the nds is padded and the file loads in DualiS (and on hardware) the pallette under bins compiled with R14 does not seem to be correct anymore (blue/pink instead of black/white), is it possible that the const char array is being overwrittern somewhere along the way?
<br/>

edit:/ ( a link to the unmodded code I am having problems with (from josath) can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=45214&amp;highlight=ebook+thingie#45214" target="_blank">here.</a>  once compiled under R14, and padding is added, it runs but it seems like the pallette is no longer correct - under DualiS you must hit right before you will see anything if you are on a CRT. From the source a "padbin 256 build/subPixelFont.bin" must be added just before the first cat command in the buildROM.sh or it will just crash)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by cory1492 on Wed Aug 03, 2005 4:31 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples, correct the approach of appending to the nds file does not work when it is not stored on a flash cartridge. WMB only sends the ARM7 and ARM9 binaries, not the entire NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
For WMB support, as long as the appended data is less than 4MB (plus the size of the ARM9 of course) it is better to link the data in using objcopy to convert it, bin2s or something similar.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
