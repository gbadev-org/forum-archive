    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HTTP1.1 is documented in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html" target="_blank">RFC 2616</a>.  I don't know if you've ever written something to an RFC spec before, but it's a good skill to learn.  You'd want to brush up on sockets first, though; if you're trying to learn to read and implement an RFC, you want your socket code to just_work. ;)

As to the current state of TCP/IP on the DS, I'll leave that to someone who's been here more than a week to comment on, because I've got no idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
