    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey!
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my bad English, but i will to my best! :D.. so my question:
<br/>
<br/>
Will there be a Software Release (of the Wifime tool) for Pocket Windows? (PDAs with Wireless Connection implemented). That would be fine!
<br/>
Ive got a Dell Axim x50 .. but I don?t wanna buy a wlan module for my pc for only doing wifime for ds. (ive also got no PASSME-Module)
<br/>
Ive only got minimum Programming knowledge so I can not do it myself.
<br/>
But what I can do is that u do the Programming and I do testing with my pda and my DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
I hope there are some good guys at programming a PDA. I think its a different and also interessting way for the wifime project!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it would be brilliant. Hard, but worth it.
<br/>
The DS is portable, so being able to use wifime and download play anywhere has got to be good.
<br/>
<br/>
You're traveling around, and maybe you feel like watching the Zelda Preview Trailer, or playing a bit of Meteos. Or if you've flashed/got a flashcart with you, test your homebrew demo or do something else.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a brilliant idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice idea, but you need to know first whether the PDA WiFi chip is supported or not.
<br/>
If it comes out, it will most likely support only specific pdas.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo hasn't deployed any hotspots for the DS yet, so there aren't any available details for them.
<br/>
<br/>
Though there is little doubt they are going to be standard WiFi APs with some variation on Broadcom's SecureEZSetup, which would be in line with both the announcement of Broadcom providing the WiFi hardware for the Rev, and Iwata's comments on the DS not requiring setup to connect to certain routers.
<br/>
<br/>
They will likely block all but Nintendo's OUI as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hehe woops :)... Well maybe, it is possible with some smaller roms. If you load the tpc/ip download thingy high in memory and let it execute from there (using a jump) and then, when the downloadplay roms is downloaden, have it jumped back to the beginning of the ram, where the rom is. Wouldn't that be possible..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
