    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You just got to prepend an NDS loader to the file and it will become a PassMe version.
<br/>
For example, get <a href="http://darkfader.net/ds/files/ndsmall.bin" target="_blank">http://darkfader.net/ds/files/ndsmall.bin</a>
<br/>
(note, this one doesn't provide a callback for filesystem calls yet. working on that)
<br/>
Then you can do:
<br/>
cat ndsmall.bin mydemo.nds &gt; mydemo.ds.gba
<br/>
or
<br/>
copy /b ndsmall.bin + mydemo.nds mydemo.ds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
This way, the end-user can use the latest loader version and have support for other media like CompactFlash etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem is that .bin files are practically everywhere and don't have a strict definition in terms of what they are (inside the file itself). In one example, it could be a Genesis ROM and in another a file spitted out after compiling a homebrew demo.

Fallow them step by step, don't rely on a .bat to do everything for you.

Then, using source provided from the site you fallowed your dev env setup from, compile their source and test it on hardware.  If it works, then copy over your current main.cpp's and compile again.  If it doesn't work then, you'll know it's your code.  If it does work, then you should be all set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You're not alone... I'm having the same problem. the pre-build DSPaint runs fine (WifiMe and FlashMe), but nothing I've built will run on hardware - but does work on the emu.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the all-in-one dev env package, so I don't think I have the problematic version of ndslib?
<br/>
<br/>
Darkain said that the template doesn't work on hardware, doesn't set VRAM banks up correctly - and it doesn't work in in the latest Dualis (r8), which backs this up.
<br/>
<br/>
So I tried the Mines demo instead, which does work (sort of, doesn't render correctly, but displays some output) in Dualis, but that still white-screens on HW. Tried FlashMe and WifiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
When I build either project, I get at least one 'mv: missing file argument' error, but the files are built (and work in emulators). Is this normal??  The error appears just after the output 'make[1]: Entering directory '/c/ndsdev/projects/template/arm7'. I've not managed to track it down yet, I'm not great with makefiles. And I think I'm going to give up for the night....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I'm not sure what template he's talking about, cause it worked fine for me on hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the mv: command errors, they don't matter.  It's a poor makefile, but works.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason your compilations work on emus and not on hardware is because emus (well, some do, some don't, etc) don't care if you have code missing, like if you forget to turn the display on, etc.  They just display your game.  Well, for some reason, the hardware (yes, I'm being sarcastic!) wants you to turn the screens on before display a background/sprite/etc.  This is just an example, and I'm not talking about any perticular emu.  I use Dualis, and it's getting better with every release!  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you need to figure out what is wrong with your dev env before wasting a lot of time writing a game that no one can play on hardware because your env is making bad builds.  I have something like 15 versions of ndslib and since there isn't a real release, every time you do a CVS update, you have another version of ndslib.  Well, incase the current version breaks my stuff, I keep the previous working version(s) before accepting the current version.  So, untill there is an official release of ndslib, everyone out there coding is using a different version (whatever was current when they pulled it out of CVS), so it makes it hard to troubleshoot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's a bug in ndstool which will be resolved in the next version. You can work around this problem by hex-editing the .bmp and swap the first two bytes, so that the header reads "MB" and not "BM".
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: The icon can only have 16 colors, so it's better to save in 16 color format. Also remember not to use the first color/entry in the palette because that one is reserved for transparancy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I found that I had to save my icon in 256 colours for ndstool to accept it.  it would not accept 16 colour bitmaps.
<br/>
<br/>
But, as FireFly mentioned the icon can only have 16 colours when the DS reads it.  
<br/>
<br/>
So in practice you have to save the picture in 256 colours so ndstool will accept it (as far as I can tell) but only use the first 16 colours or the DS won't display it properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a heads-up in-case anyone else is has similar troubles.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

OH, that's how it's done...you have to use the -c paramter to use the -b one...that makes sense, I was having trouble with this because I assumed since the NDS was already created (except for the icon) it would just add the icon.  Hah, boy do I feel stupid now. :)  By the way, great work on the wireless stuff...I'm so loving that right now.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
