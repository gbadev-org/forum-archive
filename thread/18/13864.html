<br/>
I have some simple C based source that I am porting but am having trouble. I f anyone has some time I can send them original source and my attempts.....
<br/>
<br/>
I think that a bsp viewer will be a good base for an engine for a tomb raider type game.... anyway, any offers, any help?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd like a BSP viewer for DS, seeing as I used to make maps in GTKRadiant for Jedi Academy (Quake 3 engine) all the time, but JKA needs a 500MHz+ CPU and 32MB Required graphics (on the box it says that, but it runs on my old 8MB graphics PC).  But, Quake 2 may be possible, probably maps would have to be simplified to get decent performance.

PM me if you want the source. I am struggling to write the display routines as I don't know if I have them read in correctly to start with!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
