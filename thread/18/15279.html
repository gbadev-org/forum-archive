    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey! i konw that there were many people who asked if you tube is possible on ds and i know that it isnt possible to play a flv but today i found something interesting!! there is a youtube mobile page for mobilephones and all the normal videos are there as 3gp files! i thing that th ds would be able to encode 3gps but i dont have the knowlage how to do this... i only want to inform you about this... perhaps somebody will be able to do this....

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I'd imagine that '3gp' is just a different container format. What does that actually mean for the data? Is it encoded at a lower bitrate? Does the decoding process take more processing power?
<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn't that "it's not possible to play flv files on the DS", it's just that no-one's written a player for whatever reason. There are also likely technical issues which have deterred people from writing said player. If 3gp files have the same technical issues (eg they require loads of CPU time to decode) then being able to get the videos in a different format doesn't really get us anywhere...
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what the difference is between regular YT flv files and these 3gp files?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I saw the specs for the iPhone the other day - it's like ten times faster than the DS! I wouldn't be surprised if it has some kind of hardware codec for this purpose, too.
<br/>
<br/>
@the magnitude: not necessarily. An MPEG-1 stream at 200kbps is far easier to decode than an MPEG-4/AVC stream at 100kbps...
<br/>
<br/>
That said, it could be worthwhile looking into too see if the format is easier to decode. But if it is some kinda MPEG-4 derivative it'll be pretty tough on the ol' CPU :-)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so now i found some things about it:
<br/>
the format is Real Time Streaming Protocol 3GP with H263 AMR i dont know exactly what that means but i also found this side about  h 263 : <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2190" target="_blank">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2190</a>
<br/>
<br/>
a side about 3gp <a href="http://www.3gp.se/" target="_blank">http://www.3gp.se/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
 and this codec i think it would be usefull.... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libavcodec" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libavcodec</a>
<br/>
<br/>
i think it would be possible because the side is not designed for the i phone it's for normal mobile phones...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's h.263 video with amr_nb audio. Apparently people rarely have amr installed and so don't get audio.

Every app I've tried is getting zero data from the stream. I don't have amr, but the video stream should be working. Not sure if it's just not coming off the decoder or what, the error isn't specific enough.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
