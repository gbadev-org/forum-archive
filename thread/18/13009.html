    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well to start the only programming I know is qbasic, and Ti-83+ basic, so theres most likely obvious limitations to my ideas that I don't know about...
<br/>
<br/>
I was curious whether or not it would be possible to compile DS binaries on the DS itself? It might be useful for developers to make quick changes on the go. Obviously the process would be much slower, but is this possible? I'm guessing theres some PC specific compiler that has nothing to do with the DS involved in the process...
<br/>
<br/>
Another idea that is definitely possible is a DLDI patcher on DS. I know you're thinking why not just patch it on your computer right after you download it? The problem is though is that there are multiple patches to try for some cards before you find the right one. Also soon there might be DS web browsers that allow downloads and there is no PC involved at all. (have I heard of someone making an un-zip program that runs on DS?)
<br/>
<br/>
My last idea is a simple one, that if its possible I would like to make it my first DS programming venture. Yes, I've dabbled in C, I just have to look up the syntax frequently. Anyway my idea was for a DS clock-sync program. What I need to know is how to change the clock through libnds and how to make the appropriate request from a time server. (time.windows.com and time.nist.gov are listed in windows...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I doubt you could get GCC to run on a DS (maybe with RAM expansion...), but an assembler would be no problem at all. Heck, you could even do a nice touch screen and/or button interface for picking instructions and registers instead of typing out the names one letter at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
I've always wanted to make a DS game on DS. But you'd really need either one all-powerful IDE, or a multitasking OS to quickly switch between different programs. Restarting every time you want to go tweak a few pixels on a sprite would be painful.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

All of that is currently available in the RAM builds of DSLinux as far as I can tell.  You can use Retawq to download the zipped DS binary to your card (Shift+D downloads from the currently selected link), the built-in "unzip" command to unzip it, and the ported dlditool from <a href="http://www.dslinux.org/index.php?showtopic=2008" target="_blank">http://www.dslinux.org/index.php?showtopic=2008</a> to patch it (put in /linux/usr/bin).  I have done all but the DLDI portion before personally.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this requires a RAM-enabled slot-2 device, since Unzip is only enabled in the RAM builds.  You could probably also use the DLDI version with a compatible slot-1 card and the Opera RAM pack in the bottom slot.  I think the EZ-V slot-2 expansion pack is also supported, but I'm not entirely sure about that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, of course you can't beat a full desktop environment, but if developers wanted to make a few small tweaks or something they could do it on the go (without a laptop)
<br/>
Not that I really think someone <span style="font-style: italic">needs </span>to do this, but I was just curious.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Heh, dantheman posted right before i finished writing this one :P
<br/>
<br/>
I should've thought of DSLinux... kind of a no-brainer to port the desktop linux patcher. But surely a native DS patcher would be cake for an experienced programmer. Heck, it would work perfecftly as a DSO plugin, use the built in file browser and everything...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But compare to the single 96x64 screen and 40-key pad that programmers use to write TI-83 script.

Although the 83 and the like use a series of menus for all the functions, so you don't have to type anything except formulas and such.

*LMAO* good one X^D
<br/>
<br/>
such a "programming" tool would only be useful for some sort of a basic visual (not visual basic ;^p ) scripting language - i think lego mindstorms (?) uses something similar - ontop or based on java afaik.
<br/>
<br/>
you could also have a level editor and stuff, but you would definitely have some waiting time before testing... that's where my &lt;tada!&gt; WAIT GAMES (tm)(r)(c) come in: "play pong/galaga/poker/etc. while waiting for your script to be executable" - just like the old tekken had a load game and... i feel like a weirdo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Me and SausageBoy were working on a TinyCC-arm port.
<br/>
we got it running with decent compiling speed (less then 5 seconds for a nice 100 line sprite example), but some limitations such as porting newlib/libc kept us back... libnds was successfully compiled, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention you need make, some sort of a text editor with syntax highlighting... etc. The plan was to code a DSO plugin to handle .c, .h and .cpp files (.cc, .cxx etc) but since we realized it won't be practical to restart the DS to compile/run /fix cycle, we stopped.
<br/>
<br/>
LUA could be fin if it had an embedded editor.<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.

If your game uses some sort of scripting language for some features, it would be worth adding support for editing them directly on the DS (on the dev builds). And maybe even the ability to use WiFi to update the scripts from a SVN repository.
<br/>
<br/>
It could speed up the development of script-heavy games, like RPGs and adventure games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is DSBASIC, but it doesn't work very well (it is a port of Integer Tiny BASIC, which isn't very powerful, as well as some other problems as well)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you mean DSBASIC, then yes it probably won't work with SCminiSD. And you can program on the DS as well as programming on the computer. But when writing the program in the Nintendo DS you need line numbers. If writing it on the computer and then copying it to Nintendo DS, line numbers are not required.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
