Go <a class="postlink" href="http://teamcrea.free.fr/122354_nintendo/dswifiusbkey_18653_nintendo.htm" target="_blank">here</a> and scroll down.
<br/>
There you will see the USB adapter for those who haven't a combatible wireless router etc.
<br/>
It looks neat.
<br/>
I would post more infos but the website is chinese(?) and balbefish craps up a lot.

It's Japanese. Any time you see curvy characters like
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 20px; line-height: normal">の は を</span>
<br/>
then those are hiragana, a syllabary used mostly for writing the case-endings on Japanese words.
<br/>
<br/>
And any time you see
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 20px; line-height: normal">ニンテンドー</span>
<br/>
that's Ni n te n do : in katakana, a syllabary used to spell foreign words and (when written above kanji) to indicate pronunciation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything above the pic just explains the features of Nintendo DS and recommends leaving a cart in both slots to prevent dust from gumming up the works. Below the pic is in essence "Not compatible with serial port peripherals such as GBA, GBC, GameCube link cables".
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still not sure what "You speak Satoru IWATA concerning this enormous ones" means, especially in light of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22tiny+yellow+balls%22+nintendo+microsoft&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">this</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wait wait wait... Is that a photoshop image or something real?  I was under the impression that these didn't exist, and would probably never exist.  And to [Firefly]... remember April 11th?  Well I was all excited for that day and it turned out to be a hoax.  I hope against hope that this thing is indeed real, because it means that WiFi is that much closer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It looks damn good if it is indeed photoshoped(The little sign on the rightside of that thing looks just too <span style="font-style: italic">real</span>).
<br/>
and why shouldn't Nintendo choose the DS design for this adapter?
<br/>
<br/>
anyways.....if it's fake:sorry for that ;(<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, it basically said that it was totally fake.  Look at you DS and compare.  (L and R buttons, arm neck, etc.).
