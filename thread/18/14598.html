    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been having some trouble with some of the homebrew that I've been developing.. I've just been messing around doing some test programs, which have been turning out well.. .except I can't seem to play them on my actual DS hardware...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently running a PassCard, to the M3 SDmini movie player... The Homebrews run fine on NO$GBA, but they just give a black screen whenever I boot up...
<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions?<br/>_________________<br/>-Theguy</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
