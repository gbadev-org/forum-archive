    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey!
<br/>
<br/>
As you probably know, <a class="postlink" href="http://collinmeyermusic.com/dev/" target="_blank">TheRain</a> and I released a framework for developing DS applications that communicate to music software on the computer via Wifi, using MIDI. The whole thing is called:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://dsmidiwifi.tobw.net" target="_blank">DSMIDIWiFi</a>
<br/>
<br/>
We already provided three basic example apps showing what's possible with the framework. Now it's up to you to write cool MIDI applications using the full potential of the DS to play the synths and twist the knobs, bend the filters, and spin the cubes!
<br/>
<br/>
This thread is intended for any questions, suggestions, bug reports, and of course for showing off your projects!
<br/>
<br/>
Happy hacking!
<br/>
Tob
<br/>
<br/>
Update: Via <a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com/shop/dserial2.php" target="_blank">DSerial</a> you can now connect MIDI devices directly to the DS. The name changed to <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">DSMI</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by 0xtob on Wed Mar 14, 2007 11:28 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Tob, you are the man! I've been following the news posts and your demonstration on YouTube and I'm so happy you managed to release it today! :D
<br/>
<br/>
Using the DS as a controller for my synthesizers will be so much fun! :) But the possibility of having a totally wireless, retro Game Boy sounding MIDI synth module is just the best for me. I hope you, or other developers take this and continue it, add MIDI controllable parameters for the PSG and other cool little features.
<br/>
<br/>
Please, please keep going! This is an amazing breakthrough and you've laid down the groundwork for some seriously fun future applications. Keep it up, and congratulations on your achievement! :D

No doubt I'll be back if I find a problem or get stuck with something. :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally use noteworthy composer. It handles like a freeware program (its simple and has just enough bugs to keep me busy) and doesnt actually cost that much. I prefer the keyboard entry, so I like how it handles sort of like a word processor, like I think a midi sequencer should. Plus, the free version is unlimited except for an easilly avoided limit on saving and printing, and accepts the proper midi input and things. (you can have it echo the midi input without actually inputting the notes I believe. Then to change instruments simply put in a patch change on channel 1, play the staff, and the instrument is changed.)

<br/>
Of course, this works for me and not necessarily anyone else...

Hmm, this is odd because the top screen should be displayed even when there is still no connection. Then, after the timeout is reached, it should say that it could not connect.

<br/>
Been trying to get this running on my DS under Windows XP for a few hours. I've installed LoopBE and run DSWifiMIDI. When I run the apps on my DS I connect very quickly to my router, but no midi data seems to be transferring either way. I've set LoopBE as input and output on both DSWifiMIDI and MidiOX (so I can monitor the midi events) but nothing happens. I've tried a few music apps too, but no difference.
<br/>
<br/>
This may sound like a daft question, but how does the DS app know the IP address of the DSWifiMIDI server? I'm connecting via a wireless router.

<br/>
Have you tested other wifi-enabled homebrew to see if it works in general? libmidiwifi broadcasts the midi packets over the local subnet, i.e. if your DS is 192.168.1.88, then it broadcasts to all computers whose IP is 192.168.1.* So you have to make sure that your PC and DS are in the same subnet. Also make sure the packets are not blocked by a firewall.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've manually set the config to a local address, with correct subnet and gateway in Mario Kart, but maybe there's something else. Does homebrew wifi support WEP?

I described above how to set up instruments in Ableton. Also, Ableton has a really great tutorial that everyone should follow to learn the basics. But on the other hand, maybe Ableton is a little too much if you just want to jam around. I don't know any other windows software that can act as a MIDI synthesizer, but maybe someone else here can give you a hint.

Not at the moment, because I wanted to keep the demo applications really basic because they serve as examples for writing DSMW applications. Could be done in a couple of minutes though.

It's basically just a MIDI out hooked up to the serial line on the slot-1.  No hardware involved, just wires.  See link for schem.  The passme is just a blank pcb I got from someone on here (Thanks whoever you were, can't remember nick, sorry).  If anyone wants one I've got a spare blank to give away in the spirit of paying things forward.
<br/>
<br/>
If you could provide support for this it would be excellent, as like you say, no latency and wifi setup to worry about.  You CAN directly plug into other MIDI IN devices as the line level is pretty similar, you can't use it for RS232 line level as it is much higher (or so I believe).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there, I absolutely love the Kaos DS example.  I already set up my visuals app Isadora to use it.  To go further down that path I've been trying to mess with coding up a specific idea I have using the demo source.
<br/>
<br/>
Normal compiling works fine (mac os x &amp; windows, I'd prefer mac os x) palib stuff compiles fine on windows but not on os x (is palib precompiled, it's kind of unclear and it won't compile for me, appears to fail because of missing wifi), but I have yet to get your example or one other demo that I found that had the separate files for arm7 and arm9 to compile.  Is there something specific to link those arm files, or once they are included should that be it?  Looks like those do get compiled before compiling the main makefile?
<br/>
<br/>
And if it's not clear, I am not a programming wiz-kid, but looking through the examples, especially those using palib, I'm thinking I can get a bunch of this figured out myself over christmas.  Just getting stuck before the compiling step.

Have you tested other wifi-enabled homebrew to see if it works in general? libmidiwifi broadcasts the midi packets over the local subnet, i.e. if your DS is 192.168.1.88, then it broadcasts to all computers whose IP is 192.168.1.* So you have to make sure that your PC and DS are in the same subnet. Also make sure the packets are not blocked by a firewall.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I have a question about the way dsmidiwifi handles broadcast.  Does it refer to the DS' wireless connection settings for the subnet mask, or does it assume 255.255.255.0?  My subnet mask is 255.255.255.240, which would make the broadcast address different.

When you start DSMidiWifi from the Terminal, you should see some output if it's receiving / sending data. My guess would be that there's a communication problem with the computer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Garageband is a good tool to be able to tell if you have midi devices talking in some way.
<br/>
<br/>
Try this:
<br/>
Launch Garageband, then
<br/>
Launch DSMidiWifi
<br/>
if Garageband pops up a message that says another midi device has been plugged in, the DSMidiWifi program is at least talking and sending midi to the system.
<br/>
<br/>
The rest of it would be network settings on the computer and the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you mac is working on the network first.  Then, give your DS a static ip address in the range that your computer has, as well as all of the same router settings.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a great tutorial on getting your Mac connecting to the DS and vice versa:

My computer ip is 192.168.1.106 so I've given my ds 192.168.1.107 when i launch dsmidiwifi then the midi keyboard on my ds it says connecting... then it connects fine (which it failed on until I followed those instructions) but I still have no midi signal in my software. Would using the IPv4 dns addresses from system profiler make a difference? I noticed theres 2 194.168.4.100 and 194.168.8.100 (the second one is the one that came up for SERVER in terminal so is the one i used)
<br/>
<br/>
Tried opening garageband first-no difference, I got no message saying anything bout midi. 
<br/>
<br/>
In Reason-it shows up with a green tick in the preferences for midi devices-which i understand to mean it recognises a midi device, but still no midi signal received.
<br/>
<br/>
Do I have to be connected to the internet(ethernet) in order for it to work? I was for initial setup but didn't think it'd be required for just an airport input to my laptop??
<br/>
<br/>
Could it be my slot-1 device thats causing the issue? has anyone else used the R4DS with dsmidiwifi?

This is seriously frustrating-i'm an experimental musician and what better way of doing it than using my DS?!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just went through the tutorial myself again and had it working after that. Make sure that sharing stays on, i.e. that the Airport icon on the upper left has an arrow in it. To ensure the DS connects to nothing else, delete or rename the other WFC settings in your DS (if present).
<br/>
<br/>
The Mac's firewall could be a problem, especially the option "Block UDP Traffic" in Advanced. Maybe turn the firewall off to see if it works then.
<br/>
<br/>
For testing, I suggest Garageband. With no other Midi apps open, start Garageband and DSMIDIWiFi, and DSMIDIKeyboard on the DS. The order is not important. Garageband does not give much info on MIDI devices, because it just works(TM) when devices are present.
<br/>
<br/>
For the MIDI keyboard in reason , I'd say Midi Keyboard with controls, for kaossds, I'd say midi controller (multichannel).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's cool but playing live with the ds is even more cool!!!

I have DS lite (pink), and so I search for how to use it, but I read that it's more tricky for lite and for flashing compare to old DS. That scared me a bit cause the lite cost 99pound and I don't want to destroy it. On the other hand you don't really speak aubout it for the midi-wifi.
<br/>
When I look for cards I found the M3 Simply (Slot 1) wich is cheaper then the DS-xtrem but you said that you need to install (on the card, I imagine ) a DLDI. Do you have any persons who already use the M3 Simply (Slot 1) and install DLDI and had you application working perfectly ?

I meant sound-card ( or what ever it's called ) of the gameboy when I said synth. It was 3 years ago, so I forgot a bit....

He continue to work on gameboy sometimes, and we worked together and with 2 others artists/programmer on what he called <a class="postlink" href="http://www.abstractmachine.net/blog/?p=12" target="_blank">8=8</a>. It's a interactive table that you control with your hands. (he did all the hard part, I was just invited to created graphism/sound and interface)

Everything work find, except the kaos pad with ableton live. To bad, I have to check that later maybe. You've done a FANTASTIC WORK, really simple to use, I open the midikeyboard on the ds, then the wifimidi server and finally Ableton Live. It just work like a midi keyboard. BRAVO SIR.
<br/>
<br/>
One or two little things about the server wifimidids, the thing you need on you computer. I use WindowsXP and MapleMidi and it work find, small latency by the way (maybe because of my sound-card ).
<br/>
It would be great for the next version, if you do one of course, if you could put something that show that it's receiving a signal, like a fake clipping led or a little bar that goes up and down when you send a midi message with ds.
<br/>
And also maybe something that gives you some info ( note,value,etc). 
<br/>
It's just that when the kaos pad is not working I can't tell if I even receive a midi message or wich note, channel, ctrl number, etc... It used.

BTW it's really cool apps. I used it as a remote controller for video. Changing functionnality with channels. The little improvement for me, can be adding a little dot following the stylus, so you can remember the last place touched.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too am having trouble with Kaos DS using an M3 DS Simply. The other apps work great though, thanks a lot for those!
<br/>
<br/>
When I run the DSMIDIWiFi server through terminal (I'm using OS X), and use something like the MIDI keyboard, I can see all the chatter and inputs coming through. However when I try and use Kaos DS, all I get is a keepalive. No inputs showing. 
<br/>
<br/>
Because the channel won't change in Kaos DS too, it feels like the app has crashed, but what's actually going on? Do people have Kaos DS working with the M3 Simply?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You have to start the DSMIDIWiFi server before you start Quartz.

- It stops working correctly after about 10mn (no midi messages sent anymore, had the same problem with Kaos-DS demo). Maybe a memory problem ? More malloc than free ?
<br/>
- I send a CC (127 when the screen is pressed or held) and 0 when it's released but the release message is not always sent, and It stays at 127 when I release the screen. If anyone has a tip so that it sends the 0 CC everytime I'll be glad to hear it !

That's about it, the lib would be perfect if those problems were fixed !

Tested it everything looks like it is being sent to the dsmidiwifi right.. i.e. the values show up in the terminal. It seem like maybe the airport is blocking traffic going out of it... the firewall is off so it isn't a port issue.. at least in that sense. I'll see what else I can find out.

You probably did a loop within LoopBe : you send the MIDI Out of LoopBe to the MIDI In of LoopBe, so it loops the MIDI info infinitely, and LoopBe locks up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Any help in finding that bug would be appreciated, I have no clue really.

<br/>
richt: That would certainly be possible and not too hard to implement, but it's out of the scope of the demo apps, which are actually only example projects for showing people how to use the library. I'm rather busy with other projects, so:
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here wants to become popular over night and be the superhero of all DS musicians, code a general purpose DS MIDI controller with freely configurable buttons, sliders, wheels and so forth. I actually had plans to start such a project, but I'm lacking time for more projects. So please someone code this! A lot of people would absolutely love such an app!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
First, thanks a bazillion for your efforts. Music apps is one of the main reasons I love the DS sooo much and your contributions have been enormous. I can't thank you enough.
<br/>
<br/>
I can confirm the same issues and it happens with every dsmi _controlled_ app i've used. Once i pass around 5 minutes of wifi/midi use the apps almost always stop responding. This is especially bad with pulseDS because you can hear that the DAC remains on.. which sort of makes it seem like the app or ds itself has hung up. Can't confirm that though. It might be wifi related.. though maybe there is some kind of buffer overrun on the DS itself or something else is goin on here? One of the reasons I'm led to this conclusion is that you dont have to restart DSMI server to fix this, you can leave DSMI open... you've got to restart the actual audio app on the DS... 
<br/>
<br/>
I've had this problem with MonomeDS, PulseDS, and others.. and IIRC.. it happens with MIDI-In to DS use, not sure I've had the same problem with MIDI-Out from the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW.. regarding PulseDS.. just for neatness sakes.. do you think you could add a feature where it shows the waveform playback on the lower screen? That would be purdy. It'd also be awesome if we could control the pulse width (channel #) with the arrow pads or touch screen :) Anyways, I know those are just demos and the code is public so I don't really expect an update on them.. but it'd be cool nevertheless :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's possible my question is a little silly and I'm just not understanding DSMI properly, but I'd like to use my DS in a live performance situation as a MIDI controller. As far as I can understand it, it won't really be possible without a DSerial (which are no longer available) because I need to have a Wireless Router or something to communicate with my computer. In other words, I need to have a wireless network available for this to work - I can't just use the Wireless capabilities of my PC and my DS to communicate directly; I need a device to mediate. Is this correct or am I missing something? Does anyone have any ideas how they'd use DSMI in a live situation if these limitations are correct?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! Yes, you do need either a wireless network or a DSerial for this to work. But for creating a wireless network you don't necessarily need a router, because some wireless cards can pretend to be an access point. For example all Macs create access points when you turn on internet sharing via wifi. On windows you need to check if your wireless card's software has such an option. If not, you could also just bring a router.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm following this thread with passion because I bought my Nintendo DS lite JUST to achieve Midi capabilities and so far I'm quite happy about and can't wait to playing it out live BUT...
<br/>
So far I only achieved to use DSmidiKeyboard / midiJammer and KaosDS (or so I can see midi message coming in Ableton LIVE.)

<br/>
Sadly the one I badly wanted to sync is GlitchDS and just Like MonomeDS it just stuck there.It looks like my DSwifimidi does not receive or send a Clock Midi message.....

<br/>
I don't think it's a wireless problem.

Unfortunately the hardware solution to this seems disappeared as theRain <a href="http://collinmeyermusic.com/dev/index.html/" target="_blank">http://collinmeyermusic.com/dev/index.html/</a> link is dead and even the Dserial USb adapter is gone.

Oh well, there haven't been many reports about this lately, so your case was probably an exception :)

Thank you, I'm actually in touch with the developer,I'm sure there is something missing in my picture and I hope to find a way out of NOT receiving midi messages.BTW I tested out a couple more of Midi app like Nitrotracker and this also sending midi notes but not receiving. I will change modem router tomorrow even If an Internet connection is not necessary in order to connect NinDS to a PC via Wifi adapter (my one is a Ralink).

<br/>
the CPLDstarter is indeed a very good news for anyone like me hungry to sync the DS proper with their best Host application.

Yes, you do need either a wireless network or a DSerial for this to work. But for creating a wireless network you don't necessarily need a router, because some wireless cards can pretend to be an access point. For example all Macs create access points when you turn on internet sharing via wifi. On windows you need to check if your wireless card's software has such an option. If not, you could also just bring a router.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I know you replied to this ages ago, but I completely forgot about it, got busy with other things, and have only now just come back to it. Thanks for your assistance. I've tried to see if my card can act as an access point. It's an Intel 4965AGN Wi-Fi card. I tried setting up an ad-hoc network for the DS to connect to but I consistently get a connection error from the DS. Am I on the right track with this? I read somewhere that the DS won't work with ad-hoc networks, but this was in relation to connecting to the internet through the ad-hoc connection, and I'm just looking to hook my computer up with the DS so I can use DSMI without a router on stage. If anyone has any advice for me, it would be amazing! Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DSMI requires an access point, ie. something that looks like a wireless router to it. An ad-hoc network does not work unfortunately. If it isn't possible to use the Intel card as an access point, you could get an RT2500 based card which I'm pretty sure can be used as an AP.

Thanks for the reply! Yeah, I have the card in a Dell notebook, so it might be tricky to get another card, but fingers crossed this one can work as access point under XP. I'll keep looking into it (until I get totally disillusioned!). In the meantime, if you have any luck with yours, please let me know. It would be really appreciated.

<br/>
<br/>
Back a couple years ago when I first got my DSerial2,
<br/>
<br/>
I was very dissappointed to find that none of the sequencer apps around actually supported midi out via dserial2.
<br/>
<br/>
Well DStar claimed to, but it never worked.
<br/>
<br/>
I did manage to get the keyboard and xy pad apps working, but main interest was in sequencing on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've just been checking up and it seems alot of improvements have been made.. I'm considering re-buying a nintendo DS (still have my DSerial, flash cart, etc)

I just want to know - are there sequencer apps that will send midi out via DSerial now?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It worked before. I know how to set things up :) 
<br/>
<br/>
Previously I was using an iMac connected to the internet with a network cable and everything worked like a charm. But this summer I traded the iMac for a Macbook Pro and switched to a wireless internet connection and Im using Airport now for internet. With this new setup, I cant connect the Nintendo DS to the Macbook anymore.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is greatly appreciated, because I love all the DS MIDI apps. I was heavily using them, but I have moved to another house and these dudes only have wireless internet. I would also like to use DSMIDIWIFI anywere I go, without having to connect a network cable to a router.. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> Glad you got it working. DSMI doesn't require an internet connection, so it should really work without any cable in the router other than power.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're on a mac, there's an easy hack to get rid of the router: Go to System Preferences, Sharing and enable Internet Sharing. This will turn your mac into a wireless router. Use a Wifi-enabled game to set up this connection and start jamming with DSMI.

<br/>
Some midi messages are "skipped" : sometimes, the note off is not sent when i release the stylus, resulting in a stuck note. Where does it come from ? 
<br/>
If it comes from the DS, is there a way to "synchronise" the infinite loop in a way that all the midi messages get sent ?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> This is because DSMI uses UDP, which is inherently a lossy protocol. The advantage of UDP is the ease of setup (as in: no setup) and very low latency. Unfortunately you'll have to live with the packet loss. A workaround for note-offs is to send them several times in a row.
<br/>
<br/>
readysetgo, Ben_j: If you're on a Mac you might want to use the trick I mentioned above. If not you'll have to bring a router. As I said internet connection is not required, just a wireless network. I think there's also some wireless cards on Windows that can be turned into a wireless router.

<br/>
    * DSMI Server for OSX v1.02 - Fixes compatibility problems with Snow Leopard.
<br/>
    * libdsmi for DS v3.1 - Important bugfix: Re-enables sending of beacons (necessary for DS apps that receive MIDI)
<br/>
    * pulseDS v1.6, kaosDS v1.5, DS MIDI Keyboard v1.5, OSC Example v1.2 - PulseDS is now finally working again (tested!) The problem was that I accidentally disabled sending of beacons, so the server didn't know which IPs to send MIDI messages to. Sorry about that!
<br/>
<br/>
      All example apps are now compatible with libnds 1.4.3 and devkitARM r30 (latest versions as of April 2010) and have been updated to the latest devkitpro nds templates. KaosDS, DS MIDI Keyboard and the OSC Example now use the default ARM7 binary, which means they are much less code now. Thanks to Wintermute who kindly provided patches to libdsmi and the OSC Example!

Greetings, I am a new user to DSMI and just downloaded and installed the program on my Titanium PowerBook G4 running OSX 10.5.8. My wireless router does work as a nintendo wifi compatible device, it works with mario kart, et al and my DS has been properly set up to use it.

is there a step by step instruction page for using DSMI this with an airport card and a wireless router?  everything I read says it should be plug and play but DSMI keeps crashing once the connection between the DS and the laptop is made</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#174917 - lggemini - Tue Aug 03, 2010 6:26 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can confirm the problem referred by originalblat.
<br/>
I tried both Cubase 5 and Nuendo 5 and I get always the same results.
<br/>
<br/>
The events are recorded but it seems that Cubase/Nuendo cannot manage their "timestamp". Every event is recorded at the very beginning of the timeline, regardless of the actual time they are sent.
<br/>
All the CC are recorded as if they were a tick before 0:00:00:00. All the Notes are recorded as if they were all at the beginning of the recording part.
<br/>
After the recording, opening the part where you have recorded, you can select all of them (CMD+A) and notice that they have been recorded, but all in the same time, just before the beginning of the timeline.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe there is some kind of problems with the timestamp of the events.
<br/>
It could be an incompatibility problem between the way Cubase and Nuendo manage the incoming MIDI data and the way DS MIDI Wifi sends it.
<br/>
<br/>
Amongst the several MIDI interface I have in my system, DS MIDI Wifi is the only one resulting in this problem with Cubase and Nuendo.
<br/>
I'm starting a project for iPhone/iPad but unfortunately this issue makes it useless.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#174918 - lggemini - Tue Aug 03, 2010 7:37 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just completed an experiment in Nuendo.
<br/>
<br/>
I started recording at bar 1.1.1.0 and I simultaneously recorded some notes using my MIDI keyboard and some controllers (CC1) using a sample iPhone application through DS MIDI Wifi.
<br/>
<br/>
When I opened the part in the KeyEditor I could see the note. The controller was there as well, but grayed out (this is the way Cubase or Nuendo show you a controller which is actually in the track but outside the current part region). So I selected all the events (CMD+A) and I moved them further to see when the controller became visible. The time difference between the notes and the controller is about 3500 bars at 120 bpm (!!!). This means that while the notes were right in time during recording, the controller played simultaneously were recorded 3500 bars in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
I definitely think that there is something wrong in the way DS MIDI Wifi manage the timestamp of the events or in the way Cubase or Nuendo interpret the MIDI events sent by DS MIDI Wifi. But you have to consider that I'm experiencing this strange issue only with DS MIDI Wifi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In the README.txt file there is a passage that says:

<br/>
  Normally, the server should just work(TM). You don't

  need to configure anything.
<br/>
<br/>
  However, if there are problems, you can start the

  DSMIDIWiFi Server from the command line. Then, <span style="font-weight: bold">you

How did he destroy the DS? What do you mean "only if you know what you're doing" -- the directions are super simple, there's nothing complex about them whatsoever. So more information would be helpful here, a warning without any information to justify it is not really helpful and just makes me paranoid!
<br/>
<br/>
 I've already built mine. It works fine with DStep. It doesn't really have any practical application since DStep is so limited and I guess there's nothing else out there it will work with as yet.
<br/>
<br/>
It was extremely easy to build. There should be more homebrew written to take advantage of it (support by DSMI would be awesome of course!), unless there is some system-killing risk even when the simple directions are followed correctly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm back on track on MidiControl DS, and was thinking of adding tempo sync to the soft. Is this possible ? I've looked on google and found that Midi Sync messages were FA (Start), FB (Continue), FC (Stop), F8 (Timing Clock). Now when are these sent ? What makes the "tick", and at what rate ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm trying to set up my ds to control resolume.
<br/>
I'm running on windows 7.
<br/>
I downloaded the dsmidiwifi-v1.01 and loopbe1
<br/>
On the pc i have everything working fine, i guess, the dsmidi server works it also sees the loopbe in/out, also all the resolume catches the midi server so no problems at this end.
<br/>
<br/>
After this i put the MidiControl DS on my ds lite. Setted up the wireless (??)
<br/>
for my acces point that i use for my internet and my pc(laptop) is also connected to it untill now the application on the ds stays on connecting... 
<br/>
I thinked that i should make Ad-hoc server from my laptop, so i did that but my ds doesn't want to take the connection it gives the 53100 error.
<br/>
<br/>
So anyone can help me with a guide on how to set up the wireless conections between the laptop and the nitendo ds? 
<br/>
Please....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, i used profesor layton and downloaded the weekly puzzles :))
<br/>
but not for ad-hoc connection, i also tryed to connect to a different router without internet and it rejects the connection, also i've made manual settings (for this i used a second laptop to get the ip's from the router and added on my nitendo ds,and i disconnected the other laptop from wich i took the ip's) and had no success
<br/>
<br/>
*update
<br/>
<br/>
Fixed, the MidiControlDS v2 is the problem, nitro tracker works wonderfull, not exactly what i need but helped me to find the problem :D.
<br/>
I'll search a fix for this.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks anyway, i'll get back if i'm getting stuck again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Update number 2
<br/>
<br/>
I found at least 6 other persons who had the same problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I still haven't had time to look up this problem. A few people seem to have problems with some flashcards. What flashcard do you use ?
<br/>
<br/>
I'll send you a pm asking for more detailed informations.
<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, I just finished porting DSMI to Windows Phone. I noticed the lack of midi controller software on Windows Phone and decided I should do something :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
