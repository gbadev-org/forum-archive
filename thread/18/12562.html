    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you can't find it, I believe the entire firmware image is contained inside the flashme.nds, so it's just a matter of extracting it out using a hexeditor or dd or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I remember correctly, someone did that (extracted from flashme.nds), and it didn't really work right. I would recommend that you get the actual dump from someone. Oh, is your DS a lite or normal?<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think you can just flash either a dump or the image extracted from flashme.nds.
<br/>
<br/>
There are some settings contained in the firmware - MAC address and WFC data for instance. These need preserved.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it'd work assuming they're both the same model (some Lites have different wifi hardware), but he'd have all your settings and MAC address. This means, among other things, you both get the same NWFC ID, which would cause bad things.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But even PPFlash method only wrote the FlashMe recovery code, you still had to run FlashMe from the slot-2 media to finish writing your firmware, correct?
<br/>
<br/>
And why would you want to cut a trace, solder wires, remove wires, solder trace if you could just flash the chip?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">PPFlash writes whatever you throw at it. If someone gave this guy a dump of flashme'd firmware, that would end up on his DS. I think ppflash does try to keep the mac address though.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
