    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sometimes when drawing something on the touchscreen the first time you touch the screen it registers the touch in a completely different location, then goes to where you have the pen located on the screen resulting in a line between where you actually touched it and where the touchscreen thought you touched it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm no programmer so I'm not sure if my idea is actually possible.....
<br/>
<br/>
What if a program was made so that the first 1 or 2 milliseconds (or however long it takes) that you're touching the screen it won't accept any input. Then, when the touchscreen is reporting the correct position again, the program starts receiving the touchscreen input.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would this be possible?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just wrote a quick game the other night to test my touchscreen code, and it seems(at least on my ds) that random popping touchscreen readings happen constantly with light touches, a heavy touch is generally accurate... but of course on the way to a heavy touch a light touch sometimes happens and gives me bad results.

<br/>
There have been a few discussions on this board about the subject, I was just about to go read them, I suggest you do the same, other people have definitely found work arounds for this problem.
