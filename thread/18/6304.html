    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I made some tech demos for my video codec for the DS. I just tought you may find interesting to give them a try:
<br/>
You can grab them from the download section of the website:
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The touchpad allows you to move through the movies.
<br/>
Also please note that thedemos don't run with any emulator, I've tried them only on the neoflash.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tonysavon on Thu Jul 14, 2005 6:59 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Alas I'm not allowed to give it for free. Even if I made it, it belongs to my company (and I'm not the only member of the company). I always have two projects going on: the video codec which is not free and makes me "eat" (if you allow me this term :-) ), and the Jpeg Viewer ( <a href="http://www.caimans.net/gba" target="_blank">www.caimans.net/gba</a> ) which is free and is my really little contribution to the comunity. 
<br/>
Since is the one and only Dovoto asking, and since I feel I have learned a lot (not to say ALL) from you, if you ever think to make a game and you need video compression ... well, I'm not writing it here expiclitly... but you may guess ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Looks great, are you able to get in to span both screens???

( to get videos like in metroid hunters )

<br/>
based on the file size on these demos,  it was about 1.64MB/min 
<br/>

When videos are converted, what is it converted to???

NDS or some other file?

They use cart space (0x800000) to store the video info, so they cannot stay in DS'ram space and so they won't work with WiFi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">after posting my question I checked back and forth a few times between the two and here's what I think ( If anyone even gives a flying kahoot)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. DS version uses more of the screen ( possible FULL screen if it wasnt in 16:9 mode )
<br/>
<br/>
2. better controls being able to touch the screen for the location of the movie ( touch left side go to begining, touch middle.... and so on )
<br/>
<br/>
3.sound, tough to compare but seems like it is more crisp in the DS version, could just be me
<br/>
<br/>
I still want to see video spanned across both screens<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by lambi1982 on Mon Jul 18, 2005 3:10 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think what he was saying, is that normal videos would not work well with two screen playback. Can you imagine watching a movie with a huge gap down the middle? It just wouldn't work. For custom things that are designed around it, like the metroid intro videos, it does work, but the video has to be made specifically to take into account the two screens and the gap between them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA and GBA SP internal speakers are mono. Nintendo DS internal speakers are stereo. True, the sound wouldn't need to be duplicated if the port already takes joint stereo into account.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
