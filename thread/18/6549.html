" Just figure out the damn code" im sorry, I know this line was in some movie i just cant remember which one.... 
<br/>
<br/>
LOL, thats like adding an engine to your car just because you dont have a key. 
<br/>
<br/>
that would be great though, A DS with a PassME--&gt; serial port ---&gt;SD port----&gt; wifi card....  great so I can go to a freakin Starbucks or whatever hotspot..(Airport) pull out my DS and get shot..
<br/>
<br/>
CAUSE THEY WOULD THINK I HAD A BOMB

All cause I couldnt wait for the damn code ;)

Definitely ;)

DS EEPROM uses SPI which SD cards support. SD can be connected directly to matching lines without any electronics.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True, all SD memory cards support SPI, but SD memory cards also support several proprietary protocols. Do SDIO cards such as this 802.11b card support SPI as well as the proprietary protocols?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I was mainly talking about memory cards... but SPI is mandatory for SDIO:

DS card IRQ line can be used for SDIO interrupt.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was just a development cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no extra hardware needed to make the DS connect with a WiFi AP. It is WiFi-capable out of the box.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
