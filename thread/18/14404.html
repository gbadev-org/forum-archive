    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all
<br/>
I have a problem running a GBA pong game I made on my DS hardware (it does run in emulators on my pc though).
<br/>
The problem is that when the GBA mode starts and there is the GBA logo, instead of the "NINTENDO" small logo that's supposed to be showing below the GBA logo, I get a line with weird signals and then the DS freezes and the only option there is to do is to turn the DS off and restart it.
<br/>
<br/>
I figured the problem is either a CRC check or my game's header that are wrong but I don't know what the exact problem is and how to fix it...
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for helping ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
