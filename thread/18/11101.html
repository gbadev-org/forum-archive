<br/>
<br/>
Im busy with building a web browser.
<br/>
<br/>
I just tried out Retawq on dslinux, this one is realy cool, and fast :)
<br/>
<br/>
But i'm using PaLib for building the browser, but when i try to download some text from a page it takes very very long.
<br/>
<br/>
It takes about 20 seconds to load 40 characters???
<br/>
<br/>
I also tried the demo from the wifi lib and this one seems to be much faster.
<br/>
<br/>
Am i doing something wrong with Palib, or is it just PaLib wich makes the transfers slow?
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would help if you showed us some code and perhaps find out where the code is hanging the most in those 20 seconds.

Also, please keep in mind that the PALib forum is probably a better place to ask, since most people here don't use it, in my humble experience.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
WAY TO GO !
<br/>
<br/>
Uhm: BTW: Will your Webbrowser supporting only Text (like retawq) or will it be able to:
<br/>
<br/>
- Display images
<br/>
- Display text
<br/>
- Download stuff (maybe even from Rapidshare like sites ;)   )
<br/>
- ( I don't think this one is possible, but I ask anyway) playing swf's 
<br/>
- Playing mp3's 
<br/>
<br/>
I think these things would reach ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Do you use FAT for storing the Website (the files from the Website) in the Card, maybe a specific Folder ?
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you keep up this:

For what it's worth, I've had problems with slow network connections before on the DS, but not THAT slow. I would suggest building a simple non-palib app which just downloads the pages, and test the speed on that.

its tempting, but i have enough on my plate right now.  I have my tyrian project as well as working with engine its based on.  After thats done i intend to work on wifi multiplayer and create a lobby system.  Creating a text based web browser in palib would be reletively easy but messing around with using extended memory in the supercard/m3 is probably out of my league at this point.

Opera DS works really well in text-only mode. It loads pages fast and maintains their visual layout perfectly in most cases.
<br/>
<br/>
Switch on image loading, however, and page loading and navigation takes a huge speed hit.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the basic truth is that the NDS doesn't doesn't pack to punch to run the Opera layout engine with all the bells and whistles...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI guys i was looking at my email and saw a mail from pascal :)
<br/>
<br/>
About the webbrowser, my idea was very simple because a sample code of PALIB already downloads http code.
<br/>
<br/>
So i put in the graffity keyboard to enter an url, and then palib downloads the inputted url( by graffity keyboard)
<br/>
<br/>
It was very easy to build this step, but the download speed was very slow.
<br/>
<br/>
I build a php page with my name on it this was the code:
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;html&gt;
<br/>
&lt;body&gt;
<br/>
&lt;b&gt;chris&lt;/b&gt;
<br/>
&lt;/body&gt;
<br/>
&lt;/html&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My idea was to replace html command, so a code to check if there is &lt;b&gt; in front and &lt;/b&gt; in the end of the sentence , my code must show bold code.
<br/>
I also wanted to do this with tables, so &lt;table&gt; must start a table and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
But it takes very very long to download it. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So i had given up because real c++ programming is very very difficult for me.
<br/>
But i downloaded a lot of tutorials and printed them, so i read for about a week.
<br/>
I can programming c++ but not with pointers and things like that, so i wanted to learn advanced c++
<br/>
<br/>
But then i thought there are always people better then me (sgstair), so they must make a webbrowser, because i think if your expirenced c++, and knowing wifi like sgstair, he can build a webbrowser very quick.
<br/>
<br/>
So i have give up, because c++ is not realy my style (i think), im busy with c++ for couple of years now.
<br/>
But not a full year learning, somethimes i want to programming something and then starting over again learning c++.
<br/>
Then im getting boared and stop learning c++.
<br/>
<br/>
So maybe there comes a time im trying to make a webbrowser again, but when its that time, there will be more webbrowsers already published :)
<br/>
<br/>
