    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, I'm having trouble deciding which format to use for music. I'm using libmikmod but any Impulse Tracker module I make doesn't sound right (I've got it saved in the right format but it still seems to cut off notes instead of holding them). Thing is most people seem to use IT, and I can't get XM working at all. S3M doesn't have instruments which doesn't help for instruments that use many samples so what do you guys use?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im working on a player, it supports IT fully (to the DS's capability), so you can use those new note actions without trouble. its almost complete and should be available soon. its also backwards compatible with xm, s3m, and mod</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds great looking forward to that! Hows the processing, is it all ARM7 fed by the ARM9? What about number of channels and effects, and multiple file playback?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">right now its all on arm7 (but im gonna make that switchable), it uses about 4-5% cpu for 16 channel processing. it supports everything that doesn't interfere with ds hardware (certain effects cant be done like S91 (surround), S9F (play backwards))...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
