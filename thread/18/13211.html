<br/>
Anyway, dev-cpp should be possible although there was no simple way to integrate it last i tried it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are on windows and using anything other than MS VC as an ide for c/c++ code then i think you are neglecting the best option.  (Feel free to flame me by pointing out something better...i am allways on the look out for new tools).<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

please note: i'm not targeting people from countries where it simply "isn't possible" (simplified that a lot) to buy original copies of *anything* - so you guys, don't feel offended. (e.g. unreal 2 came out in some countries for under 5 usd, just to make ppl buy the original instead of the slightly more expensive pirated copies [sometimes just betas]. i even read an article in a gaming magazine where a boy bought warcraft 4, that was *A YEAR AGO*. i still don't see a warcraft 4 around anywhere... i bet they even have killzone 2 over there &lt;lol&gt;).

i'm asking myself who doesn't have a legit copy of win? (software pirates maybe?) it comes with about every pc you buy (except those you assemble yourself and the budget systems that don't come with any os or some [free distribution of] linux). it's not like &lt;90 euros would be much... and don't tell me you *need* (like a liver or brain or something) xp professional. even then it's just like 20 euro more. come on - you use something, you buy it (if it's not free anyway)! you won't get arrested for buying windows. i bet even most of your linux/bsd/unix/solaris friends have a legit copy of win (bought with a pc). you know, for "games" and stuff. ;^P

&lt;lol&gt; yes. although we were talking about PCs (or at least i was) and i guess there is no visual studio for mac os... ;^) well, now that macs are intel based... you'd still need a copy of windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

IMHO, that's a pretty dense statement. Here in the third world, paying for windows is an extravagance ones workplace can likely afford but the individual consumer less so.
<br/>
<br/>
Never mind the fact that many store-bought PCs here in the third world come with pirated versions of windows pre-installed.

man, like tepples said (thank you.), i have made clear that i don't intend to attack any 3rd world / poor countries where ppl have other fears than weather they buy windows or not... so much for that. read better.

My bad...

<br/>
Well, anyway, things in SA aren't as bad as Somalia, for sure. Hopefully it will remain that way. Nevertheless, we do have some pretty significant problems in this country and it's nothing like the UK down here :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, speaking truthfully, there is a strong culture of software piracy in South Africa ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
