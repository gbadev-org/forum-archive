    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
I'm using oamAllocateGfx() to allocate VRAM for my sprites, but I have a problem: It's always returning the same memory location. It's not too difficult to figure out the next address to use to offset from that location, but it seems like the function should take care of itself.
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that the allocation test example uses this function without resorting to adding an offset, so I'm rather confused about this. I'm doing the same sort of video setup...
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas?
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by RyanFox on Sun Apr 19, 2009 7:58 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
