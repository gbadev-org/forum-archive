Google doesn't seem very helpful on such things.

It seems the game title at least is in unicode, can anyone know any usefull links for dealing with this, I know nothing about it.
<br/>
<br/>
reading two bytes into a single 16bit number seems to work when converting direct to ascii but sine if the codes are still different.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

You can start at <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16/UCS-2" target="_blank">UTF-16 on Wikipedia</a>. Off and on, I'm working on a library to handle UTF-8 and a few other encodings of Unicode so that I can display more than one game's "table" (proprietary character encoding) in a single program designed for trading items between saved games of different games (e.g. trade items between Pok?mon and Animal Crossing).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
