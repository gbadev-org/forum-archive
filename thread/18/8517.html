I have found this table in the Wiki for the modes:

I am not sure to have well understood, will this table say that we have from (0x06060000-0x06000000) bytes for the graphics of tiles ? then it does 6144 tiles 8X8 ? it seems to be too much, I think that I don't have well understood this table. Can someone explain me my error ? 
<br/>
<br/>
will this table also say that we have 2048 tiles 8x8 for sprites ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If i am right, it will say that by screen we have 0x60000 memory for tiles, thus if does also 393216 bytes. 393216/256/192 = 8 screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I does for each screen a memory for tiles of +/- 8 screens height. If I wonder if I am right it is because in GBA the memory for tiles was only a little bigger of the screen resolution,... and now we have memory for tiles of the background 8 times bigger for each screen,...
<br/>
<br/>
Someone can say If I have well understood the table ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure what that means, but the important part is it's 128KB. Each screen is 256x192, and you'd generally use 16-bit colour, so 256x192x2 = 98,304 bytes (96K). So you have enough space for about 1 1/4 screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am wondering how much video memory I have to store the graphics for the background tiles for each screen.

Our first idea was to use 256 colours for the graphic of tiles, but I have just read about extended palette. Your calculation is for tiles mode or framebuffer mode ? 
<br/>
<br/>
Are the 128K available also if I use sprites or is the sprite memory shared in the 128K ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't used sprites, but I'm pretty sure it's shared among whatever you're using it for.
<br/>
If you use 256 colours, then you only need 48K for the screen, so you can store about 2 1/2 screens. This doesn't account for the palette and any sprites you want to use, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Really I've only worked with a single 16-bit mode 5 background, since that's been all I've needed so far. I'll probably want to start using other things soon though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have only worked with tiles (ongba), never with framebuffer, 
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen in the ndslib reference that we can address 9 banks, when you tell me about 128k, is it for one bank ? because if it is I should can use maybe two banks for backgrounds for each screen. then one by screen for sprites, and I have then three remaining bank for the map and maybe extended palettes. What do you think about that ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If I find something about what you want to do or the response to my problem I will send a post, I will try some tests this WE.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
