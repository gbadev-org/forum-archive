    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all, I hope this is the right place to put this.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone could tell me what each of the 7 strips in the gbasp and nds power plug do. I know the bottom outside two are power in (and the bottom inside two must be power out, i put a led to it and the speaker buzzed and the led came on)... but what are the top 3? I would assume some sort of sound but i couldn't get them to run a speaker. Please help and thanx  -Leif902 (YAHOO PASSME IS A SUCCESS!)
