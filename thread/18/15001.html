It's really straightforward, actually. It requires some guesswork, but thanks to color-coding, you can catch on fast without knowing any Japanese (me). It works a lot like Brain Age. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, until someone can find out how to make code compatible with the camera, we're not going anywhere with this idea.
<br/>
<br/>
I remember fondly of a person who made his own (primitive) DS camera, and he released the source code. But, it was a slot-1 camera and I highly doubt the code works with the Slot-2 camera. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an interesting discovery!!
<br/>
<br/>
I was playing the Face Training game, and at the startup screen, it has a logo/company name for the company that was used by Nintendo to make the camera/engine. They're called Oki. I googled the company, and found their site. They have ARM development kits/boards, apparently. And as we all know.... :D
<br/>
<br/>
This could be a very exciting discovery. It probably costs money to buy the board/kit whatever, but this is pretty neat. I'll look into it more.
<br/>

I'd love to be apart of it, although I don't have the diligence to continue my C++ studies... :( I really need to get on it, though. Plus we'll have to better understand how ARM works and stuff...
<br/>
<br/>
This could be fun. :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
