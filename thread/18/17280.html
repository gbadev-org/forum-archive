<br/>
So I'm just making my converter as best as I can before FINALLY adding support for libnds by making use of sub-functions rather than calling the actual thing [like FIFO/IRQ stuff] and, while my samples sound OK at the moment with ADPCM [first sample = 0, first index = 0], they do tend to get a fair amount of noise. I noticed that commercial games [which appear to have less noise] tend to have start sample values and start index values that are not 0 which is the case with most homebrew audio so... Does anyone know how to calculate an optimum sample start + index values?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
