    <h4>#132865 - JeffMan - Sat Jun 30, 2007 7:03 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In a Windows C app, I would usually do printf("\b ") to backspace the last-printed character in a console. But when I try this for the DS, it not only backspaces the last-printed character, but it then prints a stupid weird character after it. So if the letter "U" was printed to the console, for instance, and then I printf("\b "), I would end up with " ◘" or something. Are there any other ways to backspace a character besides having to clear the whole screen first and reprint everything?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What you want is, as tepples says, the escape sequences:

printf("\x1B[1D"); - move left one character
<br/>
printf("\x1B[32D"); - move left to start of line

    <h4>#133571 - StoneCypher - Sat Jul 07, 2007 4:04 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wrote the correct process below, but it seems overly complex if you think you can get it done with a control character or a VT sequence (they're not called ANSI sequences, kids.)
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if Tepples knew what he was talking about, he'd know that control character behavior is non-portable.   
<br/>
<br/>
For example, printf('\r') will give you a weird character on pre-unix MacOS, QNX, all Commodores, PalmOS, Apple ][ and GEOS, which only respond to \n.
<br/>
<br/>
What it'll do on a DOS machine, which only responds to \r\n in pairs, varies according to the version of the ANSI driver loaded.  
<br/>
<br/>
A blank \R will be ignored on all DOS-core versions of Windows, but will be treated differently in NT-core according to which kind of console you're using.  If it's the kind of console you get from AllocConsole, you'll get UNIX behavior; if it's a .NET console, you'll just get the special character (as, in fact, will happen with \r\n or \n, too.)
<br/>
<br/>
QMail will silently discard email that just uses \r, much to the consternation of people like you, who think that QMail is in error, since the email specification only says line feed, and none of you have any clue about network dependency standards.
<br/>
<br/>
On EBCDIC machines, it's NEL, or 0x15.  AIX still uses this convention today, as the only major OS which still knows what EBCDIC is.  NOS used a nulled 6-bit-char word (24 bits total).  VMS and OpenVMS today use segments, and and so line termination is just the end of the database record.  OpenVMS can automatically append any character you want as a record terminator.
<br/>
<br/>
Unicode has seven different kinds of newline, and in unicode, \r doesn't mean the same thing as \n, neither of which mean the same thing as \r\n.
<br/>
<br/>
Most vector machines don't respond to any of \r, \n or \r\n, instead responding *only* to the actual portable things that Tepples thinks he knows but doesn't, such as std::endl (C has no portable line feed.)
<br/>
<br/>
Repeat with me: "control characters are platform specific.  DevKitPro can do whatever the hell it wants, and it's correct."
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples, as usual, is absolutely clueless.
<br/>
<br/>
On to another topic: you need to be careful when using VT sequences to implement backspace, because the VT sequence isn't actually backspace, it's cursor left.  This becomes important when you have multi-line input and when the cursor is at the left edge; a left cursor movement will go nowhere.  Also, please remember that left cursor doesn't actually change anything other than position; you need to move back, then output a space to 'erase' the character that's there, then move back a second time.
<br/>
<br/>
The process spelled out:
<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to first check if you're at left edge, and if you are, you'll need to check if you're at screen top.  
<br/>
<br/>
If you're at screen left and top, unless you're implementing console scrolling (which is harder than it should be,) then just do nothing.  
<br/>
<br/>
If you're at screen left but not at screen top, go up a line and to the right edge, write a space, which will put you back to the beginning of the lower line where you were, and so you go up and to the right edge *again*, and you're good.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're not at screen left, just go left, space, left and you're kosher.
<br/>
<br/>
Done with process.
<br/>
<br/>
By the by, if you're implementing scrolling in a system with VT code support, you're in for a special kind of hell, and I'm walking the other way.

Tepples, read a fucking book already.  I've never seen you give good advice.  Before you open your hole about line feeds again, at least read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline</a> .  It may not be comprehensive, but at least it'll get you some basic functional clue.<br/>_________________<br/>Quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum Sonatur

None of these characters have portable behavior even across the big three user platforms.  Stop trying to implement them; you've got VT codes, which are far superior.<br/>_________________<br/>Quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum Sonatur

Jesus, you can't even write this stuff.  No, douche, text mode means that the control characters are interpreted at all, as opposed to binary mode, where all of this goes away.

First off, VT100 and VT220 don't have bel.  I know, you want to read the internet and repeat what you read, because you think it makes you smart; it doesn't.  VT100 and VT220 are <span style="font-weight: bold">extension character sets</span>.  BEL comes from VT52.
<br/>
<br/>
Second off, Apple ][ didn't have noise or flash support on 0x07.  So, your little tirade about these backwater platforms that you've never even used (you don't even know what a 220 looks like, and I'd be willing to bet you didn't even know there was such a thing as a VT220 physical object) is faulty from the get go: you're listing platforms that, once again, <span style="font-weight: bold">do different things</span>.  There is no interpretation of BEL that does the same thing across all those platforms.  
<br/>
<br/>
Third off, BEL is disabled by default in VT52.  As such, on the VT100 and VT220, you would not actually have heard anything unless you had issued about a half dozen other commands first.  This is primarily hilarious because once again you're caught not knowing what the hell you're talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth off, you can't implement BEL on a platform with sound card channel requirements unless you think your printf should be <span style="font-style: italic">overriding the fucking music engine</span>, which is possibly the least intelligent available behavior.  For someone bitching about pissing users off and driving users away, you sure don't think much about their actual needs.  They seem more to be an excuse for you to condescend to others (which is likely convenient because you can't do it on grounds of your skill, your donations to the community, your understanding of the language or the size of any of your projects.)

stdout is a FILE*, and ordinarily, a FILE* for output can be opened in "w" or "wb" mode. Therefore, either a FILE* or a file descriptor has what is commonly called a "binary mode".

I seem to remember using a Digital VT-something connected to a microVAX running VMS for a computer science class at South Side High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana. It was nine years ago, so I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was definitely of the VT100 family terminals, and yes it did have a beep (which could be turned off).

What disqualifies your afternoon project from making you a game developer?  Probably the same thing that makes people who write pong ineligible for million dollar publishing budgets: the fact that your work barely qualifies as a mediocre tech demo.

Easy. Tepples is one of the most helpful people I've seen at message boards when it comes to hints, tips, help and/or feedback.
<br/>
I have no clue why this topic got so immature all of a sudden. It's like I missed thousands of threads preluding to this... it's sad stuff. Grow up.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, StoneCypher, you should be ashamed of yourself.
<br/>
One, for putting down other people's work because you think that you and your own work are superior.
<br/>
And two, for claiming you are bashing tepples and his work for the reason he was bashing another person and his work.

His name is StoneCypher and his hobby is bullying.  He is 42 years old and is a parasite.  Someone else pays for his food &amp; rent.  He has no man-friends and no girl-friends.

Unless tepples says otherwise, he was not crying about the inconsisancy. Whether he was right or wrong I do not know, I haven't the knowledge. What good projects are out there that don't let you report bugs or inconsistencies? Tepples language in that post was anything but inflaming or demeaning.

Just like my comment on the first sentence, he didn't use language that was derogatory towards any person, or their work. He has never, to my experience, proclaimed he had superior work.

You're right, I have released no code for the DS, GBA, or PC alike that I can submit as a benefit to the community. But if everyone who joins the forum  had to have contributed to the community, what would the community be for?
<br/>
<br/>
I exist in this community because I'm interested in what updates there are in DS homebrew, and in someday being a programmer. I occasionally add my opinion, on things I think I might have a grasp of, some more so than others. When I'm wrong people correct me, 95% of the time kindly and helpfully. Occasionally I ask questions, to which I get usually good answers.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't say that without my 468 posts the forum would be much different. My "speaking up" was intended to be a contribution to the community, in a way; when I see other people fanning flames I try to douse them, if I can provide a credible argument. If my logic is flawed I submit to others criticism, and if I ever have over exaggerated things in my posts I try to admit things as I see them, and I wish all to do the same. I admit that there were possibly previous histories that I do not have knowledge of. Although I still stand in my opinion that this is not the place nor the means which previous grudges should be shown forth and sorted through.
<br/>
<br/>
Really the biggest contribution I have given is extensively testing his QuakeDS port, and someday hopefully it's site will be designed by me. Other than that, I will contribute where and when I can, But it will definitely be for the benefit of the community, not just so I can be "above your contempt".<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
