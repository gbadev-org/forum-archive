    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im just getting into the ds homebrew scene,and i want to start making homebrew game.I just got devkitarm 1.7 installer/devkitarm 15.I guess thats all i need,but i was just wondering if there was a tut on turning a pc game into a ds homebrew...Or if its freaking hard to do without the source.
<br/>
<br/>
Its a freeware game from back in the day,here is the link to it.I just want to see if its even worth it to attempt this.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried again and still it wont work. Anyway, from the pic it looks like a very simple game. You should have no problem remaking it for the DS. Try to get familiar with the DS dev environment first. You might want to start looking into sprite rendering and tile mapping on the DS. I heard PA_LIB makes this easy, but I haven't used it yet. The actual gameplay programming for a game like this is dirt simple if you've coded games before. Definately a good first project for DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you have a source? I can only find info about an official version of lemmings for PSP. Which makes me doubt that they will also have a DS version.

It's not going to work in DOSBox because it's a Win 3.1 game ;) Works fine on the Win2k machine I'm on right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Old windows games like that were coded very differently than GBA games are.  Even if you had the source, you would still have to rewrite 99.9% of it anyway (and even then, the code would be structured in a way that's poorly suited to the GBA). And for such a simple game, that would be much more work than just doing a re-write from scratch (Which wouldn't be too hard).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

Its unlikely Lemmings will come to the DS as tje rights are owned by Sony.
<br/>
I would imagine someone could write a good clone though.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

It's unlikely that Lemmings will come to the PSP either as its controller is nowhere near practical for tactical clickfests such as Lemmings and Starcraft.
