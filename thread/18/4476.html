    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a DS a couple of days ago and as we can all see,  it is wireless.  We can view the mac address in net stumbler.  I don't think it should be to hard to upload our own demos to the DS.  The DS will download multiplayer games from a host DS without needing a cartridge.  Now I don't know much about the exchange protocols that go on yet but I think  that you could write your own demo, and give it a header that matches that of a commercial game IE, Metroid or Mario 64 and from your computer send it out.  The DS should be able to pick it up if it has the same header as a commercial game and thus you should be able to test it on the real DS.  What does everyone else think?  Easier said than done?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">allenu is right, we do definitely need to figure out how the DS download packages are built up before we do anything else. First we need some DS Download packages to dissect; I don't think the DS Download "demo units" are in stores yet, but it would be nice to wander on down with an iPaq, a copy of ethereal and netstumbler and attempt to figure out what the hell the units are going to send in order to get some nice raw data.
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, once we get that, chances are the "dissect the DS wireless protocol" guys will have figured it out and someone can start producing tests on force-feeding the DS with data.
<br/>
<br/>
A buffer overflow would be a real coup at this point in time. Here's hoping for lazy American programmers!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For those playing at home, "layer 3" refers to the OSI model. The DS and Internet-routed Wi-Fi use the same 802.11b, which covers layers 1 and 2. Layers 3-5 of the Internet stack are IP, TCP, and TCP; if we can get a basic idea of how Nintendo's stack works from layer 3 on up by observing PictoChat, then we can start attacking DS multiboot.

You mean a naive replay attack? That wouldn't work if the packet sequence numbers change from play to play, such as if they're initialized based on the DS's internal RTC.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
ok OSI layer 3 i thought you guys ment a data layer in the packets
<br/>
and i asked my teacher Prof. Zaman about this he suggested
<br/>
MPLS (that works on layer 2 and 3 so we could in theory work with
<br/>
the ds on all routers) any input to that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#30499 - localhost - Wed Dec 01, 2004 6:22 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To the best of my knowledge, a MPLS will understand layer 3 the problem with playing over the internet is that the only layer 3 protocol the internet understands is IP.  That's why PPTP is unique is that it can route other layer 3 protocols such as IPX/SPX over the internet by encapsulating it in an IP packet and then de-encapsulating(is that even a word?) it on the other end and outputting the packet in it's original format.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, a MPLS will do you no good here because right now only the ds knows its layer 3 protocol and even the switch wouldn't.  Layer 2 is the only thing that is common to the DS that all other network equipment can understand.  And besides that, I've never heard of a switching wireless device except for maybe for the use of VLANS in a wifi network.
<br/>
<br/>
The OSI model is tricky for most to understand at first, but once you get it, it opens up the whole idea of protocols to you correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick lesson
<br/>
layer 1 - hardware such as cables, nics, electricity, and i guess even RF signals
<br/>
layer 2 - sending packets over the wire using a standard protocol such as LLC that defines how the hardware itself understands it.  All packets no matter whether IP, IPX, DLC, etc. use layer 2.
<br/>
layer 3 - routing protocols in my book.  IP, IPX, etc fall under here.  It's a more human understandable way of addressing machines.  Your ip address is a layer 3 property.
<br/>
layer 4 - tcp, udp, icmp fall under here.  All tcp, udp, icmp packets look the same as far as layer 3 goes, the all have and destination and origin ip address information in them.  TCP defines a type of ip traffic that is negotiated, packets verify that they make it to their destination, and have a logical port # so the pc will know what application actually gets the packet.  ICMP doesn't use ports, it uses ICMP type to define the different type of icmp packet being sent, such as 0/8 are ping and reply.
<br/>
layer 5 and up - are more application, presentation layers that build on the previous layers.  examples, http, telnet, ftp, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post but I understand a lot of people just never had to learn this and thought I'd try to explain it.  Also, before someone nitpicks this  post to death, I understand the the internet does also understand BGP, EIGRP, etc layer 3 routing protocols but most ISP's aren't goning to let you pass them anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All current games and the DS itself (both in the Download mode and PictoChat) are using "NiFi", so you are going to have to crack it no matter what.
