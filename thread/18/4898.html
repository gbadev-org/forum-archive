I can't speak for DF, but I can confirm that both demos also work on my setup. You can see pictures <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dslinux.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=45&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=2057" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br/>
What the hardware does to redirect "execution" to GBA cart is modify 4 bytes in the header stream between Metroid cart and DS. This will tell the DS to load ARM7 code from the GBA cart. That code then loads custom ARM9 code right into memory.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dib, you can think whatever you like about me, but I tried both v1.01 (only other version I could find to download) and v1.03 (latest version, and probably the last version) of EZFA_Client.exe, and the MultiROM check in the menu is enabled, but greyed out, no matter if I look before connecting, after connecting, or after flashing, so it always burns that stupid boot menu, even with a single rom.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there was an admittidly mind-bogglingly simple solution that Ampz pointed out to me yesterday, just burn a pad and then my file, and then reroute the ARM7 exec address to 0x08000000+menu_size+pad_size.

I wasn't making fun of you, I was honestly wondering how you could have the technical knowledge surrounding things like flash carts and this pass-through yet not have figured out how to disable the multiboot on the EZFA.  If I'd known that you posted here, I'd have included instructions.  But phantomdjp above already covered it.  Just hit the remove button until there's nothing loaded in the list then you'll be able to uncheck the option.  Just to be certain, I would probably disable the IGF as well.  Now add your rom and flash.  There will be no loader menu and it will boot straight into the rom.

I've had to use single boot on several occassions, and my EZFA has never failed me to date.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Natrium pretty much has made the smallest passthrough out there right now, with the needed files and information for part ordering. It <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> "untested" as of right now, but by from the looks of it, it should work fine.

<br/>
<br/>
The way the passthrough reportedly works is it loads a GBA flashcart in DS mode, allowing the flashcart to send code to the ARM9 via RAM allocation, and thus gaining access to all the DS buttons, touch screen, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
