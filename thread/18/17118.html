    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking to write a program similar to Rudolph's GBA Backup 0.21
<br/>
<br/>
What I cannot find anywhere is a good example or tutorial on how to extract the SAV and GBA (ROM) files fomr a GBA cartridge. I assume that GBA Backup Tool is closed source, but is there any examples out there of how to accomplish this? I've read up a bit on GBATek, but unfortunately I'm not *quite* educated enough in hardware/software interfacing to just write up a program to do this from scratch.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">See if Eepinator is open source, or take a look at Chishm's cart_save program (on the SendSave page of his site) which is a GBA program but functions similarly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I once made a program that saved GBA cartridge saves to a GBA Movie Player.  You would run the program on the GBA, eject the GBAMP, then keep swapping between the cartridge you want to backup the save, and the GBAMP so it could write the savegame.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Saves aren't the problem - I'm pretty sure there are plenty of examples out there. My problem is reading from the EEPROM. Eepinator only reads the EEPROM of slot-1 cards whereas I want to read it from GBA cards. 
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with the GBATek reference I found is:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">GBA EEPROM
<br/>
EEPROMs in GBA carts cannot be accessed in DS mode. The EEPROMs should be accessed with 8 waits on GBA, ie. 18 cycles on NDS on both 1st/2nd access. But, 2nd access is restricted to max 6 cycles in NDS mode, which is ways too fast.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
However, I know there must be some way around this since Rudolph's GBA backup tool does exactly this. Is there a programming Guru out there who could answer this question for me? Maybe I should try to find contact info for Rudolph and ask him myself...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
