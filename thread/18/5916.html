    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been using an old template and old startup files for a while now, and it worked out pretty well. With DevkitARM r12, I decided to switch to the new template at the same time. First got a problem with the OAM (my DMA copy doesn't work anymore for it, I have to copy everything to it with a large loop...), and now another problem :
<br/>
My saves (on the gba SRAM) used to work perfectly, and now I can only read them... If I create a save file in notepad, write stuff to it, then load it from the DS, it works... If I take that save file back to the PC with the linker, there's the text I had written in it plus stuff follwing (I suppose the linker takes all the found data for the save, not just the beginning).
<br/>
<br/>
But if try writting to it with SRAM[0] = 's', for example (or whatever number), the save becomes :
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">x8  ??  GB                   </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> and stuff after that...
<br/>
Any idea why ? (writing at a diff?rent offset doesn't change anything).
<br/>
<br/>
Did something change in the devkit files concerning Sram ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance !

Pretty stange... I'm looking at the <span style="font-style: italic">ds_arm9_crt0.s</span> in <span style="font-weight: bold">dekkitpro R17</span>, it seems that one still has something different:
<br/>
<ul>IAccess : 0x36636333
<br/>
DAccess : 0x36333333</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Is is normal ? Or do we still need to change these settings in the R17 ?
