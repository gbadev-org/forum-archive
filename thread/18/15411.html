    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a file on these forums somewhere called Display_Capture. It was made for an older version of libnds. I tested the .nds that came in the file, and it worked. When I tried compiling, it gave me all kinds of errors.
<br/>
I was able to fix the errors, because they were simple. (glViewPort -&gt; glViewport, glIdentity -&gt; glLoadIdentity)
<br/>
<br/>
So, now it compiles, but the .nds dosn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
here is my files

<a class="postlink" href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/vytky2" target="_blank">http://www.sendspace.com/file/vytky2</a>
<br/>
<br/>
so, can anyone help, or give me a display capture demo that works?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what is the best format for models/textures, and what are they easiest to export from?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks. I guess I didn't search enough. (Display capture instead of two pass)
<br/>
