i guess dsHobro will be only slightly better than using one of the remote desktop apps, since it's designed specifically for browsing, and can be optimized for that task (for example, someone can be using your computer while you are using the ds 'browser')</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

and yes you do need alot of ram, but isn't possiable to shorten the amount of ram needed, by making the program less user freindly like taking out the nice interface and switching it with "poopy" one?(though i guess you'd have to have the programs source files huh)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I own hardware that was unsupported by Linux last time I checked. Around the time of Mandrake 9.1 (now Mandriva), I tried to install Linux. When it was time to choose and test a video driver, the "radeon" driver failed to start on my ATI Radeon 9000 video card. In addition, my Canon S520 inkjet printer printed the test page at 60% size because the 600 DPI printer was misdetected as a 360 DPI of the same family, and my flatbed scanner wasn't detected at all due to being listed as unsupported in SANE. In fact, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sane-project.org/lists/sane-mfgs-cvs.html#Z-MICROTEK" target="_blank">Microtek ScanMaker models 3800 through 9800 are still mostly unsupported</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Anyway, to get us kinda back on topic here is the quick pics/video I talked about..

<br/>
Here is what you need (assuming you have a few DSs and a Windows computer):
<br/>
<br/>
FREE = VMWare Player
<br/>
FREE = FC6 VMWare image (or your favorite Linux with X)
<br/>
<br/>
1 - Install VMWare Player
<br/>
2 - Unpack VMWare image (in this case, it was 2 Gig unpacked, but like I said before, you can get smaller images.  I just didn't want to waste time looking for one)
<br/>
3 - Run VMWare image, answer questions, and log in as root (going to use 10.10.10.100 as the IP in this example)
<br/>
4 - Create 3 user accounts, nds1, nds2, nds3
<br/>
5 - su to each user account and start vncserver, set password, and kill server.
<br/>
6 - Edit .vnc/xstartup script and remove stuff you don't want, add firefox and have it default to your favorite site.
<br/>
7 - start vncserver again.
<br/>
8 - Do this for the other two accounts..
<br/>
<br/>
9 - Start nds1 and launch dsvnc.nds, connect to 10.10.10.100:1
<br/>
10 - Start nds2 and launch dsvnc.nds, connect to 10.10.10.100:2
<br/>
11 - Start nds3 and launch dsvnc.nds, connect to 10.10.10.100:3
<br/>
<br/>
There you go.. have fun pretending to browse the web..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, is it really useable?  Nope.. but you can do it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Huh?  Have you even tried VMWare?  Because it sure doesn't sound like it.  In the example I just gave, my computer was using 366MB of RAM.  That includes WinXP (and the standard crap that starts up like printer utils, etc) and the running FC6 VMWare image.  Is that TONS of RAM?  Because the engineering workstations (3D modeling) we have at work have 4 or 8 GB of RAM, depending on the PC model.. I would say THAT is tons of RAM!
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Linux server with only 376MB (1 x 256 and 1 x 128 - 8MB for Video) RAM in it running as a Samba file server, SSH proxy, BigSister server, and a VMWare server running a single VMWare image of Asterisk that has 3 VoIP trunks going into it.. and it runs fine.  Does it have a lot of free RAM?  No, only about 2 meg.. but it doesn't go into swapping fits either, so it is just right.
<br/>
<br/>
So, although you can run up to 4 VMWare images on a single processor, it doesn't mean you need tons of RAM to be able to run just one.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, if you are going to proxy through a PC, you have to own a PC/Laptop to be able to do that anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, if you aren't browsing the web on the DS from the DS, it's not a real DS web browser.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tepples, Manrake 9.1 is just a teensy weensy little bit old and decrepit now. Can you say Kernel 2.4?

<br/>
If you're going to judge Linux, you'd do better by installing a more modern distro, something like Mandriva 2007 or OpenSuse 10.2, as the HW support in them is a lot better...

<br/>
<br/>
I own the bloody thing and it is NOT LIKE Opera Mini.
<br/>
<br/>
Opera Mini uses a custom proxy to pre-process browsed pages and shrink-wrap them for the browser.
<br/>
<br/>
Opera DS does not. What Opera DS DOES allow is the use of a standard HTTP proxy, the kind usually used for caching and security purposes. This kind of proxy does NOT, however, shrink-wrap web-pages and is purely optional. If Opera DS did use a custom proxy, then it would probably be a far far better browser than it is.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I seem a little irate, but I get rather peeved when I see the same old stale, bollocks info being bandied about when the facts are very easy to dig up and have been known for a while.

<br/>
Not just multiple desktops - multiple X servers and multiple logins.  If you are grabbing the video and shoving it out to a DS via wireless then you don't even need a graphics card - you could service half a dozen DS's from a modern PC.
<br/>
<br/>
But the 'clean' way to do this would be to implement a thin X on the DS and feed it from the PC so that rendering happens locally on the DS - for everything other than full screen video that would be much faster than sending images over S-L-O-W  WiFi connections.  Then you can run any software on the PC and have the DS display it locally.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you thinking what I was thinking? SSH -X on the DS would be great :)
<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who doesn't know, SSH -X completely kicks Remote Desktop's ass in every way.
<br/>
With it, for example, you can have one copy of a computer program (eg., Photoshop) installed on a big / powerful server computer. Then hook up a bunch of cheap / simple client computers and have them run that same copy of Photoshop simultaneously via the server. (The server is doing all the work; the clients just render what they need to render). It saves money <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> it's fast.
<br/>
Even just for regular remote desktop stuff, the quality difference between SSH -X and something like VNC is stunning. The computer does not take a picture of its output every frame; it just pipes over all its X stuff. You don't need to redraw constantly, and no crazy compression is done. Stellar quality even with less transferred over the network.
<br/>
<br/>

Theoretically, yes, assuming you have the know-how to write a proxy server that will shrink-wrap standard HTML pages in some fashion while still producing pure HTML output.

As is, the easiest way to make Opera DS run faster is to turn of image-loading, as this is what slows it down the most...

Just a guess, but I think Opera DS' SSR mode is your shrink-wrapping proxy that Opera Mini uses, only running locally. Problem is that you still have to download all image data before it gets resized. A proxy that would just resize images would speed up things for sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It does function similarly, yes, but it doesn't actually seem to shrink any of the images. Rather, it just flows the page in a peculiar way for the most part.

The results are not quite the same as Opera Mini though :-(

As for image browsing, I'm happy with them off anyway.

Thinking I should just import from the UK while I still can, though I've heard the US version will support Flash. Not sure how true that is, but I'm hoping if it IS true, they'll have a Phat version.

This browsing stuff is so annoying. My main desire is to get a browser that I can use on the DS that can use Ebay. That way when I hit the DVD stores and see the sales etc... I can see if it's worth getting some stuff to Ebay for a profit, or even sell used on Amazon.

Though being able to use YouTube portability would be pretty badass too... If ever any app on the DS can use YouTube, aside from being absolutely stunned, I'd be ecstatic.

It does shrink larger images though, even in overview mode.  Have you tried going to VGcats or another large webcomic?  The image is shrunk so much that it's nearly impossible to read the text.  A webcomic like Ozy and Millie however is small enough that it doesn't get shrunk.
<br/>
<br/>
This could potentially be due to the limited RAM capacity even with the RAM pack.  I know it's not a direct equivalent, but viewing the VGcats comic page in Links in graphics mode uses up nearly 20 MB of RAM, but it does keep it full-sized.
<br/>

At least the Opera browser supports animations, which is nice sometimes (though other times it's annoying).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
