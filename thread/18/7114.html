    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was simply wondering if any port of SDL was being considered for the DS.  It would be an interesting challenge, I do admit, but if it could be done there would be a myriad of new games to port.  The biggest challenges I can think of would be creating a system for using both screens, and modifying SDL_Event for touchscreen input, both of which aren't too hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A while ago I found a diff for SDL 1.2.3 that was for the GBA, Iv gotten it to work on the GBA and have ported it to the DS, as well as many of the addon libraries, still have some issues with controller buttons(xy) and no sound yet. Then I will looking into a touchscreen mouse or a onscreen keyboard etc.
