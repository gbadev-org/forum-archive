    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that music matching software is also present on other SE mobile phones.
<br/>
it works by recording a sample, sending it via *inet* (????), "recognising" it via a database and sending the result back.
<br/>
there are also some online services that do the same, only you can "sing" the sample yourself! ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
i guess, the nds' mic should be good enough for such a task, as audio sample recognission would (iirc) "degrade" (band filter) the signal for pattern matching anyways. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
the hard thing is to make the backend work, that means the recognition itself.
<br/>
good luck! :^D

so, what's with nintendo's wifi? (a service?) i know nothing about it.

Although it might be useful to record it, then when in reach of a AP send the sample.... still a pc could be used for matching the databases up so.

Idea defeated.

I wasn't suggesting where you actually store and compare it, but I was letting you know roughly how the comparisons would have to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Possible things to "fingerprint" with are the beats per minute.  Or the rhythm beats of a song.  
<br/>
<br/>
Check out <a class="postlink" href="http://www.songtapper.com" target="_blank">www.songtapper.com</a> for a working example.  It seems to expect a "tap" for every sound "sylable" to a given song.

if it's that slow, you're doing something wrong. I easily get 40kB/sec, and I've heard people getting up to 100kB/sec with some optimization. (iirc, according to sgstair, the dswifi guru, the theoretical maximum he thinks he can do with hacks is ~120kB/sec)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
