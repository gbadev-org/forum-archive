<br/>
  I've been checking the docs and made a search and even downloaded and checked the arm7 source, but it didn't give me any idea. So I'm here begging ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea about how to detect very soft touches on the touch screen? Or at least how to raise the sensitivity, or another magic trick? I can even accept way less precision than what is there now...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
