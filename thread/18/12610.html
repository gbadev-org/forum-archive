    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i am trying to create a File Transfer Homebrew (Host App and Client APP) and i need to make a DS become a Host, but i don't know how to code this, it is just init WiFi and make it wait? If yes how the DS will know if another one is trying to connect?
<br/>
And for the Client...is just connect to an AP representing the Host DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's only been one other person who's managed to do this, and he came out with a functioning demo, though it appears that it only works on a select few slot-2 cards.  It would try to send the "test.nds" file to a flashed DS, but if it couldn't find the test.nds file it just sent over its own demo file instead.  For me with my Supercard MiniSD, all that got sent was the demo file.  At least it worked though, which was huge progress.

Nobody has made any real progress that I know of on the latter except for the thread dantheman posted.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And what about DS FTP this homebrew can make my DS a connectable AP?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A PC running "soft AP" software can act as a Wi-Fi access point. A DS running software that uses the DSWifi library cannot. If you can code, and you want to add soft AP functionality to DSWifi, go ahead and talk to Stephen Stair, maintainer of DSWifi.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
