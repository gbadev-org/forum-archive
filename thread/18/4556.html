    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is kinda tangentially related, but I have to ask - could the DS have killed my wireless router? I had a few friends over and they were showing me their DS's (and I'm gonna get one soon, I'm very interested in the wireless development which is why I'm here) but sometime during the time when they were here, my wireless router started acting up, and then died - it now no longer routes packets with NAT, instead it just acts like a switch (where only one computer "behind" it will get the external IP address, and there is no real IP address for the router itself.)
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried resetting the router a million times, and I can't re-flash the firmware because the router just doesn't HAVE an IP address! So, aside from temporary interference, does anyone know if the DS could have actually damaged my router? it's a Linksys WRT54G, in case people were wondering. I see that people seem to be using the linksys routers to communicate with the DS, but I'm still thinking that the DS somehow killed mine, it's too screwed up to be just chance and it happened during the time that there were several DS units in my apartment.
<br/>
<br/>
Any input would be appreciated. Keep up the good work on the DS hacking - I'd love to help out but I have neither the time nor the equipment to play around with this. (Not to mention a DS, sadly. But Hopefullt that'll change soon... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't mean to sound mean, but it's been my experience that Linksys doesn't make very good stuff.  It's possible it just... died.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I've been a firm believer in D-Link products, and I've seen some people here (can't remember who) that hate D-Link and claim they make crap, so I guess it's all in your luck.  In your case, bad luck.
<br/>
<br/>
If it's under warranty, I might try getting it replaced.  Or, and probably first, you should try contacting Linksys directly for help.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the router not having an IP address, I'm sure it must.  Usually, it uses a local IP of 192.168.1.0 (or 0.1 in some cases, D-Link for one).  If you haven't already, type "http://192.168.1.0" or "http://192.168.0.1" into your browser, see what comes up.  I'm guessing if you know how to flash the router's firmware, you already know this, but just in case! :)  Oh, and of course it helps to make sure that (A) You plug in with a cable directly (Not wireless) (B) Only 1 cable is connected (C) The cable is in working condition, and not a cross-over.  Yes, some of this is very obvious, but in the future when other people seek enlightenment in these forums, they can brush up (or learn) the basics. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i'll just leave it at this.  its been reported several places on the 'net that some d-link routers will crash if you enable wireless play on your DS.  i'm assuming that the router doesnt know how to handle some of the more specific packets that the DS sends out, and overloads in some way.  so yes, it may be DS related, but i dont know if this is the proper thread to discuss such a thing.  lets try to keep it more twards development, and not anti-development.  ;)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

Not likely, I guess there is a chance it could have caused your router to lock up but that is unlikely too. If simply unplugging your router for a few min doesn't fix it then odds are it's a hardware failure and not DS related.<br/>_________________<br/>"He who dares not offend cannot be honest." -- Thomas Paine</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
or it could be caused by an outdated firmware.  try upgrading to the latest firmware to see if it still happens.
<br/>
<br/>
just as a note, my WRT54G doesnt die w/ the DS being turned on.
<br/>
<br/>
also, what revision is your box?  if memory serves me correctly, there are 3 or 4 major models of the router, each with varying CPUs and wireless cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-
