    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Someone needs to emulate the Genesis first. The biggest question is if the DS can emulate the M68000 at full speed.
<br/>
<br/>
If the CPU can be emulated, the graphics could be done using HLE mapping to the DS's own 2D system. The main problem would be memory.
<br/>
<br/>
Most NeoGeo cartridge roms would not fit on the DS main RAM. Games would need to be streamed from FAT, and it's uncertain if that's viable or not. 
<br/>
<br/>
Neo Geo CD games would be impossible without RAM expansions, since it had 7MBytes of RAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">M68k Emulation:
<br/>
The CPU core in Mini vMac DS is fairly fast for something that is not optimized for embedded platforms. It runs roughly 40FPS at idle and 30FPS under load, which isn't bad and keep in mind that Cyclone68000 would be even better.
<br/>

Framebuffer rendering would kill it though as was already mentioned, but then again some people are willing to use slow emulators.

That would be even slower, since that's not how emulation works.
<br/>
Emulation runs by scanlines, and you won't be able to real-time update information that fast.

if you chose to fake it and update data (convert from tiles to NDS texture format which is FB) per frame for 384 16x512 quads, you'll waste more speed then framebuffer emulation...<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.

Since the maximum width of the NeoGeo sprites is 16px, I assume you can cram in something like 64 per scanline, and that's assuming they're all 16px wide. Perhaps the NeoGeo has some other limit about that? And it's not like more than 64 sprites per scanline are likely to be used often. Also, stacking sprites vertically to achieve the larger sizes isn't really a huge problem, but all this would take a very tricky sprite manager.
<br/>
<br/>
The main issue, as I see it, is memory. From what I've gathered at Wikipedia, games can be around 330MBits, or even larger, and that's memory mapped ROM. The NeoGeo CD would work, but it has a lot more RAM:

By "FB", do you mean linear addressing? (not all frame buffers are linear)
<br/>
If so: Not really. You can do lazy updates and dirty-flagging of memory-regions and so on to get this rather effective. I suspect that most games don't change that much all the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wh... what?? Tears are flowing down on my face. First because it seems to be full speed, second because I have no means to run it with my GBA Flashcart which became useless since the dawn of DLDI.

Try renaming the .nds and the folder or game files, or move them up higher in your directory tree (put them in C:\ for instance).  If that fails, you'll probably have to try the FCSR method manually, doing each step yourself.

jEnesisDS Mega Drive emulator is fantastically fast due to it's 68000 arm asm core, but not due to forget that the Amiga besides to use the 68000 processor, uses three coprocessors more, and that already is too much load of work for the DS Hardware... :-(

I suppose that through partial emulation, something could be obtainedon Amiga 500 emulation... or perhaps something more than only something... :-)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Wonder Boy on Sun Jul 22, 2007 9:10 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
the roms would almost definitely have to be stored decompressed as-is; the limitation would be with the enormous amounts of ram the neo had when compared with the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
there was an xbox emulator that was able to finagle metal slug 3 (a ninety-some megabyte game when decompressed) with the xbox's 64 megs of ram, but..
<br/>
<br/>
that's 64 megs of ram we're talking about. not four. much as was true of the dreamcast and psp (initially), neocd is a much wiser goal, except in that case, the memory is absolutely not there.
<br/>
<br/>
the compromises necessary to do this would (i'd think) push it well outside the realm of being worth anybody's time and effort.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Whoa! I didn't know that. I'm at work and cannot test with the Flashcart, but I installed it and it worked perfectly with No$GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
You're my savior. I had actually given up on using that cart for DS stuff because everyone was moving to FAT devices and was using GBA apps exclusively. Time to test those DS ebook readers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
