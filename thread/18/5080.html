    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as reported on the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/nintendo_ds/164183.html" target="_blank">Nintendo DS LJ Community</a>, if you put a magnet near your system, it will enter into sleep mode.
<br/>
<br/>
the magic spot is inbetween the X/Y buttons and the select button.  i personally tried this and had success using a laptop speaker.
<br/>
<br/>
very interesting observation, i must say tho.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

These little magnetic sensors can be found in all sorts of things.  Most common on Door alarms for homes or businesses.

I had assumed the reason that Metroid doesn't properly use Sleep Mode is because it was just a demo. Or else perhaps they did that so people could run a "dedicated server" of sorts for Metroid multiplayer.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by TJ on Sat Mar 05, 2005 7:38 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

well, I would have agreed with you 2 days ago, but I recently bought Madden 2005 and its screen just shuts off, but you can actually still play the game if you press buttons with the lid half shut while the screen is off.. and the power LED stays lit constantly as well (Metroid reacts the same way with the LED light and button pressing), unlike when the system normally sleeps where it blinks every so often. I'm also starting to suspect that it drains the battery somewhat while Madden "sleeps", since I left it closed while I was in the middle of a game and it only took about 4 hours to go from fully charged to dead (with sporatic playing).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, Mario64 WILL properly sleep.. you can't press any buttons, the LED blinks and I'm positive theres no huge power consumption.. but it's not like I sat there watching it :P

it makes sense that it wouldn't in multiplayer.. so maybe they just felt lazy when implementing it, and made the game react the same way to sleeping whether its in single player or multiplayer. The same might be said for Madden, but Mario lets you put your DS to sleep during multiplayer (although I don't know what the effects are if you're playing against someone.. just know about practicing)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I do know one thing from experience.  It takes a few seconds to enter sleep mode when the lid is shut.  If you don't have the game in pause mode before applying sleep mode, that few seconds can be enough to have the game run unattended.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:
