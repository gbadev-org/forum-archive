    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys. Basically I want to port over an existing GBA stuff that I made as a demo using the 3d engine so I want to know a few things about the 3d engine of the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
So to make something like a sprite, I bind a texture(the sprite image) to a quadrangle right? And if I want to create a tiled background, I use the same technique.
<br/>
<br/>
But as we know binding a texture to a quadrangle one by one is slow so the best way is to bind once and use a large texture and set the coordinates and size which a quad will use to make it run faster.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I got the basics down I think but do take note that I haven't done any actual coding for the above process (Some problem with my old laptop running the newer Devkitarm tools) hence my question, Can I use a different palette for each quad without having to bind the texture again?
<br/>
<br/>
Like say quads 1- 4 use the same image but different set coordinates and different palettes each? No need to give code (but it would be appreciated), I just want to know if its possible or else I discard my whole process and think of something knew. Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As sverx suggested gl2d is a good place to start. To answer your question directly: yes, it is possible to change the palette independent of the texture. I am not sure that it has been established that switching textures on the ds is expensive though.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure that the videoGL library from libnds exposes this functionality or gl2d for that matter. Changing the texture and the palette are controlled by a single register for each.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah I see. Thanks guys. Looks like my planned process will work after all. 
<br/>
Anyway, I just assumed about the texture switching cost since it is what I read in most non-ds 3d tutorials.
<br/>
I just hope I can a new laptop soon for me to start on the porting process. My old one is at least 7 years old I think! A vintage IBM Thinkpad R31. Hahaha!
<br/>
<br/>
edit: If anybody is curious, the thing I said about switching texture to be costly, I read that from a 3d tutorial about iOS development using openGLES I think.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
