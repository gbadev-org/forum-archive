    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Witht the arrival of the DS-Camera (also at my Doorstep Whoopey!) there's a whole bunch of new possibilities.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's some toughts on what such a lib could be of use for &gt;&gt; 
<br/>
[+Lets hear yours !]
<br/>
<br/>
-Textures, Assets
<br/>
Think that <a class="postlink" href="http://microsites.ign.com/nintendo/drawntolife/index2.html" target="_blank">'Drawn to Life'</a> game extended. Or simply the good ol' use-your-face-as-a-texture spiel.
<br/>
Take a picture, draw a mask/alpha.
<br/>
<br/>
-VideoChat
<br/>
Uh unless a miracle crew of talented get together, this so aint happenin'. And even then - Camera-compression-wifi-decompression. There's some things that the DS just isn't made for.
<br/>
Anyone think its technically possible at reasonable quality ?
<br/>
<br/>
-Use it as another DS-Motion compliant device
<br/>
See <a href="http://www.gesturetekmobile.com/inside.html" target="_blank">http://www.gesturetekmobile.com/inside.html</a> [as used in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.superhappyfunfun.com/games/gam_tilt.html" target="_blank">this</a> game] for more. Guess they're using 'optical flow' for their tracking with standard cellphone cams.
<br/>
<br/>
-DsGoo extended.
<br/>
 nuff said
<br/>
<br/>
-DS Diary - a DSorganise plugin
<br/>
<br/>
-Stylised/artisitc mirrors
<br/>
I mean they put some video kaleidoscope stuff in there already and its more fun than it should be really.
<br/>
Though its <a class="postlink" href="http://img171.imagevenue.com/aAfkjfp01fo1i-22535/loc797/89861_digitalMirror_122_797lo.jpg" target="_blank">sucks</a> as fullscreen mirror :P (mmh bezel)
<br/>
<br/>
-Finger games or hand gestures
<br/>
Think spawning stuff ? la Pac-pix with/from your hands. Hadoken!
<br/>
<br/>
-Ds Tube 
<br/>
Make videos, share on a small homebrew portal [like HBbrowse].
<br/>
Hook up to youtube.
<br/>
Fat cards can certainly record some lengthy clips, although the quality would be aboniable,....Hey just like youtube !:)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even if there already was one, in what ways could you see homebrew or even commercial games/edutainment make use of it ?
<br/>
[How would one go about polling, registering and reverse engineering what comes in through the SPI anyway ?]
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The Facetraining game does some cool things on its own (besides making your face hurt) that I never expected to see on the DS
<br/>
-full screen video on both screens. 
<br/>
-It does this vertical adjustment-where it scrolls within the image buffer -mighty impressive. most proffessional.
<br/>
-There's this solid facetracker by Inteligent systems
<br/>
Not being able to swivel it around 180? is a HUGE omission however.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 I would bet that if in the right hands the ds would more than likely be able to send video streams, also anyone remember the game boy camera. that was pretty fun for a while. 
<br/>
<br/>
the ds is way more powerful than the GB so I wouldnt see why with the right software the ds could rock camera apps<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">(EDIT: I'm sorry, I just have to fix the typos in this post, they bother me too much.)
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I've had some great ideas for little games and apps using the camera if it ever gets reversed so that we can access it.
<br/>
<br/>
I also really hope the Arkanoid expansion cart will be usable in homebrew eventually, too, and that one should (EDIT: shouldn't) be too hard to get figured out.  Some great stuff would be possible, especially if it's a continuous rotation paddle, not just a potentiometer.
<br/>
<br/>
In my experience in other homebrew scenes, it seems like support for these sorts of add-ons is usually rather slow to appear in the homebrew dev tools, but hopefully it will happen eventually.  It'd come a lot quicker if these things get release din (EDIT: released in) the U.S., which so fart (EDIT: ummm...I'll leave that one) doeasn't (EDIT: doesn't) seem certain for either of them, does it?

<br/>
Youd probably use most of the cpu on the motion tracking, so the things you aim at will be just sprites, but it would still be cool to point the DS around the room blasting space invaders on the screen like a gun turret.
<br/>
<br/>
...or wait...you cant...
<br/>
<br/>
Because Nintendo were too stupid to let the camera point the other way.
