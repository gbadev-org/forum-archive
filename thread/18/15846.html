<br/>
I'm looking for information on how the microphone on the DS works, and am having a little trouble digging it up.  I'm specifically trying to interface an electric guitar with the mic port next to the headphone jack.  I'm assuming that since the plug used by the DS headsets is different than a PC microphone, they don't behave the same, but that's just an assumption.  I'm a software guy and am not very familiar with hardware/electronics, so any help anyone can provide will be very welcome.

Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
