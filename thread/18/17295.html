<br/>
I think DS programmers should take advantage of this opportunity to make something for the system, since not many games will be out to showcase all of the 3DS abilities. 
<br/>
<br/>
But thats my opinion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately it will be backward compatible with DS and DSi, and hopefully there'll be a card that will make possible for us to keep on playing with our homebrew on it for a long while :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-weight: bold">Screen size1</span>
<br/>
3.53 inches (90 mm)(top) and 3.02 inches (77 mm)(bottom)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Screen resolution </span>
<br/>
Top Screen resolution 800x240 with (effectively 400x240 per eye); touch screen is 320x240 QVGA
<br/>

<br/>
As for the CPU it has to be decent to be able to play 2 simultaneous games of SF4 (in 3d) 400x240.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the list of games coming out for it.
<br/>

I assume Nintendo is not giving information to developers now to explain how the 3D works so that people can can start coding.
<br/>
But from what I speculate the only way to do it is the front plastic layer is a micro bumpy layer which is why its not touch screen. 
<br/>
It works like this
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.thinkdigit.com/TVs/How-3D-TV-works-Part-II-_3602.html" target="_blank">http://www.thinkdigit.com/TVs/How-3D-TV-works-Part-II-_3602.html</a>
<br/>
So every vertical pixel alternate for each eye.
<br/>
Each pixel has the camera positioned to the Left and Right.
<br/>
LRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLR
<br/>
The res would only be 400 instead of 800 but you can do a lot with that.
<br/>
<br/>
You would need to code for the 3d in the game to have it play 2 times with the camera offset and to have the slider adjust how apart the camera is.
<br/>
<br/>
You can even use the buttons or analogue to control the 3D depth instead the thing on the side of the 3DS.
<br/>
Plenty of thing to do which it's too new for people to grasp the concept yet.
<br/>
I could give some examples on how it can be used but I assume some might not grasp it.
<br/>
All the home brew developers need to do is come up with a cheap gimmick to make money. But many will walk away form an opportunity since 
<br/>
<br/>
I am just supplied that they didn't do this sooner to make it 3d with lower quality graphics since the technology was available since the 1980's. I am not that impressed since I understand the concept. But I am kind of excited of what it can be used for which many will not understand what to with it fully.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At the E3 Conference, the reason behind not also making the bottom screen "3D" was because smudges on the screen from fingers and the stylus would interfere with the effect. Other than that, having anything between the eyes and the screen would more than likely mess up the interpretations of the effect to the eyes.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah it's not so easy to take out oil smudges out of bumps. I am not saying that it's not possible, just not practical for many reasons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that's probably not the problem, I seriously doubt that the bump will not be covered by something flat or on turned in the inside of the panel... as mentionned just higher, having an object (a stilus) on top of the screen would ruin the 3d effect.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

While there is no released info about an FPU (Floating Point Unit), I'm sure it will include one, because, imo, the 3D effect would really benefit from the precision that having a FPU offers.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The guy is playing a fake game video of it but explains how it works after he tried it. Go to youtube to see how the 3d looks in a way as he says. Obviously u need the glasses but the 3ds does not need it since it has the different technology as i explained. <a class="postlink" href="http://kotaku.com/5566712/want-to-see-what-3ds-games-look-like-in-3d" target="_blank">http://kotaku.com/5566712/want-to-see-what-3ds-games-look-like-in-3d</a>

<br/>
The 3d images can only be seen by the use that has to be directly in front. People that look at it from the side will not see it so well and feel disoriented after a while.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also KIDS under the age of 7 are not allowed to play the new 3ds in 3D mode as stated by Nintendo to to health warnings. lol

The winner of E3 was the 3DS. The system will be out before the end of March 2011. hmmm I don't know but I assume they will push themselves hard for a Christmas release since that is the biggest sales day.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If they say this, then within the parental controls, parents should be able to shut off the 3D effect from working (because kids these days are curious). Then again, my DS is MINE! (my precious).... I pretty much don't let anyone touch it, which is why it is still in great shape after years of use, and same will go with my 3DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
