    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good afternoon,
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is not exactly DS devloppement, but it's
<br/>
related to DS developpement testing and debugging,
<br/>
so i post this here. Of course you can move it to a more
<br/>
appropriate place if you feel like.
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see in my signature, i have an MSI PC54G2
<br/>
PCI wireless card with a RaLink 2500 chipset. I'm already
<br/>
using it successfully  with WMB (on windows) and to
<br/>
capture raw packets (on linux/debian) using ethereal.
<br/>
<br/>
Now to test my DS applications, i would like to set it to
<br/>
act as an Acess Point. Using the included software
<br/>
on Windows is not working as i'm getting "unexpteced
<br/>
errors" when creating the network bridges. (Sorry, my
<br/>
OS is in french, i can't give the exact translated version,
<br/>
when switching to AP mode. That's why i'm tempted to
<br/>
get it to run on Linux, as i'm using it for raw capture anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm willing to have it work as a simple WEP/Unencrypted
<br/>
access points i would turn on when i'm testing my apps.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I haven't been able to get it to work so far, and i'm
<br/>
willing to know if any of you, wireless developpers,
<br/>
succeeded to use this card as an access point.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope i'll get some feedback on this, as i'm sadly
<br/>
unable to do any kind of work (cannot test wifi...).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your feedback.<br/>_________________<br/>NDS Lite Gold/Silver, MK5/R4DS, MSI PC54G2, D-Link DI-624</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I have some experence with SoftAPs,(homebrew Nintendo dongle drivers)
<br/>
so I'll try to help.

Are you sure you have to create a bridge? If not,
<br/>
try ICS/Internet Connection Sharing. Or does the software do that automatically?It looks like it is auto... Is it forcing you to only use bridges?
<br/>
Can you enable SoftAP, without it trying to bridge?
<br/>
<br/>
Here's some instructions for ICS. It's from the instructions for installing
<br/>
the N dongle homebrew drivers and software. Enable SoftAP in your wireless card's configuration software. This time, instead of bridging,
<br/>
follow these instructions.

<br/>
Now go to Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections. Right-click on the Network Adapter you are currently accessing your Internet through and open the properties for that connection. Go to the Advanced tab, and click "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". Then click OK. If you get an error message saying the IP address is already in use, disable the Network adapter you are trying to share then try again - be sure to enable it again afterwards. It can take a long time for ICS to be enabled so wait patiently.
