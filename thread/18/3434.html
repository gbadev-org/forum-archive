    <h4>#20971 - ampz - Thu May 20, 2004 10:05 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS memory card is obviously very different from earlier gameboy memory cards.
<br/>
GB, GBC and GBA memory cards are memory mapped, and code is executed right off the cards.
<br/>
Now, the DS card only has 17pins, this is far from sufficient for a memory mapped memory card. So, data must be copied from the card to internal RAM before it is executed. This means the DS card is most likely a block device (like compact flash, SD card, memorystick...).
<br/>
17pins is about right for a block device. You got VCC and GND, 8 data pins, a read pin, a write pin, a chip select and/or a clock pin, a interrupt or DMA event pin, and a few (2 or 3) register address pins.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing wich is also very different is that the DS cards most likely does not support battery backed sram savegames. The cards are simply too small. Unless they have separate savegame memory cards or savegame memory internal to the DS (I find both rather unlikely), the only savegame memory types they may have used are EEPROM and flash.
<br/>
<br/>
This could mean both good and bad news... Good news could be that there is a chance inexpensive compact-flash style memories could be adapted to work with the DS. Bad news is that with block memory, one is relatively free to implement various copy protection / encryption / digital certificate technologies. Think this is the case?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, you can do some tricks with random access memory, but you cannot for example encrypt the entire cart and then decrypt it in realtime when running. This can be done with block addressed memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They look sturdy enough to me. Only reason GBA carts are thicker is that they contain a battery.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo says: "For its compact cards, the unit uses newly developed semiconductor memory, which allows for lower cost, shorter manufacturing time and memory capacity of more than one gigabit of information. "

<br/>
Shorter manufacturing time... Think they are talking about programmable memory, like flash or OTP EPROM?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm hoping that the DS has an OS-like interface that includes the RTC and PictoChat function so there is no need to keep swapping carts. I really do doubt that RTC can be built into a cart, with then being so small. I hope it's built-in the system along with save game memory because I am really tired of people borrowing my games and erasing them (especially Pokemon)

I don't think that would be a good idea. Maybe if the system still had save game memory built-in and you want to keep and extra copy, that would be all-right, otherwise, for general purpose saving, it would cause increased wear on the connectors. Kind of how some flash carts with external linkers are now, except much worse.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
