    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a Linksys BEFW11S4, which is an 802.11b router. . is there any possibility that something will be developed that would allow me to communicate it with my DS?
<br/>
<br/>
it'd be pretty sick to go online to find multiplayer games. . maybe upload some new games from the pc to the ds. . the router works with my xbox through the ethernet wire, so i'm hoping for something similar with the ds

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i would have, but "will my linksys befw11s4 802.11b router ever be able to communicate with my ds?" would be a bigger topic name, and i didnt want it to be too big. . well,.,i guess i could have called it "quick router question" or something,.,but i was more focused with writing the actual message and didn't find the subject that important. but maybe that would have been a better idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How about "linksys router question", or "future router compatibility", or something similar.  You don't have to ask your entire question in the subject, but some clue of what's within is very helpful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In theory i think the only way you could get the DS to communicate with a DS at the moment is with custom firmware, which is possible for the Linksys WAG54G and WRT54G. But even with this I dont know whether the wireless card inside has the level of control needed for communicating with a DS. And if you could communicate with it there would be nothing worth doing really (without being a god at customizing the firmware), its much more advisable to get one of the cards here <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a> and a GBA flashcart if you wanted to put other peoples (or your own) games on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting games at the moment playable over the net, well search for tunneling im sure you'll find lots of things. Basically there have been a few people who claimed to have done it but hadnt and some people say its impossible and some think it will happen one day. Well thats more than enough from me.

Edit: since the big N announced that there will be online games, people havent been putting so much effort into tunnelling</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
