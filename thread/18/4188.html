    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it turns out Nintendo plans on using the extra cartridge port functionality of the DS already with the Pokemon Dash game, putting the Emerald GBA game into the GBA cart slot with Dash playing unlocks extras.
<br/>
<br/>
Kind of weak, but the DS games being able to access this slot opens it up for a lot of options, I see it as the ultimate peripheral slot, I'm excited to see what crazy stuff they cram in there... DVD Player? Extra Storage like a HDD for MMO games...  The possiblities are mind boggling.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm surprised that Nintendo actually is using this idea themselves. I had written a post on the forums here talking about MMO games and updatable content. Who would have thought Nintendo would be actually doing it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see at the front the headphone jack and the once-mysterious headset jack, but at the back, there is a square hole near the stylus slot.  Any ideas?  I can't read japanese, otherwise the link provided above would be helpful.  If someone here can read japanese, then it's #13.  Thanks!

Edit:  oops.

Found a translate tool online, it's a stap hook.  I got excited over nothing.  Ugh, a strap?  Needless to say, I don't think I want that hanging off of my beautiful DS, unless it looks really cool and has magical properties.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It does. The strap doubles as some sort of stylus!<br/>_________________<br/>MPAA Rating: PG-13 for intense situations of peril.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for the magical stap, does it do anything else?  'Cause I could really use something to magically do all my dishes, do my taxes, download that blasted Doom3 demo a little faster, and make me look good in vests.  Not that I want to wear a vest, but it'd be nice if I at least would look good in one.

Make sure you have downloaded the latest drivers. And also, if you are using an ATI Radeon card, there are some options in the control panel that allow you to change preferences on the quality of DirectX and OpenGL performance.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hah, I always have the latest drivers.  Also, I've had bad experiences with ATI cards in the past, so I'm strictly nVidia.  My video card has some extra options for performance... mainly, the overclocking, which I bumped up about another 35% or so... I can finally do large amounts of particle affects without my framerate switching into the "second per frame" category!  lol</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
