    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guys, I am having a bit of trouble trying to explain to these people clearly the maximum size of the DS card. Some people seem to think that the minimum a DS card can hold is 128 MegaBYTES with games reaching well into 2 Gigabits.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was that the least a DS card could hold was 64 Megabits and at most, for now, 1 Gigabit. Anyone want to tell me otherwise?
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I am going to use this info and post it in this thread, so if you want to post here, feel free.

Are you sure it's 128 Megabytes? Because that would be quite a bit of space compared to the N64 era...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can see the model number <span style="font-weight: bold">MX23L12808</span>, which you can lookup on the Macronix site:

<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, the search isn't needed, since the capacity is actually in the model number <span style="font-style: italic">MX23L<span style="font-weight: bold">128</span>08</span>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it states it is 128 M bits. Future posts should remember Mb = megabits and MB = megabytes.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo did mention that the current max is 128 MB but that could theoretically be improved.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And for pedants like myself, let's not forget that "mega" means one million. Traditionally computer terminology has abused the small difference between 1000 and 1024, using "kilo" to mean 1024; as in 1KB "==" 1024 bytes.
<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully in 1998 the pedants had had enough and approved some new terminology: <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html." target="_blank">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html.</a> So we now have Kibibytes (KiB, 1024 bytes) and Mebibytes (MiB, 1024 KiB).
<br/>
<br/>
So now you know why your 20GB hard drive has only 18.6GiB of storage on it :)<br/>_________________<br/>---

Actually, there could be multiple reasons for the difference.  One being formatting.  Your system has to keep track of the data on the drive, so even if you actually had a 20GB (20 x 1024MB) HD, after formatting it, there would be less usable space on the drive.
<br/>
<br/>
Second being the advertising department.  Leave out the fact that is "sounds" better for the advertising department if they label a HD 20GB instead of the actual 19.53GB that it actually may be. Keep in mind that most advertising departments are not computer "savy" to begin with.  They probably don't even realize that 1 MB or GB is 1024, not 1000.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is not the same Mask ROM. The ROMs in the DS cards are specifically manufactured for Nintendo, and all attempts to get their spec sheets from Macronix have failed, since they are not able to reveal their specific design due to an agreement with Nintendo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yes, so the questions shouldn't be how big the max romsize could be, but how big is the adressspace of the cardrige-interface of the NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
more than 4GB
