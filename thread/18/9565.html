    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there anything (other than the wifi lib being a bit buggy) that prevents you to create a DS app which communicates with a LAN PC, so it sends a message to your pc (for example) at 192.168.0.2 - which then talks over the internet to a friends PC, and then sends the message to their DS (when they have the same DS app running)?
<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking, as this would serve quite a good simple method for multiplayer online homebrew games.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Dan2552 on Sun May 14, 2006 2:08 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well my method would help with firewalls I guess, maybe cause some extra problems if they have software firewalls

i'm not too sure how DS communicates so I don't know how easy it is to setup a P2P from one DS to another</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
using PCs between could even use a lightly modded IRC server (basically one which doesn't kick for flooding :p and it would have to be kept away from normal IRC clients) as the game server</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have noticed in MKDS, all the DS send and receive data to/from all other DS involved in the race.  Probably not the best use of bandwidth but its faster than using a relay server and probably is the best way of fault tolerance.  As for finding other opponents, build a lobby program that runs on a dedicated pc server connected to the internet and hard code its address into your game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
