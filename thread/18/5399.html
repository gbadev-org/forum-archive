    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">iDeaS is now able to load in PassME builds. I just tried it with Audio  Sampler.
<br/>
<br/>
Even though there is no sound emulation it does load in. So that's proof enough for me. iDeaS was also able to load in Battleship DS PassME Rom.
<br/>
<br/>
The extension for PassMEs is .pme so just put that at the end of your .ds.gba and they may load. Note of course this is still an emulator so it may or may not run :p.

Yes, the .pme is extension for PassMEs and they may load.

There is no sound emulation :)  I do not have a good idea on how to emulate it</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lino on Tue Apr 12, 2005 1:29 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
