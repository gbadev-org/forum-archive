    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys! I was wondering, are there any dswifi tutorials out there? I wanted to know how to connect to an access point using dswifi, but i cannot find any wifi examples with the ones that came with libnds... So can anyone point me to a tutorial, or post a small template on how to initialize the wifi and connect to an access point!
<br/>
Thank you,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too am looking for the same, it seems that the available wifi examples dont work with the current wifi libs, or maybe it's me doing something wrong. wha we need on this forum is one definitive wifi starter class from the ground up, how to setup wifi and make a basic connection to an access point, i've tried to compile the wifi example by Stephen Stair but cannot for the life of me get it to compile, i've changed the curtime refrences to time.curtime, i cannot figure out the heartbeat bussiness, this is why we ned to start from scratch with a tutorial.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
