I have an important task to answer, so hope, you can help.<br/>
Suppose, a great company has the most modern official developing tools and perhaps the necessary engine for his games.<br/>
If porting a great GTA 3 or Assassins Creed -like game from the iPhone to Nintendo DSi:<br/>
<br/>
1-  How many members are needed?<br/>
2-  And in what role?<br/>
3-  How long will this project last?<br/>
4-  What will be the most serious programming issues?<br/>
<br/>
I don't have more info on it.<br/>
Really Many- many Thanx for any help or any suggestion where I should look it up. <br/>
Bye.</div>

    <div class="postbody">Port a game from iPhone to DSi? There's a serious gap, in terms of power and 3D capabilities. So you might end up in reducing a lot of figures at best, rewrite a lot of code at worst. :|</div>

    <div class="postbody">It depends on the particular project. While at Gameloft, we were porting an iPhone game to 3DS, and the standard team size for that was:<br/>
<br/>
3 programmers (1 core engine, 1 gameplay, 1 tools and assets - although loosely defined roles because the type of work during the project varies)<br/>
3 artists (modeller, animator, UI artist - for adapting assets)<br/>
Producer, game designer (yes, game design will change!), sound designer, manual design (don't forget you must have a digital manual!) etc.<br/>
Plus testing team. I would budget for 12-15 people.<br/>
<br/>
As for time, in our case we had the benefit of the source game using an engine that supported the target platform. In those circumstances, 3 months for the initial port, 2-3 months for cleanup/lot check/etc. Without engine support for the target platform, I would add another 3 months for the initial port.<br/>
<br/>
Most serious issues will be asset issues (less memory), complying with lot check guidelines, potentially the stereoscopic rendering depending on how the engine is structured etc.<br/>
<br/>
As for DSi... Best of luck :P I would estimate 9-11 months for that, though could be more or less... hard to know with so little information.</div>
