<br/>
<br/>
You walk a street down L.A and are searching for Hotspots with your DS.
<br/>
Then you find a Acesspoint (an Wlan Router maybe) that is WEP secured but you DONT have the Key because this is the Router of a rich kingpin.
<br/>
<br/>
So would it be able that someone of you could make\invent a programm for the DS to find out the WEP Key based on this turtoial: <a href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/2005/03/31/the_feds_can_own_your_wlan_too/" target="_blank">http://www.tomsnetworking.com/2005/03/31/the_feds_can_own_your_wlan_too/</a>
<br/>
index.html ?
<br/>
<br/>
Or this turtial: <a href="http://docs.lucidinteractive.ca/index.php/Cracking_WEP_and_WPA_Wireless_Networks#Checklist" target="_blank">http://docs.lucidinteractive.ca/index.php/Cracking_WEP_and_WPA_Wireless_Networks#Checklist</a>

this Program (aircrack: <a href="http://www.michiganwireless.org/tools/aircrack/" target="_blank">http://www.michiganwireless.org/tools/aircrack/</a>)

<br/>
and maybe this one (Kismet <a href="http://www.michiganwireless.org/tools/" target="_blank">http://www.michiganwireless.org/tools/</a>)aircrack/

That's maybe 3.2ghz of CPU power and 512MB+ of RAM each. The DS has 99mhz and 4MB. I wouldn't expect to get it done in any reasonable amount of time.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is ARCFOUR insecure? I think I found a CiperSaber-2 that makes ARCFOUR to be more secure by scrambling the key multiple times<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i might be making some new "friends" now: screw you wannabe hackers! reverse engineering is art, hacking and cracking is shit! even using rich peoples devices is shit, imo.
<br/>
<br/>
if you REALLY need to check your mail on the road, do it with your goddamn mobile phone or leave it! you REALLY NEED it? you pay for it! (or ask kindly for temporary permission...) well for some guys it looks easier to wait for hours scanning and cracking keys to get to their mails, instead of pulling out the mobile...
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i doubt you would use such a tool for that purpose.

someone edit this shit out and close this thread. it makes me sick. this is such a fine community...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
