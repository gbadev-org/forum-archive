<br/>
my questions:
<br/>
<br/>
how can i get a background on the touch screen
<br/>
how can i put sprites on the touch screen and top screen
<br/>
how can i print text on top of a background
<br/>
<br/>
PLZ HELP ME and dont give the : go look on the various tutorials or find it online, also dont say go look in the examples cause i have checked and the examples dont specify what in need. I know there are background example put it is only for the top screen (not touch) and the sprites one is sprites created through the ds.All the manuals that give in sight DONT HELP either cause the are all outdated or not complete(which are most likely outdated)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're just starting DS Development, I suggest PAlib (www.palib.info), it is a programming library that uses easy codes where you don't have to deal with VRAM or anything, just use PA_LoadEasyBg() to load backgrounds, PA_CreateSprite() to create sprites, and top screen is 1 and bottom is 2.  I use it for a lot of stuff, though it's not good for things that want to boot other programs or do anything with external libraries (Libfat works fine though).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Based on reading your posts in this thread, I believe even palib would be a bit above your head. Everything you requested is in the examples and is covered in tutorials. You are either lying (about having checked the examples and tutorials) or you just aren't proficient yet. Now, granted, there is no one example or tutorial that specifies exactly what you need but all the information is there.

PAlib has a command reference, something I'd really like to have for libnds, a full, complete command reference.  If I were you, I'd at least try PAlib, and once you're familiar with it, you'll have a better understanding of how to do some things, then you can transition to the harder libnds coding.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Follow the wiki tutorials at PAlib's site, it says you can use Visual C++ 2005 Express + the PAlib appwizard (which works for libnds as well) so you can use a good IDE for your DS.  I've had no problems using the VC++ method, and it works with libfat and everything.  PAlib also has full source code, so you can read it for reference too.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

It's true that the example is for putting sprites on the top screen.  Putting things on the bottom screen is pretty easy, but I certainly wouldn't say that there is any good tutorial for it.
<br/>
<br/>
That being said you shouldn't expect anyone here to lay things out on a silver platter.  You were given plenty of suggestions on the backgrounds, which you later said you had solved, but apparantly now you haven't?  As for the sprites, given where you are at it seems you should focus on getting them to work on the main screen before jumping ahead to putting them on the sub screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have an understanding for how the sprite setup works and what everything means, you should browse through the libnds header files and look for where the definitions used in the sprite example are, nearby each of those should be the equivalent definition to use for setting things up on the subscreen.  Like relpats_eht said, mostly you just need to add Sub or SUB_ or _SUB to the various function and constant names.
<br/>
<br/>
Try looking in:
<br/>
DevKitPro\libnds\include\nds\memory.h

DevKitPro\libnds\include\nds\arm9/video.h</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have got the backgrounds to work on the main screen only cause that the only one im focused on for now. I do thanks you and the other that helped me very much in accomplishing that and i appreciate it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now i have moved on to adding sprites like i have stated and i dont know how to get both the background and the sprites up at the same time(truely i dont know how to get the sprites)
<br/>
<br/>
i have looked over the Pataer soft intro to ds programming but it seems to be out of date, because i get a lot of error after i compile i even if i copy all the source code and try to fix it.
<br/>
<br/>
i just am asking fro an up to date tutorial that will tell me how to put sprites in and that dosent include palib</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The complex 2d turorial shows how to use sprites loaded from .pcx files, to make .pcx files use GIMP and under image set mode to indexed. Since sprites use diffrent vram banks from backgrounds there isnt much code that is diffrent from plain sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
Sprites have a priority attribute, a higher one means its on a higher layer (make sure its greater than your BG).
<br/>
<br/>
The TONC tutorials are very good at explaining the principals of 2D hardware, for example code reads ndslib headers or go to chris double's website.

True, using a GUI may be nicer the first time, or if you do not plan to change the background after you have converted it. But if you use a command line, then you can stick it in the makefile and have it automatically re-convert the image every time you rebuild the project if you have changed the original image.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
