    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to use bankswitching to access rom beyond 32MB.  The addresses and data to write to, and unlock sequences vary between flash cartridge models.
<br/>
<br/>
After bankswitching, it just changes the base address of the cartridge.  Same 08000000-09FFFFFF, but they point to different bytes now.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't know if the base address is write-only or not, you could try reading the value after unlocking the cartridge, or better yet just store the base address in memory somewhere.

Is there any way for checking the unlock sequence like the above neoflash for other flashcarts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
