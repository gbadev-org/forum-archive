    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i am trying to make a much-more-noob version of DSOrganize but some codes that i am trying to use are not working! ...i am using devKit and a R4DS(MicroSD) in a DSLite.
<br/>
<br/>
1.: gba_nds_fat working with dldi...in DLDI page there is a setup "tutorial", but i can't put it to work! Or a fatlib with directory and files management...
<br/>
<br/>
2.: drawing multiple Sprites...i want to draw sprites with diferent images (BMP), i am using the devKit's Sprite_Bitmap example but again nothing...:p
<br/>
<br/>
3.: does anyone know some good libs for image process?
<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Describing your problems as "not working", won't help us help you! In order to find solutions we will need more detailed information about the errors.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">gba_nds_fat:</span> if you look at the source of disc_io.c, you will find a function that attempts to discover the current device that is plugged in. You will need to prepend the piece of DLDI code before the first attempt, so that your program will look for the DLDI-specified device before all others. If you want to, you can even remove all the other drivers and only leave the DLDI driver in to make your binaries smaller. Actually, that's the only reason to use gba_nds_fat, because right now, libfat is the better solution as it has DLDI support built-in and it can also handle directory queries! Just update your DevKitARM installation to r20. Seriously, <span style="font-weight: bold">use libfat.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">16-bit sprites</span>: I am guessing that you say "nothing" as in "they don't appear on screen". The thing is, with 16-bit aka bitmap sprites (or backgrounds), you have to set the alpha-bit as well. Simply set bit15 of all your values to 1 when you copy to VRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Imageformat library</span>: I'm looking for one as well. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what directory queries, because any in my R20 version is related with directory listing...this can be a windows function, so please tell me :)
<br/>
<br/>
the problem with my sprites is that the data that i put in SPRITE_GFX (BMP), i put data like this&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 32*32; i++)
<br/>
{
<br/>
     SPRITE_GFX[i] = RGB15(31,0,0);
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 32*32; i++)
<br/>
{
<br/>
   SPRITE_GFX[ (32*32) + i ] = RGB15(0,0,31);
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
i don't know to access this data... in SpriteEntry</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
