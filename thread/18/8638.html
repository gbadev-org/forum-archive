OK, I build the installer with release v1.1 now, I made a few more changes. R button no longer works. To change the palette, go to CONFIGURATION menu and press left/right to adjust it.

Also a few questions:
<br/>
* How to clear screen? The clear screen function doesn't seem to work. It just make error when compiled.
<br/>
* How do you write settings to firmware? I found code to read <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Main/Firmware" target="_blank">http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Main/Firmware</a> but how to write?

Hi, I am currently about to release an internet chat program, uses sgstair's library (so it's UDP).
<br/>
<br/>
You can test it at:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://bafio.drunkencoders.com/wifichat.nds" target="_blank">http://bafio.drunkencoders.com/wifichat.nds</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The DS part is quite ready (I have many changes in mind, but for later) the server part is almost completed and will be released as well. For now it connects to my server. Also, all conversations are public now and will be displayed on a web page (at least for my server now).
<br/>
<br/>
the settings are the usual for the library (static ip, no wep) and are loaded from the firmware or from a file in the CF (see wifi transfer).

I modified the flash_verify function to include waiting for the write enable latch to be set, as that is how the official firmware does it, when changing the settings.

Specifically, I fixed an issue where some game cards would not load, due to those games expecting the memory to be cleared out prior to loading.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I made it possible to return to the main menu from the config menu.  I also fixed the issue with the screen not being cleared out, when going to the config menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I modified the installer to display a percentage progress rather than ******* that are erased, as each page is flashed.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the updater was modified to deal with DS systems that have all but the last 8 pages of the firmware protected.  It will now ask users of such DS systems to short SL1, and also displays a progress as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, scratch any of the previous code given.  There was already a load/save personal settings function present in settings.c.  I also added into that same file, load/save wifi settings as well. hopefully I got the crc16 calculation code on that section correct.

Thanks! It was already possible to return to the main menu from config menu by pressing START, but now there are 2 ways (which is better, as it is less confusing). I will be able to work on it on the weekend then I can post a new version here (I am not near my computer during the work/school week).
<br/>
<br/>
I must also add a new readme file (the one in there is for the old minimal firmware, I will keep it there and add a second one, and a printable manual file), and I should probably make the palette setting to be the color setting instead. Setting 0 (gray) will be the default colors, the other ones will be other palettes.
<br/>
<br/>
And I also need examples for UDP (it will be changed to TCP once TCP works), and time/date view and set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Auto-start doesn't work yet, but you can select "LOAD NITRO FROM GBA" to load a software PassMe/FlashMe does. You just have to move the cursor down and press select. I need an example for auto-detecting what you want to start before I can make that work, though.

<ul>* Color and language is now selected by name, rather than number.
<br/>
* Went with tepple's suggestion, on naming of menu items, from nitro to ds.
<br/>
* Main menu now displays the state of the ds card slot/gba slot.  (if something is loaded or not.)
<br/>
* GBA bus is given to the ARM9 now, so memdump now displays the contents of gba carts.  GBA bus is given back to the ARM7, in case of loading DS.gba or GBA.
<br/>
* Added Return with save, and return without save to the user pref menu. * Return with save actually saves the user preferences to the firmware.
<br/>
* Invalid birthday for month can no longer be selected now.
<br/>
* Updater has been removed.
<br/>
* Installer now displays what part of the firmware is being written to.
<br/>
* Installer accurately displays percentage of firmware written, based on firmware currently present on the DS.  So, if only one byte has changed from last revision to current, it doesn't display something like 68% written, rather, it displays 0% instead, to indicate that it hasn't actually written anything, as the previous bytes have not changed.</ul></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Updated fwnitro,  now 1.3b  (leaving 1.4 to zzo38computer).  This time, autostart has been implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
It boots up in the order of DS game card if inserted,  then DS.gba if it detects Gamename DSBooter or Gamecode PASS,  then after that, it boots GBA, if detected.   Holding Start bypasses autostart regardless of the setting, just the same way as the official firmware does it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also made the GBA screen/auto start setting in user prefs more descriptive than 1/0.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
1) You asked what colours we would like. Why not just give the ability to choose any RGB15 value? Just use simple text-based sliders or numbers to specify a number from 0 to 31 for each.
<br/>
2) Since FlashMe boots DS.gba regardless of what's in the DS slot, I imagine people are used to that. (The DS.gba app becomes like a 'fake' firmware where one could potentially add options to do the things the real one does.) Could boot order be configured, the way PC BIOSes allow you to choose which devices to boot from and disable some? It's essentially the same concept. For example you could have DS.gba boot first, then DS card if it's not present, and the firmware if that's not there (never auto-starting the GBA game) if you wanted.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's also a good reason to have GBA games start out on the bottom screen: the bottom screen uses BGR order like the original GBA and the GBA SP, while the top screen uses RGB order, screwing up any subpixel tricks that the game is using.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Both are good ideas, but where will the settings be stored? They could be stored in the wrong place and mess up things. If they are stored in the same place as the other settings (or even if they aren't), they could be messed up in case they were reserved for future use and now they are used. Same thing happened with Wifi settings with FlashMe. If you have an idea on how to store these settings, I will do this.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, why was the updater removed? Now can you use Installer without SL1 to update the unprotected part of the firmware? According to what caitsith2 wrote, I think you can. I will work on v1.4 on the weekend.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One thing I could do, is set a "extended-settings" flag at the end of the user message. If the user message is less than 26 characters long, and character 26 of the message is set to a specific value (the extended-setting version number) then it will use extended settings in the reserved part, otherwise it will not use extended settings. That will fix it in case the reserved part becomes used for something else, you can disable extended settings until a new version of FWNITRO comes out that uses a different reserved part.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

New this time.
<br/>
<br/>
* Full Editing of Wifi Connection settings. (no means to test them, just edit them)
<br/>
* Full Profile editing, including nickname/message.
<br/>
* (In case it isn't obvious, there is an onscreen keyboard.)
<br/>
* Scroller Text (optional compile in option) (You can change the scroll text by modifying
<br/>
                 scroller.txt, then running scroll_text_changer.exe)
<br/>
* MKDS offline course hack. (Another thing you can choose to compile in or not.)
<br/>
* DS Game Card Dumper (Also another compile in option.) (finally, an easy to use DS game card dumper.)
<br/>
* Bug fixes in Autostarting options.
<br/>
* Autostart now autostarts a DS game card with the auto start flag set. (You can still get to the menu with start+select).
<br/>
* Key combinations added to boot what you want at startup. (L+R+A for DS, L+R+X for DS.GBA, L+R+Y for GBA).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Isn't anything new there yet, but I am working on it right now
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About compiling it:
<br/>
<br/>
The reason you can't compile (it says "no media") is because it is set for absolute paths. Type "make clean" and then type "make" and it will compile. "No newline at end of file" is a warning, it will not cause it not to compile (probably the reason for this warning is in case it is an include file, it might mess it up by putting 2 lines on one line instead, but I don't know everything about this compiler, so I'm not really sure).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by zzo38computer on Tue Mar 14, 2006 5:26 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

That about puts it right.  When done at the firmware level, you have direct access to the decrypted secure area, and you know 100% where that area is.  Also, unlike flash cart solutions, there is no possibility of the region being contaminated/cleared out accidently.

Yeah, I have to agree with you on this one.  I only wish Nintendo could have spent another month to do further testing.  Lag is not an issue with shroom ridge, or any of the other courses, in regards of tracking where everything is, as each DS is calculating where the objects are.  The only lag that is an issue, is where each of the player karts are.

Dual-booting isn't really an option,  at least not without physically modifying the DS (replacing the 256KB eeprom with a larger one, like 512KB.), as well as modifying the bootstrap to allow selection of what one to load, not to mention, probably compressing both of the firmwares.

Yes it does.  Same restore keys as flashme,  (A + B + START + SELECT).  The source code to this restore functionality is contained in the installer source, referred to as the bootstrap. I do not recommend messing with that section of the source code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the space the gui will take is the smallest issue.

One thing that someone mentioned in the thread is to have the firmware look at the flashcart for plugins or even guielements such as a custom wallpaper.

Not necessarily, except that:
<br/>
-It barely takes up any room.
<br/>
-It is best achieved through the firmware.
<br/>
-It could eventually be turned into an open-ended patching program. (Its presence could inspire somebody to do that).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

A small mockup, on my believes why a gui wouldn't hurt..
<br/>
<br/>
more fancy graphics compared to regular pixel-firmware, icons to the left with more drop-down alternatives as shown, textbox when holding or clicking the icons.
<br/>
<br/>
plugins could perhaps even be able to add more buttons to the interface when the firmware starts and loads them.
<br/>
<br/>
file/homebrew browser?, which applies to both the slot-2 memory and if an FAT-driver compatible flashcart is inserted, it browses the CF/SD card memory.

this graphical part could be compressed down to 10-15 or so kb with smart tiling. icons could each be around 300-400 bytes depending on complexity.[/img]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am thinking of removing the Mario Kart Hack and scrolling screen and replacing both with things more generic. So you could enter codes/read codes from GBA cartridge to use (something like Action Replay does). The scrolling screen will probably replaced with date/time display, name display, and user message display. Also should be a way to load plugins from the GBA cartridge (such as a GUI), although a GUI is never planned to be built-in (for one thing, I prefer text-only).

About the screen only displaying black when a DS card is inserted, that is a bug in the software, which either I or caitsith2 must correct.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
That was because the installer was hard coded to install only on DS systems with firmware ID code "MACP", which is v1-3.   v4-5 have ID code "MACg", v6 (DS lite) has firmware ID code "MACh", and IQue DS has firmware ID code "MAC[0xC2]".
<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, I changed the installer to now generate the firmware encryption key based on the ID code present in the system.   The reason the addition of flashme allowed you to install hbfirmware, was that flashme overwrote the ID code with "MACP", rather than build its bootstrap for the current firmware ID code.  The changed installer is now in the uploaded 1.4A release.
<br/>
<br/>
Im guessing that nintendo changed the firmware ID codes, assuming that because we have the encryption key for "MACP", we could decrypt the newer versions if they didn't change.  of course we knew not just the "MACP" encryption code, but the master code used to create it, plus nintendo has a convenient way to detect what DS systems you are running the software on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I imagine so. The secure area should remain there until you actually run the game, whose code would overwrite it with something else. (That is, everything is running at firmware level until you start the game.) Download Play blanks it out as a precaution (hence why you can't boot DS carts from hbfirmware through WMB), but that's about it.

Just a note, as far as I can tell the SC's SD card is in standby mode (and inaccessable) unless the supercard boots its internal software. I have only tested this by wifi with chishms FAT library (and did not add any delay to see if it was only initially unavailable), but I was unable to wake/access the SD card with my limited knowledge without using the supercards bootup sequence first (essentially if its in standby one must send the SD card a special command to wake it and then likely a mode command to put it in serial mode). Its possible this is handled internally by the hardware after a bit of time, but it could also be a problem with the M3SD as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can already test fwnitro without installing it.

After unzipping the download file, go to the file named "firmware" and flash firmware.ds.gba to your storage medium and boot it. (If you use

That is what I said at first, but maybe, after everything else works, I might add some graphics as well (but it will be optional, you can disable graphics if you wish, still). I'm not sure yet, but if I do, it won't be until everything else works first.

Are you using the 1.4c release by zzo38computer?.  At one point, I had uploaded 1.4a, and was preparing to post for its release, and at the last minute, uncovered a show stopping bug.  I had to postpone that release.  I think zzo38computer downloaded that build, not realizing that was not meant for public consumption.
<br/>
<br/>
The 1.4a release that is out now, is actually more current than the 1.4c release. (the 1.4c release doesn't have the dump game card code in it, and it has the old wifi connection settings read/write code, that sometimes locks up on the DS. (That was the last minute show stopping bug I found.)).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, yes, you do have to have the original MKDS game card inserted in order to use the offline course hack.
<br/>

Yup, chishm's hack is now detected as a commercial game and bans your MK:DS Game Card from WFC if used. This way it doesn't run directly from the GBA Slot, so it can't get banned! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm.  After experiencing some 2 black screen lockups with a game I own,  I have determined that I may have to rewrite the DS game card loading routine, to conform with the exact memory clearing nintendo does.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically,  the process is code for ARM7 DS game card loading/ram clearing sits at 0x38F600, and clears out 0x2300000-0x23FEE00, as well as 0x37F8000-0x38F600.  Additionally, ARM9 code for this process sits at 0x23FE00, which does its little thing.  Both of them jump to their respective code spaces derived from the header, after the DS card arm7/9 binary is loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
The CRT0 in the ARM7/9 binaries of the DS card is then responsible for clearing out 0x38F600-0x38FF00, and 0x2200000-0x2300000 and 0x23FEE00-0x23FF800.   Most DS cards work without some of the memory ranges cleared out, but some of them explicitly rely on these memory ranges cleared out, and if they are not cleared out, you get the 2 black screens.
<br/>
<br/>
This means I am now going to take a crash course writing some DS card loading bootstraps that will properly do these tasks, and end the 2 black screen lockup once and for all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd suggest just making a simple shell of sorts. All it would include is code to read (not write) CF/SD and the basic options (run GBA/NDS card, run from GBA slot, and maybe download and run if it doesn't take up too much space). Anything else would be loaded from some specially-named directory on the memory card (you could even choose the directory name/path at compile time). You just list the files, without extension, choose one, and run it; it loads into some unused part of RAM and gets executed. It'd be just like having them built in, but they're actually stored on the card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">..Only one problem...
<br/>
<br/>
FWNITRO hangs when reading sector 0 of the SD card when run from the INSTALLED firmware. So this is how I got it to write to the SD card while having FWNITRO installed:
<br/>
<br/>
USING MY VERSION OF FWNITRO 1.4D:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Put in a DS cart in the slot. Put the SCSD with a SD card inside into the GBA slot. The firmware version must be on the SD card. Rename firmware.ds.gba to firmware.nds and make sure its on there.
<br/>
2. Turn on the DS while holding in START+SELECT to override the autostart and boot into FWNITRO menu (prevents black screens it seems too!).
<br/>
3. Goto LOAD DS FROM GBA and press SELECT.
<br/>
4. In the Supercard menu select firmware.nds and right after selecting it, hold down START+SELECT to bypass the autostart again.
<br/>
5. Choose DUMP CARD in the menu...
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have FWNITRO installed, just use firmware.ds.gba renamed to firmware.nds and put it on the SD CARD. Follow the instructions 3 to 5 above.
<br/>
<br/>
AND NOW THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING... :(
<br/>
When FWNITRO is loaded from the firmware the DS cards header is wrong. It's displayed as . and ####. It writes a 128KB file titled ####.nds appropriately to the SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
Two solutions I'm thinking of...
<br/>
1. Get the installed firmware to stop hanging at sector 0 of reading the SD card.
<br/>
2. Figure out how to detect the DS cards header properly from within FlashMe + the firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
Route 2 is easier it seems, but that's on my end of things. For the FWNITRO team, getting route 1 to work would be optimal imho.
<br/>
<br/>
Download the source + installer + firmware for my edited version of FWNITRO 1.4D at:

<br/>
FWNITRO team: I encourage you to use the above source to get the Dump to work on SC SD. If you need help let me know. It was the best I could do.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How big is your SD card? DS cards are big (I think 128MB max, capable of 4GB); maybe it's messing up because you don't have enough space?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it sounds like the problem is probably in your write code. Did you try modifying the parts in the existing FWNITRO code that get this information, and just having them display it on the screen? That'd tell you whether it's actually reading wrong or the file writing is just messed up.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and about my idea above, thought of a nice addition. When looking for the modules or whatever you want to call them, if it finds one with a specific name (autoexec.xxx or whatever), run it automatically. Then when you have your memory card inserted with several megabytes of space, you can store a cool graphical interface on it, and when you don't, you get the standard text menu.
<br/>
<br/>
How risky is making your own firmware anyway? I imagine I could just test most of it by running it as _BOOT_MP.nds on GBAMP or similar; my only real concern is botching some code in the write-protected sector and bricking my DS. Is there any initialization I have to do when making the bootstrap code, or can I just immediately read the button status and jump to the GBA slot if they match something (to have a recovery code like FlashMe does)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I replaced everything related to GBA_NDS_FAT, which is basically the gba_nds_fat.c, disc_io.c, and io_xxx.c inside the ARM9 firmware directory. I used Moonshell V1.1's implementation of GBA_NDS_FAT. I didn't modify much from Moonshell's code. There's some new files including scsd.s which is the ARM assembly code for handling SD read/writes to the card.
<br/>
<br/>
CF support is included, as it *should* work with:
<br/>
Neoflash MK2 MMC Card support
<br/>
GBA Movie Player support
<br/>
M3 Perfect CF support
<br/>
Supercard CF support
<br/>
Supercard SD support
<br/>
M3 Perfect SD support (can't write)
<br/>
Flash Cart support
<br/>
<br/>
I can only test with the SC SD and possibly a FlashAdvance 2 Pro flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Any clue why the DS card's header's game ID is replaced with #### when used as a .nds with FlashMe? Or why it would crash when dumping inside the FAT_InitFiles when reading sector 0 of the SD card when used as actual installed firmware? Not sure why there would be a difference in it's behaviour between the two ways of running it.
<br/>
<br/>
If I changed too much code for your taste, I might be able to just implement io_scsd.c and scsd.s instead of a full GBA_NDS_FAT library replacement.

It's a firmware, it doesn't need them.
<br/>
Look at the BIOS setup on a PC or Open Firmware on a PPC Mac (EFI on Intel Macs), they don't have OR NEED graphics.
<br/>
You don't spend enough time in them to need the graphics and their functionality isn't enhanced by graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
And modules, whilst a good idea (as pointed out by someone earlier in this or the homebrew firmware thread) are kinda stupid, unless they were completely optional.

I don't think that's a job for the firmware really, more like a job for moonshell or something, a shell you want to use.

I didn't create this function, I believe caitsith2 did, maybe they will answer when they are available (if they know!).
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that I would find useful (but I'm not quite sure how to make it work) is if that option is compiled in, you can put a _auto.nds file on the CF card (or SD card, and it should work M3 or SuperCard or anything else) then when you load DS from GBA or Autostart, it will automatically start that file instead of booting the GBA cartridge directly.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I wonder if you can do on a NDS, sound by tones (like the GBC does) rather than by loading a sound file.

Yes. Six of the Nintendo DS sound channels have an alternate square waveform of 1/8 to 7/8 duty in 1/8 duty steps, and two have an alternate sample-and-hold binary noise waveform. Or you can synthesize waveforms in RAM and point the DS sound hardware there.

Yes, I will make _boot_mp.nds instead (it can be used in case some cards, such as SuperCard CF, don't support it automatically).

<br/>
This could get confusing. Why not make toggling the backlight an option in the main menu? If someone finds out how to adjust the brightness on DS Lite, you could use the same option for this (make it a compile-time option to choose whether you use normal or Lite); on normal DS it's just On/Off, and on Lite it's V. High/High/Low/V.Low/Off.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the whole idea of making your own firmware is pretty awesome, but I really don't like some of the controls (Select to open, L/R to toggle light, etc); they don't match the sort of "standard" most games/apps use. Is it possible to make the buttons configurable? Just defining them in a header file would be fine. (Put something like <span style="font-style: italic">#define MENU_SELECT_BUTTON SELECT</span> in the header, then check for MENU_SELECT_BUTTON instead of SELECT (or whatever you named it) in the main loop.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If we could just get loopy to update flashme, to put the correct firmware ID code back in place,  then the firmware code can be used to detect what system fwnitro is running on, and use that to determine the backlight settings available.  "MACp" is DS with Firmware versions 1, 2 or 3.  "MACg" is DS with Firmware versions 4 and 5.  "MACh" is DS lite (version 6 and up).

<br/>
Actually, the whole name is there for hitorical reasons. The original GBAMP FW hack (v1) was written in ASM in under 800 bytes. For this reason I couldn't parse long directory entries. I also wanted to pad the name out to 8.3 characters, since that completely fills a directory entry and can be checked with 3 comparisons (3 data words). I placed the underscore character at the beginning to separate it from the rest of the dirctory in file listings. 
<br/>
<br/>
It was specifically _BOOT_MP.NDS because it was called to properly boot the NDS from the GBAMP (since the FW was merely a bootstrap loader). 
<br/>
<br/>
But since we are no longer woking within the limitations of the 800 byte NDSMP v1, we can choose a better name. For consistency, I recommend _BOOT_DS.NDS, but perhaps someone can come up with a better alternative.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">excellent work on the FWN zz and caitsith. I am always happy to see an update of this. I am not 100% certain but I think moonshell / infantile put a method to adjust the dslite's lighting.
<br/>
<br/>
zodttd and anyone else who is wondering why it freezes when trying to dump to an SD card- I said it before in this thread already! If you read the few public docs on SD/SD in SPI mode you will see that on initial powerup they are set to a wait/sleep state and are nearly inaccessable. The current FAT driver works on the assumption that the inital powerup is already taken care of by the supercard kernel. (I am also looking at this with the assumption that the internal chip hardware on both devices does nothing to start the SD interface on its own)
<br/>
<br/>
The ~solution; implement the function to wake the memory card (bring it out of idle state) and set it to SPI <span style="font-style: italic">after</span> detecting SD media. A HAlayer version of this for PIC chips works something like this:
<br/>
-write 0xFF to input/tx 10 times (get and trash the response each time)
<br/>
-sendCommand(CMD0) with no other data aside from crc
<br/>
-if response is 1 then sendCommand(CMD1) (as above) until card response is not zero or it has been done 256 times
<br/>
-write 0xFF again to tx
<br/>
<br/>
When a SD card is first powered up (or reset), the only thing it will respond to is CMD5 (used to start sdio and not SPI mode?) and CMD0. All others will fail, which is likely why the driver halts on the first CMD to read that is sent to the SC/M3 serial SD interface.
<br/>
<br/>
The HALayer for SD/MMC that I am referring to can be found as "Portable FAT Library for MCU Applications" on circuit cellar (by Ivan Sham - <a class="postlink" href="ftp://ftp.circuitcellar.com/pub/Circuit_Cellar/2005/176/Sham176.zip" target="_blank">sham176.zip</a>) - have a look for yourself though, I am by no means 100% certain this is all that would have to be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry about that Cory. I misunderstood your original post.
<br/>
<br/>
That explains a lot though. It's why the SD driver works after booting through the Supercard kernel, but not straight from the firmware. This was when using my mashed up code with sd.s.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can get the Supercard SD working when I find more freetime. Hopefully someone will take your advice even quicker though, since you basically laid it out as good as it gets.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw though, in 1.4D the same error occurs on an M3 Perfect CF. I wasn't expecting it to fail at FAT_InitFiles() when using a supported CF module. But it did. FWNITRO 1.4A works though, although I Had to move the ' j= ' line right after where FAT_fopen() is to get it to read the dump filesize properly. This seems to be already fixed in 1.4D, but 1.4A needed this change.
<br/>
<br/>
My guess is something beyond the FAT library is causing this error. But as cory laid out, even if this error is fixed, someone would still need to wake up the SD card as explained. :(
<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the great work on FWNITRO! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Probably the next release will have it enabled, but you can also enable it in options.h and recompile it (if you have devkitpro). Although eventually this feature will be replaced with a more general feature, which can work with all games (hacking files could be stored on CF cards or whatever).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Man, this keeps getting better, and only 106K so far. :-) Some things I noticed:
<br/>
<br/>
-When you select "LOAD DS CARD" and no card is inserted (or you booted it from WMB), it switches to "NO DS GAME CARD". Why not just show that from the beginning?
<br/>
-DS DOWNLOAD PLAY doesn't appear to work, I'm guessing it's still not implemented. I'd suggest at least adding "(not implemented)" or some such to it. Or heck, show descriptions of what the options do on the bottom screen; the description for this could just say it doesn't work.
<br/>
-Is it supposed to show my name and such? It only shows the menu, time/date and keyboard. Maybe this is because I used WMB, but my apps can access user settings through WMB fine (dunno if it works the same as if it's booted from firmware, but the point is it's possible). In fact on the USER PREF menu, it shows nothing for name and "WR" for message. Maybe it's just because these are in Japanese?
<br/>
-Having an built in RAM dumper, while kinda useless, is cool. The layout is a bit lacking, though. Showing the last few digits on the left and ASCII on the right would be a plus.
<br/>
-The alarm clock function is cool, but I can't seem to figure out how to work it. Pressing Y makes it go off and X stops it, but there's no place to set the time (unless I'm supposed to use the user pref menu, which isn't very convenient). This option isn't documented either, and why is POWER OFF in the middle of the menu?
<br/>
-I can't access the MKDS course hack through WMB, which makes sense since it can't load the game anyway (though MKDS is inserted). However, I can when I run the app from GBAMP, it just won't start the game. O_o
<br/>
<br/>
Hm, it won't even run the DS card if I put it on my GBAMP as _BOOT_MP.nds. Though if I do that, then select LOAD DS FROM GBA, it recognizes that no DS card is inserted immediately.
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, if you can get Download Play working, and maybe make the alarm clock a little less heart-attack-inducing, this will have every feature I need. :-) BTW, you still have a screenshot of V1.1 up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is whats new in fwnitro 1.6A
<br/>
* Rewrote scroll_text_changer, so that the previous need to copy it and scroller.txt to appropiate directory is obsoleted.  Now the program just applies the changes to all of the builds with the scroller option enabled. (As such, I rewrote the scroll text changer instructions to reflect this.) (You can still change it the old way if you wish. It will still work that way.)
<br/>
* It is now possible to start a DS game card or GBA gamepak with the backlight off.  Starting ds from gba with backlight off is pointless as most homebrew applications just turn the backlight back on anyways.
<br/>
* onscreen keyboard now plays it click sound.
<br/>
* Fixed a rare, but serious bug, that allowed a user to completely erase his nickname. (which could potentially cause some problems in official NDS games, and possibly the 20109 error in Nintendo WFC enabled games.)  This bug can be caused in earlier versions by completely erasing your nickname in the change nickname option, hitting start, then hitting B to cancel the change.
<br/>
* Closing the lid while in alarm clock now turns off the backlight.
<br/>
* Changes to the personal message are now properly displayed.
<br/>
* Scroller does not scroll while autostarting anymore.
<br/>
* Pushing A/B on the alarm clock settings now behaves the same as setting the Hour/Minute in the Real Time clock settings.

Well, the bios properly sets the required invalid flag, if no DS card was inserted initially.  However, there is no quick way to detect every frame if the DS card was removed.  It is however correctly detected if the card was removed at one point, when you do try to select it.  (Card hardware state no longer matches DS hardware state.)

<br/>
Whats New
<br/>
* Main Menu rearranged.  Now all primary settings are at top, Optional compile settings below that, and finally, power off at the bottom of the menu.
<br/>
* It is now easier to change the alarm clock settings, right from the alarm clock itself. (Push A to go to alarm clock settings.)
<br/>
* Alarm clock now has a snooze function.  Snooze function silences alarm for 10 minutes, "not bloody 9 minutes!!".  Also, pushing the B button more than once, adds 10 minutes to the snooze time up to 90 minutes. (this feature is definitely not in the official firmware.)
<br/>
* The alarm clock no longer turns back on immediately after shut off, if it went off due to the Time being equal to the personal alarm clock setting, and the time is still equal to personal alarm clock setting.
<br/>
* Unlike official firmware, Alarm clock does NOT shut off after one minute,  and unlike most alarm clocks,  it does NOT shut off after 2 hours. It goes on till the end of time, battery dies, or you shut it off.
<br/>
<br/>

In fact on the USER PREF menu, it shows nothing for name and "WR" for message. Maybe it's just because these are in Japanese?
<br/>
-Having an built in RAM dumper, while kinda useless, is cool. The layout is a bit lacking, though. Showing the last few digits on the left and ASCII on the right would be a plus.
<br/>
-The alarm clock function is cool, but I can't seem to figure out how to work it. Pressing Y makes it go off and X stops it, but there's no place to set the time (unless I'm supposed to use the user pref menu, which isn't very convenient). This option isn't documented either, and why is POWER OFF in the middle of the menu?
<br/>
-I can't access the MKDS course hack through WMB, which makes sense since it can't load the game anyway (though MKDS is inserted). However, I can when I run the app from GBAMP, it just won't start the game. O_o
<br/>
<br/>
Hm, it won't even run the DS card if I put it on my GBAMP as _BOOT_MP.nds. Though if I do that, then select LOAD DS FROM GBA, it recognizes that no DS card is inserted immediately.
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, if you can get Download Play working, and maybe make the alarm clock a little less heart-attack-inducing, this will have every feature I need. :-) BTW, you still have a screenshot of V1.1 up.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

FWNitro is becoming a seriously useful tool.

Not only has it got the "hey look at my DS" factor, but it allows you to backup (quite easily) the games you own.

Seeing how it does this is there any chance you could implement a save backup feature too?

Maybe I have the wrong libraries. What files does caitsith2 have that I don't? (Just say which files I need the newest versions of, and what versions you have, and I will check it out for myself.) Maybe then I can fix it. I know... I have thes problems as well, with Animal Crossing.

Yes it would be good idea to make the alarm clock also a standalone app (not everyone uses Moonshell, but I guess a Moonshell plugin could be made as well), and the standalone alarm clock would have more features, such as graphics, more selection of sound (or even to load a sound from CF card), set snooze option, set alarm depending on days of week, multiple alarms, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
But the alarm feature built-in to FWNITRO will not have all these extra features.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, the first digital clock with a snooze bar snoozed for 8:31 because 511 seconds was the biggest number that would fit in a 9-bit seconds counter. Copycats snoozed for 9 minutes.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Besides that, if the thief is smart enough, he may not need to even enter the password.  Remember that there is a failsafe routine, which will bypass whatever password screen is present, completely, provided that thief has the means to reflash the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have thought about password feature before, it isn't that useful in firmware. They could just take the battery, or send it to Nintendo to get repaired. Probably if they see a different boot screen even without a password prompt, if it doesn't autostart, they might either: decide it is defective, or say "O! This is a new feature of main menu on Nintendo DS" and attempt to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
But, either way, no matter what really happend, a password probably wouldn't help that much. Try using a physical lock to lock it up, then they can't even steal the battery or such things.
<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted your phone number on it, you can make it the scroller text or user message, both are displayed in the main menu.

Maybe you can use a diff file? You can also maybe write a program that lets you insert changes to the location on the program that you want, you click where it should be and it work
<br/>
<br/>
If you tell me what things you might be changing, I could add comments to  the source code to be read by a program to automate the changing of the code. For example: If you wanted to change the menus so that you can use the touch-screen to operate it (instead of up/down/select), then you could modify it on the tags indicating initialization (to swap screens), when keyboard is needed (to swap screens again), and when it checks if the SELECT button is pressed (to decide where you clicked and activate it). In case major changes requires you to change some of these things though, you may decide to either: stay with the older version, or change some of the changing code.
<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted to, you could create a web site for the HyperHacker version of FWNITRO, to see if people prefer that, and then other people might also make their own versions of FWNITRO and call it different things, and make their own sites for that. Then there will be many different versions of FWNITRO for some people to choose from. Still, there will be the main branch of FWNITRO is the one I make, so that people may choose the main one.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm...this makes me think of something.  It'd be interesting to have this feature, then be able to add a menu option that is pretty much a shortcut to this application.  For example, put DSLinux on your compact flash, tell FWNITRO "DS Linux is this file (at..I don't know...M3:\something\dslinux.nds) and I want to add a shortcut in the menu named "DS Linux - Linux on your NDS".  Then you could choose it and it would load the file directly...bypassing the need for a loader.
<br/>
<br/>
Not certain where you would save this though (onto the compact flash itself maybe?  Probably too much to save into the firmware.  If it was on the CF card then possibly FWNITRO could check for it on boot or something).

It's possible to add a bigger firmware chip. One trace would need to be cut and 8 wires soldered. A kit with preprogrammed 4 megabyte chip would cost about $10. No PassMe or GBA flashcart required, because custom firmware on the chip could be used to download .nds using TCP/IP. Moreover, it's possible to port a CIFS (aka SMB) library so that homebrews can work with files on Windows/Samba shares just as easily as on CF/SD.

It's possible to add a bigger firmware chip. One trace would need to be cut and 8 wires soldered. A kit with preprogrammed 4 megabyte chip would cost about $10. No PassMe or GBA flashcart required, because custom firmware on the chip could be used to download .nds using TCP/IP. Moreover, it's possible to port a CIFS (aka SMB) library so that homebrews can work with files on Windows/Samba shares just as easily as on CF/SD.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think? Is this useful? Would this mod be doable by people or is it too hard? Would a step-by-step instructional video help? Should I make a new thread to discuss this? :)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Maybe separate iQue extensions could be made to the firmware, that has extra functions including: view pictures, download .nds file from TCP/IP, etc.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About Mario Kart hack: No, probably not. Probably I will replace the Mario Kart Hack with a more generic hack that you can use with any game. Maybe it will load some of the files from the CF card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">TCP/IP .nds downloading is in my opinion one of the most important parts of a homebrew firmware. It makes it very easy for people to have a fast development cycle, with the new program launching instantly without having to bother with CF cards and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this can be achieved using regular download play if you have a compatible wifi card, but most people don't, and probably don't want to buy it either. Regular TCP/IP is a much better solution, and it's not like it would take much space either.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
When you do the same with a GBA game, the DS detects that you reinserted it and you can start it without powering off and on the DS.

Other people can make translations if they want, but it won't be part of the main branch. Different people will have to maintain translations by themself (I can't maintain everything).

<br/>
<br/>
I am getting really frustrated with my DS Lite, being able to download only the official demos and none of the home brew stuff via Wifi. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am really keen on being able to download homebrew via wifi. Can anyone here send me a copy of the original firmware and any pointers they might have. I am good at reverse-engineering binaries, and I am going to see if I can uncover any other workarounds to be able to bypass RSA signature check.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to get my hands on any version of firmware you might have, but preferably the DS Lite version.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

run an app which dumps it to your cf/sd card. there's one on this board, by pepsiman i think. search and you will find. 
<br/>
<br/>
if you don't have cf/sd adaptor, there is another firmware dumper which dumps it to SRAM. this is a bit more annoying, as it requires 4 steps to complete (since firmware is 4 times the size of SRAM). again, search for it on the forum (i'm too lazy to find it right now)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you can use it with Nintendo DS Lite, but you can't set the brightness levels, and I think FlashMe doesn't let you set brightness levels either. Although there is a problem to replace the firmware on DS Lite (whether you use FlashMe or FWNITRO) that causes it to turn off by it self if you aren't careful to do it. FWNITRO is very safe although DS Download Play, calibration, and Protected View haven't been implemented yet.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I read the 20 pages of this topic, to get more information about the history.

I flashed the FWNITRO on my classic DS. I?m very glad, and I think I?ll buy Mario kart to test the hack.
<br/>
<br/>
But, like a lot of people, I couldn?t make the DS Dump working on my Supercard SD (freezes at 000.0%)
<br/>
I think that instead of waiting for the release of the lib of Download Play, you could fix this bug. I don?t know , it?s just a suggestion, of course you are the master of this project and you do what you want ?;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah supercard SD dumping would be pretty cool.  Right now i have my Supercard SD 2gb pretty setup, NDS lite, flashme7, and i think ill flash my nds with NITRO here to test it. This firmware has a serious future i think.
<br/>
<br/>
Since we can do dumps of the firmware, bios, etc etc... could you make the next version able to merge with the firmware to create a NDS file ? since dumping doesnt seem to work unless its flashed to the ds (correct me if im wrong) due to card unlocks, done by the firmware itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Also i think a hack system like the mario kart DS hack but for other games is an amazing idea.  DipStar does it, but doesnt work correctly with supercard due tot he loader. Dunno if there is source out there (think so) but yeah a cheats dir on your card would be awsome.
<br/>
<br/>
Also with your DS download play, maybe a client app can be written to talk to your firmware, so when your using FWNITRO to develop, u can stream your files directly to the NDS to test it.  I know its prolly been talked about to death but figured i might as well mention it.
<br/>
<br/>
but, I'd like to help you with this firmware.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://antoineturmel.free.fr/img/beup/beup.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Not only that, but I can't remove FWNitro either, none of the flashmes work!  Also a bunch of my homebrew apps and games give me white screens now.  I don't know what that newest firmware did, but I'm not happy.
<br/>
<br/>
I know the data's fine though, cause it works fine on my Blue DS phat (it has a working L-button :P)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: BTW, I'm using the MKDS only version.  I wonder if that makes a difference...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2: Ok, I've downgraded to 1.6b and now my homebrew works but with errors.  MAN that's hard trying to get that L button to work! &gt;_&lt;  I'll try an even older version and see what happens, maybe homebrew will work fine.

Just thought I'd add on to this; it might work if you remove and reinsert the card. If FWNITRO doesn't check for this though, you'll have to pop it in at just the right time, when the program is being loaded. With WMB this is at the Nintendo logo; with GBAMP it's about one second after the white screens appear. You probably won't be finished pushing it in by the time the program starts but that won't matter.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've tried putting flashme.nds onto the R4 by itself and running from inside FWnitro, only to have the DS lock up. I've tried booting straight to DS card by holding A+L+R at power on to get a white screen followed by a black screen. I've tried failsafe mode by holding A+B+Start+Select at power on and all I get is blank screens (no backlight) with a blinking green power LED.
<br/>
<br/>
How can I get FlashMe back onto my DS so my R4 works again? Do I need a newer SLOT-2 cart to "run DS from GBA" to get flashme.nds to work? Is there something I need on my R4's micro-SD card to get it to boot from FWnitro's menu? HELP!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

could someone take the 1.6c version of fwnitro,
<br/>

<br/>
these fixes should allow the mmd to work.
<br/>
i will test it.  i also think the gnm would work
