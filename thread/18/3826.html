The potentially bogus leaked spec lists a 6:6:6 color format for a total of 262144 colors.  Has this been confirmed?  It seems silly to use 18 bits for color.  That would double the amount of palette ram need.  Worse, it would double the amount of ram need for bitmap modes, unless a 5:5:5 mode is available.  (Chop the bottom bit?)

Maybe it can be usefull when using blending operations and things like that or they maybe can use some kind of a gamma corrector before final output?<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why is 18bits silly? 18bit colors does not require twice the ram. Simply make the graphics hardware (including memory) 18bit wide.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could tell it where (anywhere in the 4MB of RAM) to have the
<br/>
framebuffer. The size depended on what kind of mode you set up
<br/>
(16/32bit, selectable resolution, choose PAL/NTSC (I think)).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, 18-bits seems odd. And that's a lot of overhead when copying for 2 extra bits, lots of wasted memory.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even if the graphics hardware uses memory that is 18 bits wide, I'll need to store color info using u32 or some packed format.

My bad.  According to the doc, the LCD is 6:6:6.  I did not see anything about the format the graphics chip uses.  The 2D section just lists the max BG and OBJ count.  The 3D section lists the max polygon count, max pixel count and something else in kanji that I can't be bothered to look up right now.
