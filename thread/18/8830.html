    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
I wanted to know if it was possible to free texture memory(i.e. vram that has been used by a texture), to use it for another texture? if possible,how?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks a lot in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the same problem. Dovoto said that you could reuse a texture with the same size but I still don't know how because glTexImage2D calls getNextTextureSlot and it always reserves more memory even if you are using a texture name used before.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Webez on Thu Mar 09, 2006 1:11 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

void glResetTextures(void)

I somehow thought that you could overwrite the old textures but as Webez points out, and i just realize, i did not expose that functionality.  I will attempt to provide this with the next release.

I am not real fond of the way gl handles textures so perhaps in the future we will see non gl complient (but hopefully much more robust) texture managment.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't really care if it has anything to do with gl, if it is better than gl, then what are you waiting for?:P
<br/>
And, please,PLEASE, P L E A S E, fix the depth sorting glOrtho problem(I asked nicely;))</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
