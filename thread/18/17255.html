    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After only limited success getting libpogo compiled I've decided to start porting a straight console app first to learn the ropes. It's working well so far but I just have a couple of questions.
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I've used the following very simple and convenient calls to set things up:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">consoleDemoInit();
<br/>
keyboardDemoInit();
<br/>
keyboardShow();
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This has the disadvantage however of the keyboard sharing screen space with the console. I've read through a fair bit of the documentation but I'm struggling to find a simple way to put the console on the top screen and leave the keyboard on the bottom. Is this possible?
<br/>
<br/>
I was also wondering if there is a full list somewhere of the ANSI codes that the DS console supports. So far I'm only been able to find the ones used in the example programs.
