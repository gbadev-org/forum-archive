    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's a small sprite demo, just shows a couple of sprites bouncing around both of the screens. Tested in Dualis 3, but not on hardware (anyone?). Source is available, and I've tried to make it neat incase anybody should want to read it!

If you want to compile it, follow <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/Day1/day1.php" target="_blank">this excellent tutorial</a> to get the template up and running. Just replace the arm9/main.cpp file with the one in the archive above, and copy across the resources folder contents.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps someone!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's another demo (in a similar vein), which demonstrates basic touch screen movement. Again, source is available... hopefully it should give a pretty good example of reading values from the touchscreen...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you should make a full version of pac man ds since pac pix isnt the same
<br/>
<br/>
just make the first couple of levels at least and set it so you touch somewhere on the screen and the pac man follows that path and eats the crap and gosht etc like the original</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah that would be awesome. Got a few ideas of classic game remakes before I handle pacman though, muwahahaha! Still, an updated Snackman could be good, you could use the touch screen to control his vodka drinking skills. The faster you down pints of vodka, the faster Snackman runs around the maze. Oh, and the less he stumbles into walls ;)

Wait for the compo cart to see what the hell I'm talking about! :)
