    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I just got my NDS and i'm still waiting for my PassMe to arrive. I've read almost all the threads here, but one question arises:
<br/>
Is it possible to use both processors (ARM7 &amp; ARM9) in parallel? I mean, put the ARM7 to check for different kinds of input and the ARM9 do the "hard work". Is it possible on you can only have one processor working at a time?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From my understanding.  the ARM7 processor is used for input, sound and wifi.  The ARM9 is the one usually involded in the processing of the application and drawing to the screens.  Soyou are always using both processor in parallel actually.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS uses both ARM7 &amp; ARM9 simultaneously by default. There are some tasks, like touch screen input, that need to be handled by the ARM7. It would be possible to allocate certain tasks to one or the other. In most cases you would want to use the ARM9 for the meat of the code because it is a lot faster. Once you start working with the devkit, it should make a lot more sense.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks a lot! I thought it could be that way, I just wanted to confirm.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
