    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hiya guys, 
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone tried putting the .nds format homebrew apps on the above flashcart? I keep getting a file not accepted error. Is there any way round this? Im hoping to be able to use this cart once a multiboot loader allows files to be loaded from a cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help/advice would be appreciated. 
<br/>
<br/>
Once again apologies if this has been answered before, yet i cannot find similar posts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I have the same cart.
<br/>
what you need to do is to put a .nds.gba file, and not a .nds file on the cart. you can convert .nds files to .nds.gba file with ndstool.exe.
<br/>
be sure to turn off the multirom feature so the app dont add a loader to the cart</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oops, I meant the tool dsbuild.exe.
<br/>
navigate to the folder you have dsbuild.exe in with the command line.
<br/>
type dsbuild indata.nds outdata.nds.gba
<br/>
exchange the indata with the name of the rom you want to convert and outdata to the name you want on the converted file. remember to have the file you want to convert in the same folder as dsbuild.exe</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think both ndstool and dsbuild come as part of ndslib.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Godster, you also need to make sure you have the multiROM mode turned off. Some early versions of the linker software don't allow that, so make sure you get the latest version from here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ezf-advance.com/download.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ezf-advance.com/download.htm</a>. It should be the third item on that page. Once you have it, use the linker to erase everything from the cart, click the swiss army knife button, and uncheck the multiROM option. Once you do that, you should be able to burn one .nds.gba file to the cart and run it using [pass|wifi|flash]me.

You are probably using an old version of the software. The official website is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gba-toys.com" target="_blank">www.gba-toys.com</a><br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
