Hope this will help us to explore the file into a greater depth.

These files are contained within the filesystem of the game itself. The files have a .sdat extension because the file table says they do ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How are there multiple files within a self-extracting PKZIP file?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

When I reread my questions after submitting, I realized I made it sound doubtful...
<br/>
<br/>
So are you saying its exactly or very similar to the PKZIP format?<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm saying that the combination of .nds with a file system is very similar in principle to the combination of a self-extractor with a PKZIP or tar archive, or the combination of a GBA program with a GBFS archive, even though it isn't mapped into the GBA ROM space the way GBFS traditionally is.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To answer your query, a nds file usually contains the following things:
<br/>
1. header
<br/>
2. arm9 binary code
<br/>
3. arm9 overlay files
<br/>
4. arm7 binary code
<br/>
5. arm7 overlay files
<br/>
4. banner (the icon and the title of the game as u see in the starting menu)
<br/>
5. file name table
<br/>
6. file allocation table
<br/>
7. files used by the game
<br/>
<br/>
5+6+7 together form the so-called Nitro File System.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
