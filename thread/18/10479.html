    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to code an FM radio application for Nintendo DS? The antenna for the radio receiver could be the headphone wires(like other devices).

I am not saying that it's gonna use the wi-fi inbuilt. I'm thinking of using the earphones/headphones to act as the radio frequency receiver. Then the coded program will direct and decipher the frequencies, making it a radio receiver! :) Isn't that most cell phones with FM do? Why not on DS :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mobile phones with an FM receiver have dedicated circuitry to receive the signal, even if they do some software postprocessing. What you're asking for is software-defined radio, and the DS doesn't have the appropriate circuitry to do that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most mobile (cell) phones have an arial cable running up the headphone cable.
<br/>
<br/>
They also have a dedicated FM receiver circuit, as tepples has already said.

<br/>
<br/>
You could build a circuit and use the GBA slot to power the device, but that's kind of pointless when you could just use a pair of AA or a 9V battery.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

It plugged in the back and just had a switch to either use the normal GBASP sound, or radio</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This sounds interesting. Hook an antenna up to the microphone port... Tuning would probably have to be done in hardware, but I bet it's possible.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
