    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using a 2D over 3D engine for my game and am using glPolyFmt(POLY_ALPHA(alpha)); to set the transparency of my sprites. However, when two sprites with different alpha are on top of each other, they are not rendered on top of each other; instead, one of them will jump to the top seemingly regardless of its z-value (I didn't test this in depth), while the parts of the second one covered by the first one are not rendered.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this able to be fixed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a similiar issue in cquake when rendering the layered sky. in my situation the issue was related to the parameter passed to glFlush. I tried glFlush(0) and glFlush(2). I forget which one was which but one would not z-sort correctly and the other one would cause issues with polygons that were close together along the same plane - it looked like a precision issue as the artifacts would decrease the closer the object got to the viewpoint.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
