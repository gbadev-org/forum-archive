    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ive looked around I really havnt found an answer to this question?
<br/>
<br/>
So we can emulate a homebrew game or two, and we have commercial GBA carts that load roms. Has anyone done any tests to dump any game onto a GBA cart, playing with the header or whatnot to get it to load a DS rom properly?
<br/>
<br/>
I know there was a discussion of the speeds of the DS cart and GBA cart, and different people have different opinions of whether or not this is possible, but has anyone actually tried it? Am I out of line to suggest someone should?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True, games could be hacked to load files from GBA ROM space rather than from the DS card, just as GameCube games are patched to load over the BBA rather than from DVD. But if dumps are publicly released too soon in the DS's life cycle, Nintendo may attack the passthrough projects. Don't push it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well im not even suggesting a commercial game, obviously that could be a huge offense to the development. but i find it a little hard to believe that no one has dumped tetris (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.auby.no/" target="_blank">http://www.auby.no/</a>) or something home developed. This is completely legal, and was the primary use (or suggested anyways) of the GBA cart. just to understand that its possible and were a step up would be awesome. personally i think it would be a really cool test, any other news or failed attempts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">and that's what I'm waiting for :). Commercial games would be way too awkward for it, but if the people working on it get multiboot running from something wireless we can afford, it would be very easy to test and run homebrew games without having to mess with passtroughs and flashcards.

but there IS something stopping people from using wireless multiboot. I think you are missing a point here :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, DS Download Play support for PCs would act as the counterpart to the MBV2 cable to test homebrew games in the home or office, but a computer that speaks Ni-Fi won't help you play-test your homebrew game on the bus or in the waiting room or demonstrate it to other people the way you can with a GBA and a flash cart. Or do you want to carry a laptop around with you all the time to load your DS code from? In that case, you might as well develop for OpenGL.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

would certainly involve carrying less around than some of those passthroughs (3x the size of the DS o_O)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dunno about that. I have a GBA and a DS even though I never (and I do mean never) play games on the go. But, yea, carrying a laptop around with your DS would be kinda silly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

First, there was <a class="postlink" href="http://shiggsy.gbadev.org/unit.php?unit=16" target="_blank">huge GBA flash</a>. Then there was <a class="postlink" href="http://www.brolinembedded.se/projects/flashcart/" target="_blank">GBC cart size GBA flash</a>. Now, GBA flash cards such as EFA are no bigger than an official GBA Game Pak.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, future iterations of the DS passthrough will become smaller.
<br/>
<br/>
Verdict: Unless you're an EE, just sit tight.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It should be possible to load a multiboot game over wifi and then just close the lid, putting the DS into sleep mode. I'm not sure how much battery drain you'd get just maintaining RAM, but it should at least mean you could take it on the bus or plane with you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good point. Also, you could just program it to load the game entirely over wifi, and remain in a 'low-power' mode (With only the bare minimums absorbing power) until you press a button to actually start the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
