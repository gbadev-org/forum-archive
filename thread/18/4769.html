Now since you can run NES/FC roms off this thing, I'm wondering if there's any other way to run an executable off of the cards. They get quite spacious at up to 256 Megabytes(not bits)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Doubt it... The FC/NES roms run through an emulation layer that is PROBABLY on the device, not the card.  It also uses the GBA port so even if you could run your own code, you'd be limited to GBA functionality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The ROMs are limited in size, because it actually combines the emulator with the ROMs at runtime, loads them into RAM, and runs the emulator as if it had been loaded in via multiboot.  But I have heard that simply renaming any &lt;256 KB ROM to pocketnes.gba and putting it on the card will allow it to be booted, because the emulator is loaded in from the card, to allow it to be updated easily.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If someone figures out how to read the card, someone ought to make a version of pocketnes.gba that can browse the card and then load PocketNES or Goomba as appropriate after determining whether the file is an iNES dump, a GB dump, or a GBA multiboot.

There are a lot of GBA Movie Player owners over at <a class="postlink" href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/" target="_blank">Pocket Heaven</a>, and Dwedit over there even made a hack of PocketNES to get some of the more compressible 256 KB NES ROMs to load.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
