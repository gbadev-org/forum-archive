    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off, Loopy, thanks for the great work on the firmware hack. It's worked perfectly for me in running demos and homebrews
<br/>
<br/>
And getting rid of the health warning is great.
<br/>
<br/>
Now here's my request... I'd like to be able to customize the firmware hack slightly. When turning on a DS with hacked firmware the backlight fades on and for a brief moment theres a white screen. Then the main system menu shows. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to be able to have a cool splash screen or quick message in place of the white screen on bootup. It wouldn't be troublesome like the health warning because it'd go away just as fast as the white screen.
<br/>
<br/>
...I'd just love to have some cool splashscreen  that says "Hacked by Tidegear!" or something fun like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I second that...although I have no interest in a splash screen or such...what I would like is built in ndsloader so we can flash nds files strait to the cart. Direct support of the movie player / homebrew CF cart would be sweet also (if not too complex).<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good question.
<br/>
<br/>
Problem is that they probably can't release the source to FlashMe because I would imagine 98% of it is the original Nintendo code. To release it would likely be a copyright violation.
<br/>
<br/>
Though, I wonder the legality of distributing the firmware even in it's modified state, since you can't legally redistribute the BIOS for a system (which is why many emulators don't come with a BIOS file, and you have to pull it off your own hardware).
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, once there is a 100% "clean" (I.E. doesn't contain any of Nintendo's code) firmware replacement then I would imagine the source could be released and modifications could be built upon it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, TJ I don't think that's an issue really. It's a patch one applies to the firmware, not a patched firmware being distributed. There's a difference, clearly. So, I see your point but fortunately I don't think it's a problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this would be a very bad idea
<br/>
<br/>
why?
<br/>
<br/>
because it opens the opertunity for people to intentionally damage the firmware by inserting corrupt elements into a themed package.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the fact that any bug in the way the firmware is compiled or any errors in the image files you use to customise could result in a nice useless lump of plastic...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it would be nice if there was a protected firmware loader that sits in locked memory and would recover if the rest of firmware were completely corrupted...that way we could play in relative saftey.  Does your firmware allready have a failsafe recovery (failsafe within reason of course) for the unlocked portion of the firmware?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Didn't we have this discussion at length before? If you release info on how to program the unlocked parts of firmware, and leave the failsafe in the protected region alone, even if you do corrupt the firmware, you can always use the failsafe to recover it. There is no good reason not to release this info that i can think of, besides possibly copyright/legal issues.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I thought that was why the FlashMe installer needed the pads jumped, so it could install an emergency bootloader into the protected area of the EEPROM in case of some flashing failure. Maybe I am wrong though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, I think you're right...that's what I thought holding the ABXY during boot was for...as far as I know, there is that failsafe code in the protected area of the firmware, holding these will force a boot from the GBA cart allowing you to recover your firmware (using whichever FlashMe you wanted) so long as you succesfully flashed that protected area before.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
