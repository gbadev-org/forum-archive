    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've always wondered if one was possible, but figured it wasn't since no one released one.  Jim e the creator of WabbitDS has made the most impressive calc emu for the DS to date.  ZX-81 the creator of the TI-92 emu for varies systems including the PSP, GP2X, and A320.  I'm in the process of contacting both of these programmers to get their insight on such a project.  Hopefully they will be of great help in the development.  I have some coding experience and would love to learn more.  Anyone interested in helping?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It does have an ARM 68k core. It will not be possible to obtain it.
<br/>
<br/>
While it's faster than Cyclone it contains more Genesis specific integration so it would be more work to adapt anyway. jEnesisDS does a lot more than just 68k on the ARM9 alone, including z80 emulation and graphics conversion involving HIRQs. The cost of emulating non-68k components on the TI-92 should be a lot less, and besides, if it falls outside of real time speed when it's busy doing heavy processing you probably would barely even notice.
<br/>
<br/>
I think Cyclone will be pretty sufficient for this project. Some additional work can be done to inline the memory handlers or whatever. The TI-92 memory map is pretty simple and most non-instruction accesses probably go to RAM so a quick upper bounds check can determine if an access is in range. The only slightly more costly thing would be emulating the stack overflow protection, but I doubt that's even necessary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess regarding any question on his code.  I'll run this by him or just give him the link to this thread so he can drop by.  Thanks guys for the help.  I may give it a go myself but it won't be for awhile as I have alot to learn.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep, i won't port it myself :). I'm too busy with Dingoo, Gp2X-F100 and Wiz for the moment. About the TI-92 emu, you just need to rewrite the UI to match NDS geometry etc ... The 68k emulation part would be slow of course on a DS, but it's a calculator emulator so no need to have 60 fps :D. It would be a bit slow for sure, but it should be usable.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also take the original source project (Xtiger) and apply the fix i've done in the 68k part (it was buggy for several instructions of the 68k).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
