    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not to be a nub, but how do you get DSOrganizer to work on the MMD.  I've DLDI'd the .nds file and I downloaded the exeu file and when I get to the screen of the cow, I get a screen saying error about not having the right folders in the RESOURCES folder.  Please help me!

P.S. Sorry if this is in the wrong board, I don't know which board this topic goes to.

Long story short though, you need to copy over the "DSOrganize" folder that came with your download to the root of your card.  DLDI patching is good, but you need to have the folders there or else it won't function correctly.  Download version 2.61 and copy the folder over before adding the alpha versions to your card, overwriting any old files it finds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't just copy over the DSOrganize folder directly if you have an old version installed, as that will overwrite your calendar/day planner/scribble/etc files. I just go into each folder and copy all the files that aren't those (including config, because who knows what's changed in it).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
