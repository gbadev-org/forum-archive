    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible to either write a bootable program that performs the same function or even to rip that part of the firmware and make it bootable? Since the R4DS skips the firmware, you have to remove the card to get to the firmware so it'd be nice to have that function available from the R4 menu (or at least available as a bootable program).<br/>_________________<br/>I can't be bothered now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont know if the link still works or not, but you can get a copy of the firmware as a .nds so you can run it from your r4, if i remember correct download play works fine from it.
