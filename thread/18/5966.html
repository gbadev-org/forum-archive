i found a gbc (or super gameboy? .sgm) rom of tamagotchi, but i don't know if it would be possible to port it to ds.  I know you can convert gbc to gba using different programs, but i don't know anything about code.  I think it's time i learn to program...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
