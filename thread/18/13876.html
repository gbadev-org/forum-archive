    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So far, I've been using the method of linking data-files with my arm9 code that I picked up from the gbfs example that comes with devkitPro. This is a bad idea in since it becomes static memory that is shared with everything else. Still, I love that I don't have to have separate data files and was wondering how I could get around this. Since there are games running on these cards that are much bigger with just a single .nds, the cards must obviously be able to handle it in a good way. I've been searching the forums for how I can do the same thing without luck. Anyone who can point me in the right direction?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Having all data in a single .nds file is very nice, I think.  It also keeps your card a lot cleaner.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
