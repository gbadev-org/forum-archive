Speaking of which, I hate to sound like an idiot, but which thread was it that had that simple NDS demo loader?  where you held down the button to select your NDS app.  I was searching for it but couldn't find it.
<br/>
<br/>
nevermind, seconds after this I found it.  And I can't seem to delete this post.  &gt;_&gt;  I'm such an idiot tonight...I guess that means I should get some sleep then.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And now some of the ROMs listed there can be found at my site, including the BIN of DS Bonga.  The link on that site was non-case-sensitive, so it didn't link to the file.  But I figured it out.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
And for those who have made their own demos, you can submit them to <a href="mailto:submit@mymateo.com">submit@mymateo.com</a> and have them posted onto my site also.  Keep 'em coming!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi Lynx
<br/>
<br/>
If i don't forget it, I will change the current file and add the source
<br/>
to it, but no promise ;) I am lazy recently... Haven't updated PDR with
<br/>
new files since 2 months, probably longer...

So, this sounds like a perfect time for someone to take the helm to create a site that tracks NDS demos.  Of course, it's going to be a lot of work and time tracking down all the current demos, as well as keeping up with the new ones, but if it's nice enough, and people like it, maybe the devers would submit their demos to it..  Dunno..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your site had automatic submission and update features, that would be handy. That coupled with an RSS feed would make your site the perfect, up-to-date resource.
<br/>
<br/>
That's work for <span style="font-style: italic">someone</span>, though, but if you were serious about it then these features would make life easier in the end for you. Just an idea, I know that it would probably require more work than people want to put in. I'd build it myself if I had more time outside of school. If your site is doing well around June 15th then maybe I'd be up for it.
<br/>
<br/>
I started writing my own site from a "guide" point of view, and quickly found that it's a lot of work trying to tie together all the pre-existing resources. I ended up writing a brief guide with plenty of pointers to sites already up. It was impossible to keep up with the ever-changing methods and advances in this scene. Keeping a site's resources up to date is a lot of work and if people really turn to you, you'll be bombed with things to post/update soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, currently Aaron Rogers has the best "resource" with his NDS Dev Env package.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you were talking about my site, then I will respond thusly:
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to put in automatic submission, but 2 main problems with that.  (1) No immediate control over the content (porn, foul language, commercial ROMs not necessarily for DS, etc) and (2) I don't know how.
<br/>
<br/>
An RSS feed would be nice, but only 2 main problems.  (1) I don't stay up-to-date enough to be a site people would go to for the latest breaking news and (2) I don't know how.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I still don't think I'd like an automatic submission because of the reason listed above, but if someone would like to help me out then a system whereby I can enter in a game and it would automatically be sorted by date, name, author, or by rom type (PassMe, BIN, source, etc) that would be very cool.  I don't have a whole lot of free time, but that's something I will be looking into eventually anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
As for an RSS feed, I hve no particular desire to learn how to create one OR update it on a daily basis (every 2 or 3 days yes, but if I have to track down information constantly then it becomes a real chore).  But if someone wanted me to host it, I could probably arrange that (except if it's going to cost me extra money -- then it depends on the cost as well).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, there you have it.  I hope to make this site into something useful, and suggestions like these (even if they were directed to someone else) are helpful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
