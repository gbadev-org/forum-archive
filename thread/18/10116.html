    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I am using devkitPro on OS X to develop code for the DS.
<br/>
Who else is doing this? I am looking for a list of utilities and where to pick them up to assist in developing on OS X.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a DS emulator that runs on OS X?
<br/>
What other tools should I pick up?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
i just received my delivery of supercard/superkeys and installed devKitPro r19 (+nds-samples) on my mac. yesterday evening i have successfully compiled, transfered and executed a simple "hello world" app on my DS lite.
<br/>
<br/>
but that's about all i know!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tilluigi on Fri Jun 30, 2006 9:16 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I develop on Mac OS X. I use XCode as my coding environment. Following Patater's manual I started using Graphic Converter (convert graphics to .h format) and the hConvert (converts .h files to .bin files). Currently there isn't an emulator for MacOSX. To test the apps I have a GBAMP and use bafio's wifi file transfer program to transfer the .nds's to my GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps

<br/>
here's the link to patater's manual, just for the record: 
<br/>
<a href="http://patatersoft.info/manual.html" target="_blank">http://patatersoft.info/manual.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
now here are my questions:
<br/>
i how do you set up Xcode to use devkit as the compiler? 
<br/>
also, i downloaded the NDS-sample files that come with devkitpro, but some of them do not compile because the .h files of included data (img, 3d models) are missing. are the .h files generated by the IDE (or in that case Xcode)?
<br/>
what about the PAlib. do you have any experience with it? there doesn't seem to be an installer for MacOSX. is it possible to install it anyway?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tilluigi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have never used PALib so I can't answer that. As far as the XCode setup. I created a new project. Setup the project by adding a group that contains the makefile, arm7 and arm9 folders (just the setup that I use). In those folders I add the makefile, source, data, and include folders along with adding the main.cpp file to the source folders. Then you need to create a new target. This is where you would choose to use make. &lt;-- This doesn't just jump out at you though. I will try to make a tutorial over the weekend showing how to setup. Once that is setup you can then use the build button to build the .nds.

<br/>
<br/>
The .h files are generated by a program that gets called during the make process. I am not 100% sure on the name but i think it is something like bin2o. Your makefile might not have the rule to run that on the .bin files in the data folder. I wish I could help out more today but I am leaving to go out of town for a couple of days. Not sure if there will be internet there (camp grounds) however I will have my laptop to create the tutorial.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a post from ikaris on another thread:

<br/>
To use bmp2bin for DS:
<br/>
<br/>
bmp2bin -d inputfile.bmp outputfile.bin
<br/>
<br/>
This will create the Bin.
<br/>
<br/>
You'd also be good to put it into a folder like "data".
<br/>
<br/>
Then, the Makefile has to be modified to transform the Bin into a .h...
<br/>
<br/>
Then in your code, you'd have something like:
<br/>
<br/>
#include "outputfile_bin.h"
<br/>
<br/>
(Note that the .bin was replaced with _bin and a .h was added)
<br/>
<br/>
This is how all of the other examples do it. Check out Textured_Quad, it's a good example. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

yeah, your probably right. but is it normal that i have to type "make" several times to complete the full process. seems like execution is being interrupted by some system/os procedures and i have to re-type "make" to continue. is there a way to make it go through the first time?

I don't think there is one. You could run an emulator using virtual PC assuming that you had that. I don't however, I use a wifi transfer program and test on hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I have just started dev on a Mac OS X (and also a Linux) and I started using PALib. I found palib really cool to use and I made some changes to be able to use PALib on Mac and Linux.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested let me know, and I can send them the changes.
<br/>
<br/>
I also ported the PAGfx tool (for creating sprites from image files) into Perl (using imlib2). This is quite useful if you need a commandline tool for sprites on mac os linux. Ask me, if someone needs this.
