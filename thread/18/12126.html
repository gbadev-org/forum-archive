    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
I had an idea yesterday, but since I think I'm currently too newbie to do it by myself, I want to share my idea with you guys, and maybe someone gets interested.
<br/>
<br/>
The concept is simple: a benchmarking app for the flash carts. You would run the app using fatlib for you cart, select a file (preferably big), and the program would do some sequential and random read tests. It could do write tests too. And then, at the end, it would show your cart speed.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be great to compare all the market's flashcarts, combined with all sorts of flash memory brands, to see the real speed difference. And I'm not supporting piracy in any way, but I'd like to know, for example, if the fact that some users have problems in Castlevania: POR while others don't is really a flash memory speed issue.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you guys think?<br/>_________________<br/>There's no place like 127.0.0.1</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cool! I'll try to get the souce and maybe I can understand what it's doing...

<br/>
Thanks a lot!<br/>_________________<br/>There's no place like 127.0.0.1</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
