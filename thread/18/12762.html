    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, for all of us who are getting Pokemon Diamond or Pearl. I was thinking that a portable version of the pokedex at <span style="font-weight: bold">Serebii.net</span> would be killer. I know you see "pokedex" and go "Isn't there one in the game?" but this one is really in depth. Take a look, you'll like it. This is more of a homebrew suggestion, but I know nothing in the ways of coding so I wanted to get my idea out.<br/>_________________<br/>Lemurs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">come on serebii.net sucks... and is VERY inaccurate when it comes to pokemon's names and stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
i'd prefer a pokedex like the one meowth346 made (now closed), which was much better, accurate, and even multilingual.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there are already html based pokedex available. dsorganize can render html, - maybe so it should be very easy?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
