<br/>
<br/>
Just looking at Mario64, there's 1-bit alpha transparency (mesh-type surfaces, trees), per-polygon translucency (water, shadows), and it looks like per-pixel translucency (Mario's skidding 'smoke')
<br/>
<br/>
No sign of any additive blending though - the type that's the most useful for things like flames, explosions, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen any other blending modes in other games - Mario is the only 3D game I've got so far</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
