Wardriving has gotten a distinctly bad name, many people instantly associating the act with hackers (black hats at that too).

<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Uhh.. ok sure..  if you say so..   I worked in a high security facility.  The people that test facility security aren't normally the same people that test network security.  If a facility is letting kids in with their "game boy" then I would say you don't have much security at all..  Anyone can easily stuff a DS down their pants.. if you have entry security so tight you can see what is in their pants, then DS or Laptop, your not going to get in with it.
<br/>
<br/>
But, being realistic.  If you are working for a company and are supposed to be testing their network security, you WILL be using laptops and desktops to run those audits.  But, if a company really cares about network security, they will be running EAP/LEAP and a DS will be useless.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are working for a company and are supposed to be testing facility security, you will be testing if a non-employee can access the facility.  High security facility have background checks on all the employees.  It's expected that you can trust them.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How would it possibly work with DS?
<br/>
I thought the reception speed on DS is limited to 2 Mbit/s (still needs to be confirmed I think, but probably not much higher anyways).
<br/>
Thus you cannot capture normal data packets at all unless there's a way to re-associate a victim host and AP at a lower speed.
<br/>
For example, if you got enough unique IVs for WEP cracking in say 10 mins at 54 Mbit/s, it might take up 4.5 hours at 2 Mbit/s. But I'm pretty sure that it will somehow take up much longer :)
<br/>
Btw. anyone knows if Win XP has some kind of ARP flood protection that prevents using that method to generate lots of traffic? Or perhaps the soft-AP software (ZD1211) I'm using prevents re-using the same IV for a little while?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Oh.. And I just realized, if you are testing facility security, it won't matter if the DS actually can have a sniffer on it or not..  your testing if they will let you in with it..  Even if they ask you to turn it on.. your not going to leave your cracking tools in the DS..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it's not really seperated from it, is it? At least i see a gba port and a lot of similarities in the hardware to the gba.

<br/>
<br/>
My other point is, if a facility requires REAL security, one guy (network) DOES NOT maintain or test security for the whole company.  They have a network security specialist that will audit the network, Facility security expert that will audit the facility security.  Untill you have worked in a high security facility, you will not understand.  And if they want to really test their security, the hire outside consultants to do a live test.. and they aren't going to walk in with a Nintendo DS and expect to "sneak" it buy the security guard, as the guard isn't going to even let them in without prior authorization.  Now, the store down the street may have one guy doing all the security, but that isn't a high security facility.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
