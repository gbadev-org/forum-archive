The <a class="postlink" href="http://dicewars.drunkencoders.com/pong.zip" target="_blank">pong game example</a> I did for liblobby does at least part of what you're asking for - it's short and simple, but easy enough to expand to fit your needs. Can't remember if the <a class="postlink" href="svn://91.184.39.23/svn/repos/libwifi" target="_blank">svn</a> version has anything that's not in the zip file, but nevertheless you'll need the liblobby, so checkout the whole svn contents before you begin.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
