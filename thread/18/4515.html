How about a VNC client for the DS? Your stylus acts as a mouse, you can use 1 of the buttons to emulate a right mousclick, another button to summon a keyboard, etc.
<br/>
Working in high resolutions wouldn't be a problem: the upper screen shows a thumbnail of your screen that you can use to zoom into certain areas on the lower screen (with the d-pad). On the lower screen you work with the stylus like you would with your mouse. I've always found portable vnc clients (cellphone or pda's) very uncomfortable to use, but the DS might be the perfect platform to get the job done :).
<br/>
<br/>
Just a fantasy though...I can't stop dreaming about a DS "pda suite" cardridge that would offer this and several other apps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Great idea!! 
<br/>
I'd also gladly see an open-source version of Palm Graffitti using the stylus to work with terminal-based apps (such as Linux). This would allow to have a much faster typing.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I have no idea about how much resources that consume. Could anyone comment on that ?

Thanks,
