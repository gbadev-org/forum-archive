I guess he meant something like a rampack(see N64) or a mini-HD.<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it would make more sense to use the gba cart slot for those. In fact there is one flash cart that has 16megs of on board RAM that you can use. and there are gba carts that take CF cards or SD cards (supercard, movie player, play yan)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

what i meant for data ext. is if a DS game is being deleloped and the game is so big ( for example tony hawks wasteland) it needs another place to put all that stuff(tricks,Maps,online maps).Would it add load times to the game.
<br/>
<br/>
what a meant for memory ext. is like a ram pack for games that require more ram to run(like perfect dark did).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:BTW has there been a homebrew ram pack for any system,and how would you make something like that?would you need a script to make the system reconize the GBA cart as RAM?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by mariods on Tue May 31, 2005 6:55 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given the size of the screens and the maximum texture sizes you can display on them, I really doubt any game is ever going to need more than the 128 MB maximum for the DS's cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Even the largest games on the N64 were only 64 MB.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ashphalt Urban used a 2Gb card IIRC.Also,I think it was really stupid of nintendo to only put in 4MB of RAM on the DS if they knew they were going to have downloadable content.single card multiplayer is limited to how much ram is on the DS,and for a game like MPH to have SCM and only 4MB of RAM to play with,some features will have to be cut off,like smaller maps or no music(unless it is streamed).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Urban GT is 32 MB.
<br/>
<br/>
The RAM also shouldn't be a problem. Again, you not only are dealing with smaller textures than the N64, but the DS also has dedicated VRAM which the N64 lacks. The DS's RAM is also faster than what the N64 had.
<br/>
<br/>
So you are looking at a system with (if you count the VRAM) a bit more RAM than the pre-Expansion Pak N64 (4.5 MB vs 4 MB).
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don't see a problem.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by TJ on Tue May 31, 2005 7:54 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Yep, we're sure that the people on the forum who program for the NDS are wrong, and the people on that website are right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
