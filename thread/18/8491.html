<br/>
It's not very often that this happens, so bear with me while I work with my brain. Now that DSemu-ng's plugin and event architecture is relatively mature, and the CPU is at least struggling along, I was thinking it could be possible to re-merge the forks of the DSemu project; doublec's peripheral and graphic systems atop the -ng architecture.
<br/>
<br/>
The merge would essentially take the form of a patch replacing every file in the codebase, since the architecture would demand major changes. Upon completion, it'd probably be eligible for a major revision number: 0.5.0 release.
<br/>
<br/>
What's the general opinion on this? If y'all think it'd be a good thing to push ahead with this, I'll grab the .4.10 codebase and begin hacking, but I don't want to hack away on something that wouldn't be well-received.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if master Double happens to be around, I've love to get some input.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it is worthwhile merging the work if only to get dsemu running on Linux and Mac. I'll keep track of any further changes I make from 0.4.10 onwards and can reapply them to your merged effort.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think we'd all appreciate it if you took the extra tenths of a second to type out entire words.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
