    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is my first post here and I want to start off by saying that it is amazing to me what you guys are working on. I would like to follow along and look through the binary files and the files that come out of the sniffing programs. I am wondering which programs you use or would reccomend to use for doing this. I want to be able to look at the files on darkain.com.

Side note - I was reading some info about someone who put linux on a gba and he had to put some very specific information in the front to trick the gba into thinking he was running a game. I think we need to find out exactly what one ds sends to another when it sends out a download for multiplayer. I would think we would need to do this with multiple games and see what is common. Then we could start figuring out how to code what we want to put on there to make the ds think that it will be running a game. Sorry if this is tottaly wrong or is already widely known. ( I would think it would be the latter)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To go through Darkain's dumps you'll need a hex editor of some sort. Try a few to find one you like. There are also some pcap format dumps around and those should be examined with the program ethereal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
