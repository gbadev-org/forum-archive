    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry for the thread here, but I was wondering what became of the two viewers that were in development ages ago. I've been looking for the "new" one that also displayed textures, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Any links would be useful, the only ones I had found were completely dead and inactive.
<br/>
<br/>
If not, I've been struggling to extract the .arc files found in /archives. I <span style="font-style: italic">think[/] I have been able to uncompress them (opening with a hex editor shows file names and a header of SNDFILE), not really sure how to actually "get" the files though.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone [i]does</span> know anything, I'd appreciate an AIM message to LightningXCE or even in this thread.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again guys!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
