<br/>
<br/>
I don't have my PassMe card yet - but reading the code in ndslib, there is a somewhat OpenGL-like library already functioning.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well there is a lot left to do with 3D, basic polygon loading, and texturing is working in somewhat openGLish manner but there is a lot left to figure out.  There seems to be a lot of texture types that can be used, toon shading, fog tables, hardware collision and bounding boxes.  The 3D example in ndslib does pretty much everything that ndslib can do so far.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I just got everything set up with my new passMe and I couldn't get it to run. I got a black upper screen and white lower screen. The 2D example seems to build and work fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No 3D example does not work on hardware ...grrr.  It worked yesterday.  I am going to blame it on reverting gl to inline functions for the moment.  When i get it figured out I will post the update and cause.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After spending an hour or so fighting with CVS and rolling back NDSLIB to before my changes I discovered the issue was not due to ndslib at all.  Somehow my 3d example got changed in someway.  I restored it from a backup and it appears to build as expected now.  Thanks for pointing this out.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">something I've been wondering.. I've seen the openGL like calls.. is it actually openGL on the DS or did the ndslib guys just built the functions openGL like so people are familiar with it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No hardware actually "uses OpenGL." In general, a driver that implements the OpenGL API translates GL state machine calls into something that the video processing hardware understands. Yes, homebrew developers implement subsets of GL for familiarity.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In this case the DS hardware is an openGL state machine.  If you look at the semi-port you will notice that most of the calls are simply wrapping a small set of direct register writes.  As far as I can tell the hardware behaves very closely to that layed out by the GL min spec.  This is the reason I was able to reverse things so quickly.

<br/>
There are of course significant differences, mainly number formating, lack of features and texture support.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
