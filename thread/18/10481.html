The problem is that the Datel Media Launcher's file browser doesnt allow for Console output (for whatever the reason).  If you absolutely need to see your console output, the easiest thing to do is...
<br/>
<br/>
If it exists, backup the current BOOTME.NDS   ...
<br/>
<br/>
Compile your own NDS file and rename THAT file to BOOTME.NDS and place it in the root folder of the drive.
<br/>
<br/>
Turning on the device will automatically boot into your fully functional homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
There is actually nothing wrong at all with Max Media Dock;  It is actually a great platform for homebrew delevopment, except that it lacks direct support for crishm's Fat library.  3rd party drivers are availible, let me know if you need help setting it up.

In that case, mind linking them here, so I can incorporate them into libfat properly. I have tried already, but I'm not sure if they're correct.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

<br/>
The disc_io files may be a tad (very tad) hacked to work specific to myown setup, but these are the files regardless.  The origin of the mmcf drivers were from the moonshell source (of course under 'third party drivers').
<br/>
<br/>
I am able to read/write, but in order to test any apps within dualis, I found that I needed to disable "SUPPORT_MMCF."  Perhaps it is just my dak-specific hack ... you're the expert so you tell me XD!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The reason you can't test within dualis is because your MMCF driver always returns that an MMP is inserted, even if it isn't. So those drivers also won't work on other hardware. However, the ATA register addresses is all I'm really interested in, and they seem to agree with the ones I already have.
