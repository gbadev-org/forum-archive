    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Today I compiled my homebrew that I did a year ago, with the latest devKitARM and libnds. After a few tries, I keep on having the wifi failing and disconnecting (the wifi led stops blinking). Sometimes really fast (after 15 - 30 seconds), sometimes after a few minutes. 
<br/>
I tried the nds from a year ago, and it seemed to work fine, with no disconnection. Is there any known wifi problems with latest versions of devkitarm and libnds ? Any fix ? 
<br/>
<br/>
The only significant thing I changed on my code was the id of a timer I use (I know the wifi uses a timer of its own). I used timer 1 on the old version and switched to timer 3. I tried changing back to 1, but I still have deconnections.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dswifi does use timer 3, so switching back to 1 was good. the only issue that I recall is a palib incompatibility - it does not work with palib.
<br/>
<br/>
is it disconnecting during certain activity? Is your program hanging (maybe on the arm7 side) or is it actually disconnecting from the ap? sometimes a new memory layout from the updated compiler can expose bugs that did not cause problems in old builds. you could also try capturing the packets to see what is going on.
<br/>
<br/>
out of curiousity - what do you have for an ap?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes I saw it used timer 3. I still have some problems with timer 1 though. The program does not hang, just the wifi is screwed. My AP is my ISP box, a Freebox v6. I already had this one a year ago but I had to have it replaced, so maybe it has a different wifi card now...
<br/>
I'll try with a different wifi router<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://github.com/SBRK" target="_blank">http://github.com/SBRK</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">are you sure that the arm7 is still responding? if you are using custom arm7 code then you may need to update it to work with the latest libnds. if you are not doing anything special on the arm7 side, then you may want to consider just using the default arm7.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
