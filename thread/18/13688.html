    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still new to this and I already read some tutorials (there aren't many good..), but there's something I'm really interested in which I can't find any information about.
<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is recognizing shapes. To let the User draw a picture and then the game should check which sign or shape it is.
<br/>
Like in Dr. Kawashimas Brain Jogging in some exercises you can paint on the touchscreen letters like "a" or "d" and the game is recognizing them. Also special chars like "@" or "$" are possible.
<br/>
<br/>
But how do I do that? Are there some special functions? Or do I have to write all the code on my own? If so, how to write the recognition-code?
<br/>
<br/>
Hope someone can help me here! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are no special functions, you will have to write the code on your own. A simple neural net would likely do the trick, although, someone else may have a simpler method than that.<br/>_________________<br/>- relpats_eht</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Welcome to the world of "Computer Vision".  Now hit the journal sites and look for the multitude of published articles on the subject.

<br/>
A simple way to detect lines is the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform" target="_blank">Hough Transform</a>.  You have your image bitmap, and a 'function bitmap'.  You think of each point as an infinite number of lines possibly going through that point.  So this means you transform a point into a function of R and Theta, then graph the curve on the second bitmap.  Where many curves intersect is the detected line.  Usually this is all implemented by adding a 'vote' while graphing the curve, then finding which points have the most votes.
<br/>
<br/>
But hough transform is probably not too good for letter recognition.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hought Transformation sounds pretty tough.. I think that's going far beyond my understanding for now, but I can't know until I try.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other methods?
<br/>
<br/>
And I want to be able to recognize if the user wrote letter, or hiragana (Japanese signs).
<br/>
These for example are Hiragana:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Neural nets for this sort of thing would be overkill. I'd recommend looking up 'shape contexts' - they're part of an easy way of recognising free-flowing, simple shapes. I used them in my final project at uni to recognise hand gestures and basic sign language stuff...
<br/>
<br/>
Btw the hough transform wouldn't really be so hot for this, as it's geared primarily for recognising parametric shapes (ie shapes definable with a formula). You could use the generalised hough transform (which can match arbitrary shapes) but would probably be too computationally intensive for this DS...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you maybe have an tutorial or something like that for this, shape contexts?
<br/>
It's hard to find good tutorials for neural networks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
