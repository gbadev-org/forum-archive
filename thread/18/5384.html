    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know anything about a "OS Cartridge" for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I recently bought a GBA Movie Player to use with a DS.  About the third or fourth time that I started the DS with the Movie Player in it I got the message "OS Cartridge Installed" in the bottom box of the lower screen where you would normally touch to start a GBA game.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, no sooner did I turn off the power to restart the DS than it occured to me that I should have taken a picture of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
It has also never happened again.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know whether it is relevant, but I had the firmware upgrade file on my compact flash card at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just so everyone knows, if you insert the CF card up side down into the slot of the GBA movie player you will get a different message in the GBA selection box, depending on the CF card,  you get other messages. I have two one of them says no game inserted and the other says DS option pack.
<br/>
<br/>
now this isnt a one time thing it happens every time so try what you have and see the message. maybe you put it in up side down to get the "OS" message<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There very probably is an OS cartridge thingy... Nintendo seems quite interested in adding functionality for things that aren't games on the DS as well - such as their dictionary thing. I bet that sometime in the future they will do something for people like me who want to read ebooks on the go with a ds.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

The ROM name for the GBA Movie Player is something like SUPERMARIOA.   Makes you question their methods, doesn't it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ever wonder why the GBA Movie player is $25 instead of $75?  Maybe cause they didn't get it liscensed?  Original GBA Movie player was a passthrough, which is why it required a GBA cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wasn't there a similar case involving Datel &amp; Nintendo over GBC carts? I can't seem to find anything on this atm.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yet Datel is still making Action Replay products for GBA, whose lockout method is nearly identical to that of the GBC. Therefore, even if there was a case, it at least didn't result in an injunction against Datel.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Back on topic... The copy protection in the movie player is really weird.  All sorts of crazy stuff can happen just by turning the system on and off really fast.  If there's garbage data where the GBA header should be, it might detect it as an option pack, or even what the first post describes.  I doubt anyone will try feeding a nintendo DS every possible header though.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
