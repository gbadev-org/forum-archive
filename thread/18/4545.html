..Because..some guy I work with claims Metroid: Zero Mission is particularly bad on his DS, but I tried his cart on my DS and it was ok.  Sadly, he didn't have his DS with him so we could do a side-by-side comparison....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I have noticed this on my DS while playing Zelda: A link to the past. I had the volume turned about a quarter of the way up. Appears it only effects GBA games.....I'll try some of my other games and see what happens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool, getting a better idea if it's related to defective hardware would be handy - I'm sure he wouldn't want to go through the hassle of getting a replacement only to find that the replacement is also 'defective' (assuming the distortion is somewhat 'normal').
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm...actually, I wonder.  The games I tried only used the digital GBA audio and those titles sounded normal to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Any chance it could be something to do with using the 4 GB/GBC sound channels in a GBA title running on the DS?  ...The only GBA game I own where I know for sure that the GBC sound channels are used extensively is Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance, only it's on loan to a friend right now. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd put my money on the fact that the DS's audio system has a design flaw.  I hate to say it, but we need to acknowledge the truth:  The DS has only just launched, and it's very possible that to get it out in time for launch Nintendo had to make some sacrifices.  One of those sacrifices may very well be that they didn't have time to track down the problem and fix it before starting mass production.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be willing to bet it's been fixed, and the next batch of DS's they make will be less susceptible to distortion and the Mario 64 DS echo bug.
<br/>
<br/>
If this is the case, I wouldn't mind seeing Nintendo issue a total recall of all launch units... and replacing them with a Gold DS!  (Okay, that last bit is a little farfetched, but I'd still like a recall if it means I get a better DS)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm about 99% sure the problem is with the speakers themselves, not the logic or circuitry inside the machine. If you use earphones, not only does this problem not exist, but it also makes the DS games sound damn-near modern-console quality.

<br/>
So, having putting the games I have through the "tests," I would almost assuredly say that the problem resides only with the speakers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you really wanted to test that and you have a flash cart, the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.twistedpairgaming.com/download/MyRobot_v1.0_by_Nick_Sabalausky.zip" target="_blank">GBA entry I made for the last PDRoms compo</a> exclusively uses the GBC sound channels, and none of the GBA-only channels.  IIRC, It uses all four of them, too. But then again, you could also just use BeLogic's sound channel demos at <a href="http://www.belogic.com/gba/." target="_blank">http://www.belogic.com/gba/.</a>  That would give you a lot more control for testing out what's going on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I beg to differ.  I've noticed the issue on both the built-in speakers and on my headphones.  The headphones I used, though, weren't standard-jack headphones but ones that plugged directly into the DS's power jack (as was necessary on the GBA SP).  Perhaps standard-jack headphones are uneffected by the issue?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For that specific problem, it could have been a programming glitch as I have yet to re-create it again after about 1? weeks.
<br/>
However, I have noticed distortion when playing Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls on my DS, but from what it sounds like, the distortions seem to only be coming from sound channels in PSG mode, as the whole GB/GBC channels have been scaped (I think). I would assume because this PSG mode may not be exactly like the GB/GBC channels, problems like this would occur. I haven't tried the headphones on this yet, but when the audio does become distorted again, I will try.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe you guys have defective DS units.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
