    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone knew how to make use of paletted textures. In 3d mode how does a texture know when to use a palette and where to find the palette? If a texture is put in vram bank A and the palette in bank E how does the texture know to use that specific palette? Can there be multiple palettes in a vram bank? 
<br/>
<br/>
I did search the forum and couldn't find any info. The ndslib doc doesn't cover palettes in 3d mode other than to say the palette is put in the appropriate bank. Maybe it's so easy I'm missing but if anyone has any info it would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To use just change the color format to GL_RGB8 and put the palette at the begining of vram E.  As for how to get multiple palettes in there i am uncertain at this time. Sorry for a fairly useless responce.  One of these days I will have some time to do some more examples.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
