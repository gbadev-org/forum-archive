    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on a some libraries for quite a few years now(a platform library, a GUI library and a graphics engine) and I want to get the licensing right. 
<br/>
All 3 projects currently have a GPL license active, but I want to offer more licenses so people have a bit more freedom.
<br/>
<br/>
I basically want 3 possible license directions:
<br/>
<br/>
- GPL
<br/>
- Non-commercial license
<br/>
- Commercial license
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to have your thoughts on this. Suggestions are very welcome on how to handle things. I want to have a licensing scheme where:
<br/>
- people can use the library
<br/>
- people can learn from observe the code
<br/>
- people can make modifications, but:
<br/>
- people can't publish the source code and claim they wrote it
<br/>
- people can't use the source code for commercial purposes (eg. making money from something I worked very hard on)
<br/>
<br/>
[removed license quote until further notice]

But it still does to some extent, as the application using the library should be possible to re-link with newer versions of the library.

That's one of the problems.
<br/>
LGPL also allows forking and I don't want that to happen.

Years of development went into the libraries I'm talking about, so I'm not just going to throw it on the street.
<br/>
I don't mind to make it open-source(GPL) and give free 'usage' licenses to non-commercial projects, but I don't want forks of my projects and people making money out of something I don't get anything for.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] I'll consider the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php" target="_blank">zlib/png license</a> for non-commercial projects. (and where derived projects must remain under that license)

In this case I exclude commercial applications. Because the license states at the end, that the notice can't be removed, any derivate product of the software will keep the "non-commercial" notice.
<br/>
<br/>
I added "applications and/or purposes" because it might be arguable that a library is not an application. This could avoid that other people make a commercial version of the library and sell that.
