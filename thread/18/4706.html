Just imagine - game compilation on PC, then one touch on DS to start DS Download Play and that's all. I hope it's possible... ;)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by revo on Mon Dec 27, 2004 11:36 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

But if DS Download Play allows to start multiplayer game without having game cart, I'm almost sure, that it is possible to execute any code in that way.
<br/>

I read in one magazine today, that PSP allows developers to execute code via wi-fi (from dev-kits). Maybe DS also  have kind of "Wi-Fi DevMode" or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Possible? Definitely. But I don't think Nintendo had that in mind for the end consumer. Too many unplanned things can happen if things were to get out of control.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I meant to say is that it is possible for developers to send games from a PC. However, the DS uses NiFi for its communication protocol. At the moment, only 1 USB stick is capable of sending and receiving data from the DS, and that is only with hacked drivers. And no developer knew that a USB stick would work in the first place. It's not the same as with the PSP, because it uses WiFi for everything, which any wireless device can be used to communicate to it.
<br/>
<br/>
It's easily possible for someone in the public to send a ROM to the DS for exectution, but we are still quite far away from that happening.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this is exactly how DS Linux will end up working, at least as an option.  
<br/>
<br/>
It would make much more sense to be able to stream off the PC the software you want to use, possibly like you said then saving it to some sort of flash in the GBA slot, than to have to have EVERYTHING on a cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect this might be done via bootloader on a cart though rather than the multiboot option.  This way you can have a full TCP/IP stack fire up meaning you can then stream using ANY wireless kit, possibly even via a VPN to your home PC if you are at a wifi hotspot.  I hate to say that the PSP is better designed for all this though, apart from its lack of a touchscreen.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

don't forget that you lose all your data when you turn of the DS. Or where you going to play Chrono Trigger 20 hours (or more) straight? :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
