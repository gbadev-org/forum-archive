<br/>
it needs the standard DS style touch controls, a'la MP:H
<br/>
<br/>
d-pad: forward, backward, and strafing.
<br/>
<br/>
touch screen would just turn left and right (properly, not like it's a big D-pad. that sucks), since there's no looking around for this version of doom. although the version of prboom I have on my poot allows for jumping AND looking around without skewing the FOV. but whatever. 
<br/>
I just think it'd be nice to play the game proper like, instead of this whole "180 degree turn in 6 seconds" thing
<br/>
<br/>
and perhaps if anyone could get the wifi to work, and perhaps write some documentation as to how to get said feature to work. could never get it running.
<br/>
<br/>
anyone up for it, dosn't seem that big of a project.. I just know nothing of it. I suppose it's selfish of me to simply want to reap the rewards of it all, but hey. what do you want from me...
<br/>
<br/>
I'll send whoever does it a fancy toy in the post. no really. well, it'll be sort of fancy.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, that's right. I said that.

I'm guessing your definition of "proper like" isn't how it was originally played.
<br/>
The original Doom did not have support for mouse look, or jumping.
<br/>
Also, you do know that holding X allows for faster movement, as well as turning. (And a turn even without holding X hardly takes 6 seconds :P)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

but you could use the mouse to turn left and right, allowing for quick 180's at the flick of a wrist. this is the action I was looking to emulate on touch screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
