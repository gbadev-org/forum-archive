    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On the new nintendods.com website, Nintendo states that "Nintendo DS wireless communication, including PictoChat, is not private and not monitored by Nintendo".  The statement that it is not private seems to imply that it is not encrypted.  This would be great for getting our own code running on the DS!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not private, meaning that if your DS is active, other DS units will be aware of it's prescence. However, actual conversations will still probably be "protected" in a sense. Otherwise you could have lots of people get in on your conversation.
<br/>
<br/>
1 thing that no one has addressed yet when sharing a game, how the main DS is going to determine which of the other 15 DS units are connected in a room with more than 16 units. I suppose some kind of channel system is being devised, or maybe even passwords. Who knows?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm going to take a wild guess
<br/>
<br/>
There will be a 'main' DS that will host the games, and the user of that one will choose all the other players, maybe even with Pictochat, based on their usernames they choose in the game.  (I think the DS is capable of switching to PictoChat in the middle of the game, heard something to that effect somewhere).
<br/>
<br/>
And the same thing when only 1 gamepak is used, except that the people have to be chosen before hand.  I think the BIOS has an option in there to transmit the games if they support it, but having only seen screenshots and no documentation I can't really tell...
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it could just be the first 16 people to start the game, or even the 15 people closest to the 'host' DS (not that the DS's use hosts, they're all daisy-chained)
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, but I hope to find out on the 21st!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
