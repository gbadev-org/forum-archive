    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all, as some of you know I've been working on hacking the GameMaker 6.0 file format (*.gm6, <a href="http://www.gamemaker.nl" target="_blank">www.gamemaker.nl</a>) to help create a runner program for the DS so that DS game development can be made easy for even people that don't know much C++. I'm now looking for a good coder that is willing to work with me on creating a DS game that reads gm6 files and plays them. If you'd like to be part of the project please email <a href="mailto:leif902@alltel.net">leif902@alltel.net</a> or post here (though it might be a while before I read this again). Thanks -Leif902

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">reverse engineering the file format is only about 10% of the work. not many people would be willing to spend much time programming this for DS, because if they have the skills to program something like that, why not use their time to program cool games/apps directly, instead of a highlevel tool to let others make (probably limited, lame) games? Not trying to put you down or anything, but just don't want you to get your hopes up. good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, I was toying with the idea of doing a flash renderer. There are some pretty sweet little flash games out there (Alien Hominid started out as one IIRC) and I reckon the DS homebrew scene would probably benefit from the system being a bit more accessible to newbs. Plus, the 2 screens and touchscreen are a natural fit for flash.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually GM6.0 isn't very limited at all (you just have to know how to program in GML which is still much easier than C++) but of course it is much more limited than C++. This would also just make it easyer for advanced coders to prieview their games before the final (C++) version or just make it easyer for newbs or old pro's to make games fast and easy w/o having to toy around w/ all the difficult time consuming C++. Also GM could use both screens (and all touch features) very easy (for instance we could add our own gm functions for touch_X and touch_Y and such)... Anyway Please post if you are willing to help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds good! I'll get back too you (though this is a more advanced C++ project, but you're probably better than I am so...)! You'll need a registered copy of GM6.1 beta (www.gamemaker.nl/beta.html) and the ability to create DS games. Please Email me an example playable by emulator and I'll decide if your coding is what we need for the project! Thanks -Leif902</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
