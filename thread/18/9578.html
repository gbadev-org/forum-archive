Try the 'search' button. It usually helps me when I remember seeing something somewhere, but can't find it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One problem with the search button is that it's throttled. If you choose keywords that don't give relevant results, you have to wait several seconds before making another search. Another problem is that short words such as "tv" and "out" tend not to have much weight in the search algorithm.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah I tried that but didn't find anything (doesn't mean it's not there, just means I'm blind) and so I posted.
<br/>
<br/>
"tv and out" returned nothing and "tv-out" returned posts that didn't look like the right ones.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll search more later.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
