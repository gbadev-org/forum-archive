    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Daigasso! Band Brothers DX has a never-before-seen flash chip that holds 8MB (bytes, not bits--it's 64Mb) of data on it.
<br/>
<br/>
There are already tools to extract/replace user-made songs from the save that pirates already have, but there's no way that I'm aware of to actually get the save off the real actual game card.
<br/>
<br/>
It's my understanding that the chip is a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.chipdocs.com/datasheets/datasheet-pdf/SGSThomson-Microelectronics/M25P64.html" target="_blank">ST M25P64</a>.  I'd like to update brettk's <a class="postlink" href="http://frodo.dyn.gno.org/~brettk/savsender" target="_blank">savsender</a> to support this chip, but I'm not really a hardware guy.  Any tips/etc.?
<br/>
<br/>
Or, is there already a tool I'm unaware of that can deal with this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, against my better judgment, I am working on this problem myself.
<br/>
<br/>
I've already created a little utility to probe for unknown types of saves and identified the chip, I think.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can use this to dump a copy of my card's save or not later today, with luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Make sure to take a look at the eeprom/flash code in libnds (include/nds/card.h &amp; source/common/card.c), which supports most/all of the other save chip sizes. Ideally you'd write your code as a patch to libnds code, so it supports the new size just like all the others.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'm definitely pursuing that route.  Life has intervened for the moment so I haven't got much further.  (Actually, I recompiled savsender with my changes and tried it, but it hit me there isn't 8 MB to malloc for the save, and savsender does it all at once.)  I am working on a solution for sending just pages over the wire so I can confirm that it's dumping properly before going further.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
