Here is my sprite sheet (unfinished):

I tried a few settings with grit, one way and the faces work but the numbers don't. Another way the numbers work but the faces don't (BJ having 4 pairs of eyes, ect).

I must be doing something really wrong here, what is the best way to layout my sprite sheet that will have many different sized sprites?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Use 2D sprite mode only if you don't need so much sprite memory, as it has a 32KB ram limit (<a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dsvideoobjs" target="_blank">GBATek</a>)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
