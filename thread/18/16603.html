    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got my DSi with acecard 2i, which seems to work well for homebrew development.
<br/>
<br/>
First step: Got things up and running and started to dig into the reports of the pressure sensitivity in Colors! not working for the DSi. Capturing some debug-info, that does seem to be the case. I get the following data from the device (using latest libnds and the touchReadXY function):
<br/>
<br/>
First read:
<br/>
Z1:37873 Z2:895
<br/>
<br/>
And following that, I randomly read:
<br/>
Z1:33456 Z2:895
<br/>
Z1:2 Z2:0
<br/>
Z1:0 Z2:0
<br/>
<br/>
And when I have the stylus touching the screen:
<br/>
Z1:4088 Z2:4088
<br/>
<br/>
I'm suspecting that there is little chance of getting the treasured pressure-sensitivty back, but here's me hoping that someone out there that knows the hardware better can give some insight.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion, and ignore it if it is completely out of the ballpark, but since official developers could only access the ARM7 via Nintendo's own APIs, you think that Nintendo did enough altering of that co-processor to break apps that did not use those APIs?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If i remember correctly, the ADC and it's wiring used for the touchscreen and microphone has changed between nds and ndsl slightly. Chances are that this is just the same here.
<br/>
I haven't looked to closely, if there is a picture of that chip inside the dsi to have a start?

PS: Did anyone start a collection of differences between the DSi's DS Mode and the real DS as we have known it so far?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I just received an M3i card for my DSi and I had a great disappointment when I realised pressure sensitivity didn't work at all with Colors!
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any news regarding pressure sensitivity on DSi since the last post? Do anyone have a hint if it's a software or a hardware issue?
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be sad to loose that feature that made Colors! for DS soooo much better than it's iPhone/iTouch counterpart (IMO).
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: If there's any testing to be done and you need help count with me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, well, if you compare the touch screens on the DSi and DSL directly, I'd say that they probably just removed pressure entirely.  The amount of resistance on the touch screen has gone down considerably on the DSi.  Seeing as how I can't even think of a retail game that actually uses it, it makes sense why they'd want to take it out.  After all, the touch screen is a lot nicer to use now that there's less resistance.  Nintendo doesn't give crap about homebrew uses of the pressure sensitivity, of course.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IIrc, Nintendo never advertised the pressure sensitivity and it wasn't an official feature. I was said - again, iIrc - that the feature could be removed at any time. So, even though it is unfortunate to loose it, I am not surprised they did it (in case that is really true, which I don't know at the time of writing).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can think of 2/4 games that uses pressure. one is hotel dusk that use it for flipping 2 switches at the same time. I think that that uses pressure to simulate 'multitouch'. 
<br/>
the other games are pokemon diamond/pearl/platinum, which has an poketch application called dot artist that uses pressure to determine the line thickness (at least, according to the pokemon guide my brother bought).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
edit: I just tested with my brothers diamond, and it doesn't use pressure. I assume pearl and platinum aren't any different. so that only leaves hotel dusk.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not on the flashcards, no.

<br/>
I've run up savegame exploits for both of the Ubisoft DSi enhanced games - Classic Word Games &amp; Cooking Coach. Dovoto used the Cooking Coach one to confirm the double processor speed and now we're digging through code to find the bits we need to sort out in libnds.
<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, be very glad that Ubisoft programmers aren't writing software that really seriously needs to be secure :p

Can you PM me with a link to where you post recent news about this? I have just bought a DSi and I so want 16 MB RAM access (who doesn't?). Not sure if you are just trying to get double CPU speed at this time, but I am interested in that as well (heh, not that I really need it, I am not a wasteful programmer). Anyway, having access to quick news about the matter is what I am looking for ;)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

for the people that doesn't know yet, a new dsi update blocked every dsi card, causing them to not work anymore. some of them can be reflashed so they work again, after the team releases an update to the card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In games that let you draw lines on the screen (eg. the professor layton series), I've often amused myself by pressing down on a part of the screen, then tapping elsewhere with the stylus. The position calculation interpolates and draws lines out radially from the held point -- I wonder if this would go unchanged on the DSi.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing even if there's no way for the app to read the pressure info, the interpolation would still be taken care of by the hardware, but it might still be worth looking into.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
