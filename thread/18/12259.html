    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apparently some new homebrew loaders allow you to see the icon and title stored in a DS rom... I was just wondering if there was any little program in existence to easily patch a 4-bit BMP (and text string?) into a DS rom. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing that *somewhere*, but I can't recall where any more... just trying to save myself the trouble of doing it myself ;P Any suggestions? (I'm using libnds.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I'm going to have to ask for help, here... so far I've tried -b and -o, and neither one has worked... has anyone done this successfully yet?
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">edit:</span> OK, whoops. I was just going <span style="font-style: italic">ndstool.exe csdemo.nds -o csicon.bmp</span>, thinking it would write that icon into the NDS file specified... I didn't realise I had to start with the .bin files in order to wind up with an NDS file with an icon in it. While I'm here though, I'll ask: what's the difference between the 'banner bitmap' and the 'logo bitmap'?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Huh! I would've expected that would be decided by software, not stored in a specific location in ROM... What about the three lines of text that you specify in the same command, though? It can't be the three lines you see when you're about to download a 'download play' game, because I can say from experience with Meteos that they can change at runtime...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, they are those lines. And what do you mean by change at runtime? The wmb host could easily change those in the offered binary at runtime.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ahh, OK! The -b option is only for generating ROMs meant to be sent over WMB? Now I get it...
<br/>
<br/>
Is -o for specifying the icon you'd see on the 'manual mode' firmware screen? (I ask because there's some homebrew hardware that finds those icons inside of roms, and I know PAlib roms show up with the PAlib icon...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I'd like to specify that based on the tests my friend with the R4 did, -b does indeed make the 32x32 16-color icon (at least as far as an R4 is concerned).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
