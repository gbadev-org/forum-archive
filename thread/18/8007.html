    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there any other way to run make under windows rather than having to go through msys? It seems a bit of a pain. Ideally I'd like to run the compile stage from within my editor (Codewrite) like I do with all my other development projects.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, where can I find out how to use Libnds since it doesn't seem to document the library. Or ideally...
<br/>
<br/>
Where can I find information about the nds hardware itself so I can convert my library from another system to work with the NDS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should be able to just call 'make' in the same directory as your makefile.
<br/>
<br/>
I've not used codewarrior, but the best solution might be a batch file...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
cd \path\to\my\project\
<br/>
make clean
<br/>
make

There should be a way of running make from CodeWright (being honest I have no idea how you use that piece of crap anyway, I thought it was one of the worst editors I've ever seen in my life)
<br/>
<br/>
The devkitPro installer includes Programmer's NotePad 2 set up and ready to go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Beats the shit out of editors with an ide just due to sheer speed, and there isn't anything that other editors do that you can't do with it, or make it do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Apart from run make apparently :P
<br/>
<br/>
Actually I do have some vague recollections of having trouble with external tools like make which was why I settled on UltraEdit.
<br/>
<br/>
One of life's constants really, try and separate a coder from his favourite editor &amp; you'll have a fight on your hands :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It can run make and anything you want it to run, the problem is running make using devkitARM as is causes errors, so if I try to compile (make) any of the nds-examples from a normal DOS box (or Codewrite) I get errors because the env vars are set up unix style.

You're running the wrong make, you need to run make provided with msys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
