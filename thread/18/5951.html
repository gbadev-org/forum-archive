    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if there is any way to play .bin files on ds hardware...taupes is a game available for download that was done for the gbax comp...I tought it would be kinda fun to play whack-a-mole on my DS but it's a bin file and and i can't figure out how to use it on hardware, and he didn't release the arm7 and arm9.bin that would make it so i could use darkfaders ndstool...
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

check dsbuild.exe and the example makefiles, you may be able to deal out more formats from the bin. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was able to use this snippet by itself in a makefile to change the file trial.nds (using make)  to more formats, and it should handle a trial.bin in and output a trial.nds and trial.ds.gba, (or change the name of the TARGET file in this snippet):
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">TARGET   :=   trial
<br/>
export OUTPUT   :=   trial
<br/>
<br/>
$(OUTPUT).ds.gba   :    $(OUTPUT).nds
<br/>
$(OUTPUT).nds   :    $(OUTPUT).bin
<br/>
<br/>
%.ds.gba: %.nds
<br/>
   @echo built ... $(notdir $@)
<br/>
   @dsbuild $&lt;  
<br/>
   
<br/>
%.nds: %.bin
<br/>
   
<br/>
   @ndstool -c $@ -9 $(TARGET).bin $(ARM7BIN) -b</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

as to the correctness of this makefile, well, cutting and pasting from makefiles kinda assumes you are going to paste into a makefile, I recommend alot more knowledge of them than I have when doing this sort of thing, but in this case it (at least) worked for me...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
