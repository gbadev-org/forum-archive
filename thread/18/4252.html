    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since the DS has both proprietary and 802.11 spec'd wireless, I'm going to assume two things: (1) The DS will use the proprietary protocol to communicate with other DS' and (2) The DS will use 802.11 to go online VIA wireless router.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that (2) is indeed true, does this mean that Nintendo plans to branch more into online games?  Let's face it, the options for online gaming on the GC have been slim, and depending on what kind of games you like, none.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I want Nintendo to do is have online options for their games, not just one or two but most of the multiplayer ones.  I don't think it would be much harder to make Mario 64 DS, Animal Crossing DS, Metroid Prime: Hunters, or Mario Kart DS playable online.
<br/>
<br/>
How 'bout a little poll...
<br/>
<br/>
And since it's 31 days until the DS is released, I'll give everyone a week to buy theirs and make final decisions.  As for anyone who doesn't buy their DS within the first week of its release, there's the "Other" section for you.  But seriously, I can't wait...  I bought my DS three months ago, this last month will be torture...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe they just use 802.11 to search for and handshake with other nodes on their proprietary protocol ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have bout 5 or 6 close friends, only 2 of them are into gaming, and one of them HATES the DS (PSP fan).  The other is broke and doesn't see a reason to save up and buy one.  So, I'm going to be stuck with nobody nearby to play any games on DS with, except for online, and maybe the kid down the street.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i like online gaming in the online tournament, or large amount of participators in an game, sense i.e. as in racing games, but also in many genres..... also online worldwide rankings.... and such
<br/>
<br/>
i think all these things will become commonplace in the future, and i think its all good... of course multiplayer with someone in the same room is just as good, sometimes better.. but if you can be playing multiplayer online AND multiplayer on the console simulataneously that would be even better
<br/>
<br/>
as for Nintendo, 'course they should invest more into it, but that is down to them
<br/>
<br/>
i dont have any consoles right now anyway myself, gotta make the time and money to buy and enjoy them! right now im planning to develop a GBA game</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I actually had a think about MMORPGs with the DS system. Like perhaps a Pokemon release which is entirely online, with a more complex pokemon leveling system, more items and larger worlds.
<br/>
I think It'd be great to start off you own 'team rocket'like evil clan, and just spend your time trying to steal pokemon; or just team up with others in gereral. I think It'd be a great step for Nintendo, since the game models/items etc can be pre-installedon the system and any extras that the game developers would liek to add on later is cached/ streamed to the system and downloaded again when the user restarts the game console. 
<br/>
<br/>
I really think that the DS has great online capabilities. Its just up to those brilliant coders out there...

About the whole online thing, I was just surfing through the GameSpot website when I found this <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/finalfantasyiii/news_6110005.html" target="_blank">article</a>. Although it talks about Square-Enix and their involvement with the DS, a simple sentence from Miyamoto is encouraging, which starts with "Well, we're planning to connect....". The only problem I see is whether they will be dedicated. "Planning" is just planning. Hopefully it won't end up being like "GC" planning.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I wouldn't be suprised if Nintendo is planning to dig deep in the MMORPG scene. And, since they're always so bloody secretive abotu their projects, I guess we'll just have to piece hints together.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hope they do.  With wireless abilities, the DS has so much potential.  NOBODY will have to buy hardware for the DS to play wireless games, just a wireless router for the <span style="text-decoration: underline">online</span> games.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if we signed a petition, and got 50,000 people from around the world to sign it, if Nintendo would promise to make some big-time online games for the DS, and maybe Square-Enix would make some really good MMORPGs, like Chrono Cross (it has enough Playable Characters!)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, let's all hope Nintendo and all the 3rd parties pull this off!  I can't wait... 18 more days... I can't sleep...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
