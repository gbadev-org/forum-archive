It thinks C:\devkitPro\uninst.exe and devkitProUpdater-1.2.8 is infected with the trojan horse Downloader.Zlob.AOG.

It probably looks similar to the trojan (from AVGs point of view).<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, unfortunately things like this happen on a regular basis. At one point several anti virus solutions decided that all devkitARM compiled nds binaries were the bricker trojan because they didn't bother signature checking properly.
