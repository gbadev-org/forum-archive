Sorry, I should have put a notice on the page.  Because I've made a lot of changes to the installer recently, you'll have to do a full re-install.  I took the updaters down for now.

If you'd been paying attention instead of rushing out unnecessary updates you'd know.
<br/>
<br/>
When you first started doing this I added you to the devkitpro sourceforge project &amp; asked that you consider doing installer packages for all the platforms. I did hope that we could avoid a situation where your installer conflicted with the smooth running of the toolchains. Unfortunately it appears you'd rather ignore repeated requests on IRC to slow down &amp; make sure things are stable before releasing yet another update.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

NDS Dev Env itself is a suggested program that may someday in the future be worth a damn, and definitely not an urgent requirement.  Hell, you can hardly do anything with it at the moment anyway.

In the IRC channel.  Hell, 75% of what goes on in there has nothing to do with DS deving and 90% of the rest is unintelligible to me anyway.  If someone wants to give me (email/forum post) somewhat clear requests, then I would be glad to oblige.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After a two month hiatus, I decided it was time to get NDS Dev Env updated.  This is mostly an intermediate release as I hope to work out some differences with wntrmute and get DevkitPRO a proper installer.  As I'm sure you've seen, however, his constant negative remarks towards NDS Dev Env make me less-than-motivated to get this done.  :(
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think NDS Dev Env friggin' rocks for newbies to the scene who would rather spend time coding than getting everything downloaded, installed, and configured.  On a similar note, I am thinking of gearing my tutorials towards PA_Lib, the HAM-like library that makes NDS coding even easier.  Feedback anyone?
<br/>
<br/>
As is often the case, real life has been extremely busy for me lately, so I haven't had time to do a thorough test of 2.4.0.  It now includes DevkitARM R12 and the latest ndslib.  Please test it out and let me know!

I would say it rocks for almost everyone... When I wanted to start, I read one or two tutorials (install 1000 things, do this and that...)... then I found years (run de exe), and found it way better :p
<br/>
<br/>
For PA_lib, I think a lot of people here don't like it, because it isn't low-level...  I guess it all depends if you're doing tutorials for newbies (like you did for ham) or want some more advance stuff (like J Harbour's book, I guess).
<br/>
If you want my personal feeling, dev tutorials with PA would interest tons of people (and I'm beginning to have some pretty/too basic questions by mail, would be nice to have some good tutorials around :p)
<br/>
<br/>
In case you decide to do it, here's a link to a basic one I did <a class="postlink" href="http://teamnnc.free.fr/html/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=2&amp;sid=3915575d047c88fc0c5cc13d8b76a265" target="_blank">http://teamnnc.free.fr/html/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=2&amp;sid=3915575d047c88fc0c5cc13d8b76a265</a>

Sure, I can install ndslib, devkit, etc... seperately. But I can also use nsddev env, which contains everything I need, and has been tested and proved to work.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

As I understand it, it was never a problem that the package existed. There were some (apparently notable) differences of opinion on the proper methodologies for updating.
<br/>
<br/>
In particular, it looked like Wintermute felt that some of Arog's updates were poorly timed, and that the snapshots were not at ideal points of stability, and sometimes inconsistent on what portions of code were used in relation to other portions (i.e. one tool is current but another is behind).

That's like saying people who can't sift through *nux dependancies probably can't use *nux.   And seeing as the people who use *nux Oses have tools that help make all that easier (emerge, ports, etc...) I don't see much wrong with making an installer to help make things easier, or with people who use them.  
<br/>
<br/>
an installer is a quick, easy, one stop shop.

As Mikaus said, uncalled for. There's no flaming in these boards.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i quite liked the easy installer. i hate makefiles, setting path variables etc. it made it a load easier..

admittedly i've since switched to devkitpro (seeing as i couldn't get anything to run on hardware when i compiled with arog's devenv.. dunno why.). very pleased with the "how to set up devkitpro" tutorial- because i really don't have a clue about those kind of things.
<br/>
<br/>
so i'm exactly the example you're looking for. my C/C++ is fine, but i hate messing about with command lines and nonsense. i wanna get started right away usually!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I see a lot of people don't agree with me :) I just believe that if you can't set up a simple dev env, then you won't be able to code for the DS. As of now, it's not a very easy thing to do, you have to really know how to code well. I'm not being an "elitist", its the truth. VisualBasic kiddies just won't be able to make things for the DS, sorry. Having the easy installer is fine for people that actually know what theyre doing, but when it comes time to update their ndslib and devkitarm, which is very often (since ndslib is constantly changing), if theres no easy installer, than theyre out of luck.

@TheMikaus
<br/>
The difference is you can run Linux fine without any technically expertise (most of the time, hehe) but for the DS development, you have to know what your doing. As I said before, Visual Basic doesn't work on DS :) The skills required to checkout a project over cvs are substantially less than that of making even the simplest demo for the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't fully agree because I had problems with the cvs/dev env stuff at first when I was working with the GBA.  I was very thankful for devkitadv.  It was easier to setup at the time than devkitarm.  And even though I had problems getting cvs and the env setup I still coded two games for the GBA (not using ham).
<br/>
<br/>
I had to use the tutorials to set up my env using the cvs stuff. but it's all good now.

<br/>

i can't set up a dev env without something telling me how. i don't know where to get all the files from. i don't know what things i need usually.. and i'd probably install it all in a horrible messy way.
