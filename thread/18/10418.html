    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to set up an orthogonal view where 0,0 is located in the left upper corner and 255,191 in the right lower, how is that done?
<br/>
I also want to display one texture that will be updated each frame, where should this be done to not flicker do I need two and then swap between them?
<br/>
<br/>
a little pseudo code example would be great!
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Note that one "3d unit" is actually made up of many, many small, since it's represented with fixed point math.
<br/>
<br/>
For animation, if you want to do it the same way as you usually animate sprites, you'd write the new texture to vram every once in a while. However, libnds's 3d implemention does not (afaik) tell you where it has loaded your textures, so you'd basically have to write a little mini 3d lib with a texture manager. It's not as hard as it sounds, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Another way is to load all the frames into vram, and then just binding different textures depending on which frame you need.
<br/>
<br/>
Both approaches work (I think), but the second takes a lot more memory. I'd recommend starting with number 2, and then, as you gain more knowledge about the DS's 3d hardware, move to the first.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">two questions...
<br/>
<br/>
1. the projection is upside down I thought scale with 1,-1,1 and then translate y down would solve it but I cant get it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
2. My texture is only updated once... some pseudo
<br/>
vramacnt = 0x80
<br/>
<br/>
write to vram A
<br/>
<br/>
vramacnt = 0x83
<br/>
<br/>
glReset
<br/>
set projection
<br/>
set model matrix mode
<br/>
render quad
<br/>
flush
<br/>
WaitforVBL
<br/>
<br/>
in the TextureViewer in dualis I can see the correct texture but the output is the same as the first time. (it doesnt hang).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
