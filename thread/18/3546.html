    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have read a few articles with a headline suggesting that the DS will cost as much as a GBA (i am assuming SP).
<br/>
<br/>
edit: It probably cost at least twice as much to make though.

I have seen some suggeting the number $150, which I think is way too optimistic. $200-300 is more likely.

Wifi and dual screens is expensive hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even though this is a handheld, since it's not a successor to the GBA, we can't expect GBA prices (near $100). However, I can't remember Nintendo ever selling a piece of hardware for more than $200. $200 seems about right for the handheld too, even if they aren't loosing money on each sale of a DS (though they probably will be).<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm hoping for around 200 Canadian (I'm Canadian :P) so having it at $200-$300 US would be a lot more Canadian.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The Gamecube and GBA SP aren't <span style="font-style: italic">cheap</span>, their efficient and cost effective!! Think positively!! :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
