I use xvidcore (my fix version) building mpeg4 decoder lib.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(I make bat file in src dir for building lib).

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
put  m4vtst1.sc.nds (at m4vtst1.rar) into card root dir
<br/>
rename  sample1(2).m4v to s.m4v into card root dir
<br/>
<br/>
run m4vtst1.sc.nds and play s.m4v mpeg4 file.
<br/>
<br/>
It's still not optimization (slow...).
<br/>
<br/>
I found some arm asm &amp; arm dsp asm optimization code in mplayer sources libavcodec lib.
<br/>
<br/>
maybe i will change lib for decoding (xvidcore seem slow).
<br/>
<br/>
PS. I think it possible to decode mpeg4 simple 256x192 24fps
<br/>
when best optimization idct &amp; yuv-&gt;rgb and others.

They introduced a chip so the play-yan couldn't be patched and used by r0m monkeys...and actimagine does do MPEG4 decoding full screen in comercial games.

I tell you a cruel true fact.
<br/>
Because of my poor ability , it's difficult for me to continue maintaining.
<br/>
<br/>
I may try it for my interesting &amp; for fun,but I can't  promise anything.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, using xvidcore isn't  a good idea for decoding mpeg4 in nds.
<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing about arm core cpu optimization .
<br/>
<br/>
I may try using other library ( libavcodec &amp; libavformat in ffmpeg sources).

<br/>
<br/>
Okay, first off, the ActImagine codec is commercial, so no encoder for public usage will ever be released. Some goes for BinkDS, which achieves similar results (I've seen it used in a few games here and there, but I suspect ActImagine is part of the official Nintendo dev kit, which is why it gets used more often)
<br/>
<br/>
With regards to encoding for general usage, I would imagine that encoding for the 256x192 format would work best on the DS. Dual-screen is definitely going to be too slow for normal movies, unless slo-mo is the order of the day.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that some peope seem to enjoy watching movies on iPods with screens smaller than that of the DS, though, I doubt single-screen would be an issue.

But the eyes ability to look at two things at once is limited, let alone the brain to follow and process it all at once.
<br/>
<br/>
The two screens on the DS are usefull in games for a few reasons, but you seldom need to actualy focus on both at once.
<br/>
And, if your not focusing on both at once, then you might as well have one screen with the best streaming quality possible, rather then 2 "ok" streams of which you will only occasionaly glance to the second.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

A typical film converted from a 16:9 source such as widescreen DVD will be 256x144 pixels. This leaves 24 pixels on the top of the 256x192 pixel top screen and 24 pixels on the bottom that are not covered by video. This bottom area is plenty big enough for 2-line subtitles.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, these ActImagine guys are pretty tight-lipped about their algorithm. I think they'd have us believe it works by FM (f***in magic). Assuming they're not creating a custom hardware-accelerated port for each and every handheld device, from the claims of the wide variety of devices it runs on it sounds like some fairly conventional (albeit clever) algorithm in pure software.
<br/>
<br/>
Not the fastest CPU in the world, but the DS has one advantage over average iPod, cell phone, etc. that AI's secret codec runs on - a hardware 3D transform engine. Could this be used to offload some of the work of MPEG video rendering? I'm thinking specifically different types of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_compensation" target="_blank">motion compensation</a> schemes used by XviD/etc. Since commonly any given frame is almost identical to the previous frame, the common practice is to record as few 'full' (key) frames as possible, and for the rest encode only the differences between the frames. Often this difference results from things like camera panning, tilt and zoom, so motion estimation algos encode this difference more compactly by subdividing the scene into movable blocks of variable size and basically sliding them around. Once the closest possible approximation has been made by blocksliding, only the minor difference between this approximation and the real next frame has to be sprinkled into the resulting image. Sliding and distorting all these blocks eats up a lot of CPU though... seems like something the 3D engine could do. Even more complicated geometry transforms are possible (define the frame to be on a stretchy 'rubber sheet' of triangles, whose vertices can move in any direction?) but that would require fundamentally changing how the ENcoder works too, which doesn't sound like fun at all.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not an expert at all on video compression, some of you might be. Does any of this sound feasible, or am I smoking the crack?<br/>_________________<br/>There is never time to do it right, but always time to do it over.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#138959 - OOPMan - Fri Aug 31, 2007 8:24 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't know about that. I don't think ActImagine even claimed it worked by FM, as you put it. The existence of BinkDS and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-video.com/" target="_blank">Caimans Codec</a> support this...
<br/>
<br/>
What I do know is that I did some research a while back on Fixed Point vs. Floating Point. According to the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ddj.com/embedded/197003621" target="_blank">Dr. Dobbs Journal article</a> I found most video codecs do not gain ANY benefit from being floating-point-erised, as they are "bit-exact"...
<br/>
<br/>
With regards to DS vs. iPod, etc, the device actually has various advantages. For a start, the DS is a 2-processor device. I would imagine that., with careful coding, this is what allows for audio AND video to be decoded at the same time by commercial codecs. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, being a gaming device, the DS is design a little differently in terms of hardware bus, I'd imagine. Although the DS lacks the RAM capacity of most cellphones and iPods, it's designed with relatively high performance in mind and hence features various patches of high-speed memory that probably give it an edge in certain things. More info on this is available in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dev-scene.com/NDS/Tutorials_Day_2" target="_blank">Dovoto's tutorial</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, unlike devices like the iPod and most cell phones, the DS features both 2D and 3D acceleration. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, you mentioned 3D, but truth be told, I doubt the DS's 3D core is being used by the commercial codecs (Although I too am not an expert in video compression, and hence I may be totally wrong).
<br/>
<br/>
My personal guess is that the commercial video codec implementations on the DS use the 2d core for drawing and take advantage of certain facts to optimise the video:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>The DS is an ARM-only device. Hence all code in the codec can be written solely with the ARM in mind.
<br/>
</li><li>Video will be either 256x192 or either 2x(256x192) or 1x(256x384) in resolution. Hence, the codec need only support these two/three resolutions and can optimise it's memory usage appropriately...
<br/>
</li><li>The DS features two processors, one of which is usually devoted to handling audio. I would guess the commercial codecs do just this and quite probably store their audio in ADPCM format, which the DS' ARM7 can decode natively with minimal overhead.
<br/>
</li><li>The DS features a clever and relatively high-performance memory layout for a device of it's sort. Many advanced homebrew devs have been making use of this to optimise their projects (I know that simonjhall's QuakeDS project makes use of some of the fast VRAM for non-video related tasks.)
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
These points lead me to suspect that the commercial codecs don't do any wizardry with the 3d core, but rather rely on well-coded 2d solutions.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, unless my memory fails me, I'm not sure the DS' 3d core can be used to perform the kinds of CPU-eating sliding/distoring operations you'd like. I was under the impression that it's a bit of a "Black Box" and is relatively disconnection from the rest of the system in certain ways...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I looked at using mpeg2 on the DS, the motion compensation step wasn't the most intensive part of the decode step, since it's all done with integer maths.
<br/>
However if you were to do it with the 3D hardware you'd need to be able to get the results back (which isn't trivial) as this is not the final step in the algorithm. Plus if you were to upload each macroblock as a small texture map you'd have to get these textures into one of the DS' texture formats...which would be an interesting challenge!

I never said they were, in fact I'm quite sure they're not, since they're leveraging the same code for iPods and cell phones. My half-baked idea was that using DS-specific hardware like the 3D engine for certain messy decode steps would give homebrewers an advantage over the commercial codecs (though now that the experts have weighed in, this does not sound feasible :-)

Video quality of ActImagine videos varies. For sexample of good quality I'd suggest you take a look at the intro videos for Final Fantasy III DS, Rune Factory and Luminous Arc. Lunar Knights also features nicely done ActImagine video. The intro for Metroid Prime: Hunters was also very good quality, except when handling dual screens.
<br/>
<br/>
As is always the case with high-compression codecs, quality can vary from video to video quite drastically, depending on how many compression runs were made during the encoding process and so forth...
<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that poor looking ActImagine videos are more due to sloppy encoding and source material than any defects in the codec...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

It's a type of MPEG-1 yes, but it's not <span style="font-style: italic">standard</span> MPEG-1.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">why mp4 or m4v at all?
<br/>
<br/>
the format shouldn't matter, as there's surely going to be a conversion process to make any video files viewable on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
may aswell use a format that suits best to DS.
<br/>
<br/>
unless m4v is actually best for ds...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by OSW on Thu Sep 20, 2007 9:34 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

If you just want to watch a particular M4V:
<br/>
<br/>
If Windows Media Player can play it, then STOIK Media Converter might be able to transcode it to AVI so that you can turn it into a DPG. If VLC media player can play it, then VLC might be able to <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.videolan.org/index.php/Transcode" target="_blank">transcode</a> it to AVI so that you can turn it into a DPG.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need to convert them to a reasonable sized Xvid file (256*192) and then rename that to m4v. The m4v bit does not matter - its the xvid part that matters and this will generally be avi extension which you can rename to m4v.
<br/>
<br/>
Most programs can convert to Xvid - just make sure resolution is (256*192) or something similar if you dont want it full screen.<br/>_________________<br/>White DS --- Supercard SD --- Passcard ---
