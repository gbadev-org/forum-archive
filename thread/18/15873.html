Regarding your first question: Could you rephrase that, please?

... But, well, I think the best thing a team can do is make a decent design document (D3 ;^D ) and a small prototype (not neccessarily running on the NDS - can really be anything, as long gameplay resembles what it's going to be like on the target hardware) that demonstrates the game's core gameplay, then send it to some publishers and see how things work out.

Time to fork this topic.
<br/>
<br/>
First, you need to realize that publishers sell games to make money for themselves.  All of their decisions revolve around this key point.  The publisher needs to feel that A) they will not waste time/money dealing with you, B) they can make money selling your game, and C) they can make enough money selling your for it to be worth their time.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are basically three approaches you can take.  For what it is worth, some publishers will not work with you unless they have some sort of a preexisting relationship.  Assuming they look at "outside projects", here are the approaches you can take:
<br/>
I) Document the game you want to make and go begging for the resources to make it.  The publisher's reaction is going to be "Who are you, and why should I give you anything to work on this?"  If you can satisfactorily answer those questions, your project will be funded if it otherwise fits into their overall portfolio.  If you have not release a title that has sold a bunch of units, chance are the publisher will not be interested in working with you because they have no guarantee that you will even be able to complete what you have on paper.
<br/>
II) Create a demo of the game you want to and go begging for the resources to make the complete version.  Again, the publisher's reaction is going to be "Who are you, and why should I give you anything to continue working on this?"  Having said that, the answers to those questions are less important to the extent that the demo speaks for itself.  If the demo looks interesting the publisher may willing to negotiate with you.  An advanve to complete the product may or may be possible (ie, you might to finish development out of your own pocket).  Your game may be branded ("Your ghouls are neat, but we want to release a Hello Kitty title.") or otherwise tampered with so that it fits the needs of the publishers portfolio.  If they don't think they can release it as is or turn it into something else they are otherwise interested in, it is time to approach another publisher.  There are cases where a publisher may actually be interested in a demo, but they decide not to deal with it for fear of complications involved in getting it out the door.
<br/>
III) Complete a game and go looking for a publisher to sell it for you.  This is probably the most cut and dry and the publisher's reaction is going to be "What do you have?  Will it sell?".  The publisher is either interested in it as is, or they are interested in a modified version (as above) or they are not interested at all.  Seeing as the game basically complete, they do not have to worry about it not getting finished, so it is easier for the publisher to say yes.  Chances are, some modifications may be requested.  Or they may not be.  It just depends on who you are dealing with and how hands on they are.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to become a licensed Nintendo developer, there are a similar set of hoops you need to jump through.  Nintendo wants to know that A) you can complete projects (track record), and B) that you can protect their trade secrets (not under capital or otherwise at risk of bankruptcy and have a secure environment).  Seeing as they ultimately want to sell carts to you, they will also want to know what you are planning to make (not objectionable) and how you plan to sell it (business plan).  There are probably licensing fees, but I don't know anything about that.  To the extent that you clear all the hoops, you are good to go.

Oh, I totally forgot to mention, that you have to do some <span style="font-weight: bold">market research</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">A BUSINESS PLAN</span> (includes the former)!
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't read sgeo's whole post, yet, but I think he indicated that, too. (Now I have and he did. :^) )
<br/>
<br/>
@ sgeos: I partially disagree with point 3. It may happen, that publishers will take a nearly finished gamea and sell it, but I doubt any majors will do that. Publishers want to have controll over their investment, that's why they hire external or send internal producers. From what I hear, even for internal studios, it's very uncommon to get the green light for production without any of the publisher's representatives.
<br/>
A team, that has a game nearly done is risking to have to rework most of it, because the only publisher that was willing to even let the demo be tested, wants it that way. So, you've wasted time and efford.
<br/>
<br/>
There are exceptions, sure, but those are outstanding, very promissing products.
<br/>
<br/>
Another way would be to publish your game yourself. That requires some sort of online shop and / or some k? for running prints. Advertisement is another story. :^/

If they think it will sell, and they don't have to shell out any cash to make it, why would they not take it if matches their portfolio?  It can be out the door as marketing sees fit because it is already done.  Some inhouse studios can not guarantee working seamlessly with marketing.
<br/>
<br/>
Budget- we don't want tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to get this made because it is already done.  Your budget consists of marketing expenses and other things you have no intention of telling us anything about anyway.

What investment?  The game is done.  You are talking about a royalty deal.  You want someone who is willing to sell your game and collect money doing it.  If they desire or require rework those details need to be negotiated.  If you would rather see the game not released at all than severely tampered with, then just be fussy and they will be interested or not.

Irrelevant for something that is already made.  Their options are A) it meets our needs, we will take it, B) it kind of meets our needs, but this is what you need to do for us to take it, or C) good job, but it's not what we are looking for right now; better luck somewhere else.

<br/>
Of course not.  Internal studios are asking for money.  Point three refers to something that is basically complete with no intention of an advance on royalties... because the game is already done.  This is very different from an incomplete project because the options are A) release it as is, B) test is some more and then release it, C) rework it and release it.  In theory it could be out the door (ie, carts ordered) by the end of the week, although in practice this is not going to happen.

<br/>
If only one publisher is interested and they require massive rework, have you wasted your time?  Maybe, maybe not.  It depends.  Your options may be A) show a demo that gets ignored, or B) show a complete game that gets completely reworked and then released as something else.  In this case, would you rather rework your game to get it released at all?
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a finished quality product, someone ought to be interested in it basically as is unless your timing is horrible or you have a lot of enemies.  Rework is expensive and you would be a fool rework your game for free.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess this is... &lt;OFFTOPIC&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
(I am still relaxed, so you can picture this post that way. :^) )
<br/>
<br/>
Although I logically agree with most of what you write, you forget one important point: There seems to be a "different logic" when it comes to management and publishers. That may not be true for all of them, but the more common ones are definitely among them.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the publisher has to invest money, even into "finished" games. PR (which needs preparation to be good and to translate into sales) and print ("to make DVDs") costs are among the things a publisher will pay for. The budget for that can easily be as big as the development budget itself. (Except for Duke Nukem Forever. ;^D )
<br/>
There have been a lot of games that cost more to produce (develop, market etc.) than the money that sales generated. Good companies can go down that way (this is generally speaking!) (Looking Glass - RIP :^C )
<br/>
Publishers always want the least risks. Releasing a product you had no creative control over isn't exactly a "no risk" scenario... especially when talking about a first product and a first business relationship (that's what the question was about).
<br/>
<br/>
Then, how does a publisher know a game is good enough to be sold? There has to be a lot of testing and adjusting to be made and sometimes (I guess it more like most of the time) products, that looked promissing and nearly done in the beginning, turn out to need a major revamp.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But we could go on forever with this discussion, each having a seemingly valid meantal image of our very own point of view on the same thing.
<br/>
I'm just saying that there is no one way, nor are there two or three. As a young development team, you just have to keep trying and to put effort into the project. And understanding how the business works also helps a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have too much experience with all of that (from the business side), so I am not much of a help here. Also, I haven't pitched (is that the right term?) a game to a publisher myself, although I know peope (in person) who have (some were successful :^) ).
<br/>

<br/>
That's the point and we both agree with it. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
Btw: The game industry is somewhat simmilar to the music industry. In order to get your record published you either have to rerecord existing songs entirely or you have had put a lot of money into the first recording to begin with. Well, in the latter case, it's not guarranteed that you won't have to rearrange or rerecord at least some parts or remove songs etc. It all depends on what the publisher thinks it can sell the most.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, it was nice having a chat with you. :^) It's always good to check out how others think about certain topics, as one can learn a lot from sharing experiences. I enjoy that very much. :^D

<br/>
I'm not sure what you mean by management.  All companies have management.
<br/>
<br/>
I will be explicit about one of my assumptions.  No publisher is going to be shy about rejecting your project.  There are a lot of risks and other considerations, so chances are great that the first few places you approach will not be interested.  Interested means that they think <span style="font-weight: bold">they</span> can make enough money selling your to cover all expenses and turn enough of a profit to justify tying people up who could otherwise be doing something else.  Making money for you is nowhere on their list of priorities, it is just a potential side effect of doing business with you.  (Yes, some publishers fail to pay developers.)
<br/>
<br/>
I will also explicitly state what I mean when I say a project fits into a publisher's portfolio.  Every publisher has an idea of the kind of games that work with their image.  This may be "children's games", "online network games", "high quality games based on movies", "anything that sells at least 500K units", etc.  If you make a single player GTA clone that does not look like a 500K+ seller, none of the above publishers will be interested.  The "high quality games based on movies" might be interested in shoehorning your project depending on what you have. If it looks like your game might sell 470K units, the "anything that sells at least 500K units" publisher may or may not be willing to work with you bumping the quality of your product up if they think it can be made to break 500K.  The other publishers may or may not look at your game, but they will ultimately turn it down even if they do.  To recap, this means that a pulisher who sells only "children's games" will look at your project and turn it down even though they think someone can sell over 400K units.  Why?  A GTA does not fit with their image.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, manufacturing and marketing.  Shipping basically a manufacturing expense and there will be other miscellaneous xxpenses.
<br/>
<br/>
Gross Profit = Units Sold * (Sale Price - Manufacturing Expense Per Unit) - Shipping Expenses -  Other Miscellaneous Sales Expenses
<br/>
<br/>
The size of your game, and the save game requirements should pretty well limit you cart choices and therefore define manufacturing expense per unit.  There is a good chance the publisher is going to have a sales price in mind if they are interested at all.  Before your project is sold, "units sold" is going to be an estimate.  Your target market is going to help define potential units sold.  I'm operating under the assumption that shipping expenses and other miscellaneous expenses are ultimately going to be negligible.
<br/>
<br/>
Net Income = Gross Profit - Development Expenses - Developer Royalties - Marketing Expenses - Other Miscellaneous Expenses
<br/>
<br/>
Gross profit, the result of the above equation, is the money on the table after all units have been sold.  Development expenses are whatever the publisher needs to shell out to get a program that can be sent to the factory, probably a lump paid out in milestones if they are interested at all.  Developer royalties are any extra money the developer receives later and publishers are known for going through great pains to make to this figure a zero.  Marketing expenses are going to be controlled by the publisher and I doubt they will give you much information about them, but I may be wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
Return on Investment = 1.0 - (Money Left Over at the End / Money Thrown in at the Start)
<br/>
<br/>
If we spend $100 to make $70, our ROI is -30%.  If we instead make $112, our ROI is %12.  An ROI of 0% is a waste of time (unless other long term goals are being supported).  Both your project's projected net income and ROI are going to need to be favorable from the publisher's perspective, or they will reject your project.
<br/>
<br/>
As the world goes, almost anything can be negotiated.  This usually translates to a bad deal for the developer.  If you are too fussy, the publisher will lose any interest they might otherwise have had.  "Too fussy" depends on what you bring to the table.
<br/>

<br/>
Someone on the other end is going to play your game.  They may not beat it.  You may or may not want to point certain things out to them so they get noticed.  Note that they are not going look at your demo until you sign something that says you won't sue them if they release something very similar to your project.

And this takes time, which translates to salaries (money) and opportunity cost for the publisher.  Your project will be rejected if you make a bad first impression.

Welcome to the messy world of dealing with other people?  The publisher knows all of this, and that is why they are more than willing to turn you down ASAP.

It depends on how you define your terms.  Perhaps I should redefine mine to remove ambiguity.
<br/>
I) You ask for the entire development budget up front.
<br/>
II) You ask for the part of the development budget after you have started the project.
<br/>
III) You foot the bill for development.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could throw money at the publisher, but I've never heard of that.  You could also ask for extra money, but you may be asking for a deal breaker.

You also need to realize that you will be turned down, but hopefully not by everyone.  In this day and age, you could run out of publishers to approach.

<br/>
In other words, you need to make a commercial quality product?  Naturally, it depends on what you are making and who you intend on approaching, but if you are not aiming for 100K to 1M units based on some objective criteria, I think you are wasting your time.  Aim != hit the mark, which is why <span style="font-weight: bold">aiming</span> for 3K units is a waste of time.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect silent_code and myself actually agree, but we are defining our terms differently and operating on different assumptions.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before I go to the studio (so I will have to skip that last post, sorry) ... here are some other options:
<br/>
<br/>
 - Develop your game and then apply for a job and pitch it to your producer after some time in the team!
<br/>
 - Develop your game on multiple platforms such as Windows, flash or java (possibly doing so using a scripting language with JIT compilation to allow the most amount of code/logic to be shared). This allows you to test the game against a market and may build up a buzz.
<br/>
 - Pitch it to GAME, they have already published titles and may be the best bet for indie's!!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And most importantly; document your code like you plan on selling your code as a development studio with publishing (or a publisher with a studio) would have a much easier job in adopting your game and expanding on its development (possibly).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or they like games, just not the games they happen to be selling.  I suspect there are some nethack junkies out there who are working on mad 3D titles.  I suspect there are people out there who work on licensed E-rated games but prefer to play wilder titles.  My grandma plays nothing but tetris.  The president of a book publishing company once said, "There is some c**p you just need to publish."  As far as video games go, those are the endless sequels and licensed drivel the market is plagued with.  It is easy to sell, and publishers don't want to go bankrupt.

The platform is irrelevant.  Handheld or portable status is largely irrelevant.  You need to show that A) you do indeed finish projects, and B) your finished projects make money.  If you broke a million units in $1 PC shareware sales, and you want reinvest some of that into a retail DS release, I highly suspect people would look at your offer.

<br/>
The quality is up to par with other commercial products.  If you make your own soap, but it has lye pockets in it, that is not commercial quality soap.  Games on that are up to par with less fancy released commercial titles are going to be "low quality", but commercial quality none the less.  Things like the NES games rereleased on GBA are a special category.

A products user base is not the same thing as a customer base.  Plenty of people like nethack, but few of them would pay for it.  Due to the number of units that need to be sold to make retail publishing worth the effort (this will be different for say, cell phone games), a product's customer base is going to be measured in at least thousands of units sold.  Units sold != total users, as there may be more than one user per house and pirates do not count either.  So, the two questions are... What are your net sales (gross sales minus returns and discounts) in dollars?  What is your customer base in thousands of units sold (round down)?  Because the answers to these questions are $0 and 0 units for free games, free games are completely off the radar.

I had not thought of that, and you are right.  The thing is, in house developers start mature engines.  If you send them GTA meets Mortal Kombat, even if you can make Sesame Street meets the Teletubbies using the same engine it is probably going to be so far off the mark that you are talking about a different game as far as... probably everyone is concerned.  Even if they realize that you could make SSmtT, they may not think it is even worth bringing up.  Afterall, to the extent you made GTAmMK, it can be assumed that that is what you are interested in making.

In theory, yes.  Afterall, it rarely hurts to ask.  Furthermore, even if you attempt III), the publisher may see it as nothing more than a demo.

Fascinating.  As a developer, you might rather work with a retailer because they might be less apt to step on your toes.  The distinction between what a retailer and a developer does is greater than that of a publisher and a developer.  Also, a guaranteed retail release is fantastic.  To the extent it is "in-house" they may be more apt to push the product than that of a 3rd party publisher.

Hmm; well I guess some DS/Wii specific controls do not translate well to other platforms ... but if you develop your game with removable game components and are able to produce the game (pushing whatever brand you suggest to the publishers) then you will have a slightly stronger case than an inflexible game system that only works with one control method.

People sue when they feel threaten and there is money on the table.  Sometimes either one will suffice.  I'm sure piracy is a concern, but don't forget that Nintendo is in the business of making physical carts.

Unfortunately, it seems that the majority of people who use flash devices and whatnot are in it for the piracy.  From a business perspective, Nintendo believes it's worth the tradeoff of making us homebrewers mad, in order to prevent losses due to piracy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So what kind of "removable game components" would you add to make a platformer work with a touch screen? Or a phone keypad or a PC keyboard that doesn't allow more than one button to be pressed at once?

People can find decent SWF games on Newgrounds for $0. For a jar or swf or js game, is an advertising-supported model viable, or did you have some other revenue source in mind?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Browser games can generate revenue through subscriptions and [possibly] advertising. In regards to removable game components in a platformer, you could have a particular weapon such as a target missle that the touch screen and mouse would operate, not available on a phone! Clearly it is not possible to have a system that makes use of all available features while still being able to translate to all platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
In this case you would want an alternative option of gameplay that is just as fun as the target missile. Instead you could have it replaced with an auto target system for the missile.
<br/>
<br/>
In general I was thinking more on the lines of designing the gameplay for the PC/Browser, but being able to translate well to the DS - where you would have already prepared the design to make use of the added features rather than scratching your head once you got the deal.
<br/>
<br/>
So it's more of a design strategy issue than anything else.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In retrospect, I should have said that the platform is <span style="font-weight: bold">largely</span> irrelevant.  This certainly applies to your portfolio of past works and it may also apply to your demo.  To the extent you can pull the project off, anything in your portfolio matching your target market is going to be a big plus.  Naturally, the more work you have done on the target platform, the better.  Failing that, the more work you have done with similar authoring tools the better.  The goal is really to show that you can get the job done and that you will do a good job.  If you can't do that, why should they deal with you?  (They shouldn't.)

Of course, but you don't care about the vast majority of people, just the ones willing to suscribe.  When it comes to demos, a 1% conversion rate is actually pretty good.  In other words, 300,000 downloads equates to 3,000 sales.
<br/>
<br/>
Think of it this way, how many people walk by that candy bar in the grocery store before someone picks it up?  (Many.)  Does the grocery store care that most people are not interested?  (No.)  The candy bars are there for the people who are willing to pay for them.

Playing games on cell phones sucks, there is no getting around it.
<br/>
This is how I would map the keys for the NES megaman:
<br/>
123 - Jump (left, vertical, right)
<br/>
4 6 - Walk (left, right)
<br/>
5 - Shoot
<br/>
789 - Slide (left, current direction, right)
<br/>
*0# - Menu / UI / System
<br/>
You could jump and shoot with this scheme, but it would be annoying.  The solution?  Don't make stages that require much if any jumping and shooting.
