    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to sync gameplay against the song playing with libntxm, however the lib itself doesn't seem to have any native support for this. Further, I can't existing structure I can call upon from the arm9 that would give me any solid indication of song positioning. I tried using demokit.c to feed off the timers but much to my dismay the arm7/9 use separate timers.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not afraid of recompiling the lib, but I can't find a simple way of doing it without major reconstruction or additions to the arm9/7 communication structures, which I don't understand nearly enough to attempt.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any ideas on doing this?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
