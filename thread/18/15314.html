    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like to rapidely add some basic audio to my game demo but I don't have much time to spend on this. Is it possible to implement an audio system that plays a sound track + some sfx wavs in less than 10 hours given 0 knowlege of DS audio? Or even better: is there a free library?

It doesn't have to be a reliable solution for long term.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, iirc, there are two libs promoted around this forum. one of them is called something similar to "multithreaded sound library"... search for it!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">CUrrently this lib is uncompatible with latest libnds. If you want, send me a PM and I'll send you the fixed version. (I don't want to release it publicly for now since the next libnds will broke it due to IPC changes, so I'll wait to have a future proof version for release).

<br/>
EDIT: your problem may be due a to simple not updated example . Just add in your arm7 main.c a AS_Init() (somthinhg like that) and that's it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
