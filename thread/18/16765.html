    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to optimise my emulator and though I put the opcode jump table in DTCM but it didn't work (tested on No$GBA and HW).
<br/>
Looking into it a little deeper it seem the section is zeroed out where it's supposed to be copied from, in the link map it says it's load address is 0x0201f0f4. When a added a breakpoint for writes to 0x0B00000 in No$GBA it actually shows the coping of data from 0x0201f0f4 to 0x0B00000, and the area at 0x0201f0f4 is just zeroes for the amount of data I use in my DTCM section.
<br/>
I just used ".section .dtcm" to declare my section and this is for ARM asm.
<br/>
So is this how it's supposed to work or is it a bug?<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Use  .section .dtcm, "ax", %progbits
<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea why the designers of GNU Assembler didn't make that the default.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
