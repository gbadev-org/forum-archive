Ah, thanks.  I was in #dsdev and Parrot mentioned that it was unstable.  I've only played your port of Rick Dangerous based on it/xrick, and it didn?t work entirely perfectly, so I assumed he was right.
<br/>
<br/>
What is involved in getting the sound support done?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My port of Xrick doesnt use SDL ,I ported that before I ported the SDL library.
<br/>
<br/>
Well the way SDL is written, its expecting a thread that sits around and waits for the currently playing buffer to finish and then it mixes the next buffer and starts playing it. So either thread support needs to be added to the SDL lib which would handle the thread part or this needs to be rewritten to use some other method.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">still this concept of using pygame would be cool, how would you load it though? Since we not have a way to load libraries(dll or .so) either pygame would somehow have to be embedded in the python executable i guess.

I attempted this in a port of python and pygame I did for the dreamcast but couldnt get pygame embedded correctly so I gave up lol

In what sense would it not embed correctly?  The port of Python itself was now pretty much complete, and I have gotten the Stackless features  working as well.  But I am sort of stalling because I don't know what is involved in porting pygame.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">for the dreamcast it was pretty much just had to write a Makefile, since it uses SDL. More then likely the same can be done with my ds SDL port, even with the limitation of my SDL port (no sound, threads) everything is stubbed so it should be able to be compiled.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have much python experience so I might have been trying to embed pygame wrong into my python environment.
