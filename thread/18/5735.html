    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are there already some real emulators to run on the DS, I mean real DS progs, not gba?
<br/>
And maybe oftopic, but I couldn't find it on the psp pages: how do they already have a gb emulator on the psp, is it because programming the psp is much like programming for the ps2?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On the top screen, i would see the game and the bottom screen would show me the different games. I wish I was skilled enough to do this myself, but h?, I'm just starting to learn c :)

As long as people still have the misconception that the PSP can play music and the GBA and Nintendo DS can't, there'll still be a necessity for setting things straight.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
