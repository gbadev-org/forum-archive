    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, first post and sorry if this annoys anyone but I was curious if there was much demand for a CPS-2 emulator on the DS, or if there is one I am completely unaware of.
<br/>
<br/>
Ingramb (creator of NeoDS) thought it would be a nice idea but he didn't have any plans to make one, so (because I have no experience whatosoever in coding and no time to learn on my busy schedule :() I am asking someone to please create an emulator, and of course not to sound like I have anyone at my command you can of course say no. XD
<br/>
<br/>
But uhm...yes please respond and perhaps you can see some desire for it in the NDS homebrew community :)
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some PC emulators that include source code, so the emulator mightn't be built from scratch if it were to be made.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm skeptical a CPS-2 emulator could be pulled off on the DS.  The DS really isn't very powerful.  I think it can barely handle SNES emulation and the CPS-2 is far superior to the SNES from a technical standpoint.

The problem is that the architectures are completely different, so a lot of the PC code would not be portable to the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seeing how Cyclone in NeoDS isn't able to run at full speed, first you'd need to write a faster 68000 emulator. Then there's the fact that the graphics hardware of CPS-2 is a bit more complex than that of NeoGeo, and I can bet noone will undertake the task.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No need to bump, Mr. Pants. Sgeos and Ninjalj have already answered your original question. At this point, your best bet is start up the project yourself if you're really interested.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
