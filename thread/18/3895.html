Definately.  The Linux croud loves getting it ported to any and every platform, especially embedded/portable systems.  I'm certain some people will try to get it going, and will probably succeed (if they don't end up running into problems with the 3D hardware as has been mentioned in another thread.)  There's probably people already planning it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And since the linux would be held entirely on the DS card, you wouldn't have to mod the DS at all.

Yeah, but when you have loaded the linux kernel and some linux webserver, there is no space left for the web pages. Why would you need linux just to make a webserver out of it? There are plenty of OS-free small TCP/IP stacks to choose from.

You'r right but it's still a possibility with the web server.
<br/>
I can play Videos with MPlayer over the Network filesystem. Sure i could do it over TV Out but my pc is old and crappy and has no TV out. Besides my GC is connected to the LAN anyways so i don't have to by an extra cable to connect my PC to the TV. And i don't have to walk away from my TV to put in another Video.
<br/>
<br/>
I just remeber another thing that might be possible. You can play games through an emulator directly on the GC. Like a free Gameboy Player, or old DOS Games. Or PS1 might even be possible, imagine Rige Racer on your Cube! ^_^

If you have been reading any kind of tech news, you'll see the trend starting to pick up. I think it would be great to have a non proprietary OS on my DS that would be awesome. I love nintendo and I think the DS would be a great solution to all my wardriving needs. Also with wifi why limit yourself to what Nintendo <span style="font-style: italic">thinks</span> you should do with it. If you have the hardware to do more interesting and exciting things why try and do the same old crap?

I want to play some F-Zero then drop into a terminal and IM my buddies from a local wifi hotspot. Maybe some place nice, like in the shade of a tree a few yards away from a starbucks :). 
<br/>
<br/>
It's also interesting to me that WinS is being developed for the GBA, what's the point there? Perhaps the most recent open source tools aren't small enough to run efficiently on a GBA but with the DS we will have all that stuff ready and waiting if we can embed linux. Why rewrite when you can reuse? Isn't that the programmers creed? Or just mine?
<br/>
<br/>
Hey and then once we get linux running on the DS maybe more people will get excited about hardware mods for the DS. It would be trivial for the developers in the Linux comunity to start banging out awesome stuff for what looks to be an awesome system. Why fear open source?

I used to run Linux on a 386 with 8 megs of RAM (later 16) just fine.  It was a tad slow, but what do you expect from a 386?
<br/>
<br/>
As far as a distro sizes go, I ran for the longest time a distro called LRP (Linux Router Project) that booted off of a floppy and ran completely out of RAM on a 486 with 16megs of RAM.  That's pretty compact.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is already a leacked SDK, altough not widely available. 
<br/>
The person who has it has made two documents, one about the nitro rom file structure and another about memory map. I guess that's a good start, and untill we don't get another one, we really can't find the possible watermarks. Altough those two files have been altered and are subsequently "watermark free". 
<br/>
<br/>
A lot o people have already seen them, but for those that haven't here as some exemples :

Data Format
<br/>
A NitroROM file has the following constituents. 
<br/>
<br/>
Header: 16KB of management stuff. 
<br/>
Startup static blocks: Modules for the Main and Sub systems that are loaded and executed on startup. 
<br/>
File name table: Array associating file names with numbers. 
<br/>
Overlay header: Links for main and sub systems between file numbers and overlay IDs. 
<br/>
File allocation table: Array of file numbers and ROM positions. 
<br/>
File Images: Take a guess what these do. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A file or directory name must follow these rules. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maximum length of 127 single-byte characters. 
<br/>
Case-sensitive filenames. (Speeds up the read process) 
<br/>
Entries with the same file name within the same directory are not allowed. The check for this is done at the time of compilation of the file system; hence, case sensitivity is ignored when this comparison is made. 
<br/>
File name characters may only take values within the range of ASCII 0x20-0x7E, except the characters \/?"&lt;&gt;*:;| 
<br/>
Any file entries that are in the same directory are arranged in successive order, and as such get successive IDs. After a directory entry, and after the last file in a directory, a file entry of length 0 and name "\0" is entered. 
<br/>
<br/>
Example filesystem
<br/>
/Nitro.rom
<br/>
/l33t.dat
<br/>
/img/sprite.png
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope I'm not going against the rules, those are just examples though. The mods are free to delete everything that they judge inapropriate. (Obviously mr obvious...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Where did you get this info? Give me a general idea, so you don't get people into trouble.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">uh no.  those are addresses to hardware registers on the ds.  the arm chip doesn't have a seperate io/mem bus (like x86) so the io ports reside in memory.  they look very similar to the gba also.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
