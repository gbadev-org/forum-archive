    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To run homebrew on the DS lite or any other DS with firmware version 4 or later, you need a PassMe2-compatible game, a PassMe2 adapter customized for that game, and an M3, SuperCard, or traditional GBA flash card. If you're planning on buying an M3 CF, then do it now.
<br/>
<br/>
With FlashMe v6, you will also lose backlight brightness adjustment.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Unless you're trying to test a program without having to yank the M3, yank the CF, insert the CF into the PC's writer, drag the .nds file over, close the window, right-click and choose Eject, yank the CF, insert the CF into the M3, and insert the M3 into the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you plan on ever using WifiMe, then maybe the supercard would be better, since the M3 don't work with WifiMe, but the M3 might me better on other things, I don't know.
