    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a library somewhere (or if it's part of libnds) where I can get keyboard functionality support similar to the one the DS provides on system setup?  Maybe it's just an image and some functions someone has written, that would be good enough, if it were available.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is, however the current official libnds release has keyboard support.
<br/>
<br/>
There is an example under examples/nds/input
<br/>
<br/>
Next revision of libnds does fix a few bugs with the keyboard code and adds a few more examples.  It is generally recomended to wait for the release than attempt to dev against the SVN repo as we tend to keep things a bit fluid (and not allways building / bug free).<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes. libnds 1.3.x has one. But I still like the simple layout of headkazes keyboard
<br/>
<br/>
I have done an updated example using his code and gfx.
