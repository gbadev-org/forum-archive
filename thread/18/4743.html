think it'll only be there for 6 days (don't have a web page)
<br/>
<br/>
enjoy!
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. opengl controls are mouse+aswd
<br/>
<br/>
also I'd like to integrate a arm9 disasm into this tool - if anyone has some code for this that they'd like to donate :) please pm me - ta</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#33275 - Mr. Ploppy - Sat Jan 01, 2005 12:04 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, nice program! I like the data tree layout and the hex viewer for unsupported files. Also showing the textures is a real plus! There are a few suggestions that come to mind though. Not being able to view a model twice is annoying, I'd fix that first thing if I were you. Also, the controls aren't nearly as spiffy or intuitive as mike260's modeler. I'd suggest adopting his camera controls with one slight moditication. On larger models, being able to move the camera but not the target can be a hassle. IMHO, the third mouse button and scroll wheel lend themselves perfectly to this task. I plan to build a personal version of mike260's viewer for my own use with this improvement. I'd be happy to sond you my source for this. (Speaking of, where is the source for this program? It was built using the source from other open projects, seems only fair you allow your's out too.) Other things that come ot mind, how about saving textures, sound support, not having to adjust the width of the hex viewer every time it pops up.
<br/>
All in all, it's a great program. Plenty of room for improvement, but great none the less. 
<br/>
PS- Zardoz? Like the Sean Connery movie?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers. Cluck, cluck, gibber, gibber, "my old man's a mushroom", et cetera.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Ploppy
<br/>
<br/>
Yup no problem I'll post the source - it's just a test version at the moment. The only problem is the it's C++ builder so it's not really that port friendly - but I'm sure people could rip bits of code out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Features I intend to add 
<br/>
<br/>
Arm9 Disasm
<br/>
Hex Editing
<br/>
Model Editing
<br/>
Texture Editing
<br/>
Repacking
<br/>
<br/>
so as you can see lots of work to do. I basically want a easy to use packer for when we can start deving.

Alex - it's great that you want  to help make this editor better, and I will release the source code very soon - although I very much doubt that you will be able to do anything with it (since it uses alot of custom libs - in fact you are much better off starting from scratch with DF and Mk260's code). In the meantime can you please remove that link to the hex edited version of my program - resource editing a exe does not justify you putting your name to it as a developer. I find all this very amusing - but I know that this would just piss off other developers in this scene, just don't do it!! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There wasn't much I could do with the program without the source code, so I just took some of your suggestions from this topic, and made a few additions/fixes to the program. Some examples would be, fixing the title bars, sizes of the windows, etc. I also added new features that I thought of on my own, like the ability to open all file types, while before you could only open .nds files. I know it isn't a big deal, but hey, I was bored, and I thought you guys might like something a bit better, as I am guessing a lot of you do not know how to install DSGraph. So, here it is, download it if you want to, don't download it if you don't want to.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

let me get this straight...
<br/>
you alex b. 14y/o are coding a nds emu which you needed to get your mind off of for some time... then you got bored and decided to make a pitiful attempt to gain kudos by some lame resource hacking, readme editing, topping it with editing your handle in and changing the program's name ?

<br/>

...and he also might want to change the fact that the webserver he is hosting that file on allows directory listing for folders without index files....since, you know, someone might go exploring around in there and download a file with all of his personal info, telephone number, etc, on it.

<br/>
or at least remove the file(s)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I didn't try and get all of you pissed at me or anything, and a couple of notes. I do realize all of my files are available to the world and everybody to see, all I would have to do is place a html file in there and name it index.html, it would automatically go there, and you would be unable to see anything, it is not the server. Also, the DS Emulator folder has nothing in it, because I am not uploading anything onto it until I have public files on there, I have other files of my progress on a seperate server, and they are only accessable to my testers. Another thing, I gave credit where credit was due on that program, I said ZardozJones, DarkFader, and Mike260 were the main people responsible for the program, and I even said, I only made a few edits through Hex Editing and Resource Editing. Also, I am not 14, I am 15, yeah it's only been about a month since I turned 15, and it doesn't really matter how old I am. I know many talented people at my age and younger who can program in multiple programming languages, while only program in two. So please, think about what you are saying before you post things again.
<br/>
<br/>
ZardozJones, I will take your request of taking it offline, and I know you have added me to MSN Messenger. If you say I may put it back online, then of course I will allow people to download it once more. You can e-mail me with an either Yes or No answer, and if it is yes, be sure to tell me of any edits you would like me to make, like in the readme or the About window in the program, or changing the title back to NDS-Packer, and I will. I'll be sure to say more clearly that I was just somebody who screwed around with the program for a bit. Also, I am building my own model viewer and hex editor with DarkFader's and Mike260's code. As I know people want to be able to use programs like this, but are unable to, as they do not know how to compile/install a program like DSGraph.<br/>_________________<br/>The tooth fairy teaches children that they can sell body parts for money...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yup please take it down until you get the source code. I really don't give a shit about this situation myself , but I *know* that alot of developers certainly would be fucked off with your actions. I can guarentee you that putting "Note that this applies to all parts of this program. All of this program was either
<br/>
written by myself, ZardozJones, DarkFader, or Mike260" into the readme.txt when all you did was hack it up with a resource editor will not get you into good favour with the devr's - and so I feel that I have to set a precedence here. I have added you to my msn so I can send you source first, since you seem enthusiastic about all of this :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you did change/set some window flags and put yourself as main devr in the about box for christ sake !! But hey if that's nothing to get pissed over I'll just wait for your nds emu to surface (if ever) then I change the background color and edit a new readme and put ME in the about box... oh yeah baby I'm gonna get famous for coding a nds emu. :}
<br/>
<br/>
and why would you want to code another wrapper for ndstool/dsgraph ? we do have one... many thanks to zardozjones.
<br/>
just keep going with your nds emu... you know I'm waiting with resource hacker ready. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Btw zardozjones if I would get a dime for every overly enthusiastic 15 y/o I see in forums these days I think I'd be stinking rich by now. ;)

Age has little to do with it. You may not know this, but I am also 15. However, I think I have a bit of respect around here...
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the point. Hacking binaries in a resource editor and releasing it as your own isn't really a good thing. It would have been better to contact the developer and tell him about your ideas. I think he would have been more responding to that instead of what you did.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Googlyoshka dont try giving out shit mods of other peoples programs .
<br/>
So what if you change a cuple of things,even if you made it better by making the .nds to any file,anyone can do that and if they want it they can do it them selfs and keep it to the selfs.Except if the mod is really good which in case if you it mod that good you can make your own program(not including the other peoples stuff)Not to be offensive to Googlyoshka.<br/>_________________<br/>?hsx?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, certainly. Age has nothing to do with it. When I was 15 I was coding in 680xx assembler, went to demo partys, stuff like that. Best time of my life. :) BUT I would have NEVER tried to claim kudos for or rape someone elses work without even asking the author. Most of the people those days had a sense for respect which seems a lot of the 15 y/o today lack...

If he didn't bother to ask the author in the first place, then there's nothing really more to say. In the business world, that's what we call "theft of intellectual property". And I don't even think it's open source either, or GPL'ed.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think he has gotten the idea by now.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great tool this model viewer!
<br/>
Being a 3d artist I found is very interesting to see Metroid's 3d models and textures.
<br/>
Now I can guess the geometry detail and see the texture sizes that are used. So far I didn't see any over 128x128 but that's still pretty high.
<br/>
<br/>
If this tool is still under development and if new functionality will be added to it I would love to see:
<br/>
- polygon count for the selected model
<br/>
- palet info
<br/>
- texture size and number of colors</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
