    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok while messing around with my DS I noticed the headphone port.(Didn't notice it before)So I thought 'Wouldn't it be great with surround sound'
<br/>
So i checked my speakers.
<br/>
And guess what i found out something!
<br/>
My speakers have there own seperate power supply so there is no need for the DS to give out any more power than what it is allready giving.
<br/>
So I got one of them Wires with the 'thing' on the end that goes into the headphone socket.
<br/>
Cut the wire off then attached my speakers, plugged it into my DS and out came sound.
<br/>
It wasn't perfect at first, but after an hour of playing with it i got it perfect.
<br/>
So from now on i'll be playing my DS wit surround sound!!.
<br/>
<br/>
Woooo Hooooo!
<br/>
<br/>
(Had help from a friend so i don't know what all the parts are called, sorry. But atleast i can play with surround sound now!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">AFAIK there is no support for surround sound in the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
What you have now is called "Better speakers than the built-in beepers"
<br/>
It is still just regular stereo sound.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I wouldn't say it has surround sound, but it makes good use of stereo..  When I was playing Mario 64 DS with headphones I could hear the waterfall change headphones as I move around..  Thought that was cool..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Surround sound" on a stereo signal can mean one of two things: <ul><li>Playing a sound effect 180 degrees out of phase when it's panned behind the listener. This is called matrix surround, which Dolby Pro Logic receivers can decode into a passable approximation of 3-channel surround. </li><li>Feeding a delayed, attenuated, low-pass filtered version of one speaker's signal to the other speaker. Such a "headphone compensation" circuit <a class="postlink" href="http://www.headwize.com/tech/headrm1_tech.htm" target="_blank">simulates the behavior of a pair of speakers aimed at a head</a>. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While we are on the topic of sound, has anyone noticed distortion of some sounds when the DS is at low volume in GBA mode? It seems to only happen when the sounds are low pitched but it sounds like static.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would think that the DS would be just as capable of surround sound as the N64 is.  Just get Factor 5 to develop a MusyX driver for it (if they haven't) and it should be possible.  From what I've heard, using MusyX for GBA, you can techically have some kind of surround sound on GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

Except I've read that Nintendo doesn't allow licensee code to run on the ARM7 (for wireless certification purposes), nor (apparently) does Nintendo allow custom soft-mixers that run on the ARM9 (possibly for battery and sound-quality purposes).

Anyway, the DS can have Dolby Pro Logic, or even Dolby Pro Logic 2, depending on how the sound engine is designed.
<br/>
<br/>
Daigasso! Band Brothers has a surround option in its config menu, which obviously means that it supports outputting sound in Dolby Pro Logic. It works when I connect it up to my surround receiver, as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's hope to God Factor 5 never makes a MusyX driver for DS..then sound development on the DS would never progress..and we'd have a lot more  crappier games using up all their resources on stupid things, and not leaving enough for the memory-hogging sound system that the driver would need...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wouldn't the game be required to display the "Dolby Pro Logic 2" symbol is if the game supported it like many of the Gamecube games do?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
