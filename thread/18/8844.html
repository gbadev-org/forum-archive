    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I downloaded the linux version from here: <a href="http://www.ndsemulator.com/nintendo-ds/ideas-download.htm." target="_blank">http://www.ndsemulator.com/nintendo-ds/ideas-download.htm.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
 But when I fire it up, I get no output, no screen, nothing. I don't even get a crash. I am not sure what is wrong. If anyone has this working, I would love to here it. 
<br/>
<br/>
 I have tried ./ideas, and ./ideas myrom.nds and I get the same results with both... nothing. 
<br/>
<br/>
 I was kind of hoping to get further into my project, before actually buying a DS...
