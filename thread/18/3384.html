I believe that we will eventually have compilers and an emulator to test your game, possibly a cart of some sort. Would be great for us, bad for Nintendo though. I know the emulator won't be too much of a problem since you can't really play the game without the touch screen, mic etc.

Well, to be fair, the question is just "Will there be DS homebrew dev?"
<br/>
Almost every system has some amount of homebrew development community, sooner or later. Whether the homebrew crowd will be able to make commercial-quality games and have access to good, stable, high-quality tools durring the main lifecycle of the system, would be a different question, and I imagine there might be a lot more "no"s<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.

True, I was really comparing it to the level of quality on the GBA compared to some commercial games. The DS is just too different. And besides, how the heck would an emulator emulate the touch screen? The only thing I can think of is to use a PDA, but that might require a speed hack to get it up to a "respectable" speed, and sooner or later, Nintendo is going to use that patent for the invention of speed hacks in their games to use.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree.  I loved the super scope games on the SNES.  I understand that the super scope is emulated with the mouse.  Far from the same.  Real hardware is always better.  With a Wacom tablet (mine is a lot smaller than a table =) it would be ok, but having the pen over the screen would be a lot nicer.  The wacom screen-a-ma-jigs were really expensive last time I clicked.  (sic)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been considering development of the DS emulators, and for now we can assume it will have similar hardware to the N64 just for development purposes, as I don't believe they will be that different anyway. And once we know what they're really like we can adjust the engine - but again it should only be minor changes.
<br/>
<br/>
The two processors can easily be emulated, though I hate arm and thumb opcode arrangements.
<br/>
<br/>
As for loading to the DS - this can be done through the network port. Assuming they will also allow a network boot, you can just create a boot loader that can load the rest of the ROM into the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think that people should develop for the N64 and iQue instead of the DS though - the DS doesn't have analogue controls or all those <span style="font-weight: bold">buttons</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know how soon, but you know that eventually there will be DS flash carts. Maybe they'll stick out a little at first (remember the first 64mbit gba cards were the size of an old GB cart, now they fit 16 times that into the size of an original GBA cart.

Also about LCD screens, I meant like 17inch LCD monitors with a 'tablet' covering the whole screen, giving 512 levels of sensitivity, for emulating the touch screen. But again, the mouse is the most obvious answer for this 'problem.'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

More buttons &lt;&gt; Better Gameplay
<br/>
<br/>
More Buttons are not always the best. With the buttons you have on the DS you can do pretty much and the touchscreen gives you more options to crontrol the game.
<br/>
<br/>
I just remember the PS2 controler have 4 shoulder buttons. But why the hell do i need 4 shoulder buttons.
<br/>
I recognised that on many playstation games you have an extra button for every single action you can do in the game. But as a smart Game designer you wont need this much buttons the most time if you make a situation dependend control in your game. Just look at all the actions you can do with the A button in Zelda. You can talk to persons, open doors, collect item, ...
<br/>
<br/>
If you think the more buttons the better then play pc games. The Keyboard has more buttons than any other controler. 
<br/>
Or bye yourself a phantom (*lol*)

I wouldn't compare a mouse - touchscreen in the same way as a mouse - gun .... but a mouse will never come close as most people take longer to focus with a mouse than touch - - having said that you would have to lift your fingers off the d-pad / buttons to use it so few, if any would ever use the touch screen for fast paced gaming action
<br/>
<br/>
back to buttons - - the lack of analogue controls may prove a problem porting some N64 games, and also poses problems due to the nature of having a 3d perspective and range of movement. Having said that, good games can be made to use only the d-pad, but it completely eliminates the possibility of some whereas having one does not at all :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Having the second screen there unused, will probably be what keeps developers from flooding the DS with N64 ports. I don't think Nintendo will allow developers to simply port games to make a cheap buck without using that second screen. The same thing will happen to the PSP and it's likely PS2 ports.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But, that might work. when i said the ds cart can use info from the GBA one, i didn't mean it would send GBA info straight to the DS cart. That would be easier for this process, but could bring other problems. It probably meets further inside the machine, and when i said programming the GBA cart before, that is to send the information to be saved to the connection point, then make it turn back to the DS slot.

I still don't know everything about the GBA and it took me about 2 years to really feel I'd mastered the GBC (an exceedingly simple machine in comparison).

<br/>
With GBA, I have had extensive info for months about the Nintendo RFU unit as I was the first person to get the thing working outside of Japan (my Japanese got a bit better too.)  A couple of times I had to go edit posts to make sure that I kept that secret until it was officially announced.  Just like the game I'm working on now is confidential and the previous which was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaben (recently announced so I can mention it.)  This board is a great resource to me for finding obsure information about the GBA or bouncing off the wall ideas off other developers.  I pay for that info by helping people in kind.  I just have to be real careful in how I do that.
<br/>
<br/>
So yes there is still GBA stuff that I can't announce or discuss even now.  (Even now I'm editing this post for content.)  That 1.5 years thing fo DS may be offbase, it may not.

It took quite a while before we could even run any code on GBA hardware. At least a year.
<br/>
Judging from the information available, the DS may be a significantly harder nut to crack.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, I don't do much electrical engineering, nor have I learned to interpret a disassembly of ARM code. And if the DS carts are encrypted... remember that Capcom's CPS-2 still hasn't been 100 percent cracked. If dagamer34 wants to have my seat on the DS RE team, it's fine by me :)

And I don't really see how the release date in various countries is important. Hackers live in all countries in the world. And besides, the really fanatic ones imported it from lik-sang as soon as it was available anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo said that they would start production of the DS in the summer, giving them about 1-2 month period to finish the retail prototype and then begin manufacturing.

If you ever take a look at the issues that show the revealing of the Nintendo Gamecube, take a look at the controller and the one now. Notice how the B button has changed and the color scheme is a bit different. Except now everyone is expecting the changes, so they will probably deliver.

Anyway, I reckon Nintendo will change the DS slightly to look more sexy, but they won't change the overall layout.  They'll probably change the colour schemes like they did with the GBA - I miss the good old silver and green/orange schemes.

<br/>
But what I really want to know is what the hell the name of the system will be!  I reckon it will be called Nitro, but until Nintendo confirms the name, who knows what it'll be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
