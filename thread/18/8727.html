    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I've been working on a little handwriting recognition project.  I saw several mentions of JMerlin on these forums and I decided to just port XMerlin to the DS.  It seems to work really well and I've put together a little demo using the code.  I haven't released the source yet (wanna do a little cleanup first) but I have the rom available if anyone wants to play with it.  It does work in Dualis but seems to work much better on actual hardware.  Details can be found on my website: <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.crmx.us" target="_blank">http://ds.crmx.us</a>.  Let me know what you think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to try out DSOrganize yet, but it appears the gestures for the letters might be a little unnatural to use.  The gestures DSMerlin uses are based loosely on Palm's graffiti so hopefully a lot of people will be able to pick them up quickly.  I added a list of the gestures to the webpage.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Could you please build an nds version, that is meant for hardware? Some of us here use loaders that are designed for nds files, rather than ds.gba files. (specifically most of us using GBAMP/M3/Super Card.)
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, this handwriting recognition is far better and easier to learn than the one in DSorganize.  Only a few letters have given me trouble, but I managed to figure them out enough that I wouldn't mind having this handwriting recognition code in DSorganize.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#73706 - carmex - Mon Feb 27, 2006 5:38 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, thanks for all the feedback.  The source code has now been posted, along with an nds version built for hardware as you requested caitsith2.  I removed the version with the loader; everyone can figure out what loader to use for themselves.  
<br/>
<br/>
Roc, you're right, drawing a lowercase 'e' often results in recognizing a 'z'.  Not sure why that is, I might need to tweak the sample pattern used for lowercase e.  I've had much better luck drawing the uppercase E as is the standard way to do it on Palm's Graffiti.  Both methods SHOULD work, however, so I will look into fixing that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too am using an M3, but I didn't know about the powerON(POWER_ALL_2D); until today, so I had been using a loader to get my rom to boot.  After adding that line, my nds file boots directly from my M3 with no loader, but I've noticed a problem.  The touchscreen doesn't seem to work (or maybe the app freezes, I don't know which).  If I run the ds.gba file, however, the app runs just fine.  Both of these are built at the same time by my makefile and I don't really know much about the difference.  Does anyone know what the problem might be?  Btw, I've updated the zips on my website to reflect these changes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The loader in on the ds.gba file is probably setting something up differently.  I've had that occasionally with other homebrew...adding this loader on fixed it.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#74780 - carmex - Tue Mar 07, 2006 4:57 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSMerlin 0.2 has been released.  As always, download it at <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.crmx.us/dsmerlin/" target="_blank">http://ds.crmx.us/dsmerlin/</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the changelog:
<br/>
<br/>
version 0.2:
<br/>
Library changes:
<br/>
<ul>* To improve recognition accuracy, multiple gestures for each character have been removed.  There is now only 1 way to draw each character.  Gestures also more closely match the Graffiti style.</ul><ul>* Numeric characters 0-9 are now recognized.</ul><ul>* Gestures have been added for space, backspace and return.</ul>
<br/>
DSMerlin demo changes:
<br/>
<ul>* The touchscreen is now divided; the left side is for alpha input, the right side for numeric input.</ul><ul>* Included a help screen which shows how to draw each supported character.  Access this screen by pressing the 'A' button (remember this is mapped to X on your keyboard in Dualis).</ul></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
