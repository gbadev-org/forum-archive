    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I'm trying to do some programming for the DS (devkitpro) but have the following problem:
<br/>
- I created a working .nds program (hello world incl some 3D triangles)
<br/>
- I converted it to .ds.gba (dsbuild.exe)
<br/>
- I appended a test folder with some data in it to the .nds and the .ds.gba (ndstool)
<br/>
- I try accessing the data in the testprogram using nitrofs (the showdir function in the exampleprogram of nitrofs wiki)
<br/>
<br/>
--&gt; on my DS it works : it shows the content of the testfolder
<br/>
--&gt; on No$Gba it initializes nitroFS correctly but the testfolder is empty (initialization of fatlib doesn't work of course)
<br/>
<br/>
I tried both .nds and .ds.gba versions but I can't find/open any files
<br/>
<br/>
I've looked on the internet but only found some posts on messageforums stating nitrofs should work on no$gba ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
