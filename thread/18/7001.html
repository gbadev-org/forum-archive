<br/>
<br/>
i'm a final year student in the university of ulster currently preparing a project proposal. i'd love to do something with the nds, but can't think of anything that wouldn't involve the wifi capabilities of the device. i was wondering if there is any information on accesing these capabilities?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
