    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe you have to give the other CPU access to the GBA slot. Or maybe it only detects if you own an SCSD. ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i got a new name for that function. insteadof calling scsd_Isinserted() it should be called GiveMeATrueValue(); that discribes that function a lot better ...hehe</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
