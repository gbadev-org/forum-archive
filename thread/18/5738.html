<br/>
I would like to use the microphone in my game, but couldn't find any information on how to do this. I was wondering if anyone had an idea on how to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And if the microphone can be used then it should be stated in the manual.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm this brings up a question I should make a homebrew that uses the microphone...<br/>_________________<br/>They say when you run a Microsoft Disc Backwards you can hear Demonic Voices... That's nothing when you run it forwards it installs windows.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would be nice if only during specific times after you collect specific item for example it would give you persay 3-5 Seconds to scream onto the mike and depending on how loud it is it would destroy so many bricks.

But sadly I know nothing of how the Ds works which is the reason why I came here in the first place to make homebrew games for the ds like Pacman or Strikers 1945 1,2,3,Plus ^_^<br/>_________________<br/>They say when you run a Microsoft Disc Backwards you can hear Demonic Voices...
