    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, noob on windows trying to get into NDS programming here.
<br/>
<br/>
So I install devkitpro fresh, and go into the examples for nds installed with it, and every single one of them i try to use the make command for produces:
<br/>
<br/>
Error makefile 6: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 7: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 8: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 10: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 55: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 71: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 75: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 79: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 95: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 96: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 97: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 106: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 113: Colon expected
<br/>
Error makefile 114: Colon expected
<br/>
Error makefile 115: Colon expected
<br/>
Error makefile 124: Command syntax error
<br/>
Error makefile 127: Command syntax error
<br/>
*** 17 errors during make ***
<br/>
<br/>
What the heck am I doing wrong?  Nothing I try to make anywhere does anything but this, and I haven't changed anything to have broken it myself.

..And now they're gone.  Just like that.
<br/>
I didn't even do anything different, it just suddenly worked after many completely identical failures.  Okay then!  I'd still like to know wtf the problem was, but at least its' working now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
This one is often caused by a make that isn't gnu make being in the path ahead of the msys make. Not sure why it would suddenly just work though.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Several things can cause that to happen: closing the command prompt and opening a new one, logging out and in, restarting Windows...<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
