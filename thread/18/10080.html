    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just started codeing for the DS and I'm haveing a little trouble getting my code to run on the DS. I have an EFA-Linker II 1 Gigabit that I got a year ago so I could play homebrew and it will play anything I try and run, even code created with PAlib that I downloaded from the "PAlib Projects" section of the Wiki or from the forums. But anything I compile (My own code or things from the "PAlib Examples folder") won't be loaded onto my card. Am I doing something wrong here? As I said the cart will run other peoples PAlib projects (Such as Balance by Seddy) but not the examples in the PAlib folder or the things I make. Also, the things I make will run on NDS emulators.

Any help would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
