<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how to access info from the gba pedometer that comes with <a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Weight-Loss-Coach-Nintendo-DS/dp/B000X25GWW/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1231883602&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">"My Weight Loss Coach"</a> ?
<br/>
<br/>
I have searched in the forum but only found <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=15724&amp;highlight=guitar" target="_blank">info for the guitar grip</a>...
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I can't test anything as for now : I don't have this game yet and only plan to buy it if there could be homebrew support (just for the fun, I have no idea what I'll do with it and I'm aware that any homebrew using this would be of limited use as I guess few people has it !)...
<br/>
and I'll only buy it if I find it on bargain
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>
