    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is this possible at all? with any type of slot 2 card or anything?
<br/>
<br/>
my current debug process...
<br/>
- put the microSD in the USB adapter
<br/>
- put the USB adapter in the USB port
<br/>
- put the .nds onto the microSD
<br/>
- put the microSD into the R4
<br/>
- put the R4 into the DS
<br/>
- boot up
<br/>
- navigate menus to start the .nds
<br/>
- rinse repeat with each update to the code i'm ready to test...
<br/>
...so annoying!
<br/>
<br/>
I tried dualis but it doesn't work much like the hardware for some things...
<br/>
<br/>
no$gba seems like it might be nice but apparently getting ahold of the debug version is a pain...
<br/>
<br/>
i'm not against throwing down some cash if it means debugging on the hardware itself!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have an answer to your question, but I have a possible speed up to your current R4 process. I have one too and this is what I do:
<br/>
<br/>
Leave USB adapter in computer all the time.
<br/>
Leave the R4 in the DS all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
I end up just pulling the microSD out of the adapter and putting it into the R4 and vice versa. I never eject the adapter or the R4 while I'm testing, just the microSD.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and rename your rom to DEFAULT.NDS and you won't have to navigate the boot menus either. R4 will automatically start that rom on boot up.
<br/>
<br/>
My two cents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my microsd fits a little too snug to pull it out of the R4 and USB without having it in my hands...but i didn't know about DEFAULT.NDS.  I'll definitely be doing that to shave off a few seconds here and there.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought about having another microsd so i can always have on in the computer and one in the ds...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping there is some slot2 card that will let me debug on the hardware...that would be great!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

simonjhall's wifi debugger is quite good for debugging on hardware. He had to pull it from the web unfortunately, but there's word on the street that some sites still <a class="postlink" href="http://dl.qj.net/wireless-debugger-v0.11-for-ds-nintendo-ds/pg/12/fid/8785/catid/220" target="_blank">mirror</a> it :)
<br/>
<br/>
I also haven't yet really found a solution to the card-swapping disease. Several copy-and-launch-binary-via-wifi solutions exist, but for me card swapping is still faster and more reliable.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

welp..thanks for doing the tests for us!  i wonder if DeSmuMe would be fine for 2D apps..

<br/>
Same goes for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also done the testing, and apparently DeSmuMe has problems with display capturing (disabled it and changed mode from FB3 to 5 with 3D to make it work.)
<br/>
<br/>
Whereas no$gba simply ignores capturing and renders the scene as usually, DeSmuMe displays a black screen (even when disabling the capture!) :^(
<br/>
It's even worse: I think it actually has problems emulation the FB3 mode, because even when capturing is enabled (in mode 5 3D), 3D is displayed... ?
<br/>
<br/>
Also DeSmuMe is wa(aaa)y slower than no$gba and the shadow polygons are rendered without stenciling and blending! Again, no$gba ignores them (in 2.6 - 2.6a has a more complete feature set, at least from what the web site says), which is better than rendering solid black monoliths! ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Other bugs include: Scissoring does not work propperly (warping!) and the 3D backdrop color is wrong.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

Load the .ds.gba, or patch your NDS with the R4 dldi patch and access any files and folders located in the same dir as your NDS.
