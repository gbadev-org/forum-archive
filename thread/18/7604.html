<br/>
<br/>
I have some questions about how libnds does some things and some sugestions also.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Why are u,v coords rotated?
<br/>
2. Why the projection matrix is reset in glReset? It it wasn't reset every time, gluPerspective should not be necessary to be called in the main loop. I also think that modelview matrix should not be reset in glReset either
<br/>
3. I have also seen that glTexCoord2f only supports 128x128 textures. I know it is only a wrapper for the t16 function but it is a bit confusing if you don't know this</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
