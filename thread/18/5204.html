I'm a Half-Life2 modder, and this thing has helped me out a lot since the HL2 SDK only comes as a vcproj. So I just started getting in to DS development, and what do you know, the template is only in vcproj format. So this is just for those of you who aren't exactly in the mood to go and shell out a lot of moolah for VC++.net

Also... umm, hi. First post. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do already. I have a copy of Visual Studio.Net 2002 and it refuses to load the project saying that it is version 8.0. My copy can only load projects from 7.0 and below. :(<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it may be nice to know that v8.0 is a free download (for Express verson beta, and a good chance the release will be free download too, seeing as how all other Express products (FP Express, Outlook Express, etc) are free download).
