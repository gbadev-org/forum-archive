    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am having some trouble with my ds code.  Its just a project I am using to learn.  The error is pretty apparent and it will only take a sec for a knowledgable person to fix/explain.  If anyone has time I would be greatful if they took a look at my code real quick.  Here is a link to the code, I think seeing the problem would be alot easier than me trying to explain it and the code is only a few lines long.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there is actually a few things that could be the problem, so explaining would be nice
<br/>
<br/>
if it is what I think it is, when you press A or B you get garble.
<br/>
<br/>
This is due to BG2 and BG3 occupying the same space in VRAM
<br/>
<br/>
To see how to properly do a rotation background and tile BG take a look at my page

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dissabled the A and B buttons, I was just using them for testing about where I should put the tile data.
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially the tile data is being written over the background data.  I have looked at your example several times but there is one issue.  I am using a 512x512 exrot, and it takes up both Vram A and B and to do this the VRams must be consecutive.  I want to use the memory allocated to Vram E to store the tile data, but I cannot figure out how to get the data to go there.  In your example you place the bmp image at base 8, but I need it at base 0 because the picture is so large.  It is the tile data that must move but I am beginning to think this isn't possible.  If anyone knows definitely that this won't work, please let me know so I can stop banging my head against the wall.  I was hoping to make a demo that used every type of 2D option to better explain how they relate to each other.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course if someone was to download my code, find the magical number to fix the error and then post the error, my head would explode with joy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you are going to have to go to bmp base 8, then change the adresses of A and B to 0x6020000 and 0x6040000
<br/>
<br/>
tile data is limited ti the first portion of vram i believe<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>
