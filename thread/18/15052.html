    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did a search for this, but only found <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10839&amp;highlight=backup+wfc" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10839&amp;highlight=backup+wfc</a>, so I hope this post isn't too redundant.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there currently a way to backup the internal Nintendo WFC settings in a DS, so as to be able to restore them later?  I have to get my DS repaired (stupid hinge crack), and while I should get the same one back, I'd rather not have to generate new friend codes for every single game again.
<br/>
<br/>
I know you can transfer WFC settings from DS to DS, so it seems like it should be possible to backup/restore the WFC identity and restore it later.  Is there currently a utility that will do that?
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yah, but I don't have a spare DS/DS Lite at the moment... I know, I know, I really should have 2-3, but...
<br/>
<br/>
So, at the moment, there is no way to backup the MAC/WFC stuff?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That makes sense. I was just hoping there was a WFC data backup utility, for situations like this... I suppose I may have to take a chance on NOA this time around.  That or buy a DS just for short term data storage.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Firmware writing code is publicly available, bricker or no bricker.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Tell them you use the WiFi connection and you need the same DS back. They should ask you about that when you request the repair.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
