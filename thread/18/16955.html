Not necessarily since it uses C++/Python now instead of tcl/tk so there's a chance it could be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not the DOS version that's been donated, it's the X11 port of the Mac port of the DOS port of the original C64 version... But the source code has been released :)

C++ and Python, and GTK, and SWIG, Pycairo, AND TCL/TK...
<br/>
<br/>
To actually port this to the DS you would have to start with the cleanest source code you can find, the "original" tcl/tk version and strip out the interface code and rewrite that bit.  Only problem there is that from my initial look at the tcl/tk C source is that there's a lot of intergration, and from reading the posts on the site it took the OLPC guys 2 years to convert it from tcl.tk to Python/SWIG/C++ and provide the build environments for Windows.  If you want this ported to the DS, you will have to plan for a long term project and not an overnight patch job.

Oh and if you do manage to port the game, put the plane crash back in, it was removed because of the 9/11 disaster...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm not that interested in this, just asking for the sake of others who may want to pick this up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
