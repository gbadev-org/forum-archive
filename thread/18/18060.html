    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone!
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to do a post request to an https direction, right now I used the example provided here <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-examples/blob/master/dswifi/httpget/source/httpget.c" target="_blank">https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-examples/blob/master/dswifi/httpget/source/httpget.c</a> but it is for http requests, so as expected I recieved the <span style="font-style: italic">301 permanently moved</span> error.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone knows how can I do an https request?
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You would need an ssl protocol handler and you would need to manually encrypt and decrypt packets. I do not think anything like this was ever created for ds homebrew.  You could try porting an open source ssl library but I am thinking that would be an enourmous undertaking. Possibly something with a proxy server instead?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's what I thought to simplify it, but it felt a bit wrong, searching over the forums I've seen some links that could help, but most of them are dead already.
<br/>
Thanks anyways! I'll stick with a simple solution this time if there aren't any ssl libraries to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
