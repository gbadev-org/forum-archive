    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a 350k arm9 bin, that requires 3.5 megs of ram to run. I want to be able to push down a new bin though the wifi and run it again.
<br/>
<br/>
What I have working is I can boot other bins that are append to the main bin file from the cart via softresetting into into those locations, and downloading things via wifi isn't a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
When the old bin downloads the new bin, the 3.5 megs of ram can be scrapped but the 3.5 megs is in global arrays so they need to be allocated when the new bin executes.
<br/>
<br/>
I know the arm9 code gets copied to ram on execute, so i figured if i copied the new bin to above the first 350k, and I run it from the location say 2 megs of 4 megs of ram I figured it would copy to code back to the beginning of ram and jump into that location of ram to execute the code.
<br/>
<br/>
What I can't do is reprogram the card while its running because its a older style GBA flash card. Now that this has became a problem I want to know how to solve it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
So is there any suggestions someone could give me?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
