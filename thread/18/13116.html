    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there. I'm just curious, if there is some sort of a mesh viewer for 3d models (like md2 or X-file or obj) around on the DS? What I'am looking for is a little tool with wich I can easily view my models on a real DS screen to see, if they are ok (polycount, texturesize, shading and so on). As I'am an artist without any further programming skills, it would be nice to have such a simple tool (just like a pictureviewer). But unfortunately there's only a lot of examples around how to load meshes (like md2) in your own program, but no simple viewer. I've searched around but did not find anything. Does anybody know if there's something available?<br/>_________________<br/>Simplicity is the most complex topic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
My converter converts .x files of a specific syntax to a .c file containing a NDS display list which can be used in programs.
<br/>
My viewer allows you to view a model by reading in such a .c file.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure other developpers have created better programs than I have, but these do the job. Not much settings to play with though.
<br/>
If you're interested in trying them out, PM me with your email address.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm a n00b when it comes to programming.
