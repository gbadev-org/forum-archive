    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Datel provide a new hardware maybe interesting for developers. It is a slot 2 hardware which allow to access whole memory while a slot 1 application is running.
<br/>
<br/>
The software has a dump feature with disassembly window. You can spy certain memory locations. You can trap on memory changes and patch every memory location after trap.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this will help for debugging code and for reverse engineering.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A reason we haven't had this before from the homebrew scene is that some people in the homebrew scene are vocally uninterested in the liability that they imagine comes from having even once read the disassembly of copyrighted, trade-secreted object code of an all-rights-reserved commercial game. They don't have the same kind of resources that, say, Phoenix Technologies used to maintain a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design" target="_blank">clean room</a> in order to make absolutely sure that the company's clone of IBM PC BIOS did not infringe IBM's copyright.

A reason we haven't had this before from the piracy scene is that warez release groups treat their debugging tools as a competitive advantage over other release groups.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm interested in what debugging facilities, if any, that this has for homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">today I got my <span style="font-weight: bold">Datel Toolkit for NDS</span>. 
<br/>
<br/>
you must have a Datel AR for DS also, I didn't know this. my luck I have one since month.
<br/>
<br/>
without a AR the slot 2 module does nothing. starting the NDS with both inserted (toolkit in slot 2 and AR in slot 1) windows want to install the new USB device. 
<br/>
<br/>
from now on you can access NDS memory from PC (read and write). strange, datel let you see datel own code? on screen there doesn't appear the normal AR picture. on upper screen is a Logo, code counter and trainer status (on/off). lower screen shows "INSERT GAME CARD ..." and version numbers of 'Body: v0.08', 'HOOK: v0.04', 'Patcher: 0.03' and 'Code Engine: v1.21'.
<br/>
<br/>
it works in same manner on a flashed DS and on a original DS. AR program directly start after switching on DS (without flashme with healthy screen).
<br/>
<br/>
###
<br/>
<br/>
after inserting a cartridge into slot 1 it appears 4 lines of information. for example for a UFPEX 16G (DS Linker / MK5) it appears:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">chipID: 00000F ...
<br/>
game ID: DSGB-73FB ...
<br/>
Game Name:
<br/>
Unknown Game</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
for a Super Mario Bros appears:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">chipID: 00001FC2
<br/>
game ID: A2DP-C83D5913
<br/>
Game Name: 
<br/>
Unknown version</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
own "Games n Music" card will not be recognized. Also no DS Link card. neither on the flashed NDS nor on the original.
<br/>
<br/>
original games are all ok and starts fine. DS Linker and M3 Simply also will be recognized as a game card.
<br/>
<br/>
you can dump any memory area as hex dump or assembly view. windows can be refreshed and you can choose auto refresh. it is possible to build a watch window to spy at specific locations in a specific view. 
<br/>
<br/>
it is possible to make whole dumps and then compares with other (previous) dumps and detect changes (euqal, not equal, less, greater - all with specific value or with last dump). the result ist a list of memory occurences which is shown in a list of addresses with all values of all dumps. 
<br/>
each result can be easy choosen for a spy in a watch window. each result or entry in watch window can easily used as base for a poke (memory write) or a code for AR.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
no breakpoints! read/write works while game is running. on heavy transfers the game speed slows down while transfer is running. 
<br/>
<br/>
but you can upload new action codes at runtime while game is running. it has his own little language with loops, compares, branches, write/read commands and offset register (pointer - for C programmer).
<br/>
<br/>
the costs are ?39.99 at <a class="postlink" href="http://uk.codejunkies.com/news_reviews.asp?c=GB&amp;cr=GBP&amp;cs=%A3&amp;r=1&amp;l=1&amp;p=17&amp;i=9077&amp;s=8" target="_blank">codejunkies</a>.

the ARDS interface is changed completly. now you also can enter codes manually. you can get the update at <a class="postlink" href="http://uk.codejunkies.com/home.asp?c=GB&amp;cr=GBP&amp;cs=%A3&amp;r=1&amp;l=1#" target="_blank">codejunkies</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Reverse engineer it.  To get a firmware dump to reverse engineer, just retrieve it from C:\Program Files\Datel\Action Replay Code Manager\firmware.bin.  Remove the first 8 bytes from it, then you can manipulate it like any other nds rom file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
