    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I got to DS development with the Tutorial from PataterSoft(.info:-) and in that tutorial the using of *.bin Image Data is praised^^
<br/>
So, they got me and I wanted to convert pix in Binary
<br/>
Sooo...
<br/>
First I used GbaBmp but it produces like kind of shit, shown on my screen in pink and green pixels, they seem to be something different than the original pic
<br/>
So I wanted to use hConvert and gfx2gba but I develop for the DS on a Windows-PC and this Tool (hConvert) is only written for Mac and Linux. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So maybe someone of you knows about a (better) Tool for Bmp (or gfx in general) to Bin or C to Bin conversion. Important: *.bin Files export :-)
<br/>
<br/>
thx hmbg</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
use usenti (google for it) and (win)git! these are nice free tools i also use myself. they work pretty good, even though unfinished.
<br/>
<br/>
note that patater uses a mac tool that enables the alpha bit in the images in 16bit mode. you'll have to modify the loading procedure to enable it a bit. (shouldn't be a problem, though). there are also some typos and missing lines in the doc, but the sources are fine. i already told him about that some time ago ;) hopefully you got the updated version (haven't checked it, yet).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Git's default export mode is tiled; try using -gb for bitmaps. That and maybe -gB{<span style="font-style: italic">n</span>} for the bitdepth. The readme has examples of flags for all the modes ...  that's <span style="font-style: italic">GBA</span> modes, not NDS modes.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: default export mode is tiled for paletted images (bpp&lt;=8), but 16bpp bitmapped for truecolor images (bpp&gt;8). Check the exported files to be certain what you actually got.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
