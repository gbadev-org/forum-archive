This would be useful for many applications... DS Linux, emulation and perhaps even heavy duty 3D games with complex (well for a handheld) physics.
<br/>
<br/>
Say for example the ARM7 (33Mhz) could be running a SNESAdvance port with the ARM9 handling the other tricky stuff (DSP, SPC, SuperFX, runtime ROM decompression).
<br/>
<br/>
So far all the demos I've seen have only used the ARM9 CPU, or am I mistaken?

<br/>
has anybody looked?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

both CPUs are active at the same time.  the ARM7 handles the touch screen and X/Y buttons.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
And that bugs the heck out of me. It's like, 'how many GBAs does it take to read a touch screen? Two! Hahaha!1!!!!111!1!'
<br/>
Series-8 is right, proper use of the ARM7 has some awesome possibilities. 
<br/>
<br/>
For communication, the demos around now are doing it with a designated memory area (IPC.h in NDSLIB).
<br/>
Dualis has that IPC struct layout hardcoded into it, so it can trick the ARM9 binaries into thinking the ARM7 is feeding them touch screen info.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully more demos will start doing cool stuff with the ARM7 here in the next few days when the PassMes have reached their designated coders :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it may have been a typo...or intentional.
<br/>
<br/>
if the ARM7 can handle the 65C816, thats great. What I'm worried about is the DSP, SuperFX/MarioChip/SuperFX2/Other wierd SNES chips that take MUCH more processing power to handle.
<br/>
<br/>
I figure by the time people get code running on the PSP the DS will have alphas of many emulators and lots of games/demos, even if there are no commercial DS-flashcarts made. 
<br/>
The nifi-multiboot will be easier to figure out 'from the other side', speaking of which...
<br/>
<br/>
Can the PassME have a serial port added in the future? 3 thin wires hanging off the PCB would be enough right? (minimalist RS232...well not really since its 3V or 5V or whatever... not 12V...)
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be useful for packet logging/transmission of arbitrary data over the DS's WiFi system. So that it can be used to figure out how the Nifi works and to eventually allow non-modded/ no PassME equiped DS's to load user made games/programs from 'server' DS's.
<br/>
<br/>
Spread the demos and free games to those outside the DS development community. (get everyone else hooked...heh)
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rambling post... I like to type or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Who cares about SNES when there is a chance that the DS is powerful enough to make a semi-decent emulation of the world's #1 sound chip: The SID.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is no legend without Zelda.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let's take SID discussion to <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=39054#39054" target="_blank">another thread</a>, shall we?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
