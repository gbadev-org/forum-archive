    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
<br/>
I am new to DS development though I have some exp in PC game development. I am currently using Homebrew and PALib to port my game to DS console. But the problem is I don't know how to handle game menus which include buttons, checkbox, statusbar, textbox and a lot of other UI components. In PALib, I can use background or sprite to draw things on screen. But background is limited to just 4 and sprite has limited size. Though Sprite seem more preferable, I think it is better use for game characters and not for menu graphic. Is there any other method to draw UI in DS or should I use Sprite for rendering game menu? Plz help. Thanks in advance.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are using PAlib, there are some UI functions included (see the PAlib docs).  There are also a couple libraries that people have done for UI that be found on these forums...unfortunately, I'm not sure of their names.  A little searching should help you (or maybe someone more in the know will reply).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
