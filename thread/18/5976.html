    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Considering I'm relatively new at all of this (ok, <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> new), I decided to follow doublec's tutorials. 
<br/>
I followed instructions to the T, and set up devkitPro exactly as it showed. I've checked and rechecked my paths for the DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM variables, and also check the paths to the minigw bin file and the devkitarm bin file. 
<br/>
However, I just cant seem to use the make command in the MGW bash, I navigate to the complex2d folder and try it, try typing make &lt;folder path&gt;, &lt;folderpath&gt; make, nothing. Same with make.exe. And there are makefiles in the complex2d folder, I've checked that a million times :P. 
<br/>
Any help here would be much appreciated, thanks for putting up with the n00bs :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't run the make form the MGW bash. I just run it from cmd.exe. I also just run 'make'. No path or anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">oh? Alright, It looked as if you were using the CMD but I didnt think it would just work like that! Learn something new everday. 
<br/>
Thanks alot for the reply.
<br/>
[edit]
<br/>
Ok, I'm obviosuly missing something here. the CMD is giving me the same behavior as the MGW bash, so I missed something along the line...
<br/>
Hm..
<br/>
Its recgonizing the makefiles's existence, as the command is not giving me any errors. I press enter and it just prints make after the path and goes to the next line.

Ok, it seems that it makes a folder called "build" with nothing contained inside. I really have n idea what the problem is here, as everything appears to be working just fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
