    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I know that it's sound stupid but I'm trying to compilate a code, that works on linux, and it does not work.
<br/>
So I have some questions:
<br/>
Devkitpro includes standar C libraries?
<br/>
Where can I found them?
<br/>
and where have I put?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">devkitARM include the standard c-libraries, yes. They can be found inside the arm-eabi\include folder of your devkitARM-installation (afaik, devkitARM is usually installed in C:\devkitPro\devkitARM\, so that should make it all C:\devkitPro\devkitARM\arm-eabi\include for most users). You shouldn't have to do anything special to include them to my knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that linux has a lot of "other standard libraries" (like POSIX), some of them are not available in devkitPro.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
