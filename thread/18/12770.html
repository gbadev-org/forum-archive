<br/>
Anyway (sigh), the program you'll need is lmp-ng - this is the music-playing software you'll need. Do a search on the forum for this.
<br/>
<br/>
To get this onto your DS you'll need a booting device. I recommend a slot-1 card, such as the M3 Simply. To actually store your music, by a big microSD card to plug into the Simply.
<br/>
Things to search for: flashme, nopass, wifime.
<br/>
<br/>
You may also find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh</a> an interesting read too, and it has a big bit on the types of booting device you can buy.
<br/>
<br/>
When you buy stuff, consult the retailer feedback forum for good places to buy. Btw, this forum is for actual development - have a look in the flash equipment thread for more info on the hardware you'll need.
<br/>
<br/>
