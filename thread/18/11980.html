    <h4>#112676 - acryl - Tue Dec 19, 2006 11:16 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
(sorry for my bad english in advance - but i am no native english speaker)
<br/>
<br/>
I've got this idea to devellop a vocable trainer for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The Idea is as simple as striking:
<br/>
The top screen displays the vocable in question
<br/>
the bottom streen displays the correct answer - which is supposed to be hidden until you hit A.
<br/>
<br/>
The words should be randomized. Also one should be able to choose one or several lessons.
<br/>
One should be able to add new vocabulary to the database, according to your progress of language-learning. Maybe following the lessons in your book.
<br/>
This would make the Vokable Trainer a tool which could be used by anyone learning a foreign language and give him the freedom to choose which words he/she wants to learn. (i.e. uploading only the words you want to learn - in the language you want to learn)
<br/>
<br/>
Thats it for the beginning. In a later version one could think of using the bottom screen to enter the correct translation with the stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
My problem is:
<br/>
- I don't have ANY programming experience or knowledge.
<br/>
- I absolutely don't geht japanese characters to display on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope that one of you guys is intrigued enough by this idea to help me out a bit.
<br/>
I'd be endlessly greatful.
<br/>
<br/>
regards
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like a really interesting idea; you could even implement it in a sort of Brain Training-like manner for e.g. kanji characters. (Draw 20 right and get points, etc).
<br/>

When I get some spare time and I'm not working on one of my other DS projects, I might have a go at this :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, the possibilities are infinite. You could implement a Kanji-Learing-Programm with animated stroke-orders to follow with the stylus on the bottom screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Also brain-training-like: you could measure your progress in vobable-knowledge in a graph. Or somethin like that.
<br/>
I have thousands of Ideas about this.
<br/>
<br/>
So, is there anything I can do, to get started with this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
By the way, the English word your are looking for that should be in your subject line is: Vocabulary
<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't work out what this was about for maybe 10 seconds while my mind clicked its way through the V's (Kept latching on to Vocation for some reason :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Just to check though, is this program supposed to teach spoken language or written language?
<br/>
<br/>
What about Grammar, should it cover that as well?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Vocabulary... you're absolutely right. Stupid me :o) Could any admin correct this please in the headline? thx
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway: My first idea was somehow to digitalize my little Paper-Cards i wrote my vocabulary on. Beacause sooner or later I'll have about four thousand words to memorize, and imagine having a card for each word... its gonna kill the rain forest.
<br/>
<br/>
So the <span style="font-weight: bold">basic version</span> of the programm is supposed to display a word in japanese writing (or any other target language) on the top screen.
<br/>
You stare at this for a moment, then if you're shure you know its meaning an pronounciation, you hit A and check if you were right.
<br/>
<br/>
A more advanced version could cover all imaginable aspects of language learning. For example, it could play an audio file instead of displaying the word in writing.
<br/>
If it supported the thouch-screen, you could input the right translation and/or pronounciation in hand writing.
<br/>
<br/>
Another feature imaginable would be a reverse vocabulary test. Top screen displays a word in your native language, and you are supposed to enter the right translation (for example in japanese) on the bottom screen with a stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this ist too much of a plan, but i know there are some japanese handwriting recognition programs vor the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I made one of those for GBA a couple years back, and posted a demo to That Other Site as a "Flash card emulator for GBA". Is it important that it run in DS mode, even if only for use with SLOT-1 cards?

Now that's a bit too cryptic for me.
<br/>
If you mean, if I will be okay with using only one screen, thats perfectly fine with me.
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded your Flash Card Emulator, but unfortunately I wasnt able to get it running on my DS.
<br/>
But I guess that is exactly the sort of thing I need right now.
<br/>

The DS mode will be neccessary if there is going to be a handwriting recognition.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've considered the idea of a DS app that teaches Japanese, and there's a lot of things you could do. (Of course it could be any other language, but Japanese is what I'm learning.) Nintendo doesn't seem interested though. :(

<br/>
The DS has a decent sound system and a microphone, so it could speak a word and test your pronounciation skills. The touch screen would be useful for writing and choosing from a list. (Anyone played Slime Forest Adventure? Figure something like that, but instead of typing the correct word, the game randomly chooses from the word, some similar words, and a few completely unrelated words, and you touch the right one on the touch screen.)

I was hoping the author of SFA might be interested in a homebrew DS port, but he isn't. So a lot of my ideas are based on "how would SFA play on a DS?". :p

It's great. You can draw Kanji and Kana and then get an english translation of the word along with some examples how to use it.
<br/>
Unfortunately all the menus are in japanese and the translations only in english. Believe me, it's quite hard to learn a foreign language through english, when english is not your native language.<br/>_________________<br/>Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#114900 - enric - Thu Jan 11, 2007 12:41 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on a similar idea for a while now.  It was orininally intended to be a web site but I now think it would be much better to run it on a DS.
<br/>
The basics would be to have a limited word database in a program (about 1000 words) in different languages plus a simple drawing to help our memory to retain the word.  The user could choose his native language and the target language he wants to learn and the program would initiate to present words (and images) so the user should give the answer.
<br/>
It would be perfect if a voice/writing recoginition (like in English Training) could be used. 
<br/>
When offering the aswer (wrong or right) the system could display the solution and produce the sound for the word (digitalized by native speaker).  
<br/>
The main issue though is that I have been working on a simple algorithm that presents the words to the user several times but less and less frecuently as he gets them right. In this way you can focus in learning what you don't know yet and only review (just in case) sometimes what you have already learned.
<br/>
<br/>
I can not code this myself, but I'm interested in finding a good programmer who can do it.  I could provide all the artwork and functionality analysis and would also pay for the job.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The hardest part in writing a program would be the character recognition, I guess.  However there are already examples, like Pocket Kanji and padict.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
