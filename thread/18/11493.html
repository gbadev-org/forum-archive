 I believe it had been throughoutly tested before release, so it must be a problem on my side. Did anyone have the same problem? Any hint? Thanks alot!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

LOL. PAlib is so buggy that you have to hack lots of code to get something working. Also, FAT_InitFiles() (aka PA_InitMyFileSystemPreetyPreetyPlease(NOW)) is a part of chishm's old fatlib. you might want to update.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SC:CF is one of the most homebrew-compatible carts, so there's a good chance it's either a bug in PALib or in PALib's version of fatlib. I would suggest trying out the newer libfat alpha. It's on this forum, not too far down, you'll see it. (only downside to is is that directory listing functions are not implemented yet, but not everyone needs though)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It turns out the 2005-11-06 ver of fat lib does work on my sc-cf card in the latest devkitpro and palib environment.  
<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I've done:
<br/>
I don't know how to use old fat lib to replace the one come with palib ( I couldn't use the build script to compile the lib). So I just put the old fat lib in my source folder, and change the function name whenever I get "confilict definition" error during compiling and linking. I know it's a crappy way to do so, but at least it works.  I am still wondering though which part is the bad guy? the new fat lib? the devkitpro? the compiled fatlib? But one thing for sure is all other homebrews run just fine. Could that just be a problem of my luck?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
