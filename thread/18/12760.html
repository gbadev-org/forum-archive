    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am now looking into being able to put music and video on my DS Lite.  I have tried reading the topics giving instructions, but they confuse me a bit.  I think I might get a M3 Simply.  It looks like it will be very easy to set up and use.  I have seen many people say it is a good product, but I am not sure if it is the best.  If I were to purchase a M3 Simply, could you recommend a good place to get it?  Does this site look like a scam or look legit?  <span style="font-weight: bold">[Removed link to page operated by a retailer not listed in Retailer Feedback.
