    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not knowledgable on modding, so please forgive me if this sounds dumb.  I want to do a sound project and was hoping to use my DS.  
<br/>
<br/>
I have a few audio sound clips on my DS that I would like to play out of a speaker.  It's going to be a project for a vehicle, to give it "voice".  I was going to use not a car speaker, but one of those car horn speakers to make it sound loud.  Problem is, I am not sure if it is going to work.
<br/>
<br/>
What would be the current that the 3.5mm puts out?  If possible, I would like to plug a speaker into the jack to increase the volume of the sound.  Is this possible, or would it use too many amps and won't work?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
