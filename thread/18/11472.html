    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently working on some sort of spritesystem, using 3dfunctions instead of the 2-hardware. Reason for this is that I want to have more flexibility when mixing cool effexts with sprites and so on, since I think it will be messy trying to sync up 3dstuff with hardwaresprites/background and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
I used to work with Palib, but since thw 3d-support isn't that good yet, I decided to try out using libnds instead, at least for now.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have now gotten to a point where the 3dstuff do not behave in a way that I can figure out how to fix it.
<br/>
<br/>
When the roms is run, you see some objects. All the objects are flat, and the z-value between them is 0.02.
<br/>
You can change the texture used pushing the R button, as the current one was used when I was perfecting the scroll of them(this is the main quest, to find x/y increase values that won't make the texture to garble, but to look pixel perfect when scrolling. only the object to the left is correctly adjusted in this demo). Change the x/y values with the arrowpad. A and B to rotate them. Zoom with start and select.
<br/>
<br/>
??? ON TO THE PROBLEM:
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, (do not use the y and x buttons when testing), when one coordinate go out of screen, something screws up, and the object pops up, in front of them all! :(
<br/>
<br/>
This problem ONLY appears on hardware!
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.
