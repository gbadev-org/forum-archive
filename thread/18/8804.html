    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been rummaging around the different emualtors for the DS, and at the moment, it seems that all the emulators are built only for Windows.  
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the emulators post their source code (DSEmu), and it seems that some don't (Ideas as far as I could find).  Ideally, there would be a DS emulator that runs under Linux, but if there isn't, are there any emulators that would not be difficult to modify to use SDL or OpenGL so as to port them over to Linux?
<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Chris, there has been some interest in getting things going under Linux but no one has really looked into it yet. Two major stumbling blocks:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Inline assembly. This would need to be converted to C or a format suitable for gcc.
<br/>
2) Windows GUI. This would need to be converted to an open source framework.
<br/>
<br/>
dsemu-ng, by Imran, was a start a redeveloping dsemu to be cross platform. It currently builds and runs under Windows, OS X and Linux and I'd like to one day merge this into the dsemu tree to get cross platform support. The source to dsemu-ng is available from:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.dsemu.org" target="_blank">http://www.dsemu.org</a>
<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, dsemu runs under wine. As does dualis I believe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First you would have to get Wine running on DSLinux. Then you'd have to somehow have enough RAM to run iDeaS in it. Then if it did work it'd be ridiculously slow.

Any more ideas? ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But when I fire it up, I get no output, no screen, nothing.  I don't even get a crash.  I am not sure what is wrong.  If anyone has this working, I would love to here it.
<br/>
<br/>
I have tried ./ideas, and ./ideas myrom.nds and I get the same results with both... nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
I was kind of hoping to get further into my project, before actually buying a DS...

What about reverse engeneering the DLLs to let them compile for ARM architecture?
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm already shutting up.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
No I just have to: what if you would run windows under ds linux through a real emulator (is there one running under linux? if not, someone would have to code it) and then let it run iDeaS? &gt;.&lt;
<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't think that this is possible somehow... it would just be so absolutely paradox that I just had to follow that nerdy thought ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
