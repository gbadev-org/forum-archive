I have no idea what your point is.  I KNOW each screen is 256x192, and I made absolutely no indications to the contrary.  My point is that you can access DS hardware, enabling 256x192 video (if even just 1 screen).
<br/>
<br/>
And to address both xaint and ravuya's posts, booting the DS into a GBA game will only allow 240x160 video.  And no, the DS doesn't stretch the resolution of GBA games, you just get a black border.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, based on babelfishing and translation of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20041215/nintendo.htm" target="_blank">this story</a>, all indications are that it will <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> be full-screen on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, babelfish is saying:

On the countrary, the GBA and the GBA SP has roughly the same battery capacity, but the SP backlight makes the SP battery life shorter than the GBA.

Of course, it is possible the SP is able to supply more current to the video decoding than the original GBA?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perhaps, but the fact that the SP battery is rechargable which the GBA lacks makes a difference. No one is going to use this product if it only has a 4 hour battery life for movies and 8 hours for music if the batteries run out so quickly. Otherwise, people would rather go buy a PSP instead.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm guessing if the battery life is a factor for the GBA it's because if the decoder takes extra power, the SP's Li-Ion battery can handle the power withdrawal.  On the other hand, the GBA will take regular AA batteries, and as we all know you can buy a dozen batteries for 5 bucks (or less), and would therefore turn a regular 2 hour battery life on the GBA into... I dunno, 5 minutes?  I did the same with my digital camera.  I could take about 4 pictures before it would die.  I got NiMH batteries and now it lasts for a solid hour of taking pics.
<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, it will probably work in the GBA, but Nintendo won't promise it becuase otherwise they'll get complaints from the poor saps who can't bother to buck up for decent batteries.
