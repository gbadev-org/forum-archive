<br/>
<br/>
I'm busy to learn opengl, because i want to make 3d games.
<br/>
So if im done im going to try 3d on nds.
<br/>
<br/>
But i downloaded the cube demo from drunkencoders.com, but can't get it working on emulator???
<br/>
<br/>
My flashcard will arrive on wednesday, so i want to use now an emulator. But they all crash. Is this only with me? Or does more people have it?
<br/>
<br/>
i only didn't try hyperds, but can't download it because i saw it was private?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
