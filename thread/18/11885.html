    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering how difficult it is to distribute homebrew from one DS to several in a similar fashion to the "demo download" function in many official DS games (such as Meteos). No multiplayer functionality -- just simply sharing the entire program wirelessly like a download station. It seems like the development of the DSWiFi library is mostly geared towards interfacing with an established WiFi network.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless someone steals Nintendo's private key, this will never happen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One way to do this involves reverse engineering some commercial DS game's bootloader. For instance, <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario 64 DS</span> sends a (signed) bootloader to other players, and this bootloader receives the game data from the server (the DS with the Game Card). If we could send the (signed) bootloader and then send different game data...<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
