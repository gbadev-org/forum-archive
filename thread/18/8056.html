<br/>
I want to ask if someone knows, how i can get a minimal power consumtion with the DS.
<br/>
Of course, to disable as many things as possible is the first thing (sound, backlights, screens, ...).
<br/>
But how can I get the processors to consume as little power as possible? Does for example one of the SWIs DelayLoop, IntrWait or WaitForIRQ help and if yes, which one should be the best? Or is it possible to completely power off one processor?
<br/>
<br/>
The thing, why I ask this is, that I will code something like a "sleep-mode" which will stay in "standby" for a specific amount of time time and then powers on everything again. And this "sleep-mode" should stay as long as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance
