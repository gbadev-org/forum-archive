    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I realized that no one has really explained how to get a texture to show up at this forum. So in hope more people will do as I do right now, and help more people to get somewhere, I here by post a working texture example with source code for the DS 3D mode:

My hopes were to make the original Gamecube intro but for the DS (cube flips over to make the GC logo). I got this far by my own, but I lack of OpenGL knowledge. Just being able to do texture coordinates and produce texture data by my own took a long time (two days). It would have gone both faster and futher in this project if there was someone before me to give out texture examples. So instead I wish people to get the help I wanted by giving out an example with source myself.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can produce something out of this, I am happy to be of help.

I tried to find those examples from a site named Drunken Coders a few times. But for some reason the download wasn't directly linked to the thing I was looking for. No big as I figured out how to manage texutures by myself. I just want to help you know.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Link has been updated on drunkencoders.com.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=159894" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&amp;package_id=159894</a>
<br/>
<br/>
These examples are also installed if you use devkitpro web installer (you have to select them though)
<br/>
<br/>
*EDIT*
<br/>
Actualy the old link was good but the example package was bumped down and you needed to click "examples" in the list. It would take you to a listing of all example project files including the ones for nds.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now do you know any way of rendering solid quads at the same time as texture quads?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
it might not be GL_TEX_FORMAT but something like that look in video.h or videoGL.h to be sure..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I used glDisable, it disabled all the textures during the frame render. I want to have some quads textured and some just filled with colors.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Exceptions are fun</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
