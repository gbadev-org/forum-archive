    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
First of all I must congratulate you and the entire nds scene: Great job studying NDS secrets for homebrew development! 
<br/>
I'm having problems using FAT on the M3 miniSD card with my own software, using older libfat or using the DLDI patching. I need to boot and load my app using the DSTT card and then use the M3 mini SD as a disk. 
<br/>
The only way to make the M3 accesible is booting from the M3 (using PASSME on the DSTT). It seems that the M3 is not configured, or switched off, if the system boots from the DSTT.
<br/>
When using DLDI, I disable the autopatching feature, so the DSTT can't modify the DLDI driver.
<br/>
Any ideas on how to configure/activate the SD on the M3 without booting from this device?
<br/>
Thank you in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On some cards like this you need to go into (in this case) the M3 menu, power off the DS then boot off the other card. This seems to initialise the card...some how. I've had this many times with the Supercard.
<br/>
<br/>
However, sometimes there can be an alternate dldi driver which initialises the card properly negating the need for this step. Is there an alternative M3 driver?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks simonjhall for your ultrafast response! There's an alternate dldi driver but it seems to give same results. 
<br/>
<br/>
Surfing ds sites I found the DSfile2 utility (thanks CalcProgrammer1 for the idea !) that seems to work ok for my 2 devices. This utility uses PAlib and libfat :). I tested the libfat library by chishm, using &lt;fat.h&gt;...fatInitDefault ()..dirnext()..and so on functions, and seems to work perfectly. I can access the slot1 device and the slot2 device simultaneously ! 
<br/>
<br/>
I'll continue testing this libfat. Thank you again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
