    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, for one thing, this isn't hacking.  It's homebrew.  Running non-official code on the DS system.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I believe that you can indeed use your Nintendo Wifi USB connector as a softAP for use with homebrew programs that use Wifi, as a replacement for a wireless router, but this requires the use of Linux as far as I know.  
<br/>
<br/>
This would allow you to use WMB, or Wireless MultiBoot.  This sends a signed DS demo to the DS via DS Download Play.  Note that if you flash your firmware using FlashMe, you can send unsigned DS programs up to 4 MB in size as well.  Installing FlashMe however involves the use of a passthrough device.  WifiMe is a virtual passthrough device with which you can install FlashMe.  In both cases, you still need something to store the flashme.nds file on, like a GBA flash cart, Supercard, M3, or other homebrew device.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the ability to use WifiMe, aside from having the correct wireless chipset, is mostly dependent on your DS firmware version.  Search the forums here for directions on how to use the TakeMeOut method to test which version you have.  If your DS is version 4 or above, you cannot use WifiMe, and you must therefore purchase a different passthrough device like a NoPass variant.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know about DS firmware checking...My screen turn yellow. Also, I have no flashcart..but can you give me a link on where to do this? Do i have to the thing where I have to Turn my USB connector into a SoftAP?
<br/>
<br/>
And if I do have to do that, whenever I download that file it just says center.exe and then I double click it. Then I get an error.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I just found out that I can use my ARDS as a nopass
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: So by my understanding, since my ARDS is a nopass, if I buy a flash cart I can run the demos and games by saving them to a flshcart? Are there any specific carts i need? an reccomended 1s?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
