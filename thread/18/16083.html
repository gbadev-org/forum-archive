    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. Id like to know if someone coul help me:
<br/>
<br/>
I usually used the program "pcx2gba" to get to converet a picture (this outputs image in 16bit values (2 pixels per value), and palette in 16bit values into an array in a C header file ) and like this I can work with pictures on the screen. The problem is that now I need know how to get a image into an array in a C header file, but in 8bit value (soime program ?) , or, how can I get only one of the 8bit value from a number like 0x1F02 ( 2 and 16 ) ?
<br/>
I have a image with a "new font" to use in a game and this have characters with diferents lengths. Cuz of it I need cut a (x, 16) font picture (8bits color ) and put in the specific point in the screen. I also need know how to access only a 8bit value in the screen, not 16bit value ! The bios have function like dmaCopy, swiCopy, but then only work with 16 bit... Please, could someone help me ?!? Maybe have a easy way, but I still don?t get...
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
Renato.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you can't figure out the meaning by yourself (I don't have time to explain it atm.), you should take a good (!= BullSchildt) book about C / C++ and start or at least continue reading it. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards! :^)

PS: So, how do you read 8bit pixels now? By fetching non-8-bit values from VRAM and extracting the values you need.
<br/>
<br/>
PPS: You can also do the task in other ways; xor (^) comes to mind. :^)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
