If you want to know what "language" the DS understands it's ARM assembly (and even Thumb on the ARM7TDMI), GCC can compile C &amp; C++ at least to ARM targets (maybe even D soon?).<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am assuming that Nintendo has a library ready for developers to use for voice recognition pruposes, otherwise that would put a lot of strain on a developer to make such a library. I'm hoping the feature will be used to enhance gameplay but not as a gimmick.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The voice recognition hardware would most likely decode the audio to turn it into phonetic data regardless of language; and it would be up to the developer to make sense of it.

Once that piece of work is done there isn't much hard work for the developer; apart from matching - h e l l o - to hello</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
