    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ohh... thx, I am working on a University Proyect, a Homebrew that generate video patrons with the ds engine linked with a music generator (a new version of AXE). So, I want to plug my DS to a Videoproyector  to made live performance and art installation.
<br/>
If I find a Tutorial to weld a output plug into the circuit will be great!! ^o^
<br/>
I think this is the only way to get a video output... -_-
<br/>
Any idea?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Due to the H/VSync timings (already fitting, no logic required), a LCD-Signal -&gt; FBAS  should be pretty easy to do. The most expensive part should be the DAC, which are about 1-2$ for 10-20MHz DACs (where you need ~5MHz)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, there is no tutorial for such. (At leat none i am aware of)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm no electronic freak so i might be wrong here, but the things to master would be
<br/>
- create a short negative signal on hsync
<br/>
- create a long negative signal on vsync
<br/>
- create an ac line from the datalines in each color
<br/>
- create a color select signal (pixelclock * 3) (this signal might be available on the DS somewhere)
<br/>
- compose the above signals on one line with the FBAS in mind (black shoulders, PAL Burst, Syncs, Colordata)
<br/>
<br/>
The first 3 steps should be easy to do (create R-C combinations for the needed uSecs)/follow the DAC's reference.
<br/>
The later 2 steps are beyond my abbilities, but i think one studying e-tech should be able to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'd suggest using three TDA8702 DACs, and a CPLD or FPGA. If your logic device has enough gates left and has built-in DACs you can avoid the TDA8702's.
<br/>
Basically you need to buffer two lines of video data and output the first multiple times while the second is being stored.
<br/>
<br/>
Every time you get a HSync pulse you need to swap buffers, and start reading into the backbuffer, and output the front buffer at four times speed.  Remember to multiply the HSync from the DS by 4 to get the HSync the monitor will use.
<br/>
<br/>
This will scale the input from 192 pixels tall to 768 pixels tall. Analog monitors have no idea about the dot clock so we don't have to do anything special to scale the image width wise.
<br/>
<br/>
You might have to play around with the VSync / HSync timing to make sure you have the front and back porch your monitor / projector expects.
<br/>
<br/>
Two 4x PLLs (HSync &amp; Dot-Clock) and two banks of 256 x 18 ram, plus glue logic need to be implemented in the FPGA.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming university has an electronics program that teaches FPGAs you should have no problem finding some help.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Method 2</span>
<br/>
If you wanted to avoid opening the DS, you could use display capture and some custom hardware wired up to the GBA slot, but you'd need to handle dma'ing the data out on your own. Something like an ISA video card, some address glue logic, and levelshifting from 3.3v to 5v.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
