    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">after hearing that i had to update immediately or else mario kart would brick my DS in trying to store wifi settings (joy!).. darkain's loader doesn't seem to be able to load anything anymore, and there's no sound in the loader frontend.
<br/>
<br/>
granted, the loader still boots, which is a good thing as i understand it.
<br/>
<br/>
update: snesDS apparently still works just fine, so it's definitely not a problem with homebrew in general (or at least not a problem with loopy's). what's more, the random crashes in capcom games <span style="font-style: italic">seem</span> to be gone, although that might just be my imagination. so this could be a darkain-centric issue, and hasn't he been ostracized or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It prevents the firmware from working properly (overwrote part of flashme), it doesn't exactly brick it.  You can use a flash cart to restore (and unlike the trojan bricker, it doesn't corrupt flash cart firmware if you have a M3, etc...), just like always.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
