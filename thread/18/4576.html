    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking somewhere a year. That was about how long I noticed it took for people to start the GBA homebrewing. Now I could be wrong, it could take longer because of the complexity of the system, but I have complete faith in our reverse enginers.

<br/>
But, first does anyone have any updates on the subject? I mean, has anyone even tried making an emulator for it yet? That, I think would be the first step. Let me know what ya'll think.<br/>_________________<br/>How many boards could the Mongols hoard, if the Mongol Hored got bored</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally believe that the DS is such an anticipated system with all it's unique features that it will spurn on the people working on cracking it to work faster/more diligently.  I wouldn't be surprised if we're developing by April.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the processor emulation should be finished by now. I know that the arm 7 core was at its alpha testing at around June. I don't see the harm in our first emulator having GBA graphics/sound hardware capabilities with the dual processors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
