    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been thinking about trying to do some 3D, nothing too hard, but I'm not sure where to start. I haven't done 3D before, I've been avoiding it for a few years now and it's about time I try.
<br/>
<br/>
So are there any good tutorials for coding 3D stuff on the DS, Or coding 3D in general that can easily be used on the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'd probably want to start with OpenGL on the PC. It's pretty easy to get some nice 3D graphics going, but it doesn't do anything else for you - I/O, game logic, sound, etc are all up to you. I recommend using SDL which takes care of some of these things (windows, joysticks/keyboard/mouse, 2D graphics, sound, timing, and some other things I've forgotten), but you'll still have to do the real hard stuff (trigonometry; physics, hit detection, etc) by yourself if you intend to make a game.
<br/>
Once you're familiar with OpenGL, you basically just have to learn how to work the DS' 3D hardware, which is fairly similar. (This is also why it's good to learn how to do all that hard stuff yourself - most systems won't do it for you.)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd suggest doing OpenGL on PC first, because you'll learn the basics of 3D programming and because the NDS 3D HW API is pretty much similar though with the additional restrictions.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

thirding the previous two comments - learn how to think about 3D on your PC first; deal with the DS specifics later.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Aye, stick to PC first. Check out the tutorials at <a class="postlink" href="http://nehe.gamedev.net" target="_blank">nehe.gamedev.net </a>and also there are good tutorials at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ultimategameprogramming.com/demoDownload.php?category=OpenGL&amp;page=1" target="_blank">ultimategameprogramming</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
