    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Iam trying to record the microphone and play it immediatly (well one frames latency, it sounds crap, I think the recorded stuff isnt synced with the channel. so my question is how do I sync the microphone fetch interrupt to an audio channel playing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I can't tell if it's possible, but isn't it possible that it sounds crap because of the fact you're recording and playing on the same time?
<br/>
<br/>
In mean this in fact: record voice + play recorded voice + record play recorded voice + ... you might get the idea, doesn't it give some sort of distortion?
<br/>
<br/>
Just like when calling to the radio station (being live in the program) and speaking over the phone while your radio is on with the same program?<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ive set up a buffer of 1024 samples. Play it as looping and start from the beginning of the buffer, and I start to record at the middle of the buffer, but somethings goes to fast/slow!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if I set my microphone interrupt timer to: 0xF800 (16khz)
<br/>
and play my sample at 0xFC00, isnt that supposed to be exact the same speed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
