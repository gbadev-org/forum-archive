    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before proceeding any further, I wanted to make sure there's no existing solutions I could use. In other words: Does anyone have currently source / lib for searching and setting wireless network connection up, that would be easy to include into a project? I.e. finding a router, configurating WEP passwords etc. and saving connection settings to firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm aware of <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8237" target="_blank">El Hobito's WiFi Setup</a>, but 1) that's for PALib only and 2) I couldn't even find a source code for that anymore (links both from this forum and El Hobitos's blog have been expired).
<br/>
<br/>
Follow-up question: Does anybody else here need such a thing? And if so, would you prefer as tiny and simple source code without any GUI or extra gimmicks, or rather something graphically polished, similar to what commercial WiFi games have for setting up network?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, it would be a nice thing to have. Especially if you could write up a manager that let's you "swap" profiles. Virtual profiles (not the 3 on the DS) and place them in the 3 slots. 
<br/>
<br/>
While you're at it, please implement rebootlib (reset to device-bootmenu) and Locator (find application directory with libfat).
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be a great thing to have, a standard lib so anyone with wifi homebrew can just call the wifi setup then return to their code without trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to add such a thing to DiagnoSe, but I don't have the acknowledge.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

Hmm, yes - not a bad idea. Have to think about this as well.

If I get this done, it's better to be as simple as possible - although a standalone WFC settings program makes some sense, I rather would like to see the settings be part of any homebrew application that just uses WiFi.

<br/>
Yes - but there are situations when you forget to have a commercial game inserted, are on the road and can't connect to an AP because the homebrew ones rely on ready settings.

Indeed it does. Thanks for the pointer.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is something that I intend to implement for Dicewars DS, but there's tons of other things to finish with the game first - so don't hold your breath quite yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
