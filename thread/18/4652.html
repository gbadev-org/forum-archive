    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you turn the DS on its side to have stereoscopic view to make it look 3D?  One screen for each eye.  Make a slightly different image on each and hold it close enough.  However the screens will be slightly different distances away, but that may be compensated in software.  Also the screens are different resolutions, but that may also be compensated.   You'd only be able to use one set of buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of the idea?  Crazy enough for Nindento?

<br/>
<br/>
but i doubt anyone would try to market that cause so many people cant cross their eyes and stuff, also, only 1 screen can be 3d accelerated at a time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo tried this earlier, and it failed miserably. Google "Virtual Boy".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">(1) The screens are both the exact same size and resolution, the distance is negligible
<br/>
<br/>
(2) It's not known for certain whether or not the DS can do hardware 3D rendering onto both screens at once.  If not, then it isn't likely you'd see this effect.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm willing to bet that, if you're lucky, 1 or 2 developers will do this.  Otherwise, it's going to be homebrew if we can manage to get to that point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So, it flips between the two LCDs every second frame? There must be more of a penalty than that for doing that sort of thing (having to reinitialize the scenegraph with the new viewport position).
<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong though; I only have rudimentary experience with OpenGL and even less experience with how console 3D operates.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://rav.realitybytes.tk" target="_blank">Rav</a> (Win/Mac/Linux games for free)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
