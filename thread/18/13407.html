    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, Im researching for making a DS game.
<br/>
Currently Im looking at PAlib and cant see any support for wifi multipler.
<br/>
<br/>
I see someone made Doom with Wifi multiplayer.
<br/>

<br/>
Though it seems that it wont run with my DS R4 setup.
<br/>
<br/>
Whats the easiest way to get access to wifi multipler support?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So far PAlib will suits my needs, though I will have to write some extensions.
<br/>
<br/>
If not PAlib, what should I be looking at? In particular do you know where to look for good WiFi libs / examples / tutorials?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">RandomTiger, don't listen to anyone that provides that kind of info.  You will not get any open opinion from them.  PAlib has its place and has been used to produce some extremely nice homebrew (WordUp for example).  That being said, my only warning was the WiFi.  It is newly added to PAlib and buggy.   Since Mollusk is taking some time off, you might not get the support you need right now (though, he has current posts on the forum, so maybe he'd done with his time off already?).
<br/>
<br/>
Being that you are a new NDS coder, you have two choices.  Spend the time to learn the DS hardware, so you don't need PAlib, or use PAlib.  I personally have nothing against PAlib.  I like it, and without it there would be a lot less NDS developers.  Of course, people like Sausage Boy would say, "good, because they suck anyway" just because something as easy to use as PAlib draws out the most "unskilled" developers.  Heck, if it wasn't for PAlib, I wouldn't be able to do any DS homebrew.. and I struggle with PAlib because I don't have a developer mindset.
<br/>
<br/>
So, before you dive into WiFi, I would suggest you start with something simple and work your way up.  As you are learning, you will start to outgrow PAlib and in doing so, eventually get to the point where you don't need it.  If you don't want to wait, I'd suggest you start looking at the examples that come with DevkitPro and go from there.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I can see both points of view here, PAlib as someone with no DS experience, and is used to higher level platforms has let me play around with some simple stuff very quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
However it seems to be missing some core rendering functionality but I can just write my own extensions into PAlib and as you say as I continue I can use PAlib less and less.
<br/>
<br/>
On the wifi / multiplayer stuff, I really for the moment just need to know that it possible as multiplayer is the kind of killer side of the app that will really make it fun. But I should probably write the game first, which will take a while since I seem to have less and less free time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Whoa, please don't put words in my mouth. I agree that many people have this mindset, I'm not one of them though. I have no problem with PAlib programmers, they don't bother me. Bad homebrew is better than no homebrew, and at least they learn programming. The moment they start quitting my scene and spamming my IRC, I'll get slightly pissed, but as far as I can tell, PAlibbers are not the ones doing that stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
My point is, you can build great games or applications with PAlib, but they'll smell of France and fail. I'm kidding.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About which part?  That you can build great games/apps with PAlib, or that they smell and fail? ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
