    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, due to the limitations of the DS hardware I was thinking about how to make an infinite tiled background.
<br/>
The idea is easy, but I didn't had any luck implementing it, mostly because I have no idea of how to do it (I tried several codes, but nothing)
<br/>
<br/>
My idea would be have a 512x512 bg and whether the screen moves load the necesary tiles and move back the background so it actually seems the background is really huge
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone has implemented it, has anyone done it? :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You've just reinvented what just about every NES game does. In fact, this technique is described in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=6775#6775" target="_blank">the board FAQ</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Tip: You only need 512x256 because the screen is only 192 pixels tall.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
