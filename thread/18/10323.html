As for C or C++, use whichever you are comfortable with.   If you use C++, there's a few features you should be careful with that have the ability to slow your code down, but if used intelligently, either is fine.

    <h4>#92464 - silent_code - Thu Jul 13, 2006 4:40 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">right, c++ isn't "just an upgraded c". indeed, oop should be understood when using classes and its concepts, but it is no harder than any other language. every language has its pros and cons. c++ is very low level (for a high language, that is) and gives you total control over the hw and os features.
<br/>
<br/>
that means that an unexperienced programmer won't be able to produce optimized code instantly ;p ... there is next to no string support in the language, too. but it is very flexible and extensible. it has its standard libraries and optimized libraries like boost (that is a playground for new features to be eventually implemented in later revisions of the standard libs ;D ).
<br/>
i also see it as a feature that the language has a very small set of keywords (63) because you don't mess around with too many of these, yet you can do whatever you want with it (well, not EVERYTHING you want ;D - like let it rub your back... ;P). add a consistent set of rules with a clear syntax and you have a very powerful tool to implement your designs and systems.
<br/>
<br/>
imo, why learn one language to start with another right after that? i don't see the point. c programs are quite different in design than c++ progs. that's clear to someone who knows both, but a newcomer won't see big differences (plus you may mix c with c++ in most cases). why confusing that person with a simmilar (but different) language in the first place? e.g., i found malloc and free are harder to use than new and delete. there are quite some of those examples. i also think that c++ progs are potentially easier to maintain. think about templates... doing something similar in c is a pain. all those (void*)s... inheritence? nope for c.
<br/>
<br/>
you have to admit, that once you understand it, you won't give c++ away. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
my advise: learn c++ basics first, then learn to use it (start some &gt;simple&lt; useful projects) and finally learn how to make your code efficient (e.g. through more advanced data structures and the like).
<br/>
<br/>
there's a lot of info about each of these steps on the net and there are some really great books out there, too! check your local book store or some online shop.
<br/>
<br/>
if you like to leanr c++ anyway, start with it and don't waste your time with c.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: THESE ADVISES ARE BASED MY OPINION AND EXPERIENCE WITH THE TWO LANGUAGES. I KNOW EVERYONE HAS HIS/HER FAVORITE, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP. PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND.

<br/>
<br/>
I would say however just use a blend of both, if you see a case where a OOP approach would work then great, but if it doesn't need it then just use some functions and structs. I don't like getting too bogged down worrying if my code is OOP enough or all C, just a happy medium. I like to have a few globals but I keep a close eye on their dependencies, which you'll find is the real kick in the teeth with C++... include hell!

sajimori, has the thought ever struck you, that the good programmers you've known perhaps have been mediocre at some point? And how did they learn C++ inside out? Certainly not by studying C! The only way of learning a language inside out is to use it, use it and use it. Sure, you'll hit the wall from time to time, bang your head into the table and scream out in misery, but after you've solved it, you will be a better programmer.
<br/>

i don't want to flame you, just comment! :)
<br/>
<br/>
what meant in my "big" post is that i don't think it is necessary to learn (the restrictions of) c (though i like that language a lot!) to fully understand the concepts and design decisions of c++.
<br/>
<br/>
it's true, c++ is the child of c and oop, but would you date a girls mother before dating the girl, just to know what she inherited from her mother? i don't think so. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
didn't i mention the complexity of c++? shame on me.
<br/>
well, sure it is complex. but most concepts are straight forward. of cause one should understand what a language does and why it does it that way. you're totally right. but that fits about every language. you don't know your tool, you can't use it. simple as hell. :)
<br/>
<br/>
there's nothing special about the world of c++ pain. hurts like any other language. relly. i tried a few ;) but c++ is a faw more superior tool than any other language i know. so mastering it will give you more benefits.
<br/>
<br/>
there are people who are obsessed by the idea that c++ generates bloated binaries and isn't as fast as c or asm. then think about why it is THE language of choise? it all depends on how good you use the features the language offers you. you don't need to know c to be a good c++ programmer, you need to know c++ to be a good c++ programmer. knowing how it works, you may be able to write programs in c++ that are  as fast as asm progs (may also depend on the compiler). you just have to know your language. [by any means do i not say that i am one of those c++ masters.] anyway, it would make more sense to learn asm than c before learning c++, imo. that's something noone says, i wonder why?
<br/>
<br/>
e.g. a beginner may write a c prog that assembles to like five instructions. the same programmer (beginner) could write a simmila prog in c++. that one would maybe assemble to eight lines. well. doesn't sound good, does it? it's like 1:0 for c... maybe not. because this is just a simple numbers example we can say that an experienced (not too advanced) programmer changes bits of the c++ sources. after that the c++ prog could assemble to like four instructions.
<br/>
<br/>
i've seen enough of such (real world) examples. again, it really depends on how you use your tool. and this example isn't just a one way thing. a beginner may also write a c++ prog that is faster (uses optimized instructions or simply has fewer instructions) than his similar c prog.
<br/>
<br/>
another thing is that you have to learn to use c++ properly. as i said there are lots of good books (and also a bunch of crap) on the topic. there are some good authors that have written several books and some of them have even worked on the c++ standard. they know the guts of c++.
<br/>
<br/>
again, if you want to learn c++, because you are interested in oop, then don't think twice and skip c. you'll learn most of it anyway, but from the view of a c++ programmer. having oop concepts available from the start may also help you write good oop code later on. ;) [i admit i often use c for file i/o and stuff, though i know the c++ way... it's a habit from the old c days ;) even though i find using c++ for those operations easier... that's wierd. i'll work on it ;p]
<br/>
<br/>
and if you start out &gt;small&lt;, you may even start learning c++ without ever having programmed in your life. depends on who teaches you. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
all in all, i advise (again) to learn c++ if you want oop. if you don't, c is a very good thing.
<br/>
<br/>
happy coding!
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i really don't want to write another comment like this... there are some good programmers out there that know a lot about the subject. looking at my posts they may seem pretty basic and too simple, but remember this guy wants some constructive advise.

A bad thing about 'C' is that it allows some coders to "jack around" too freely.

<br/>
I'm a C++ coder but I can easily envision something like 'D' taking over the world.  I'm an open source guy and I share in the common belief that languages like java, c#, .net, etc cause more harm than good (and suck up more resources too, btw).

<br/>
People bitch about how c++ is non garbage collected.  I'd say that c++ exposes bad software design more more quickly than the other languages do.  That sort of implies that more skill is needed to code in c++.
