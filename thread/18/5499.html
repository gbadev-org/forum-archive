This looks sweet, and I love the idea of porting DOS programs, and adding dual screen / touch.  There are a lot of programs out there that could probably be emulated too, if the demand was there. Thanks for the link.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On the other hand, I spent far more time in high school using my TI-86 to play Z-tetris than to perform Z-tests... the boundary between "graphing calculator" and "handheld gaming system" is already horribly blurred.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i wish i knew the differences between the ti83 and ti85 cause if possible id use it

and is it just me or is it weird the ti83 is new/more advanced that the ti85</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are probably a few things that can be done to make the emu better, but it will not support ti83 i dont think (the original emulator didnt, and i just ported it). The main things are speeding it up, and fixing all the buttons (a few of them don't work for some reason). probably also adding save support would be nice (save to sram or to cf/sd).
<br/>
<br/>
But nobody else seems interested in it. if someone wants the latest source code feel free to contact me...but i don't think anyone with programming skills really cares about it. (feel free to prove me wrong)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you can also get a TI-86 emulator for your computer
