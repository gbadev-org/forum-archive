    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was able to get some helpful feedback on rendering (thanks guys!) so I thought I'd ask about this one as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to pull off any effects on a full screen image in a decent amount of time?
<br/>
<br/>
For the app that we're working on we'd like to apply filters to take a basic image and do weird and wonderful things to it -- similar to what you can do in Photoshop etc. but on a very basic level. The accuracy of the transform doesn't even come into play, it's simply for fun. 
<br/>
<br/>
These effects could be colour transforms (greyscale, sepia tone), algorithmic (mirroring), distortion (fish eye lens) or graphical (charcoal sketch, Van Gogh) etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can use the display capture feature to render the scene to a section in VRAM. Then you could do some process that image and output it to the screen as a 2D background.
<br/>
<br/>
The real-time bloom DS demo does something like that. The link for download is down, but you can have it here:
