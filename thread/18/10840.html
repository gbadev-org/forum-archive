    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">uuuum. i guess that i think you're asking... uuum.
<br/>
i'll just guess what you're asking.
<br/>
if you're going to use beup you'll need a way of delivering the program to your ds. this is, at the time of writing, more commonly done through slot-2 on your ds/the gba slot. device like the supercard, M3 ect etc - google is your friend if you want to find out more about them.
<br/>
i'm going to ignore what you were saying about nintendo because it isn't necessary to answer in order to get beup running on your ds. 
<br/>
What is necessary is to enable you ds to open programs from slot-2.
<br/>
This is done with a passme device, something like the max media launcher*.
<br/>
i think you might have been trying to hint at using WIFIme. i'm not sure of what pc wifi cards do and dont work with this method so i'll let someone else address that.
<br/>
googling passme is probably your easiest bet. 
<br/>
Also Beup is just one amazing program out of a damn good few that's worth looking at/playing with; you'll end up engrossed in this stuff so it is worth the ?40-50 it takes to get up and running, and this is the best place to enjoy it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*cheapest passme in the uk as far as i know, esspecially for homebrew needs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Buy a NoPass and a GBA Movie Player v2 CF. Then you can just put the program on a CompactFlash card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
No, there is not such an exploit. My point is this: Is there a reason that you <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> buy a DS Lite but <span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span> buy a flash card?
<br/>

<br/>
If you want to do it without buying any cards, then you have to use FlashMe+WMB. Installing FlashMe without buying any cards involves <span style="font-style: italic">paying</span> someone to flash your DS, and using WMB requires <span style="font-style: italic">paying</span> for the wireless card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

How is online different from in person if they charge the same amount of money?

How did you afford your DS, your wireless PCI card, and wireless router?

<br/>
The only way to install FlashMe without using a GBA card is by soldering a parallel port cable between the DS and the PC.

<br/>
the PCI card was like 70$
<br/>
<br/>
i had a router from a while back and same with the PCI card.. becasue to get my computer in my room there is no LAN wire , so we had to use wireless in our house hold also we own laptops, but 2 days ago i bought a DS and saw the video of beup running and i was shocked and happy and impressed...
<br/>
<br/>
but alright , ill go ahead and save up for a flash card , the reason why i cannot buy it online is becasue im 15 and dont own a visa but ill make a deal with my rents and or brother.
