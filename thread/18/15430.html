    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just updated my devkitarm installation to r22. I am now getting "relocation truncated to fit" error messages when linking. The problem is related to some functions that I put in itcm. the linkscripts do not appear to handle .itcm.c* files differently from r21 to r22. I did a little looking a found that the error message is related to jumps being too far. has anyone else run into this problem or better yet, know a solution? I would really like to keep these functions in itcm as it did provide a small boost under r21.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe itcm got moved a bit. Append __attribute((long_call)) to your function prototypes to tell the compiler to use long jumps to those functions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
