    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a working install of VC Studio Express 2005. I have a working install of Devkitpro (installed with the 1.4.2 updater and checked it by 'make-ing' a few DS roms.)
<br/>
<br/>
I can't get the 2 to play together though. I always get an error about the NDS.h not being or the PALIB.h not being found, or something else not working? I have tried the setup instructions on the devkitpro website, but they weren't thorough enough for me. I also tried the wiki on the PALIB site but had some problems that. 
<br/>
<br/>
has anyone got the 2 working together, and if you have, could you give me some pointers? I know some basic C and some high-level web languages and wanted to try my hand at DS coding.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
