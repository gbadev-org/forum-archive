    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was reading earlier about the possible headset port on the front of the DS. This is most likely what its purpose is since the icon next to it shows headphons with a mic. My question is, has anyone tested this? if you attach a mic to those two contacts does it override the built-in microphone?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So the rectange one is for the external mic, the round one is a standard headphone jack.

i've wired my mic into the port (very dodgily i might add) and it seemed to work, but i'm not sure if its because the built-in mic picked up my voice.  gonna test that bit next</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The external mic will probably be an external mic/headset combination.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you telling me that you would rather have an external mic that you have to hold? That would completely defeat the purpose of it. It supposed to be there in case you want to use the microphone in a noisy area. I guessed that a external mic/headset would be made so that since you have a microphone on your head, you might as well put sound output out too...<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It wouldn't be hard to re-wire an existing headset to use a plug that the DS uses for its jack. You'd just need an existing plug/cable to snip and strip first, unless you modeled one yourself.

Unless you had a defective DS like I did that wouldn't disable the speaker when a plug is plugged in, unless you used the GBA SP adaptor. (It was also the only other DS at our EB games that had a dead pixel.. the first one being my brother's.. how's that for coincidence)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the problem is getting the right plug for the mic socket. a bit of pcb would do it, or you could attempt gluing some plastic strips together with the wires on top</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
