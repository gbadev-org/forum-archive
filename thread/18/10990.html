<br/>
<br/>
It's a really good looking airplane game that, in terms of graphics, beats the crap out of most official 3rd-party 3d DS games.
<br/>
(Anyone else notice how bad some of those are looking of late?)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Glad people like the progress so far, most of the credit goes to the guy doing the models, which are great, and really capture the look of the movie.
<br/>
<br/>
At some point there will be a beta version available for everybody, but in the weeks to months away timeframe I'm afraid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ahh so you are the programmer. Well models or not they still have to get in the game etc so good work. I was browsing the cgchat and boom first post I checked was the progress on the game and it looked great. Very inspirational. I think it would be cool to make a nausicaa homebrew game. I got a mockup I did for the GBA but it would be cool to implement 3d elements into it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice Nausicaa screen Twindragon. I wonder why there aren't any Ghibli games (that I'm aware of.) Maybe it's part of Miyazaki's whole keeping kids away from the tv, only watch the movies every few years philosophy. They certainly have every other kind of licensed junk imaginable.
<br/>
<br/>
rmco2003, that's part of the reason I haven't been here pimpin' it. Nothing much works at this point, so it isn't too interesting except for the pretty art.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
