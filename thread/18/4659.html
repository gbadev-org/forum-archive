On a serious note, shouldn't this also include emulator development?  It seems like a reasonable topic to have under the same forum considering that the two often go hand-in-hand, and considering what is so far known about the DS it's probable that we'll get the "Hello World" to show up on a computer mimicking the DS before we ever get it on the native hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea should be to curb the b.s, not to divide and isolate productive, provocative, and informative (as well as <span style="font-style: italic">informed</span>) discussion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks, but I usually drink <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/vcoke.jpg" target="_blank">Vanilla Coke</a>. I still feel appreciated.

I forgot about that. But still, until we crack wireless and/or Game Paks, how are we going to dump anything to emulate?

If we can't get it to show up on the DS hardware as well, then how do we know that the emulator is accurately mimicking the hardware?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Fortunately I held off for the day before responding, since now we can both <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=4667" target="_blank">know the answer to that</a>.

True, I was mostly considering things in a chronological hierarchy and focusing on the fact that flash carts (or chips, as it were) are still much further down the road.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
