    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Long shot here.  Lets say we crack the encryptions, figure out the wireless, a year down the road.  Would it be possible to patch an existing GBA rom, run it in DS mode and substitute the standard wired multiplayer code with the ds wireless code?

<br/>
just curious.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
first the DS uses 802.11 and the wireless for the GBA uses RF signals so that will never happen.
<br/>

As for DS to DS gba wireless multiplay that could be with the right something ?????<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lambi, are you trying to say 802.11b doesn't utilise RF signals to transmit data?  Because that's completely wrong.  How do you think it works, lol?
<br/>
<br/>
What Hoagie is talking about, if you read his post again (specifically the bit where he says "substitute the standard <span style="font-weight: bold">wired </span>multiplayer code with the ds wireless code"), is making patching games that utilise a traditional hardware link cable to use the DS wireless hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
And to answer your question, Hoagie, I don't think it is possible.  Wired and wireless communications are too different for a simple patch to allow a game to use one or the other.  This is why the GBA Wireless Adapter only works with games specifically designed for it.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by PhoenixSoft on Mon Apr 18, 2005 4:24 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Link cable based multiplayer on GB, GBC, and GBA can expect responses within a handful of cycles of initial transmission. This cannot be effectively achieved with 802.11b. There are some types of short range wireless where this might be possible to accomplish, but we have to work with what's provided.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. Trying to tunnel layer 2 of the GBA multiplayer comms protocol would take too long, as layer 2 needs a response within 0.1 ms. GBA packets are much smaller than Wi-Fi packets, and proprietary GBA software expects packet transmissions to complete much faster than the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi hardware can send them out.
