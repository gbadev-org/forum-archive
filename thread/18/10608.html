    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wanted to share this tip since I've been searching for the answer and just found it.   Photoshop will try to interpolate any image you create and will, thus, blend the edges of differrent elements of an image.  This is great for publications and such,  but the outcome if you are trying to create sprites with transparent portions for a game is that you get a mix of unwanted colors on your edges.
<br/>
<br/>
To fix this, in Photoshop, go to the Edit menu -&gt; Preferences then -&gt;General 
<br/>
<br/>
In this screen, go down to Image Interpolation and change the setting to "Nearest Neighbor".       Now when you scale things, rotate, or anything, Photoshop will not try to compensate for the loss in quality and you will maintain sharp jaggy edges.   It may not look as nice, but the result is better than trying to use the Sharpen tool on your edges, I garantee that.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise- the shape tool will still try to anti-alias the edges of shapes you create... you need to use the "Fill Pixels" option when doing this, which is in the top iconic menu that shows up with the shape tool.   Next, uncheck anti-aliasing and you're set to go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
