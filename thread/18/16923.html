    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I saw some topics about 3d the last days, and I decided to learn more about 3d. I asked already somewhere else for a tutorial but they said: look in the examples with opengl. And yes i did, I understand what they do but what they did not explained was about how you can convert models and such stuf. They just have some .bin files whit a nice model in it, but they did not provide any converter. Furthermore I really want to know about poly's and textures, because everyone is talking about that when it's about 3d.
<br/>
 Is there really no good tutorial which cover all the 3d stuff?(I looked at tonc but there was no 3d on the gba so....)
<br/>
<br/>
And really sorry for the english
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You should probably start by looking at basic 3D stuff rather than jumping right in with 3D models (unless your a 3D artist I suppose).
<br/>
<br/>
Try: "Simple_Quad", "Simple_Tri", "Textured_Quad", "Textured_Cube" and the "nehe" tutorials (and web page if your so inclined)
<br/>
<br/>
You may be surprised how much you can do, even if all you know how to do is draw a polygon with a texture on it.  (I'm still on this step and will probably stay here for a while longer)
<br/>
<br/>
Then once you're comfortable with all that and want more complex objects you can start working with 3D models.  The only resource I know of for those is to search this forum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would recommend going through some basic OpenGL tutorials because there are a lot of concepts that still hold true, particularly how rotation, translation and scaling works and the different matrix stacks.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm learning this myself right now, and found that running through an OpenGL tutorial and comparing the functions I saw with the ones available in libnds really helped.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
