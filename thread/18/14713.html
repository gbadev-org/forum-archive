I like the sounds that it can produce like the old NES games but I don't understand how various frequencies, ect. can come together to make those tunes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can set the frequency of a PSG channel, which corresponds to a musical note using a chart like this: <a href="http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html" target="_blank">http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
You can also change the duty cycle of each PSG channel, which I think will just effect the "color" of the note.  You probably just need to play with this to see what sounds good.
<br/>
<br/>
To make an actual song, I would probably look into something like a midi or mod file, and then have a program on the PC translate it into something you can read on the ds, mapping instruments into PSG channels or noise channels with various parameters.
<br/>
<br/>
I've never actually done this, but hopefully this helps a bit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To see how frequencies become musical pitches, see <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_tuning#Tuning_systems" target="_blank">Musical tuning systems</a> on Wikipedia. The most common tuning system for Western music as of the late 20th century and early 21st century is <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament" target="_blank">equal temperament</a>.

You might want to start from the source code for <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/#axe" target="_blank">AXE</a>, a short demo that I used to learn the PSG.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
