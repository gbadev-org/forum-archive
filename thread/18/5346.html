    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be in any way possible for software on a DS to operate with a palm wireless keyboard?
<br/>
<br/>
What about having peripherals like keyboards and storage devices plugging in to the GBA slot?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't plan to do anything with that knowledge... but it's worth knowing :D<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The wireless keyboards are likely to be Bluetooth. Nintendo DS speaks Wi-Fi (though currently only in a proprietary layer 3). Devices supporting only Bluetooth do not interoperate with devices speaking only Wi-Fi.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But if u *did* get a Wi-Fi keyboard and mouse, you would have to program all the drivers and such (propably more networking stuff) into the game itself. 
<br/>
<br/>
So possible (as far as i understand it) but probably not worthwhile.
