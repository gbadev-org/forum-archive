    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to get in to ds programing so I downloaded devkitPro updater, devkitARM, MSYS, libnds, libfat, Programmer's Notepad, and libnds examples.
<br/>
I was told it was the right stuff to download. I'm learning C++ but I was wondering how does it do ds games because the is no color and stuff like that is there somewhere or something where I could learn how to do ds programming specifically.
<br/>
Also how do I use all the things I downloaded.
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">... or look for patater's page or cearn's tonc - although the latter is gba specific, you will learn alot for the nds, too, because a lot of the hardware is and works similar.
<br/>
<br/>
happy learning! :^)
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i hope you have brought a (really) big amount of the mysterious thing called "time" with you into (nds) programming land, because patience is what you will need on your programming learning journey the most! so be patient and work hard, so your wish of becoming a programmer will become true in the end. i'm a bad poet. feel free to ask when there's trouble with the hw or tools or whatever. :^)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by silent_code on Thu Apr 03, 2008 1:20 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">take alook at the nds samples. try to compile them. then try to modify them. it really depends on what your goals are. are you trying to learn C/C++ programming? if so then download a free dev enviroment like Microsoft Visual C++ express - and come back to the DS when you know some of the basics. If you are already know C/C++ then try the examples or try starting a new project from the templates provided with libnds. To start off, try the arm9 only template. When you get to a point where you know why would need to build for the arm7 then take another look but just ignore it for now. search for other projects hat have source included and take a look at it. Try to have a specifc goal - you must have a reason why you want to look at this in the first place?

have fun.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
