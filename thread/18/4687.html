Now I'm not a very great coder in graphical stuff, so I'm wondering of by any chance later it will be possible to anti-alias stuff. Cause that would sure make things a lot prettier. But will this be possible, and more important, do you think it will slow stuff down too much?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The screenshot you are showing is....extremely ugly, but then again: it's EA, what did you expect :p. What a DS could use (and I don't understand why nintendo didn't include this) is a form of texture filtering, because the pixelated textures do stand out sometimes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree with telamon.  It's probably a hardware limit, or at least only possible to do 2x on more simple scenes than those found in SM64DS unless done in software.
<br/>
<br/>
But in the case of software, it would cause massive CPU drain because you would have to either:
<br/>
<br/>
draw everything in software
<br/>
<br/>
or
<br/>
<br/>
draw landscape (ground, hills) in the far distance w/ hardware, copy to a buffer, copy everything in the not-so-far distance to another buffer w/hardware, blend the two together, moving closer and closer.  Then, doing the same thing with scenery (flowers, trees, clouds) but over top of the landscape.  Then, finally doing the same thing with objects and characters, but over top of everything else done so far.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a very efficient programmer, and as a result have an uncanny knack to think of the most CPU wasteful ways of doing things, so keep in mind these are just the two ways I can think of making better looking scenes.
<br/>
<br/>
Er, just thought of another way, dunno if it's possible.  Render the scene 4x the size (2x wider and 2x taller) into a buffer, then using a smart software scale shrink it down to the regular screen size.  I call this Matt's 4x Non-De-Anti-Aliasing.  But if someone has already thought of and created this method, then whatever they called it is the real name... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you mean the tree, that's not an AA problem, that's a texture issue.  The DS really, REALLY, needed better HW texture support.  You'd think with 4MB of memory they could've done better (don't know if that 4MB is accessible to the video, though... the video, as I know it, has some weird number like 656 KB).  Still, just some bilinear filtering would have been nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's almost always been the case that early games don't look as good as games made a year or two after a system's release, so we'll have to wait and see!  Or crack the DS wireless and send some homebrew demos showing off what the DS is capable of, and use that to gauge how good games COULD look.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think the DS does super-sampling AA, because only actual polygon edges appear smoothed in the screenshots I've seen - if it was doing FSAA then alpha-test borders would also be smoothed and so would the boundaries between texels.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest visual improvements will come from games tailored to the systems strengths:
<br/>
<ul><li>Noisy, high-contrast textures look ugly
<br/>
</li><li>Low-contrast textures look ok
<br/>
</li><li>Textures containing bold, simple features look ok
<br/>
</li><li>Smooth-shading looks good</li></ul>
<br/>
Basically, the system appears to heavily favour the Nintendo style. Games going for photorealistic visuals are going to look inferior IMHO.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This tiger woods screencapture has been *scaled up*, unless somebody out there has a special DS with a 460x345 resolution. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
So there's not much you can glean from this. Any image that's scaled up (especially to a weird size) will get pretty mangled at a pixel level, and some graphics tools do a really awful job at this. It's certainly going to look more "pixelish" and any AA that was there originally is impossible to distinguish from the scaling side effects.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a clue how they get these screen captures? Is it likely that the DS dev hardware has a a screen capture capability, or is it more likely that it's off of a Nintendo-made emulator? The differences in gamma alone could lead to some misleading artifacts if you're adjusting the levels for release to the press, especially with "noisy" textures.

which gap?  the technology gap or the price gap?  Personally, I'm quite happy with the capabilities of the DS considering how much more powerful it is than the GBA SP that I purchased a little over a year and a half ago.
<br/>
<br/>
The PSP looks neat, but the price is what's turning me away.  Until the PSP can run homebrew code, I'll probably continue to stay away.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not that I'm calling you a liar, because it seems you know what you're talking about, but how do you explain the fact that if you zoom in on Mario 64 and look closely you can see anti-aliased edges?  Go onto the main bridge in front of the castle, and zoom in so that the cement handrail covers half the screen.

Maybe THIS AA is some subpixel trickery instead of being a true AA?
<br/>
<br/>
That sounds silly :) What I mean is that instead of working out per pixel how to AA a line, it instead has a special mode that, for lack of a better programming term, was called AA, but instead of doing a per pixel calculation display, it has a mode where each pixel in a group is treated as an individual pixel.

I am however calling you a liar, since the Nintendo DS can do antialiasing(note, I have no idea if it's hardware or software, but from what I've seen it should be hardware). Antialiasing is not a programming term, it's a technique used to anti the aliasing (weiii), which the DS does feature(just take a look at Mario 64 DS). Sure, it's probably to slow to handle FSAA, but some kind of AA is in that can o' gaming.
<br/>
And we where never talking about any texture filtering here, which the DS does not feature(atleast not from what I've seen, and if it does, it would be really weird that no one uses it(although you could perhaps fake it somehow))</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't see how the DS can do FS AA of any kind. To do that you would need a frame buffer.
<br/>
<br/>
It might be possible for it to do AA on triangle edges, but somehow I doubt it. To do so, the hardware would have to sort/rasterize triangles back to front. Since there appears to be no full framebuffer (and therefure no full z-buffer), chances are the 3D core scanline-intersects all the triangles for that frame, draws all triangles appearing on scanline 0, then 1, then 2, etc, using a small z-buffer of height 1 (almost equivalent to how PowerVR and similar hardware do it). Using any z-buffer means no depth sorting needs to takes place, which makes AA on triangle lines impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
And obviously, no texture filtering of any kind.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd have to go with sub-pixel trickery to get some sort of pseudo-AA on triangle edges. Either that or rendering doesn't use any z-buffer at all, which means back-to-front sorting is needed regardless of AA, and in this case AA would be a freebie.<br/>_________________<br/>outRider</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

either that, or i'm thinking, going by DrEggMan, that LODs are being used
<br/>
"For example, imagine you are building a small town. You create a park with some benches and a path. Off in the distance, there is a house. When you are in the park, the house looks like a tiny box. You can limit the detail of the house, perhaps by just using a primitive cube for it. But what happens when you move towards the house? Eventually, the house will fill the screen. Now it is obvious that it is only a simple cube.
<br/>
<br/>
This is where the Levels of Detail (or LOD) feature helps. A Levels of Detail object (or group) contains different versions of the same object, from simple to complex
<br/>
Let's return to our example above. You can create a simple cube to represent the house at a distance. For a closer view, you can create another house with some simple windows and doors. And for the close-up version, you can add as much detail as you want: window sills, awnings, brick walls, and so on. You can create as many LODs as you want. If you then group these LODs together, the various LODs will automatically be revealed as you move towards and away from the object. So, when the object is far away, the simplicity of it will improve performance during navigation. When the object is close, you will see all the detail built into the object."

No, you're completly right. LODs only (atleast usually, they might have to do with textures and other stuff too, but almost never AA) have to do with the polygon count of models.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hopefully this is a feature that future games can make better use of. But it still seems pretty pointless, as it's the lack of bilinear texture filtering that's giving DS games the nasty PS1-like look. Which is a shame, as it makes Mario 64 look significantly worse than the N64 version :(

Super Mario 64 DS does use antialiasing(and I think Metroid, but I'm not sure of that, haven't looked). And the antialiasing we are speaking of does not have anything to do with texture filtering.

<br/>
<br/>
DOES the DS have 3D hardware at all or is the previous comment about the ARM9 doing all the rendering in software true?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't recall ever reading anything stating it DOES have 3D hardware, just a quote of how many polygons the DS should be able to push.
<br/>
<br/>
Seeing as the GBA could do basic 3D in software it might be possible the vastly superior ARPM9 could handle 3D graphics this well.  However as im no programmer I have no realistic idea if this is possible or not.
<br/>
<br/>
It has been said though that the DS is more powerful at 3D than the GP32 BECAUSE it has 3D hardware, so again - does it or does it not?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

Pardon me mister expert. Can you explain to all the people what antialiasing consists of?? Nooo? Well, I'll tell you. In a very ROUGH way AA consists on rendering the scene at a higher resolution and then scaling it back to the native resolution. Of course nowadays this tecnique is performed in very different ways because it needs lots of optimizations for not being so heavy. 
<br/>
To do this calculations graphic cards have very specialized hardware capable of doing texture scaling operations at incredible speed. 
<br/>
DS has no graphics specialized hardware, only a few registers and operations in the ARM9 maybe. 
<br/>
Nintendo64 had AA. DS hasnt. Call it whatever, but I assure you DS can't do AA, and if it can its because Nintendo has lied about the hardware (which I doubt). Of course there are other techniques besides AA to soften hard edges...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS has perspective correct texturing. Something which is not easy to do on quickly and accurately on an ARM chip without a divide instruction. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just from playing and observing Mario64 DS, observing the gouraud shading, mostly-accurate z-sorting, perspective correct texturing, accurate clipping, edge antialiasing, and translucency, I think there's definitely some graphics hardware at work. 
<br/>
<br/>
If it's a software renderer, it'd have to be rather l33t to do all that at a good speed, with the all game code running  on the same CPU</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Supersampling (what you describe) is only one way to do antialiasing; there are many others, and they can all create a good final image.
<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways hardware like the DS could do polygon edge antialiasing, especially if it has a one-line buffer as has been suggested. If it was fairly simple - for example, an extra pass only on pixels where  a near-vertical (the most noticable aliasing) edge occured - it could be done with only a slight performance drop.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying it does do antialiasing, just that there are methods that could be used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, if there's some specialized 3d hardware I cant see it anywhere. Yes, its true that there are other ways of doing AA but its ridiculous. With the size and resolution of the screens who wants AA there. My OPINION is that theres no AA, the image is simply too small to have hard edges. Its like doing AA on a 320X240 image... its pointless. Its true that  DS seems to make some sort of texture correction but that's as far as I can tell. And yes its impressive if it's doing that on an ARM9 only. Maybe Nintendo figured out a way to make a very optimized 3d software engine for the ARM9 platform.

in fact if you closely enough at any high contrast textures you can see how poor the perspective correct texture mapper is - it must use 32bit fixed point for it to lose precision so quickly. In fact at certain angles the whole illusion falls apart and the texturing becomes very "watery"!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. From the leaked register map, it's almost certain that there is hardware based 3d.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Anti-aliasing by rendering a larger picture and scaling it back with oversampling is only one way to achieve AA, called FSAA (full screen anti-aliasing). It costs lots of memory and bandwidth, however there are other ways to achieve AA, even if the result is less pretty.
<br/>
<br/>
3. The outstanding pixelisation problems that can be seen in DS games come from the fact that there is no bilinear filtering. Bilinear filtering does more for the rendering quality than AA.
<br/>
<br/>
4. I'm pretty sure that the DS does AA. Perhaps they could do a limited form of AA easily and without complicating the hardware too much because of the way they seem to render polygons (line-by-line, on the fly, as it is rumored). Otherwise I don't think they'd have done it, it's kind of a waste to spend resources on doing that when you don't even have bilinear filtering.
<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting fact  that would tend to point toward hardware based 3d is an article, in an old issue of edge (perhaps one year or two ago, don't remember). It was an interview of a guy from ARM, where he explained that it was them who designed the GBA's hardware, and they were working on a very low power consumption, low transistor count 3d chip for nintendo, that could fit in a portable system.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It seems that when the DS does AA, it's only on polygon edges.

Try to approach a gate, but don't open it. It's easy to see on a closed gate because there's usually a good contrast between the light blue of the gate and the dark wall.

Look at the top edge of the gate. Turn slightly, so it's not perfectly horizontal.

Thinking about it a bit more, it does have one good use - for small, detailed models with subtle animation, such as Mario himself - to hide the low resolution of the screen a bit.

I believe part of the POINT with LCDs is that they ARE accurate, extremely clear indeed.  This is in fact why even though the DS is a small screen its still VERY  easy to pick out the pixels.  Nintendo seem to think we are all blind.  The ONLY way we wouldnt have seen them so easily is if the DS had used MUCH higher resolution screens at the same physical size, in other words a MUCH smaller dot pitch.

The best example being on a PC.  You stick your monitor in a resolution so high you would have trouble reading the text.  Now run a game in that resolution.  The pixels are so small, AA is not really necessary.

The fact is the Nintendo rubbish that texture filtering isnt needed is just that, pure bull crap.  Unless you are using stupidly hires textures you will ALWAYS need some level of filtering, its just too damn easy to see the crappy textures especially on Metroid.   Its true that its not essential, but its going to be the thing that pushes some people to the PSP.  Some people are shallow creatures who just couldnt handle the idea of buying a console that has big blocky textures.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

Where there is no AA (high contrast edges within textures, polygon edges that are not antialiased), you can perfectly distinguish the pixels. There is no blurring effect due to the LCD.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Folks, polygon edge AA isn't trivial. Even your bleeding edge Geforce 6800s and Radeon X800s won't do edge AA. Instead, they've preferred FSAA, which eats up fillrate like there's no tomorrow. Think about it, edge AA is expensive, so expensive that cutting edge consumer 3D hardware would rather process the entire framebuffer at 4x the resolution than deal with pixel-thin triangle edges, because at the end of the day it's still a lot cheaper.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason is simple. To do edge AA you have to render each and every triangle back-to-front. Sorting every single triangle back-to-front every single frame is expensive. Not only that, but drawing everything back to front eats up fillrate for nothing, since you're potentially drawing over every pixel many many times. Not to mention that the hardware is probably already testing every triangle against every scanline, and that amounts to an impossible amount of sorting per frame.
<br/>
<br/>
Further more, every single triangle edge would have to be drawn with alpha blending enabled, eating up even more fillrate.
<br/>
<br/>
Forget about bilinear filtering, it would be braindead for Nintendo to build a machine that does edge AA period.

The PowerVR chips actually did something closer to FSAA, not edge AA. To anti-alias triangle edges you have to blend them with what's behind, so what's behind has to either already be in the framebuffer (back-to-front), or your framebuffer has to support destination alpha (front-to-back AA is possibly with this), but either way your triangles have to be sorted per frame. Cards as far back as Voodoo2 supported edge anti-aliasing, but you had to provide sorted triangles per frame yourself (using the CPU).
<br/>
<br/>
PowerVR's tile method is similar to what the DS (supposedly) uses. At that point in time a fullscreen zbuffer was unheard of, it was expensive and memory latency was still high. The PVR cards didn't have a fullscreen zbuffer, instead they had a tile-sized zbuffer, and the framebuffer was divided into tiles. All triangles intersecting the first tile were drawn with zbuffering enabled, then all triangles intersecting the 2nd, and so on. Using a zbuffer for HSR frees you from having to sort triangles, which you should avoid like the plague. Using a small zbuffer overcame the high latency of zbuffering at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Once a tile was drawn it was copied to the framebuffer. A 32x32 tile might represented a 16x16 area of the framebuffer, so the tile would be scaled down via bilinear or bicubic enterpolation, which basically amounts to FSAA via supersampling done tile by tile.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS probably uses the same approach on a scanline level, without the final framebuffer, or any filtering.<br/>_________________<br/>outRider</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have perfectly sorted polygons/spans, edge AA is fairly trivial. This may suit the DS nicely, if the speculation about framebufferless rendering and polys-per-line limits is true - if there's no z-buffer, the polygons are being sorted in some other way, and if they're sorted, adding edge AA is quite easy.

If the DS doesn't have a framebuffer, then it might be drawing scanlines with a linked list structure.

I remember implementing edge-based sprite rendering in an engine I was working on once (16bit, with all the blitting was done with memcpy). I did it like this: when constructing my scanline lists, I'd 'overdraw' each scan by one pixel to the right. Then I would 'mix' the first pixel of the next scan with the overdrawn pixel, and finally memcpy the rest of the scan as normal. After optimizing the blending as much as I could, rendering an entire frame took around 5-10% longer than it would take without the blending.
<br/>

My *guess* is that the DS rasterizer may have been designed as an extension of the GBA sprite hardware - and spans of polys are handled in a very similar way to how the GBA handled rotated/scaled sprites - this would explain any polys/scanline limit that may exist.
<br/>
<br/>
This would need a lot of setup per scanline, which would probably need doing in hardware, but maybe could done on one of the CPUs, with an awful lot of hblank DMA?

These methods (that I saw called span buffer or edge lists) works well for software rendering. IIRC, that's the method the first quake was using.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I think there is some sort of z-buffering: I had a bug once in asphalt GT where a car I collided into got stuck halfway through the road, and intersected properly with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Come to think about it, the antialiasing (that I'm still convinced is in, regardless of how silly it may sound) seems to be a bit applied on a random basis. It could very well mean that they simply don't sort the polygons, and thus depending on the drawing order, some polygons would exhibit antialiased edges, and for others, the antialiasing would be overwritten by the background polygon if it's draw afterward (which would mean they anti-aliasing impementation would add pixels at the border to perform the AA, but would not write these in the z-buffer)
<br/>
<br/>
For those who have feel the magic, try launching the yacht minigame. Pause the game, so you're sure that you don't mistake movement and remanence of the LCD for AA. Pay attention to the edge between the sail and the pole (unpause and blow slightly to turn the sail around, if needed). The sail is white, the pole is black, and that edge is slightly slopped.
<br/>
You should distinguish the aliasing effect clearly along that edge, but you don't.
<br/>
<br/>
For reference, look at the girl in the story mode game selection menu: there is no AA there, and the edge of her arms and legs against the orange background are clearly pixelated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Whatever. I've pointed at places where edges are smooth, others where they aren't. The later proves that despite the screen size, the individual pixels can still be distinguished (well, maybe it depends on the person. I'm short sighted and I see tiny thing very clearly from close up). CPU cycles have nothing to do with it if it's rasterized by the hard, and I doubt it's software rendering.

I'm quite familiar with LCD screens, having written a sub-pixel font renderer for the GBA, and this doesn't look like an effect that would be caused by something as simple as the sub-pixel order or anything like that. Also, it remains even when the scene is stationary.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
It's quite visible, as I've said, on most of the edges in this scene, but oddly, the stone area right below this (if you look down over the edge) clearly has absolutely no smoothing; the edge is as jagged as can be.

Yep, some edges are smoothed and others aren't, heh.  And when they aren't they really stand out from the smoothed edges.
<br/>
<br/>
Another example is in the octangonal room (with the aquariums) you can reach from the main interior castle area...there are polygonal, non-textured, and alpha'd light beams coming out of the tanks.  These edges are clearly not smoothed at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Sort of off-topic, but related to alpha blended triangles, etc.  They would need to be sorted back-to-front ...and rendered back-to-front...in order to work correctly.  I'm not entirely sure that they are doing this sorting though, at least not in all cases.   Note, this really only applies to rendering alpha'd triangles against each other.
<br/>
<br/>
An example is in Lethal Lava Land.  Just to the left of the player start is a small island with an alpha'd faceted globe where the star will appear when you've completed the red coin part.  If you go to this island and look around, you'll typically see lava bubbles (placed as decals on the lava surface) drawing over top of the globe.

In case there was any question, Metroid also has smoothing that operates in a similar quirky manner.  The wireframe lines someone mentioned earlier don't seem to be AA'd, but the edges of most (all?) models are.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Quite frankly, I don't see why the developers wouldn't apply it to all edges if it was available. The fact that it isn't applied to all edges, and that it appears to be applied at random (not strictly on near-horizontal or near-vertical) suggests that it's a side effect or some fortunate but uncontrollable process. To be honest with you, unless it was free I'd rather have it completely off and spend resources elsewhere than have some edges (that might not even be selectable) blended and some not, since it's barely noticeable and overshadowed by the lack of texture filtering, which affects a lot more pixels than triangle edges ever would.<br/>_________________<br/>outRider</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It absolutely is AA in the <span style="font-style: italic">true sense of the technique</span>. Antialiasing describes <span style="font-weight: bold">any</span> technique for eliminating the visual aliasing caused by low sampling of an image. Whether it fits in with your idea of edge AA or full screen AA doesn't matter one bit. By your definition, the tile method used by the Dreamcast somehow isn't "proper" AA either, regardless of whether it produced a scene with less aliasing.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand why'd you'd even try to argue that this isn't "real" AA somehow; it's purely semantics. As far as why developers would use it - at this point, we don't know - it may be a hardware feature that is essentially "free". I agree that texture filtering would be a better feature to have than edge antialiasing, but as one is apparently available and the other is not, I don't really see the point of bringing it up.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
All I'm really trying to say is that just because a method for AA isn't the one you know doesn't make it any less valid. Also, this is in no way "sub pixel trickery", at least in so much as relates to the color sub-pixels of the LCD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have any information that suggests that this AA is intentional and not some side effect of other processes, then please volunteer said information. Otherwise I'll stick to my opinion, thanks.

And I've already mentioned PowerVR's rendering method as equivalent to FSAA via supersampling. Please don't put words in my mouth.

And the point of bringing up texture filtering is that it's cheaper than edge AA. It makes it hard for me to believe that what you purport to be edge AA on the DS is possible, considering texture filtering is cheaper and easier, yet unsupported.

I fully grant that using traditional methods, antialiasing would be far too expensive, but in motion this is clearly more than just a by product - also, I can't think of any rendering process that could be reasonably capable of producting this result unintentionally, and I've personally written both span-based polygon engines and voxel engines. I'm not saying that it can't be so, just that, to me, this clearly looks like intentional antialiasing.

That's the point, it might not be a typical rendering process: flicker and softening filters. Consoles use them, and since it is on the video signal output, it's not visible on a straight screen capture (I can't reproduce it on my Xbox with a framebuffer dump), it definitely blurs (some) contrasting edges, giving them a softer look. Considering there is no framebuffer on a DS, if screen captures come from the video signal any manipulation of that signal should be visible on the capture.
<br/>
<br/>

I really don't want to argue about it any more, but the edges which show smoothing really look like they were antialiased in a very standard way - they appear almost exactly as I'd expect from a supersampled or multisampled image. Note that I'm not suggesting that the DS is doing it either way, I'm just saying that if you actually look at the result on a DS and compare it to more standard antialias methods, the result is pretty much identical.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which also rules out any sort of FSAA as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Typical edge AA requires sorting per triangle per frame. That's orders of magnitude more expensive than extra memory reads. Not only that, but only silhuette edges can be antialiased, otherwise the scene will have cracks everywhere. Silhuette edge identification is expensive. I really can't imagine that the 3D core not only sorts triangles, but also identifies silhuette edges, every single frame. You have to remember that this is a handheld consumer device. If even your high end 3D hardware won't do it, is it reasonable to think that a DS, or even a PSP would do edge AA?
<br/>

Your right, though it doesn't provide a perfectly sorted set but at the time it was cheaper than a having an associated zbuffer with the framebuffer. But if the DS uses a scanline zbuffer I don't see why they would want sorting as well. Having a small zbuffer with low latency memory would certainly work out to be much faster than computing average z per triangle for the purposes of depth sorting. I recall someone mentioning running into a wall in a game and observing correctly intersecting pixels, which suggests a zbuffer. Having perfect depth sorting via a zbuffer, is it really reasonable to assume that they would then add hardware sorting and silhouette detection just to get edge AA on probably less than 5% of the pixels on the screen?

Toon shading isn't usually done with silhouette edge detection as such. Instead all backfacing triangles are drawn (switch the culling mode from CCW to CW or vice versa) in wireframe mode with thick lines, but thanks to the zbuffer nothing but the silhouette edge reaches the framebuffer. Identifying silhouette edges involves finding all edges shared by both a front-facing and back-facing triangle. It's even more expensive than z sorting.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, this is a sub $200 machine, with 2 screens, one being touch, and a wifi radio. Can they really afford to have a GPU that has a zbuffer, scanline intersects and z sorts triangles, and determines silhouette edges? I have no explanations for the pics posted previously, nor can I be sure that they are raw frame grabs, but in my honest opinion I seriously doubt that this machine as any sort of hardware support for any of the above. I'm much more inclined to believe that it's some other trick, such as jittering the scanlines, or some anomaly or side effect.<br/>_________________<br/>outRider</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The way I know is almost similar to what he said, except instead of rendering in wireframe with thick lines, you render the backfaces of a shell (same model with vertices displaced along normals, can easily be precalculated) as polygons filled with an uniform color .
<br/>
<br/>
There's a least a game on PS1 that did toon shading, with silhouettes.

<br/>
I don't know how they did implement the AA. I didn't find anything of note regarding how they pulled it off regarding polygon order. I just know it's there.

The 3d hardware of the DS is very unusual. It's seems it's been the product of out-of-box thinking, and that they have pulled some clever cheap way to do AA doesn't sounds too far fetched.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The N64 supported multi-texturing? I didn't know that.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems that Nintendo designs it's 3D hardware around the fact that many of it's games will get an extra boost by not using textures on 3D models but instead pure colors. Even on the Gamecube, it's clear that models don't use textures unless it's needed. Of course, 3rd party games go texture crazy, with textures everywhere they can be. Unfortunately, they end up looking bland and are often compressed beyond all belief. 
<br/>
<br/>
Multi-texturing would be a nice effect on the DS, but with no filtering, I'm afraid the effect will decrease its quality instead of inceasing it.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, I should clarify that more. In NINTENDO's first party games, that's the case. For example, Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend of Zelda: WW, Pikmin, Mario Power Tennis, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
2nd party games use more textures in their games, but not too much, like Star Fox Adventures, Metroid Prime 1 &amp; 2, Eternal Darkness...
<br/>
<br/>
With 3rd party games, it's obvious that texture compression has lessened the quality in GCN games. It's especially easy to see when watching a CGI FMV on the Cube. For example, SSX Tricky's intro movie looks much cleaner on the PS2 than the GCN. 
<br/>
<br/>
Take all these facts and apply them to the current situation: Super Mario 64 DS. Mario himself is only barely textured (probably the M on his cap is, nothing else) and the world around him seems to have more straightforward color. It's easy to notice if you go look at the Mario model in SSBM.
<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the 3rd party 3D games on the DS, Madden and Tiger Woods. Again, texture heavy, but they look weird because the system isn't a texture pumping machine... :(<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i know some people have said that the DS can't support a high level of AA, but when someone can hack the DS via the wi-fi or posible some other means (ds or gba ports) there is bound to be some minor altering of the DS's default programs: like picochat, and the main menu system. (i know i would like to see the warning screen removed, and have there be a way to get back to the main menu without turning the thing off first; but that it not really relevant at the moment) so, when someone does get the hacking down, eventually, wouldn't it be posible to add a bit of code, or program, that would OC the DS's cpu(s) or gpu clock speeds or memory? (sort of like on a computer, but i don't really know how simpliar the DS is to a modern computer, besides in preformance) for example, the cpu on my pda is a Xscale processor, it runs at about 400mhz, BUT the intel web site says it can run up to 1000mhz, only problem is battery life goes to hell. all i'm saying is would this be posible, OC the DS to get more power, and then add some more powerful AA code (thats if its software based) without loosing much due to the OC. just an idea. don't know about heat though...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
