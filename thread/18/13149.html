    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">... or WiDD for short. As this was discussed earlier, it`s a lib that provides interface for accessing data on your PC directly. Basically it feels, looks and acts like mounting your harddrive on a DS as a fat storage device.
<br/>
<br/>
Features:
<br/>
<ul><li>Uses devoptab 
<br/>
</li><li>Standard I/O functions supported
<br/>
</li><li>Directory listing supported
<br/>
</li><li>Easy to use
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>

Any comments are appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Really cool. One feature that I'd like (this might be a bit tricky though) is SMB-support for "seamless" integration with existing systems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. This library operates at the file system level. DLDI operates at a lower level, that of sectors on a block device. A DLDI for iSCSI probably wouldn't be practical for these reasons: <ol type="1"><li>Few people know how to run an iSCSI server. </li><li>The disk exposed by the iSCSI server would need to be either a dedicated volume (which is expensive unless it's a USB drive), a dedicated partition (which few people know how to create) or a disk image (which Windows cannot open without third-party software such as Daemon Tools). </li><li>Libfat with DLDI runs on the ARM9. Anything involving Wi-Fi needs the ARM7's cooperation, which would require recompiling existing apps, which is exactly what DLDI was designed to get away from. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
