Enormous efforts went into finding a way to bypass the encryption, and the current way of doing things still requires additional hardware to allow us to run unsigned code.

If you have the official tools, on the other hand, you'd be the messiah of this entire community if you told us what the private RSA key was. ;)

This forum is specifically for unofficial developers. By asking such questions on this forum you are jepodising unofficial development (as you appear to know giving your .sig of "please don't ask...I'd only have to kill you when I've told you!").<br/>_________________<br/>---
