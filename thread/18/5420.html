    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a video that was taken from E3 that proves Nintendo DS can successfully render 3D on both screens. I have no space to upload it, but I can e-mail it to people who are curious to see.

It's Pac'n'Roll, and there is a 3D Pac-Man on the bottom screen, and a 3D game board on the top screen. The frame rate looks just fine too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm really tired of people saying it's not possible, so if I can supply some hard evidence suggesting otherwise... Why the heck not?

<br/>
Besides, it's an interesting video.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
