    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sometimes I get a freeze for two seconds after I close an emulator, but that's it. It happens in multiple emulators, including some emulators that I use for NES development, so I don't think it's especially Martin Korth's fault.
<br/>
<br/>
Emulation of a system with two ARM CPUs and two GBA video chips takes a lot of CPU time. Perhaps NO$GBA has caused the other programs on your system to fall behind, and the animated advertisements on some pages that you're looking at in Firefox need time to catch up. But then I use an <a class="postlink" href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/" target="_blank">extension that manages a whitelist for SWF</a> in Firefox, so I don't notice it as much.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whether or not this will help in your circumstance, I looked up "csrss.exe" on Google, and I've seen 2 suggestions about what to do if it starts taking up 100% CPU (or 50%/50% for HT/DualCore CPUS, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
1) Your Windows profile is corrupt, and you have to delete/recreate a new one.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Your Power Management setting is set to something other than "Always On".
<br/>
<br/>
Just google it, and follow the instructions, o you don't make a mistake.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
