    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sort of new to coding on the DS and using C++ in general. I've been successful in printing text and taking stylus movements, thats about it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now i'm experimenting with fetching stuff from servers. Not anything on the webbrowser scale, but enough so I can perhaps fetch a daily message/quote from a text file on my server?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My problem is: Right now, I'm storing the data like so:
<br/>
char buffer[2048];
<br/>
<br/>
This is not holding  the contents of the file. So my question is, what is the best datatype to hold fetched data in? 
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I'm using PAlib, so when I use GetHTTP, the buffer needs to be a 'char'. I'm wondering if theres a way to receive part of the file at once, store it in a string/something else, then fetch the rest of the file?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'd advise you better get to know the hardware a bit better (as well as the language), if you're new to it, before trying to do funky wifi stuff. ;^) also, taking a look at the sources of programs like less/more could help, as these should be able to display remote files. but again, if that helps depends on your understanding of c/c++ and data structures in general.
<br/>
<br/>
happy coding!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
