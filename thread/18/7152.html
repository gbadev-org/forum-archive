I mean, if there's people trying to write a tcp/ip stack, they must at least be able to talk to the 802.11b-chip... so, where's that info?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Therefor the answer is:

No there are no (public) known methods to use the wifi hardware<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
802.11b is just a reference for the spec of wifi (original revision) in the 2.4GHZ band (IIRC). The freqencies for channels and IIRC protocals for wireless headers and stuff.
<br/>
The hardware could use a completley different frequency (and so not be 802.11b standard) but still be wireless.
<br/>
Wifi isn't 802.11b + tci/ip it's just an acronym of Wireless Fidelity.
<br/>
What are you actually after?
<br/>
The registers that control the wireless hardware in the DS?
<br/>
These aren't published yet, but will be when sgstair is done.
<br/>
<br/>
"That guy" (Sgstair, he deserves the respect of a name) has had to find out these registers and is now writing his own stack. He'll publish the libraries/source/docs when he's done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, yes... I'm after those. Sgstair is taking too long to port a tcp/ip stack. I've already ported IwIP for arm, but with a known 802.11b chip, in a custom project. I just wanted to see some action, but since he's keeping his "discoveries", everyone else has to do the same job he's doing to get something working...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

:o
<br/>
... I guess then this kind of things are not always that good for the community... Someone else might have been able to write a tcp/ip stack before if we all share the info.
<br/>
I don't know sgstair, but I think he knows what he's doing...
<br/>
It's just that it didn't took me more than a week to "port" IwIP, the hardest thing was to write the 802.11b driver, but once you know which chip you're talking to, it's quite easy :-)... so with the DS, the hardest problem is to know how it communicates with the wifi chip, but if sgstair has all the things he says at site at 100%, that should be already been done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Personally, I think as long as it gets done and done well, then I don't mind waiting.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps when he releases everything you can make a better version based on his register definitions?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

   How do you mean? These bounties/contests (like the neoflash competition) are actually motivators for homebrew developers. If there was no wifi bounty it is possible that sgstair wouldn't have even bothered cracking the wifi at all. Not only that but the full source code, libs and docs are going to be released when hes finished. Without the bounty the person that got the wifi working may have keep the code closed and forced us to only use their apps. 
<br/>
<br/>
These  "kind of things" also introduce some competition into the scene. If you think hes taking too long, then feel free to try to code it yourself. I would like the wifi libraries as much as the next guy, but I realize that sgstair is working hard and it will be done soon, no need to get impatient.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I mean that some times it can make people greedy for the bounty, and slow down the process. For instance, if sgstair releases all the info he has managed to get so far, we could all work on the wifi project and get it done really fast... Else, we all have to do "in secret" the same kind of investigation, because there's a posibility that someone else might steal what I've done so far and get the bounty first... I mean, c'mon!, we're not here for money, we're here for fun... anyway...
<br/>
Let's hope he can have the code ready soon and enjoy wifi on our DS :-P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
