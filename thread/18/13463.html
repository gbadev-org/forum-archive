    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking at developing for the DS as a hobby. So far I have seen the PALib which looks like it does most if not all of the low level work for me however it feels like I am cheating a bit. While I know I will still use PALib despite what is said here, I would like to know what I am missing out and opinions on using PALib over doing it yourself or visa versa.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apart from the code, I think it's the experience of working with the hardware's APIs that is most of the fun. Discovering how the 2D/3D engine works, how to use interrupts, manage memory and stuff like that. Sometimes it can be a pain, but it's mostly a lot of fun discovering the hardware that's been sold a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS#Marketing_and_sales" target="_blank">silly 40 million times</a>.

<br/>
It's really about whether you just want your software to run on the DS or want to familiarize yourself with the toy itself.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's the thing, I did some minor GBA work years ago (nothing special, it was purely graphical) when I was still relatively new to programming and the GBA hardware, and I remember it being immensely fun.
<br/>
<br/>
I may end up doing both, doing small programs directly on the hardware and 'larger' programs using PALib.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally, I see most of the "satisfaction" when the game/app actually runs on the DS.. so the quicker I see that, the "happier" I am.  Now, PAlib hinders that satisfaction when you are trying to get something to work, and PAlib is the reason it won't.  So, I suggest using PAlib until you are familure with the hardware so that you don't need it anymore.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
