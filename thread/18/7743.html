    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'll start off with the background. I dont know C++, but I wanted to program for the NDS. I program well in Java so I purchased JET, and converted my script to C++. Know I am confused. I need to run my program on my DS but I dont know how. I get errors. My program is rather large, its a webbrowser. I made a HTML loader in java, and created a decent page viewer (I am not artistic). Now the problem may be as to how I am accessing the NDS's Wi-FI "port/s". Can any one please help, I would love to finish my program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no real usable WiFi/Network support libs for NDS devs yet. Also, you'll have to convert your code to load files in a different way (maybe using the GBA/DS CF FAT libs), display graphics using the NDS libs and many other things. If porting was a case of dropping it into the DS DevKit and hitting compile you'd see a lot more coming out here  :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
