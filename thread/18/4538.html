    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone have a DS EXT2 pinout?  EXT2 is what the power and headphone plugs can go into.  Yes, I have Googled and done a forum search already.  I came across a broken link to a diagram, but that's all I found.  Surely there must be an EXT2 diagram floating around somewhere; hell, we even have iQue cartridge pinouts!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here it is for all interested:

GBA: Stereo Sound Connector (3.5mm, female)

GBA: Power Supply Input
<br/>
The GBA does not have a separate power supply input, however external power supplies can be connected to the battery socket. The recommended external voltage is 3.3V DC.
<br/>
<br/>
GBA SP: EXT.2 Socket (Power Supply and Headphones)
<br/>
  Pin     Expl.                   ___________
<br/>
  A       PWR(-) GND             | X  ___  Y |
<br/>
  D       PWR(+) 5.2V DC         | ---   --- |

<br/>
  X,Y,B,C Headphones ???              \_/
<br/>
<br/>
 
<br/>
<br/>
External power input is used to charge the built-in battery, it cannot be used to run the SP without that battery. The switch in the middle between X and Y pins is probably used to disable the internal speaker when headphones are connected... or to sense the external power supply ???
<br/>
<br/>
Using PC +5V DC as Power Supply
<br/>
Developers whom are using a PC for GBA programming will probably want to use the PC power supply (gained from disk drive power supply cable) for the GBA as well rather than dealing with batteries or external power supplies.
<br/>
GBA: To lower the voltage to approximately 3 Volts use two diodes, type 1N 4004 or similiar, the ring printed onto the diodes points towards the GBA side, connected as such:
<br/>
  PC +5V (red)   --------|&gt;|---|&gt;|--------  GBA BT+
<br/>
  PC GND (black) -------------------------  GBA BT-
<br/>
<br/>
 
<br/>
GBA SP: Should work directly at +5V connected to EXT.2 socket (not to the internal battery pins), without any diodes.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That could have just been a special unit.  Like the old GameBoy demo units around the late SNES-era that were hooked up to an external monitor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dunno........ I really think it might be video out, it's just too many pins to just be power/headphones. Besides why would there just be external audio and not external video?
<br/>
<br/>
Given the rush job they did to get the DS out before christmas and the PSP, It wouldn't supprize me if this was left in
<br/>
<br/>
It makes more sense that It'd be power+ground, Video in+Ground, and Audio left+Audio right. Those are the 6 wires your going to have to connect on any LCD screen you splice into a system.(Speaking from Xbox experience) And I wouldn't put it past nintendo to do such a thing just for the sake of a 3rd party "Gaming screen" or Tv or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
It just makes more sense. I'll strip down some component cables and test this theory when I get home.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just thought I'd note this.  Comparing the port with the GBA SP port, the GBA SP also has 6 pins, in the same place as the DS.  Looking at the power supply cord, it has 2 pins, and the headphone adaptor uses 5 pins (most likely 2 pins for each speaker, and also one common ground pin for both power and headphones).  That's all 6 pins used up.  No more area for any type of Video Out pins.<br/>_________________<br/>Current high scores on Super Mario 64 DS:

Hi,
<br/>
just a little question, but aren't there 7 Pin's?
<br/>
I can see one between X&amp;Y too.
<br/>
Or is this one not connected to the board and its just to hold the plug? (I don't want to open my GBA/DS to look.)
<br/>
Also the powercable and the earphone adapter has a little placeholderlike-thing for this one.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Ok as i can see now i think it's just to hold the adapterplugs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
