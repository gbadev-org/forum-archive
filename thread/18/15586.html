<br/>
<br/>
I made a post in the Help Wanted forum looking for an advisor to talk to to make sure my models would be useable in a DS game of the rpg variety. All the while I was thinking about the necessity of a programmer and such and....then it occured to me. If perhaps I did manage to get a programmer at some point, would it be easier for him to create tools that I can use, instead of coding the entire RPG? I'd have no qualms about coding the entire game by myself if I knew how to code. but unfortunately, I don't have time to learn any programming languages (and I won't have time in the near future either). Unless it's something simple like Lua or Ruby.
<br/>
<br/>
tl;dr: Is it easier for a programmer to create tools for me to use (as opposed to coding the whole game) if I have the whole game planned out already and know exactly what I want to do? Don't assume I'm asking for this, I just want to know if it's easier for a programmer.<br/>_________________<br/>Uh oh, it's an oreo!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actially, IMO it's better to not design (too much at least - use some common sense ;P) for reusability, and rather redesign for reusability once a component is proven to be usefull. If not you'll end up spending all your time designing abstract interfaces, instead of making your product.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't even see where this came from. I'm not asking someone to make my game for me. There are too many things in the game that I want done a specific way for me to rely on somebody else for the entire thing. What I said was that if a programmer decided he wanted to help (read: HELP) me complete my project, would it be easier for him to create tools for me to use rather than programming the entire game? Programming for reusability rather than "one-off"

It is quite the same, although <span style="text-decoration: underline">note</span> that telling thousands of skilled scribes how to construct a pyramid (with the tools of the time) is <span style="text-decoration: underline">still</span> somewhat harder than developing a bug free operating system comparible to Windows &lt;_&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...unless every nds game has to have it's own OS-esque shell to run in? I don't know things like this...

Unless you were being witty. In which case the joke is lost on me cause I'm really pining for some help in the DS knowledge department, and that's all I can really concentrate on right now.

I have to agree with Twentyseven, you're going to need some programming knowledge to get our own projects off the ground. To design DS games, understand how the DS works and the limits of the DS's hardware will go along way even if your programming knowledge is limited.
<br/>
<br/>
Building tools for non programmers to make a game is imo a-lot more work then a programmer getting in and coding stuff specifically for one project. (hard-coding).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not completely lacking in programming knowledge. I don't know any specific languages (though I've dabbled in C++ alot), but I know programming theory. I understand limitations of the DS hardware, I spent a week trying to find out everything I can. Can this topic be locked though? I appreciate all the advice that's been given, but I want this topic locked, if possible. Thanks. I just want the topic in the Game Design forum to remain open.
