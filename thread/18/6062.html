Does anyone know what the problem is?
<br/>
I think the compiler just hates me  :'(
<br/>
I always get stupid errors like this, and when I create programs for the pc I barely get any errors :(
<br/>
<br/>
I hope someone can help me with this :)
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">do you have environment vars for DEVKITARM?
<br/>
try adding this to the bat:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
SET DEVKITARM=/c/ndsdev/devkitarm
<br/>
SET DEVKITPRO=/c/ndsdev
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and if that doesnt work trash the ndsdev environment and use this instead:
<br/>
<a href="http://devkitpro.sourceforge.net/setup.shtml" target="_blank">http://devkitpro.sourceforge.net/setup.shtml</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I have heard it works better. I had the same errors when trying to make PA_lib with the mv, and it was because something wasnt defined, you can check the makefile to see if there is any other variables that should be defined as well (although Im assuming you remade your makefile yourself from a template?) Some of these errors could be happening if you are using mixed versions of the template and devkitARM (which is at R12 now)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nah everything works fine now. Had "BG.raw.c" instead of "BG1.raw.c" somewere in my code :)
<br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with those envoirement vars since other projects compiled as they should ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, Im glad I was wrong ;) my not defined meant that files from ndslib werent on the path where they should have been, but files that hadnt needed it were compiling fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
