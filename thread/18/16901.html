<br/>
I just bought a sharp netwalker which contains an arm omap processor. I tried to build devkitp arm on the netwalker using the build-devkit.sh script in a console window. I chose to download any needed sources. I checked that the netwalker (which runs ubuntu) had wget installed and build-essential tools (using apt-get).
<br/>
<br/>
However, when I run the build script it just says that the source packages cannot be found - even with the download option :shock:
<br/>
<br/>
I then tried to manually download the sources: gcc, newlib and binutils, but the script then said that gcc-g++ could not be found :roll:
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone able to help? I would have thought that it would be possible to build devkit arm for arm linux?
<br/>
<br/>
The netwalker already has gcc installed but I presume this wouldn't cross compile for nintendo ds without devkit arm</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
