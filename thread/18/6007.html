Ok the idea here is to make a DS game maker, the plain is to make a converter for Gamemaker6. since game maker files are not compiled when saved or made in to executeables they could be made in to DS roms. yes it does sound a little far fetched but I'm pritty sure it could be done. game maker it self relys hevly on direct x but only in the runner program and the editor. the files them self are just lists of operations sprites sounds that sort of thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if this doesnt work and it turns out im dead wrong. it still stands that there has to be drag and drop game making devlopment for the DS and orther consoles.
<br/>
<br/>
step one: crack the GM file format.. Done green man games has the hacked fie format *see link above*
<br/>
<br/>
step two make our own format for the DS: this is the part i need your help with. so far every one who ive asked to help is pritty closed minded and wont even look over and give me a clear answer, mostly its a matter of wether or not they like D&amp;D game making programs, that sort of thing is erelivent. this kind of thing sould be aprocehed with optimisum even if it doesnt work, and again starting a D&amp;D dev studio sould bring more people who have little knowlage of programing to the DS dev sceen and make games or apps</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
- Reverse engineering the files violates the GameMaker usage license
<br/>
- The game files are encrypted before they are added to the runner
<br/>
<br/>
It would also be a huge effort to create the DS runner application, as the PC application is tied deeply with DirectX.  You would have to write everything from scratch.  It would end up taking years for a small group to complete, the only way this would work, is if Mark Overmars agreed to sell a license to a large commercial group who could work fulltime on this.  And it really isn't worth that much effort.  If you're too lazy to learn C or C++ and get coding for yourself, then fuck off.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It would be a lot easier to build a game maker from scratch, and building one from scratch isn't THAT hard. Seriously.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All they really have documented is the Sounds.
<br/>
<br/>
The hardest of all of these will be Scripts. We will have to write a script interpreter for the DS. If it's not compiled into bytecode we'll have to write a compiler as well. And that's all assuming they reverse engineer the script format in the first place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Btw, there already is console development middleware out there, with support announced for the DS if it's not already out. Yes, it's commercial and licensible only to professional game studios, but you asked, and it's out there.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, build your own, it would be much easier.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
