nothing is there anymore and the link is gone from his homepage. does this mean he's revamping everything because he had a major breakthrough with the encryption? sure i'm jumping to conclusions, im just really hopeful.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Being a non-commercial program (I assume), I don't see a really big deal with it getting out early. It's not like anyone's in danger of losing money or sales or anything. But then, I guess it's all up to the author anyway &lt;shrug&gt;.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As it stands, a lot of people who are itching to get developing on the DS right now are unable to do so. There are a few reasons this is true. One, building a passthrough isnt simple for everyone, and being that no one has been able to massproduce one yet, means that you DO have to build your own, or convince someone to do it for you. Not everyone is willing to take this route. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, what options are left for people who really want to start working on stuff for the DS? An emulator seems like a good place to start, doesn't it? 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really think you can compare working on an emulator to working on cracking the encryption.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
- Pressure from Nintendo after leaking Mario and Metroid
<br/>
- Work on encryption becoming too difficult for him to handle
<br/>
- A certain enraged emulator writer threatening him with legal action
<br/>
- Losing interest in the DS
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
if you check darkfaders DS page from goggle cache you can see the links to the HypeDS binarys, it seems that he have links to "leaked" binarys of the emu after all, I just hope it's some kind of misunderstanding. Nothings say that he leaked it, he could just have posted the links. Who knows? I dont think he leaked the files. I think he just had links to files, everone can make a mistake.
<br/>
<br/>
If he would like to f*ck with the author of HyperDS he would not have removed his DS page. When he removed it he also removed the links to leak files.
<br/>
<br/>
But I dont see the BIG problem by binarys is leaked from freeware software, if it was the source I would be more pissed.

Valve, Bungie, etc didn't react strongly at all banning people and threatening legal action did they...
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately they're private pieces of work which the public have no right to unless the creator says so. Imagine if the emulator now appears on slashdot along with a quote from nintendo saying that they'll consider legal action. Early versions of emulators may contain clearly copyrighted code or data gained from questionable sources, used as a placeholder until later versions in which it's replace by legal custom code when functionality is in place, at which point the author wouldn't need to worry much about legal implications,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't see your point.
<br/>
<br/>
If the author was willing to help the development community, he should release builds already, starting clearly THIS EMULATOR DOES NOT PLAY GAMES. He can remove his e-mail address from webspace and/or documentation to avoid being annoyed. 
<br/>
<br/>
In fact I can imagine other reason for not releasing it. But the fear being annoyed by newbies isn't a good reason, because you can prevent that.

Leaks are indeed anoying (I know that), but reacting to a leak saying "release plan have been cancelled" is just hurting yourself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's the only way they can get a big FU out to everyone online.  I agree with the person that said it's childish but it's up to the developer to decide what he wants to do with his project.

Breaking the encryption will invite the pirates. While this will ensure the availability of decent DS flash cards, this will also bring on Nintendo's wrath on us all. Again.

That's not really what I meant. But I think you understand that.
<br/>
Breaking the encryption would be exciting and open up many doors, but there is a downside as well.

Not that it really matters in the end. It is only a matter of time before the pirates figure out how to load copies of DS game from GBA cart memory or wifi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't noticed anyone looking at it as "the end". I know I haven't been. It's just dissapointing to see someone who's been so active and helpful in the community leave so abruptly (and mysteriously). So it's just kind of "the end" of having darkfader around. And while it's far from any end of ds dev, it's certainly poses a setback for the prospect of not needing a passthrough. (How much of a setback is debatable, of course, but that would just be nitpicking.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, but you need to gut a DS cart for the header data. What tepples means is that there will be a socket to insert a DS card, instead of the company needing to buy and gut a cart for the passthrough (Almost certainly illegal).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Normally I would agree, but lately the EU has been passing some very big-company-friendly copyright laws and the software patent law is just around the corner.
<br/>
"Circumventing copy protection mechanisms" already is or soon will be (depending on which EU country you live in) illegal in EU. Note that this has nothing to do with software patents, this is a separate copyright related law passed a few years ago.

I honestly don't see why you guys think it's stupid for the N to use encryption.  Dreamcast died because you could rip every game produced.  From what I saw(in local stores) it sold a good chunk of systems and very few games because you could rent/rip/burn every game with minimal effort.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this DS reverse engineering thing should be done in private. Having web sites claiming "this was cracked" or "here is the latest dump" is just looking for plain trouble. I know that those working on this are not doing it for money, they usually do it for fame. So that would explain why every little discovery is swiftly displayed to the community via forums or web sites. But it would probably be better for everybody if this information was not made public until something really usefull is available for the homebrew community.

Anyways, I hope this won't stop further research.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not strictly opposed to Nintendo using encryption, the big problem is the current (and future, in the case of the EU) legal implications of getting around it. And the only reason that's an issue is because of the console's closed-platform nature.

<br/>
<br/>
The laws about almost anything digital are becoming increasingly stupid.  They're drafted by apathetic old farts in both houses who don't have any idea how it applies and are being led by the nose by the lobbyists of huge companies.  Screw it and screw them.  I stopped pirating when I was 17, but I still &lt;deleted&gt; emulators to &lt;deleted&gt; every NES and SNES game I own the cartridge to.  Meanwhile, my real games and systems sit neatly stored in a box since I don't want to waste the space and time just to set them up in order to play Super Metroid for ten minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, owning any kind of rom is illigeal, and if every single person on this board doesn't own at least one or two, may monkeys fly out of my ass.  If Nintendo pulled the plug on DarkFader because he was somehow cribbing from their SDK, good for them, though I doubt it.  If they did go after him, no one can blame him for taking it all down.

Anyway, the problem with passme is that it ties up the GBA slot for your "homebrew" code.  The main reason I'd like to see a DS flash cart is so people can start working on "accessories" to use the GBA slot.. Oh.. Like GPS or USB, etc.  The reason passme rocks is because it will allow the rest of the world to get cracking on writing/playing homebrew code without lugging a cart around for the FPGA setup. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now..  Just be cause someone may or may not be working on the encription doesn't mean we can't have a DS passme flash cart.  If you look at the original GBA Movie Player, it required a GBA Cart to work..  So, someone could still incorporate the passme circuit into a flash cart to free up the GBA slot for accessories.  Dang.. that's a good idea..  Natrium42, what do you think about that??  :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's no reason you can't use DS option paks from a passthrough-booted program, just as there's no reason you can't use GBA cart hardware from a multibooted program. If your program is 32 Mbit or smaller, then you can passthrough-boot from the GBA slot and then hot-swap to the option pak.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, it was useful in that it ruled out one option.  Does it get us any farther along, not really, but it is a step regardless of the results, it's been pretty slow and people aren't really any further along than last month.  Any work on the ds is a good thing, regardless of the results.  Somewhere along the line, someones test will lead to important discoveries.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is a sign that maybe darkfader hasn't quit on the DS just yet.  I think it's cool that anyone is even trying anything, keep it up!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In my opinion I think a big fight accured between those 2 (DF and FireFly, and is FireFly the same person who made a cheat software for PSX X-Plorer cheat cartridge in the old days? Cant remember the title sorry).

<br/>
And in the end maybe they threaten each other resulting both projects canceled.

I think the balme crap on both accounts is just stupid, but as to the original action it seems like it was a very simple.  "Don't do this"
<br/>
<br/>
If you have trust between someone and a community and that trust is violated why should you produce for the community especially now that the community is bashing you?

::shrug::
<br/>
Fader's comments seemed more geared towards the piracy aspect of the emulator anyway, with the way he talked about running commercial roms and such.  Maybe firefly didn't want to be a part of piracy like that?  Not sure.

The quality is really shitty as it is recorded using my cheap 2mp camera, and you can't read the text words, it still looks cool though.  
<br/>
<br/>
Too bad the start got cut off cause apparently there is a limit to how many chat messages it will store and I'm too lazy to redo the starting or finish it off.  Would have to do some video editing and append multiple clips together, I captured the good part anyway.

DarkFader's work on getting the DS opened up has led to huge advances for us all (like the ability to run code on a DS already), and FireFly's work with emulators is top-notch (as can be seen with his excellent GeePee32 emulator).  Both are obviously quite intelligent people, so why can't they just get over this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
