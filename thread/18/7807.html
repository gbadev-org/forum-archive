Amen to that! All I see them update is their Game Manager to work with "Pokemon Dash" or "Gundam SD" or whatever... I wish they'd start improving the actual FIRMWARE and throw in the audio-sync fix like with v2 (pressing Select unlocks the shoulder buttons I hear.)<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In an e-mail from the M3 devs they stated to me that they were not interested in making the video quality better as *many* people dant have the storage space for larger video files. They said a few other things, which by and large meant "we dont want to make it better, cos instead we can make a *new* product from those improvments and sell it!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
