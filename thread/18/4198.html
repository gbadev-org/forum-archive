    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't wait till someone makes a super nintendo emulator for the DS, I just know it's going to be done, cause it was attempted on the gba before with little results.. as the gba was underpowered, the next cannidate for snes emulation is the DS, just look it has perfect button layout for such an emulator, and it's more powerful than a snes supposedly on par or better than a N64. So hopefully we see an emulator in the near future. 
<br/>
Imagine sending the rom file to someone else via wifi and playing battle toads, goemon, double dragon (or whatever snes game floats your boat) wirelessly. Dam I can't wait for the DS to get cracked open.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it would be more fun to get some original homebrew games on the DS than just have a SNES emulator for it. Plus isn't downloading snes roms illegal anyways? So why would you want to make an emulator so people can give the homebrew community a bad name?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Then they can package up N64/SNES repro's like they do now with the NES stuff on the GBA, and charge $20 a cart to play the same game again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it's a good idea and I would like to see it on there but I'd rather see time spent making new and fun games utilizing the DS's new hardware features.
<br/>
<br/>
Ports can't simply be packaged up again and sold for $20. They need to add things like a second screen; otherwise it would be blank.

I wonder if they have the old design docs so they can fix the bug, eliminate the errors and finish the stuff the didn't have time to do.  I hear RS3 was rushed out the door- bits and pieces left unfinished.
<br/>
<br/>
Original stuff is good, but I've noticed that a lot of people are good at messing things up pretty badly...

I don't think the hardware in the DS will make much of a difference (except the cpu) in emulating the SNES, the GBA can't do subtractive blending, doesn't have per tile priority, doesn't have 16x16 tiles.

With all the power the DS has, you could probably play games that are better than SNES quality in terms of graphics using display filters.

Then again, it is still going to take time. I want the DS to be very successful first, and then start under-the-rug projects... :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree on both counts.
<br/>
<br/>
The "me too" games are a big problem, and how often do any of them do well?  Hardly ever.  I think the only explanation for why publishers continue to think that that could ever be a good strategy, despite the contant proof otherwise, is their incessant "packaged goods" mentality.  Crap, it's no wonder there's been so many publishers going under lately, how often did any of them put out anything that was really worthwhile? How in the world would a group of suits who never even play games ever know the difference between a good game and packaged crap? No wonder they keep dropping like flies...  And then there's the people complaing about the rising development costs while they totally ignore the fact that some of the most successful games ever - like The Sims, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Myst, even Deer Hunter were no where near the level of sophistication (hence, fraction of the development time and cost) as the $10 million pieces of crap.
<br/>
<br/>
You can hardly even count how many perfectly good franchises have been nearly ruined by trying to cram their gameplay into 3D.  I blame the publishers and marketers from the early 90's that turned "3D" into such a disproportionally huge buzzword that they refused to do anything that they couldn't market with a giant "3D!!" logo plastered all over the box. It got so over-done that the whole "It must be 3D or it sucks!" mentality seeped into a lot of customers minds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wonder how long it will take for a free functioning DS emulator to come 
<br/>
out on the PC? Emulators like VBA had commercial games running on them not long after the GBA release in Japan. I remember playing Castlevania: CotM on the Dos version of VBA before the GBA hit US stores, but that was back in the day when I didn't know about GBA homebrew development.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Jaleco did, as FluBBa pointed out. PocketNES minus save states or minus LZO compression of save states is permissively licensed, and Jaleco used it in GBA ports of its NES back catalog.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If nintendo doesn't use an SNES emulator written by the homebrew community someone else will...  A small and efficient homebrew community is good for console as a whole... publically available emulators and commercial roms are not, unfortunetley they're byproducts... so it's going to be tit for tat...
<br/>
<br/>
Emulators will emerge anyway though, the pirates will find a way, so you might as well put these tools to good use.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I wrong or wasn't the GBA's video playback abilities descovered and used by homebrew programmers first before big N started distributing movie carts??
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA wasn't reverse engineered or anything, a developer or a publisher felt as I do, and the GBA development manual leaked out, I'm assuming the DS manual will "leak" out as well in short order...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
