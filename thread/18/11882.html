    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to get the MODEL VIEW matrix and modify it.  I see there's a glLoadMatrix in VideoGL.h but I didn't see any function to GET the current <b style="color:#FFA34F">MODELVIEW</b> matrix.   I am trying to make this message as short as possible but I hope i am not over simplifing the problem.  Thank you very much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are 2 functions described in the videoGL.h file as glGetInt and glGetFixed. This is what will get you the Model View matrix. The GL_GET_TYPE type is located amongst the other constants, and the pointer parameter is where the matrix will be written to.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you want to manually get the matrix without going through these functions, just access the 64-byte region at address 4000640h (which is called the CLIPMTX_RESULT at <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">GBATek</a>).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment though, from the tests I've done, only No$GBA seems to have this feature (other than hardware), so if you are using other emulators, you'll only get 0s.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
