<br/>
<br/>
nice to meet you all and be a new GbaDev member!
<br/>
<br/>
I searched a lot around, readed tutorials forums  and guides,
<br/>
but still cant' find a simple and clear way to make with dekvit ( and maybe also PAlib and visual basic)
<br/>
a simple Video gallery on Ds
<br/>
<br/>
just a map with some hotSpots and some videos linked (with audio) that start playing when I Press it and stop and return to map When I choose to close it
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not interested about conversion, or the file type, i found around there are some converter (I tried dpg tools and super for example) and that there are different file format (the best should be the .dpg am I right?)
<br/>
<br/>
anyway I'm not interested about quality or video format, i want just some
<br/>
hints on How to develop a simple video gallery
<br/>
<br/>
is this possible with the Ds Hardware atm?
<br/>
<br/>
plaese help me
<br/>
in any way :D
<br/>
<br/>
thx in advantage
<br/>
good bye and HAPPY NEW YEAR! :)
