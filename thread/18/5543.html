That would be me. =)
<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to run into this bug again, but for those who are wondering, there is an easy fix to this if you have the older version. Just close your DS to put it in sleep mode, then re-open it. Simple as that.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my perspective on why this works (even though I barely know much about sleep mode myself)...
<br/>
What I believe this does is shut down the audio/video components, and re-initializes them with data that was saved before setting sleep mode. This data is determined by what the developer wants it to be, so since this random 'bug' wasn't intended with this data, it doesn't get added, and therefore is not present after the sleep mode.
<br/>
<br/>
As for audio effects in hardware, I believe there are, but until there is concrete evidence, I can only speculate.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
Echo effects can be done by using the sound capture interface to record raw sound output to memory and then play it back again mixed with the currently playing audio. Thus, if this interface is left enabled, all generated sound will have an echo effect generated by the DS sound hardware.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow. It seems that more output of the Nintendo DS's subsystems is observable by the program than on any of the system's predecessors: the 3D core output (used by the dual-screen 3D trick for the sub-screen) and now the audio mixer output (used by echo). Perhaps Ni–∏tendo will open a can of anti-emulation whoop-@$$ in its future titles, by rendering a test scene and then halting if it doesn't match stored data down to individual roundoff errors. Say good-bye to any chance of high-level emulation like what is typically done for the PS1 and N64 video cores in PC-based emulators.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
