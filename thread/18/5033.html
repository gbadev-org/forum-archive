<br/>
No, it does not.
<br/>
DS games use serial EEPROM for savegame storage. There is no limit to the size.
<br/>
Whats more, the main storage could easily be replaced (partly or entirely) with inexpensive block flash memory. (This would be the preffered way to store extra programs)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Because Nintendo removed the link port, the only way (apart from adding a USB port to an option pack cart) to hotsync would be over WiFi, right?
<br/>
<br/>
And that likely means that Nintendo will let PalmOS apps access the wireless chipset just like they do on any other handheld - giving us instant access to IM clients, web browsers, everything!  And not to mention the great stylus-optimised games, such as Bejeweled (which we currently only have on the DS in the form of Zoo-Keeper, which is nowhere near as good as Bejeweled 2).  The only problem I foresee is with resolutions.  AFAIK, Palm devices usually only have resolutions of 160 x 160, 320 x 320, etc.  So how would applications deal with a 256 x 192 screen?  Would they run in 160 x 160 mode or stretch to the full screen?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Large companies will license many patents just to the point that they can,hopefully, later build upon the idea. And to stop competition.

what could b possible is that the desktop is put over both screens...top half on top screen, bottom half on bottom screen, and then by using the select button you can swap the two over so you can use the touch screen? fiddly, i know, but its just an idea

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd be awful curious as to storage, if they intend to actually put PalmOS on the DS or a similar device. Last time I did any direct work with PalmOS, it had a crazy memory model that mixed applications and their data. Ill-behaved applications (and on what platform do <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> applications behave as per spec, or even vaguely sensible practices?) could easy thrash some types of storage a little too often, raising the sort of situation some people see with some Linux filesystems on the PocketPC devices.. i.e. cards with sections that have been written to a little too often.
<br/>
<br/>
'course, I'd still like to see something a little more official.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
SummitSoft has this product that has a whole line of different utilities and games for Palms. It would make sense that they would take advantage of Nintendo licensing Palm OS to release these products onto the DS market. Also, Palm OS, depending on how it's activated (through cart or other method) may be used to generate better server lists and WiFi spots, etc. (considering the few features on that page that include such things)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally think that they're only licensing a customized version of the OS that acts as software for an SD Card Reader/Writer Option Pak.
<br/>
<br/>
Although.. the main source is Spong.. and they're.. well.. trying to get honest information out of them is like trying to get a coherent sentence out of Ted Kennedy.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea that I think Nintendo is going for is the release of an SD Card Reader/Writer Option Pak. The Palm OS software would have online features, and allow you to play music/movies through the SD Card Reader/Writer Option Pak, as well as manage files in it, play some applications, store e-mail, text files, image files, etc. Essentially the two would be packed together. For ease of typing.. I will refer to it as an SDC R/W OP.. or maybe.. a VIRTUAL POCKET (VP) to store things in.
<br/>
<br/>
The Palm OS software wouldn't be the only thing you could use the VP with though. Imagine being able to design a pattern on your computer, save it to an SD Card, then put the SD Card into your VP, plug the VP into Slot 2, and then put in Animal Crossing and upload that design into Animal Crossing. Or you could download an image you made in Animal Crossing to the VP, pop in the Palm OS software and send that image to a friend's e-mail.
<br/>
<br/>
But that's just my ideas...<br/>_________________<br/>Evilish!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

and nintendo have been talking about a translator dictionary for the DS, so organiser software is just another step

sure, the palmOS rumour might b exactly that, but if nintendo is trying to capture the adult demographic with the DS like many in the industry are saying they are, then a range of organiser stuff is a good idea</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
