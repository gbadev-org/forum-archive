    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello
<br/>
Ive made my own passme with a "xillinx xc9572xl-10vq44c", too.
<br/>
Ive made my own plate and solder the chip on it.  Ive dont make short-circuits or other things. If i start the nds with my passme and a gba cart with a demo, it only comes the warning message and then a white screen only, ive dont haveto click on the screen to accept the warning.
<br/>
<br/>
For my connection diagram, ive used the "Schematic, Board and Library for CadSoft EAGLE" from <a href="http://natrium42.com/blog/" target="_blank">http://natrium42.com/blog/</a>
<br/>
and the passme code from darkfaders site ! (jedec file)
<br/>
<br/>
PS
<br/>
ive used 2 chips, first one i think the chip is broken or something else, but now with the second chip, same errors appear ?!?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ottelo on Thu Mar 24, 2005 11:19 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it sounds like you got everything working... but the problem is, is that there is multiple versions of the passme firmware, and some demos only load on some versions.  try more demos.
<br/>
<br/>
also, what flash cart are you using?<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm *hoping* you either build the 1 layer version, or insulated the back on the 2 layer version.  Now, when you were at the white screen, and you said you didn't need to touch the screen to get it, your running the new DarkFader code, and as far as I know, almost all (if not all) demos have been converted.  Now, when you get the two white screens, it means it is seeing the NDS cart.  Now that your getting the boot menu, it is not.  So, I'd start by moving the PCB around inside the DS untill you get the two white screens again.  That'll let you know that your PassMe is working fine.  Next, you will need to troubleshoot your Flash Cart, and or the demo your trying to use.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is the exact same cart I am using too. Make sure you don't put a bootmenu onto the cart. Also, it doesn't need to fix the header.
<br/>
<br/>
White screens usually means that PassMe is working, but there is some problem in the code on the GBA flash cart. I encourage you to join #dsdev on EFnet so that we can try debugging your problem.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by natrium42 on Thu Mar 24, 2005 6:11 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

download 2d or 3d example demo from my site (www.drunkencoders.com in the EXAMPLES section) and flash the .nds file....if you dont feel like making them try the Memory viewer demo (in the DEMOS section) as it is just the binaries.  All the other demos on my site are based on old boot method which will not work with the much improved passme firmware.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
