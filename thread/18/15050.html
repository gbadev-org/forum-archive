    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an r4ds and am interested in developing a homebrew biometric fingerprint scanner or some kind of mock scanner that just looks cool. I am also interested in being able to program it but I don't know where to start and have little experience. If somebody would like to help me out or take up this project on their own I would like to know about it, and if you already know of a similar homebrew program please let me know. I understand that the ds hardware is probably not capable of supporting a true fingerprint scanner, but it is a cool concept.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A real one is definitely not possible, but it would be very easy to make something that just looked like it was scanning your fingerprint.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't ever messed with it before, but there's a way to get a temperature reading from the touchscreen, so you might be able to use that to at least check if the screen is actually being touched by a finger instead of the stylus.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see any reason to make something like this, but it just so happens that I love silly coding and since this would be easy to do I'd be happy to do the code work for you if you don't want to do it yourself.  You'll have ot supply the graphics, though, because I'm no good at graphics.  Just a 256x192 background image would be enough, the rest can all be done with effects and text.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i would love for you to help me on this project, I may not come in handy but just let me know what i can do. I'm sure that I can easily make an image for the background in whatever image file you want. I think it would be a cool little project. Let me know where we can start. I got the idea today when I tried playing trace memory and there is a part in the beginning where you put your finger on the screen so it can pretend to read it. I don't know if you have the game but I can upload an image of that part if I can figure out how to upload them to this forum.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are my ideas-
<br/>
-bottom screen has oval where you place your finger
<br/>
-first horizontal bars scan your finger and then vertical bars
<br/>
-maybe after it scans it can display a random image of a print and enlarge it or do some effect
<br/>
-top screen will show a progress bar</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From there, you'll see whether it shows something that roughly looks like a fingerprint or if you need to cheat more ...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From playing with the temperature sensor, it is just not rapid enough to detect fingerprint presence on the screen.  It takes many seconds to register any temperature change as the sensor is underneath the screen.

Sounds like a great way to try it, but i have no programming knowledge, I can do a lot with computers but programming ds apps as it is very difficult for me. Currently I have created 72 frames that can be compiled into an animation that initiates after you press the screen. I'm not sure how simple it would be for you to program something like that but if you can give me a way to send the animation graphics to you I would be happy to let you do the programming. I was going to have Sweater Fish Deluxe program it for me but i haven't heard from him yet.
<br/>
<br/>
If anybody else wants the graphics just let me know how you want me to send them to you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, I thought I sent a reply to your last PM, but checking my outbox, I guess, I didn't send it.  I distinctly remember writing it, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've begun coding this using my own graphics.  I decided to do something a little more complicated with the top screen, so it's taking a little longer.  Still pretty easy, but just time consuming since I have to keep building and testing to make sure everything is aligned properly.  I needed a break from the game I've been working on anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the background images I'm using:

<br/>
<br/>
On the top screen, you'll have a scanned image of your thumbprint with a text console on the left, progress bar below that, a legend of verified point matches on the right and the top left is just a logo.  I've got the first half done up to the point where the scanned thumbprint is displayed on the top.  Now I just have to scan over that print image and detect some matches and then it'll be done, I guess.
<br/>
<br/>
The magenta in those images is just a placeholder color since I'm using a nice slick looking paletteshifting effect on that color.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want me to use the images you made, instead, just put them in an archive and PM them to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The images I have are actually frames that can be made into a gif animation. I don't know if yo can program gif animations to be used on the ds, but that was the idea. You can sill use the frames though. It is about 70 frames and if you can get them to play that would be great.
<br/>
<br/>
Here how the animations would work.
<br/>
- 3 looping frames that play until the screen is touched (bottom)
<br/>
- 60 frames that play once the screen is touched (bottom)
<br/>
- a constant looping animation that looks like a loading bar for the top screen
<br/>
<br/>
I will try to send them to you in about 4 hours. by pm
<br/>
<br/>
I like your ideas bt i think you should look at my animations and maybe add text bar scrolling on the side, etc. thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
