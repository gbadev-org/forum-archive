    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">gfx2gba is confusing me ALOT!
<br/>
I readed the readme like 30 times but it couldnt help me.
<br/>
<br/>
Look, I want to have 2 backgrounds for my game and I want 2 sprites.
<br/>
How am I going to do this? 
<br/>
<br/>
This is how I think everything needs to be done:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Background</span>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a 256 colors background you'll need to get 3 type of files: BG.pal.c and BG.raw.c and BG.map.c
<br/>
(question one: why 3 different files? And what does every file do (what is it function)?
<br/>
You get get this by typing: "gfx2gbx -x -fsrc -m BG.BMP" (right?)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sprites</span>
<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to get the following 2 (?) file types of your sprite.BMP:
<br/>
sprite.pal.c and sprite.raw.c
<br/>
(question 2: were do these files types stnad for? pallete is for colors or something and raw.c is for ...)
<br/>
<br/>
What if I want to create 2 sprites that look the same? Can I use the same sprite.pal.c file? And also the same sprite.raw.c??
<br/>
<br/>
And how do I MAKE these 2 sprite filetypes? The same way as with the background: "gfx2gbx -x -fsrc sprite.BMP" ?? Because I get some strange pixels colored on my screen when I try to run a program with these files. Some blocks with alot of colored pixels but they dont look like my sprites. (only the backgrounds work)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I use gifs2sprites from <a href="http://gbadev.org/tools.php?section=gfx" target="_blank">http://gbadev.org/tools.php?section=gfx</a> . Might be less confusing for u 2. I do use gfx2gba (both versions) for everything else though ie. tiles/BGR15.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
