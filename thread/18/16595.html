    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking at the new DSi and the downloadable games from the shop I couldn't stop wondering... Do you think it's at all possible to run the DSiWare games on the regular DS? The only thing I could think that would limit it is the lack of RAM and games that need the camera (obviously). Do the two DS systems differ that much in hardware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only way I can think that DSiWare games could possibly run on a normal DS(L) is if they were running under the normal DS-mode, but I believe because of the method they are retrieved from the internet and stored on the DSi suggests they don't use that mode at all.
<br/>
<br/>
What I mean by normal DS mode is that it uses none of the upgrades that come with the DSi, such as the 133Mhz ARM9 CPU, the 16MB RAM, updated audio and WiFi, etc. It's similar to the comparison of the DS mode and the GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I thought I heard that they updated the actual hardware.

(i'm not telling they haven't changed the audio part, just that speaker ARE part of the hardware)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So it's more powerful than a normal DS, that's for sure.<br/>_________________<br/>woei!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I've read about that, and about WPA support, and about SD slot... what I would like to know actually is mainly <span style="font-weight: bold">if</span> there's still a 'real' ARM7 inside (I believe it's so... somebody could try my libxm7 demo, for instance...) and if they changed (upgraded?) sound capabilities, sound quality (speakers) aside...

I'm not saying, that some of them *couldn't*, but I don't see any cameras in my old NDS to run WarioWare Snapped. ;^)
<br/>
(Speculation:) Also, the firmware needed to run them isn't present in the NDS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">is this the right category for your post?
<br/>
<br/>
ask yourself this question:
<br/>
what does my post have to do with development for the ds?
<br/>
<br/>
i would suggest the category DS Misc, for similar posts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
