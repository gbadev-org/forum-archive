<br/>
<br/>
I created a graphical touchscreen keyboard, which was actually intended to be used with DSlinux, sadly, they're now using a different method (tiling I believe) which means it hasn't been used, which is am awful shame, because i've put many hours into it, and feel it should be used if it'd help someone, so I'm offering it for free use to anyone that's developing for the DS.

I'm looking for a keyboard graph for PA_lib (the one I use looks 'a lot' like pictochat...), do you think we could use this one (which is much nicer) ? :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Help yourself :)

As regards to the tiling, i'm not sure, you'd have to ask Pepsiman, who's doing most of the work on DSlinux, it wasn't explained very clearly to me why mine couldn't be used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Apparently, in a tile-based display mode, it's easiest to replace sections of the screen that are whole number multiples of 8x8 pixels in size. For instance, a good size for a single key would be 16x16 pixels.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I didn't design the keyboard for tiling in mind, as the method that was currently being used at the time was more flexible, so I was more concerned with the look of it than compatibility with other methods.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
