    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We were trying to find the equivalent on VC6 but didn't find how. IMO, it could have worked in Project/Settings, debug tab, with "executable for debug session" set to the emulator and "program arguments" set to the target but the build/execute (CTRL+F5) command remains grayed out in a makefile project.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate if someone knew how to CTRL-F5 our way to the emulator in VC6.
<br/>
<br/>
Until then, i'll use a workaround i made myself: a win32 app that catches CTRL-F5 and launches the emu + rom. It's downloadable from the below location (vcrun.exe) and you only have to create a conf.txt in the directory you run it from with the 1st line as the full path to the emulator's exe and the 2nd line as the parameters (but it _requires the exe name_ at beginning of params):
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://70.81.30.70:15036/" target="_blank">http://70.81.30.70:15036/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
And example of conf.txt:
<br/>
<br/>
e:\emu\no$gba.exe
<br/>
no$gba.exe d:\prj\gba3\gba3.nds</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In VC++ 2005 Express, go to Tools -&gt; External Tools...
<br/>
<br/>
Select Add
<br/>
<br/>
Title:  iDeaS Emulator
<br/>
Command:  C:\devkitPro\ideas1016\ideas.exe
<br/>
Arguments: $(TargetDir)\$(TargetName).nds
<br/>
Initial Directory:  $(TargetDir)
<br/>
<br/>
Where Command: is the path of your emulator, and Title is what you want in the menu.  Now, just build your app, go to Tools, and select iDeaS emulator, and you can test it right away.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing you can do, for easy real-hardware testing is:
<br/>
<br/>
Go back to Tools -&gt; External Tools... and click Add again
<br/>
<br/>
Title:  Copy to CF Card
<br/>
Command:  xcopy.exe
<br/>
Arguments:  $(TargetName).nds I:\Applications\Demos /Y
<br/>
Initial Directory: $(TargetDir)
<br/>
<br/>
Where Title is what you want on the menu, Command is always xcopy.exe (the DOS copy app), and Arguments is always:
<br/>
<br/>
$(TargetName).nds &lt;Path to where you want it to copy to, in this case, your removable media&gt; /Y (the /Y disables prompting for overwrite)
<br/>
<br/>
Now when you want to test on hardware, just stick in your card, click Copy to &lt;whatever kind of card you have&gt; Card, and when it says Done in the output window, you can put the card in your DS and run it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">calcprogrammer1, I can see copy to FAT card being useful in external tools, because I have that also, but why have the emulator in tools?  You can just have it set to your debugger, so that when you press F5 ( which everyone gets use to in VC) it runs the emulator with the nds file you are programming.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the VC 6.0, I have to get a hold of my one friend from college and have me send a copy, since my disc has gotten damaged, when I get it, I will post the instructions on that<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>
