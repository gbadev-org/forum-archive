    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I am a novice C++ programmer but I thought it would be fun to make a few applications for the DS. However I am extremely frustrated by the lack of easy to read documentation on how to do this. Most guides are cryptic and reference other guides and this leads to confusion. Anyway here is my main problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I installed devkitpro and when I try and make files from the command line it says make is not a recognized command... 
<br/>
<br/>
Seems rather silly... why did I download this supposed compiler if I cannot even build things... Anyway... Does anyone know what went wrong and can you point me in the direction I need to go in order to start compiling basic programs.... I am running windows xp.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Make sure that PATH contains "c:\devkitPro\msys\bin" somewhere is there, if it isn't there, add it in.
<br/>
<br/>
That's where make.exe comes from.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you use programmers notepad(Not the best software; I give you that) it handles alot of that stuff for you. I'd use it for hello world stuff just to get a baseline and then go from there if you want to switch to something else.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
