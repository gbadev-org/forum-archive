    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've managed to crosscompile <a class="postlink" href="http://ccxvii.net/fitz/" target="_blank"> this pdf library </a> to work on the DS, and with some modifications, have gotten it to render PDF's. I really don't have the bandwidth to make something like this into an actual useful for everyone thing; so do you guys think there would be enough support for this that homebrewers would run with it if given a base?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not ready to release source for it yet; I still have a few bugs to work out, which brings me to this: Is there any good debug tools for the DS? So far no$ accurately predicts what the actual gameboy will do, but when it crashes the thing doesn't even finish flusing the buffers before it closes. Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
