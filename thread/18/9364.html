    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried a couple of audio code examples, and they seem to always play sound on the left speaker only, I can't seem to play sound on both speaker. Maybe there is something that I am missing.
<br/>
<br/>
I've even compiled SaTa's mp3play (r10) and it too only play sounds on the left speaker. And since I can't seem to find the way to execute the precompiled version on my m3 I can't compare.
<br/>
<br/>
I would welcome any comments on this, thank you

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's what I tought, but I can't seem to make it work using the panning, by default the example (ndsexample SimpleSound) I used set the panning to 64, so I tried the full range from -128,127 and it makes not change whatsoever.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't seem to find documentation regarding this.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried looking through the source code for libnds but there is no indication of the value that should be but I think that theses changes should have an impact.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should try with a differenct libnds and/or devkitARM version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
