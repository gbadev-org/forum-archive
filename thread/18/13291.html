    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure many here are aware of what <a class="postlink" href="http://treacle.hewwo.com/jazz/oj/" target="_blank">OpenJazz</a> is, and even more so what <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Jackrabbit_%28game%29" target="_blank">Jazz Jackrabbit</a> is.
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, Jazz Jackrabbit has been ported using OpenJazz to several different systems, Windows, Dreamcast and the PSP to name a few, and I'm curious as to whether there are any projects to port our little Blaster-Wielding bouncy friend to the DS. It's such an awesome game that I want to take it with me wherever I go.
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, any projects that people know of?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I ported my dreamcast version to the ds, but it needs lots of work. I have to track down my sourcecode and see if it works with latest devkitarm/libnds versions.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://gpf.dcemu.co.uk/OpenJazzDS.rar" target="_blank">http://gpf.dcemu.co.uk/OpenJazzDS.rar</a> is a binary i found on my site not sure of what the status was on it since it was last febuary since I posted it for people to test for me.

Yeah that'd be great but I'd need a set of instructions on how to get it to run if you wouldn't mind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Never mind about instructions, I got it working. It's an awesome start but it definitely needs some work. Do you have any plans to continue on with it? Cause that'd be super awesome!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
