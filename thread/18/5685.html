    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using the libs from 05/07/2005 from nds dev... and I'm trying to do 3D stuff but the new library has made everything really really dark. Is there a problem with the lib or have I got my lighting wrong and it just worked previously by luck.....
<br/>
<br/>
Textured Cube demo etc doesn't seem happy so I don't think its my code...anyone else got a similar problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm having strange results with lighting too...
<br/>
ambient on my material is working fine, but diffuse makes things go odd colours (if i have green diffuse on my material, i get orange coming out?).
<br/>
i might've done something wrong tho - i've only been playing around with this for the last hour or two...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
