<br/>
basicaly its a program designed for tablet pcs where you draw shapes and stuff, and create this "Physics playground", you can define the ammount and direction of gravity, make constraints like rope, springs or axis, aply force to any object etc...
<br/>
<br/>
I just though that it would be perfect for the DS as a little toy for when you're bored, just am not sure if the ds is powerful enough to run it, the download in that thread contains a compiled version that'll work on normal desktop pcs and also the source code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe it's possible - it just looks very difficult.  You have fixed point routines, and more than enough power for some system-optimized raycasts.  I just don't think it'll be powerful enough to make jenga towers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a DS homebrew game out there that lets you play with particle physics and elastic bands.  Not as sophisticated as what you want, but it's still pretty fun.  I think a physics playground type thing would definitely be possible, but you'd probably be limited to a small number of objects.
<br/>
<br/>
On another note, my professor wrote the original app that eventually became the Physics Illustrator as part of her PhD thesis.  She's done a lot of work with stylus-based input and yet had somehow never played the DS until I showed it to her...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
