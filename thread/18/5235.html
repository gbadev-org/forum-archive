 The Ds cart plugs into the side of the ar which in turn goes in you GBA slot.

Whether It'll act as a pass me is one Question but I'll be happy if it uses a touchscreen keyboard for codes. Make it so much faster.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, and pay money for an unwanted game just because it has some exploit for which you might need to wait a few minutes too ;P

Play-testing is an issue as well. For a game designed for a handheld system such as a Nintendo DS, I would want to test it in an area where handheld systems are likely to be used. Being small is an advantage for testing because it allows testing to be spontaneous. For instance, pretend that Darkain beat you to it and got a Ni-Fi multiboot master working before you got your passthrough working; if I wanted to start the DS and test a game that I or another forum member was working on, I'd have to pull out a laptop, start it, and then have the laptop start the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It believe it's definitely possible to implement TCP/IP in software eventually, despite the fact that the DS doesn't support it natively. A good network coder should be able to pull it off easily, and write a small PC-side uploader app as well. But then again, like you said, it seems that we don't know how to access the WiFi features of the DS at all (except maybe for Darkain :p)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True. I truly miss the old Pro AR where you could look for your own codes (I own the Gamegear version). What fun it was to find hidden secrets/codes in each of your games! That really did lengthen the life of the games.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you look at any of the screenshots at lik-sang (like this one: <a class="postlink" href="http://image.lik-sang.com/content/action_replay_duo/03_AR_DUO_console.jpg" target="_blank">http://image.lik-sang.com/content/action_replay_duo/03_AR_DUO_console.jpg</a>) in an image editor, you'll notice that each 'pixel' in the image is actually a 4x4 square, and when you shrink it to 25%, you get a 240x160 image. i.e. it is using the GBA's resolution. If it were truly booting in DS mode it would be using the full DS resolution. (not to mention the other screen)<br/>_________________<br/>If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, why the heck do you care?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On the web site it has an update that says "In depth" and it says "Datel?s dynamic new Action Replay MAX DUO! Combining Action Replay for GBA and MAX Drive DS" and goes on to say it only allows you to read and write game saves of the DS, hence the name MAX DRIVE DS.
<br/>
<br/>
But they do go on to say that you will be able to download game saves with cheats enabled such as infinite ammo<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the savegame format has at least a 16-bit field for maximum ammo, then the savegame can be set up such that the game system will run out of battery power before the hero runs out of ammo.

Or if there's poor bounds checking in the code that can cause invalid values to break the logic, it is also possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Video game programmers don't always have the best sanity checking, and sometimes the optimizations can result in some interesting effects if 'impossible' data shows up (i.e. something the game itself will never generate)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
