    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are there any DS emulators for the Mac, or any plans for one?  It would greatly reduce the annoying delay in testing small changes in the code-&gt;compile-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">copy to CF card</span>-&gt;run-&gt;repeat cycle.

Otherwise, I might have to buy an Intel Mac and run (oh no!) Windows.<br/>_________________<br/>null</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree a mac emulator would be a great help.  I imagine the closest thing currently is DeSmuMe what with it being open source and having a linux port.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.thrivepresents.com" target="_blank">www.thrivepresents.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What would be even better is an <span style="font-style: italic">accurate</span> emulator, regardless of platform. But if you're worried about the musical CF cards issue, once someone gets an HTTP client/.nds loader going on the DS, you'll just have to turn on the Apache HTTP Server that you already have.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I have a dual 1.8 GHz G5 with 2 Gigs of RAM.  Think it'll run?<br/>_________________<br/>null</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
