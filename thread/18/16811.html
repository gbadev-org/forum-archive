    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have jury rigged Payk's md2 model loader to my game and all is well and good. But I don't know if md2 is the best 3d format out there. The md2 files seem to be small, but I don't get normals. Its nice that I can load and unload md2 models as the game progresses. 
<br/>
<br/>
Are display lists a better option? From what I understand, they would support more flexible texturing and normals. Are display lists all compiled into the code?
<br/>
<br/>
What about any other file formats out there, blender exports to like 30 formats. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">md2 is mostly used for nds games because it is a small model I think. But if you want a small(er) model format you can look in nitro engine's nea format. And rip the loader out of the source for your own game I think, but I think for that you need AntonioND permission.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://imetal.nl/" target="_blank">Website / Blog</a>
