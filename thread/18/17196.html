    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I know some of you must have an amazingly quick test cycle on hardware...
<br/>
So, what's your secret?
<br/>
<br/>
Here is mine:
<br/>
1) Eject card from slot-1
<br/>
2) Eject microsd from card
<br/>
3) Insert microsd into reader
<br/>
4) Insert reader into computer
<br/>
5) Copy application
<br/>
6) Eject/unmount reader
<br/>
7) And so on until....
<br/>
95) Wait for cart menu to load
<br/>
96) Launch hbmenu
<br/>
97) Launch copied application
<br/>
<br/>
There has to be a better way which supports argv :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So the steps are now:

<br/>
1. Turn on DS
<br/>
2. Select the receiver app.
<br/>
3. Run the sender on the PC.
<br/>
4. Wait for xfer to complete.

Basicaly the MicroSD WiFi card emulates a small HDD that you can access via WiFi, so it reduces the  steps to:
<br/>
<br/>
1) switch on DS
<br/>
2) Copy file from PC to DS
<br/>
3) Boot nds file
<br/>
4) Exit from the nds file and return to step 2
<br/>
<br/>
Only problem is I've not seen any of the microSD cards with a WiFi and storage space available anywhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think wireless SD cards are necessary here since the DS can do all the transferring and storing just fine. We would just need a loader on the DS that waits for the PC to send a DS binary, store it on the SD card and execute it. The new devkitpro homebrew menu will support for DS homebrew to return to the loader (science!) which could also be useful for this wireless loader since it would spare us turning the DS off and on all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
The workflow I'm envisioning would be this:
<br/>
<br/>
1. type "make wifi" and have your .nds copied to and executed on the DS
<br/>
2. test your app
<br/>
3. press L+R+A+B to return to the loader
<br/>
<br/>
The only problem I'm having with this is that it's limited to WEP encryption. If I want my home network to be WPA secured, then a USB wireless dongle would be required as a workaround.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yea, wireless sd cards aren't necessary, and it might not be easy to find a microsd version, and then there is the question if it works on the flashcards. 
<br/>
<br/>
the return to loader might be a bit tricky (or not). it would be easiest if you can execute an nds file without touching the bootstub code. that way, resetting the nds file would bring you back at the menu, where you can just run the receiver again. 
<br/>
<br/>
an other (harder) option would be that the receiver saves the bootstub code, and then installs its own. that way, when you reset the nds file, you can immediately send another one, and quiting the receiver would return you to the menu.<br/>_________________<br/>my blog:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just avoid as much of the unnecessary inserting/ejecting stuff as possible. 
<br/>
<br/>
1. eject miniSD card
<br/>
2. Insert the SD Card reader into my computer <span style="font-style: italic">if not already plugged in</span>
<br/>
3. insert miniSD card into reader
<br/>
4. copy program to miniSD card
<br/>
5. remove miniSD card from reader
<br/>
6. insert miniSD card into flash cart
<br/>
7. boot DS
<br/>
8. wait for card menu to load
<br/>
9. select and boot program (directly from cart menu)
<br/>
<br/>
Note that I have a SuperKey and a SuperCard MiniSD, but is it actually necessary for you to eject your slot-1 card each time with your setup?
<br/>
<br/>
After reading this thread, I plan on making a program that compiles my project and immediately copies the resulting file onto my miniSD card. For me, the copying is the longest step as of now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DS-Xtreme looks like it would've been great for homebrew testing. It seems you could just leave the flashcart in your DS and have it always connected to your computer via USB. Had built in storage (4gb)... no need for a microSD.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I've never used it myself, but the idea of a flashcart like that would be great, IMO.
<br/>
<br/>
I could see the test cycle like this:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Type make (this would include the .nds copy to your card, on successful build)
<br/>
2. Power on the DS
<br/>
3. Test it
<br/>
4. Power off DS
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the DS could stay on the whole time? Then it could be:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Exit to menu
<br/>
2. Type make (includes file copy)
<br/>
3. Test it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Test the rom, soft reset back to the menu, write updated rom to card, and then use the card's menu to go up a dir and back in (to re-read the dir containing new rom). Or maybe the firmware needs to "unload" the device and re-init first. Too bad we couldn't get the Homebrew Menu on that card and then we could code the necessary functions to do the re-init if required.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The best solution I've seen so far for development is the one used by ps2dev.org:
<br/>
- run a server app in the console that listens to a given port
<br/>
- run an app (ps2client) in your computer that connects to the console and transfter all data (app binary and program files) to the console RAM throught network
<br/>
- the server app then executes the transfered binary that is in RAM
<br/>
<br/>
You get printfs in your computer and can even run gdb.
<br/>
If DS had a system like this one, development would be sooooooooo much easier I can't even tell you guys.<br/>_________________<br/>Iuri Fiedoruk
