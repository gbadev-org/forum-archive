    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi fellas.
<br/>
I've been following mr. Rogers' <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/manual_setup.php" target="_blank">step-by-step-guide</a>
<br/>
but now I'm stuck and I can not find any help. I've come to the part where it says 
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Change the first line to SET DEVDIR=C:\ndsdev\devkitarm
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
but it doesn't seem to work. My <span style="font-style: italic">Install.bat</span> doesn't look anything like <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/Day1/images/day1_ndslib_install_bat.png" target="_blank">this</a>. It only has two lines in it. 
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">make
<br/>
<br/>
pause
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried both <span style="font-style: italic">adding</span> the line required as well as exchanging the first line (<span style="font-style: italic">make</span>) for it.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had the same problem? I should also tell you that my CVS (whatever that is) installation doesn't look like the one depicted on the website.
<br/>
Compare <a class="postlink" href="http://files.upl.silentwhisper.net/upload1/cvs_finished.JPG" target="_blank">mine</a> to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aaronrogers.com/nintendods/Day1/images/day1_tortoisecvs_checkout_complete.png" target="_blank">Mr Rogers'</a>. See how I miss the entire <span style="font-style: italic">ndslib/startup</span> library?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be really glad if you could help me with this. The guide has been really helpful so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As has been said, you're better off with the devkitPro updater but completely remove everything you've set up using that guide first. Uninstall msys then delete the ndsdev folder you created and set your environment variables back to the way they were before you started.
<br/>
<br/>
The latest version of the updater/installer is 1.2.7

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Manually removing things I have no idea how they got there or what they are is not my cup of tea. By the way. I have tried the devKitPro already. It didn't work and that's why I tried to install it this way in the first place. I have gotten used to Visual studio 2003 and thought I could install it so it worked with that. But I'll just have to quit with that.
<br/>
Is there a way to easily install it with Dev-c++? I tend to like that program as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Well thanks anyhow. I'll just go back to genuine C++programming with DirectX. That is working partly as it is :S</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All the devkitpro installer does is unzip the libs and devkits (that you choose at install time) to the selected directory and then sets up the environment variables for you so that "make" will function as expected.  The eviron variables are set unix style as that is what make likes.  If you prefer to unzip things yourself and set the variables this is quite simple if a bit more tedius and you dont get the nice little auto update feature from the installer <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/setup.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/setup.shtml</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This makes integration with visual studio very simple: Create a new makefile project; type make and make clean in the build options box of the new project wizard; Copy one of the template projects from the libnds examples to the project dir and you are good to go. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/visual-c++-express.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.devkitpro.org/visual-c++-express.shtml</a>  --this guide is for 2005 express but works with trivial modification for VS 6.0 and 2003, 2005 full versions.
<br/>
<br/>
If you need to compile from a dos prompt (or batch file) you will need to set dos style path and variables manualy...path=c:/devkitarm/bin;%path%  is all you really need to compile from the command line.  It is also helpful to set an environment variable which points to your library.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or in proper English: I don't really know what you're talking about. I'm supposed to create a new project? I've never heard of makefiles before.

in 2005:
<br/>
file-&gt;new-&gt;project-&gt;visual c++-&gt;makefile project
<br/>
<br/>
in 2003 and VS 6.0
<br/>
something very similar but i forget the specifics.  Pretty sure wntrmutes guide i posted has that sort of detail.  Takes a few minutes to figure out but once you do makeing a new project is only slightly more a pain than making a blank project for a win app (takes an extra step of copying a template project--allthough this is also avoidable with a simple to write plugin).  Worth figuring out if you have access to visual studio.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
