    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys, i know that it's possible to use Visual C++ Express to code for the NDS but is it possible to use Visual C# Express too? I'm wondering this as im not all that familiar with C++ 
<br/>
<br/>
If so, how would i go about doing this? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any and all replys</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no, there is currently (and unlikely ever to be) a C# runtime for the ds. you can use the visual studio express IDE to to write the code in C or C++ but you can not use the bundled MS compiler. dovoto at drunkencoders has created visual studio project templates for the ds and gba - <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14788&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14788&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=</a> it creates a makefile based project that will call the devkitarm compiler, etc.
<br/>
you need to run the devkitpro installer first (if you have not already) - <a class="postlink" href="http://devkitpro.org/downloads" target="_blank">http://devkitpro.org/downloads</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interestingly, .NET Micro, which is the .NET stack targeted for embedded devices, is now an open sourced project.  Porting that stack to the NDS could make for a rather interesting project, I think... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it is open sourced for development, but I believe there is licensing fees if you release something. I think there was also something about limiting the amount of time your demos could run before they shutdown.
<br/>
<br/>
it does look interesting though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you have any evidence for this?  According to this MS blog post:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/netmfteam/archive/2009/11/15/net-micro-framework-version-4-0-ships-open-source-community-development-and-more.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/netmfteam/archive/2009/11/15/net-micro-framework-version-4-0-ships-open-source-community-development-and-more.aspx</a>

<br/>
The framework is available under the Apache license, which is about as liberal as it gets.  Additionally, the author claims:
<br/>
<br/>
"Fourth, it?s all still free.  We announced the removal of the ?per unit? royalties from the runtime distribution licenses and the fees for the porting kit last Spring.  We continue to follow that path. There will be no fees from Microsoft associated with the use of the platform. "
<br/>
<br/>
So, AFAICT, the platform, itself, is free. 
<br/>
<br/>
Intriguingly, according to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Micro_Framework), the platform is already supports ARM as a target, too.  Oh, and that same article also claims:
<br/>
<br/>
"Microsoft does not charge fees for developing applications using the .NET Micro Framework and makes an SDK freely available for download and can be used with all version of Visual Studio including the free Express editions."
<br/>
<br/>
So it's looks to be about as free as possible, *and* already ARM compatible... :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Didn't someone also do a mini-port of Mono to the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
But still, I'd recommend C++ either way.  Yes, it's a huge massive gargantuan beast of a language, but you don't have to know all of it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you focus on the basic features, I'd say it's approximately 35.8% harder to use than C#.  Give or take 50%.
<br/>
<br/>
(It's about 5000% harder to set up a decent build process, but I'd imagine Homebrew Inc. LLC (tm) has already done that work for you.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
EDIT: somehow I ended up download version 3 instead of 4. so, ignore what I said. sorry for the confusion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
