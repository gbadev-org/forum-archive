<span style="font-weight: bold">what is T9 predictive input?</span>
<br/>
T9 predictive input is a scheme used in mobile phones by which a word is entered by pressing the number which the letter appears on only once. So for example the word 'face' is entered by keying in 3223.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is this post all about?</span>
<br/>
I wrote 'java' code for T9 input for a programming competition; and it has just occured to me that it may be of use in DS input schemes. So if anyone is interested i will give them the code
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">How does T9 Work?</span>
<br/>
Each word is given a probability that it will appear. When keying numbers the most probable word will appear. This is achieved by building two tree structures - one for the letters in the words, and one for the numbers
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What has it got to do with DS Dev?</span>
<br/>
Text input seems to be of use in the DS realm; and 9 keys takes up more space than an entire keyboard. Besides the thumb 'thingy' for the DS makes its usage similar to that of a mobile phone when it comes to keying in numbers.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What can it do for me the DS 'input' developer?</span>
<br/>
I will give you my code for to handle this problem - maybe even port it to C for you if you have trouble doing so. And if you need input; why not use T9? Many people are much faster at keying txt messages than they are at writing emails too ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you telling me there are actually people who can use a telephone style keypad (with or without predictive text completion) faster than a keyboard?
<br/>
<br/>
Besides the fact that predictive input slows me down more than anything. I spend more time looking to see if my phone has guessed the right word yet then just typing the damn thing out in the first place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
well yes! There do exist people within this world without proficient keyboard skills - and as txting is so popular many people are much more skilled at txting. After all not everyone in the world is in the IT sector</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When "txting" has become more popular than typing, I guess it is about time for me to check out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well you are more likely to send a txt to a friend in an emergency, and typing skills are mostly limited to the application of work so if your work does not involve regular typing then what need do you have?
<br/>
<br/>
When you are in the sector of IT you are surrounded by regular typists and take typing skills for granted. Just try to think of how much time a macdonalds worker actually devotes to typing after returning from the pub after a days work. And in the case of gamers - how much time do they spend actually typing inbetween playing?
<br/>
<br/>
But nethertheless message ease seems to be a great input scheme</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A predictive text entry system uses characters disambiguation based on a dictionary. In other words, guesses what letters are "likely" when you press a key that has three or four letters on them.
<br/>
<br/>
Since T9 uses the current legacy letter assignment (i.e., PQRS on key 7) it cannot possibly do a better job compared to a key assignment specifically created to separate high-frequency letters. Notice that both R and S are quite frequent and on the same key. Also H and I, and N and O are on the same key.
<br/>
<br/>
MessagEase, on the other hand, is frequency based. If you use it with a dictionary (and you can; they have a demo for a cell phone that is dictionary based on their website) its disambiguation is much more accurate than T9.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you use Messagease in its tap/drag mode on DS. then you can enter each character with a single tap/drag, including @ % &amp;  etc. Try doing that with a T9 keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
Messagease already runs on PDAs, takes a smaller space, and has bigger keys compared to QWERTY. Yet it provides full text entry. Someone over here was working on it. I think it would make DS a powerfull text messging machine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am sure the good people at <a href="http://www.exideas.com" target="_blank">www.exideas.com</a> would work out an easy deal to make MessagEase availalbe on DS. They are quite cooperative and support their users quite well.
