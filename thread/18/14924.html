    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We have an 83 emulator, and an 85 emulator, and a Genesis emulator that works at full speed with no sound(jenesisDS), so would an 89 be feasible? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89</a>

Specs:

10-12Mhz 68k processor

256KB main RAM(190KB available to the user)
<br/>
2MB flash memory(700KB available to the user for storing apps/etc.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most likely, yes.
<br/>
Probably better off emulating the TI92+ instead of the TI89.
<br/>
<br/>
I bet it would take a lot more work to come up with a high quality and highly usable input system.
<br/>
I could see it now... touchscreen to move the cursor, touchscreen to click on a previously entered equation, hold click for a copy/paste context menu, but making a really good user interface would take much more time than emulating the TI89.
<br/>
<br/>
We already got the 68k core (assuming the 68k core source is available), and can scrounge up code to emulate the other hardware from another TI89 emulator.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
