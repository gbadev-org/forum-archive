    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi there to all,
<br/>
<br/>
recently, on the 13th of May 2004, i purchased a 256MB EZF-advance with gbagod.com for USD116.00. 
<br/>
<br/>
i opted for courier shipping because i figured since they were based in Indonesia and i'm in Malaysia, the shipping would be reasonable. 
<br/>
<br/>
they shipped it on the 17th and it arrived on the 18th.
<br/>
<br/>
the cart came in a very good package and it also included a 4MB GBA memory stick which i didnt notice when i made the purchase. 
<br/>
<br/>
all in all, it was a good transaction at a decent price (but i guess you guys outside Asia would have to pay a higher price for shipping) and i would do business with them again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
