    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Total GBA ? Recommended (5 Star)
<br/>
<br/>
The quality of the blank cartridge was never in doubt but I didn?t want to pay ?20 shipping costs from America or elsewhere. I wanted a UK supplier, at reasonable cost.
<br/>
I found Total GBA from a link from an obscure site and it offered my perfect solution ? a 256Mb cart &amp; USB cable for a mere ?49.95 delivered!! I?m normally a doubtful person and I was unsure whether I would ever see my cartridge. I copied every screen print of my order etc (as you do) in case I had to make a claim later. Well I needn?t have worried ? after placing my order on a Saturday night, the postman delivered my order on Tuesday morning. Now that?s what I call SERVICE! I?ve tested the cartridge and the software that I downloaded from the site ? they work perfectly. My order even arrived in a nice little box as shown in the pictures on the website.
<br/>
I think the website only sells the 256 Mb cart but I?d love them to give a price for a 512 cart if they can supply them - I?m unable to back-up my Urbz-Sims In The City game to a 256 cart (it won?t fit!).
<br/>
I have never joined or added a comment to a forum before, but I felt I had to write this for the benefit of any other UK purchasers. I would definitely order from this company again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The Urbz is a 256 Mbit (32 MByte) cart. You might need to size-strip it or tell the writer software not to write a "loader".

Sounds legit enough.  But I maintain that before your explanation the situation did seem a bit odd.  I personally wouldn't want to do business with a company that inflated its review scores on a forum, and though I no longer believe this to be the case, if it was the case the community ought to know about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems like TotalGBA, as well as kicktrading, e2city and (tnd) MW Electronics all point to this forum for leaving feedback (which explains the low post counts). I havent found any reasons to believe any of the posts in any of these topics are made by anyone working for any of these companies, so I dont think you need to worry about that abilyk.

Does anybody else think that those two pages have a lot in common? Their web designs are almost identical (look at the logo, the menus, and the lack of the usual statements at the bottom). They both use the same PayPal program and the only contact information is a single e-mail address in both cases. The domain whois replies both show that the registrant wanted to hide their personal information.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think I would worry about that stuff too much. The site similarities could be due to a similar/duplicate template. Many of these stores just purchase a cookie cutter web site. That could also explain the paypal.

<br/>
If that is not the case, maybe it is the same company, just operating from 2 virtual storefronts, not a bad idea really. Though it does tend to make one paranoid, I doubt it would be anything to worry about at this point. Although, I ordered my 512mb xrom from easybuy2000 and had no problems, but others have...

<br/>
<br/>
I follow your advices &amp; i tryed TotalGBA.com for my second flash card (i needed another one for my Nintendo DS).
<br/>
<br/>
The main reason i ordered mine @ TotalGBA was the price: ~ 64? for a 256Mbit flash kit with shipping included is really interesting.
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered it on wednesday the 8th, they send it the same day &amp; guess what i found on my mailbox this morning ? The card ! 3 days only to receive it here in France &amp; the package was well protected, i recommend this shop + EFA cards are really great products, a looot better than the F2A one i used to have...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.  They have been very fast in sending the product.  The pursuit of the shipment also is good.  I had a problem:  unit EFA was damaged (it did not work).  I put a mail, and they responded express to it.  They indicated to me to return to them the unit defective.  Thus I did it, and they sent other to me than it works perfectly, plus a small gift.  In my opinion, they deserve a very high note.  They have responded perfectly, with professionalism.

Hola. Han sido muy r?pidos en mandar el producto. El seguimiento del env?o tambi?n es bueno. Tuve un problema: la unidad EFA estaba da?ada (no funcionaba). Les puse un correo, respondieron r?pido. Me indicaron que mandara la unidad defectuosa. As? lo hice, y me mandaron otra que funciona perfectamente, m?s un peque?o regalo. En mi opini?n, se merecen una nota muy alta.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bought the 256mb EFA from these guys a few weeks back, so have been using it for a bit now.
<br/>
<br/>
Ordering was pretty good (I'd completely forgotten I had a PayPal account). Ordered it on a Wednesday evening (I live in the UK by the way). Was dispatched on Thursday morning and arrived on Sunday in the funky little wooden box.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, could have been faster, but I guess that's the postal service.
<br/>
<br/>
Cartridge itself works nice enough, has had one or two teeny problems, one involving the cartridge not registering on the PC (well it did register, but seemed to be locked - however, a quick unplug/replug sorted it) and one not moving a few sprites around memory as they should (this has since been sorted - don't know how, I just gave it a fresh copy of the ROM).
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, the cartridge itself works great on my GBA, DS and even my GBA Player through the Cube. The software used to transfer stuff over seemed a bit confusing at first (you can tell I'm new!) but I got the hang of the essentials.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, pretty good delivery, pretty good product and I'm not arguing with the price (especially since I haven't checked out the competition, but this seemed cheap enough).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On sept 4th I purchased the 256Mbit EFA-Linker cartridge from TotalGBA.com, I received it a few days later only to find that the flash memory on the cart was faulty and wouldn't retain any downloaded information. I emailed Pete at TotalGBA and it was agreed that the cart would be replaced upon return, I posted back the cart and waited, few days later I received an email saying the faulty cart had been received back and a replacement 512Mbit cartridge was being sent to me as the stock of the 256Mbit version had run out, excellent I thought, double the capacity for the same money, any other company would have made a customer wait until new stock of the 256Mbit cart arrived. I received the 512Mbit cart and charged it thoroughly before use, I loaded the EFA-client software fully with ROM's and began to download, no problems with this cartridge, everything worked flawlessly and as advertised, in all I would say I was lucky to have received a faulty cart first, the customer service at TotalGBA.com was exceptional and I recommend them highly.
<br/>
I had one issue with the instruction manual for the cart, I downloaded from EFA.cc. It was written in poor chinese/english, so to avoid any confusion for new users on the Extreme Flash Advance, I edited and corrected the mistakes and a proper English Language version with FAQ can be downloaded here:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently ordered a EFA-Linker 512mb from TotalGBA.
<br/>
What a fantastic product and service they provided. 
<br/>
I was contacted via email immediately to confirm my order, and once again contacted the next day, to confirm item had been sent First Class and required a signature on delivery.
<br/>
I ordered at 6.00pm on Tuesday and received within 48 Hours on Thursday morning of same week at 11.30am. 
<br/>
I already owned a great EZFA 256mb card which i thought would take a lot to equal, this EFA-LINKER 512Mb is Fantastic, You can even load your own BMP Pic's as your Background.
<br/>
I had searched for a few days before i ordered from TotalGBA, they were by far the best i found for price.
<br/>
I have now tested the card, and installed a background Pic, something which i could not do on my EZFA 256Mb card.
<br/>
Everything worked brilliantly on the EFA-Linker 512Mb card, and with a very fast write speed!!!
<br/>
I also used the TotalGBA website to download the most uptodate Drivers and Client for the EFA-Linker 512Mb card, i done this before i had even received my new card, as i knew from previous experience with other Flash Cards, DRIVERS AND CLIENT SOFTWARE are required for Flash Cards to work.
<br/>
The download even included a EFA-Linker Pdf manual, step by step guide, for How To: Install of Drivers and Client, Brilliant if you are new to Flash Cards!!!
<br/>
I highly recommend TotalGBA for their excellent allround service, I would definately use again, and highly recommend if you are looking for a Flash Cartridge!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ordered an EFA II in the past from them, no hassles.
<br/>
<br/>
EZ Flash IV and V both ordered this time, arrived only a couple of days after ordered, working fine.
<br/>
<br/>
It's good that they have a fast download link of the client and manuals etc (as the chinese site is painfully slow) although it would be handy to have a proper English language quick reference to the products available on their website, as the info of how the carts work is slightly ambiguous in places. Having said that, they were very helpful by email in answering the couple of queries I had. For the EZF IV, which I bought to use in my GBA Micro, It seems the FAQ linked from the Chinese site (which isn't maintained by Totalgba obviously) is more focused on getting the EZF IV running on a DS. So there's a gap there to be filled by some good local knowledge :)

Two thumbs up!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just thought I might leave some feedback on my experience with TotalGBA:
<br/>
<br/>
Ordered an ezflash V bundle edition including the slot 1 cartridge and the 3 in 1 expansion pack, together with a microSD card (the correct fast Japanese PNY type comes in the full pack) and reader all from TotalGBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Everything works like a dream and I have no complaints at all. (I'm really new to softmodding, but info was readily available in a lot of unofficial forums and wikis, thus making things much, much easier). 
<br/>
<br/>
Delivery was really fast and could be tracked (only till it left the UK. After that, the Spanish mail service (I live in Spain) took over and took it's time - as usual - even so, it took around 5 days for it to reach from UK to Spain, which is fast enough). Price was very reasonable, delivery was free.
<br/>
<br/>
All in all I'm happy (I was thinking of ordering from China, which might be cheaper, but delivery took much longer and was expensive).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I bought a EZ Flash V from TotalGBA back in Febuary - it arrived in less than a week (despite being out of stock on the site at the time of ordering) and they sent it to my work address as I asked, which not all places will do. Great.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the cartridge had a dodgy connection somewhere and occasionally failed to register the flash card at all, it got to the point where it just stopped working. I emailed to see if they would exchange it and then sent it back last week. A replacement was sent out and I got it today. The new cartridge works great, a completely trouble free exchange - just what you want in the (hopefully unlikely) event that you are unlucky enough to get the one that quality control missed...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I ordered an EZ flash 3 in 1 (GBA size) on 27/04/2008, it was sent on 28/04 and I received it (Greece) on 01/04. Very fast!
<br/>
The problem was that they sent me the NDSlite version not the GBA size one for my DSPhat.

I send them an e-mail, they replied to me in about an hour and told me they will send me the right one.

Besides this they told me I can keep the other cart without needing to pay anything extra!

I haven't tried much on it yet and should there be issues I'll make sure to drop an e-mail, but less than two days for an air mail parcel is great (thanks Royal Mail?). I got my item in additional bubble wrap, was kind of hoping for the original packing but I read that in order to assure low shipping costs, they unpack the item sometimes. It didn't look particularly used though so I'm not bothered too much. :)
<br/>
<br/>
TotalGBA was recommended to me on a forum - I'm really happy I decided to trust the guy. Can't trust the mail though so I took secure shipping. With the item at such low price (15 at TotalGBA, twice to thrice as much over here?) I thought paying 8 Euros for the shipping isn't that bad at all. I mean, that's what the Mail charged anyway, no rip off at all. :)

<br/>
<br/>
Our stock has been seized by HM Revenue &amp; Customs due to an application made by Nintendo. As a result we have effectively been shut down.
<br/>
<br/>
Customers who have purchased products during 2008 (and December 2007) that are still under warranty need not worry. Customer service and customer satisfaction have always been our highest concerns and we will honour all requests to replace a faulty product still under warranty until December 31st, 2009.
<br/>
<br/>
We will also continue to provide product support to all current customers by e-mail (see below) until the same date; December 31st, 2009.
<br/>
<br/>
We have had a lot of fun serving you during the 4 years we have been in operation and we would have liked to continue doing so.
<br/>
<br/>
From the whole TotalGBA team, we would like to thank all our loyal customers and wish them and their families a merry xmas and a happy new year.
<br/>
<br/>
Until next time,
<br/>
<br/>
The TotalGBA team</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
