If you dont have a flash card, GET ONE!!!!! (best things on earth)

This guy was really good too! I'm not a big interet shopper, but this guy sent  both cards to my friend hyper fast, and it was pretty chearp, (Compared to all the other websites my buddy looked at).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mark and e2city are located a short distance from me, so that just made everything even more perfect!
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered the 256Mb Powerstar cart.  Within an hour or so of Mark actually receiving his shipment of these carts, mine was in the mail.  It got to my doorstep in 2 days.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen a lower price anywhere.  $137 CDN to my doorstep in 2 days.  I doubt any other supplier can even come close to that!!  My other friends that have flash carts payed between $160-180 after shipping and border fees...and they had to wait several weeks for them to clear the border.
<br/>
<br/>
As has been said before, Mark kept me updated EVERY step of the way.  Every delay he had in getting them was relayed to me.  He let me know that it was in the mail as soon as he got back from the post office.
<br/>
<br/>
All of my friends with GBA's have the flash carts, and my other friends now want a GBA and a flash cart from Mark!

<br/>
I ordered my EZ-FlashII 256Mb PS.  I recieved an E-mail every step letting me know the status of my order, and as soon as it came in stock he E-mailed me saying it has been shipped and should be 2 business days at most and I got mine the next business day.  I have never made an online order and received my order so fast and that he is based in Canada and I am in Ontario, being Canadian and ordering from another Canadian online retailer is always a good thing.
<br/>
<br/>
The price is amazing as well, $137CDN, I have not been able to find any others nearly as good as this price.  When I got my cart I had a few questions that I E-mailed to Mark and he replied in very short time, 3 questions all answered faster than I have ever received a reply to a question from anyone.
<br/>
<br/>
The service can't be beat, the product is great.  I showed this to my friends as well and they are all planning to buy as well.  Keep up the good work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The EZ-Flash manufacturer no longer includes CDs for EZ-Flash II PS because the CD drivers tend to get outdated very quickly. There is always a newer Client+driver available for download at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ezflash.cn/indexe.asp" target="_blank">http://www.ezflash.cn/indexe.asp</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Please send us an email if you have questions like this and if you wish to receive a more prompt reply. We will be able to help you with the installation and use of your cartridge.

<br/>
<br/>
- e2city's customer service pwns everyone elses.  seriously
<br/>
<br/>
- cheap prices. sure, there's not much in stock, but you wouldn't want to buy something else anyway... at least... i think so...
<br/>
<br/>
- fast shipping.  shipped a few hours after i placed my order.  i was just unlucky enough to order near the weekend, but i guess it was just fate
<br/>
<br/>
- product in perfect working condition.  none of that cheap ripoffs other less reliable sites sell.
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, bottom line:  if your thinking of getting a flashcard and you live in canada or the us, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  GO BUY FROM E2CITY</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are two ways I can see this:

1) This is the <span style="font-weight: bold">best online retailer I've ever dealt with</span>, and as such you should buy from him because he is so damn good.

or,
<br/>
2) Our new alien overlords have arrived on earth and are seeking to work their way into our culture through <span style="font-weight: bold">inhumanly good online sales</span> websites, hoping to undermine our social and political systems. You should order from them to appease your future masters, thus assuring yourself a better place in the hierarchy of power in our dystopian future.

At first I was skeptical if I should order or not, since it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the only site that I found with low prices.. so I sent a few e-mails, and was I amazed! It was replied within a day on weekends, within the hours on weekdays... the communication was great, now all I needed to do was confirm the delivery... reading all the previous posts from here AND on gamefaqs.com I quickly ordered an EFA last monday and recieved it today(I live in Southern California, so 5 business days), and I am now enjoying it :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I live in Canada so along with the positive feedback for e2city is what attracted me to this retailer. I placed my order on a Friday, and I received the order the following Monday! Now that is fast shipping from B.C. to Ontario.
<br/>
<br/>
Mark of e2City was on top of things from the beginning. I ordered in the early morning western time, and received a reply mid-afternoon western time that the item was about to be shipped. Shortly thereafter, I received another email from Mark saying that the order had been shipped and should arrive in 2-3 business days. He also gave me a tracking number. Essentially the order was shipped on the weekend, and I received it in one business day (technically). The tracking number showed up in Canada Post's system on Monday, but I had already received my package :)
<br/>
<br/>
I had moderate to significant difficulty getting the drivers to work on my computer, I'll leave that for another post. The short answer is, that after spending quite some time on the manufacturer's web site gba-toys.com forums, I was finally able to figure things out. I spent an entire evening and a full system format however doing so (Yes I read two different user guides and thought I was ready before-hand). Now everything seems to work perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Service</span>: 10/10
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Shipping</span>: 10/10
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Packaging</span>: 7/10 - (the device is in a tiny box in a large padded envelope. I would have preferred tighter padding, but the box was not damagad at all.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Price</span>: 10/10 - (seems as cheap as anywhere else you may find it in North America). 10/10 if you buy the Extreme Flash Advance, this is the cheapest price I have seen anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Manual/Drivers</span>: 5/10 - None included. The driver issue makes sense, as they are constantly updated and you can obtain them from the official website.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the manual that e2city has linked on their website (which I followed to the letter), is a bit simplisitc and doesn't cover any troubleshooting issues that you may run across. The link is <a href="http://www.canerdian.ca/gba.html." target="_blank">http://www.canerdian.ca/gba.html.</a> This is not entirely e2city's fault, as it seems the manufactuer gba-toys doesn't even have an offical manual of their own :E
<br/>
<br/>
It is a decent beginners manual, and I recommend reading it - just be forewarned, using this method may not allow proper installation of the usb cable drivers. This is not an all-ecompassing method. Before you give up, refer to <a href="http://www.gba-toys.com" target="_blank">www.gba-toys.com</a> forums. I will give links or summarize my eventual (and believe fully correct) success later.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Overall</span>: 8.75/10 (not a scientific calculation :))
<br/>
I had to take a full mark off because of the <span style="font-style: italic">lack</span> of detail and <span style="font-style: italic">simplicity</span> of the manual. If this is fixed, 9.75/10. Overall, I would have to say I am very satisified with e2city.com
<br/>
<br/>
Regards
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit</span>: Just wanted to say that I would indeed order from e2city.com again, and if anyone is curious, I am using Windows XP SP1 with fully updated USB 2 drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit2</span>: When thinking about it, I have not seen a cheaper price in North America for the EZF Advance (some other sites might be comparable, but not cheaper) and if you order from abroad, then you have to deal with such things as Western Union fees and high shipping fees, which in my evaluation costs more overall, so I have changed my price score to 10/10 from 9/10 and overall 8.75/10 from 8.5/10.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you live in Canada and want good service, pricing, and very fast shipping (not to mention no import duties or tax assessed), order from e2city. Fully recommended. The only issue is the linked manual will be wholly inadequate for some people (I was tempted to just give up and return it but after reading gba-toys.com forums, I finally found my solution after several hours). I think that driver problems are common with this device and windows xp (sp1 perhaps?). I will post what I think is a proper installation elsewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">See my posts above regarding my experience with e2city.com and the EZF Advance I ordered.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, unfortunately, I have run into issues with the EZF Advance. 
<br/>
<br/>
1. It will not keep my saves (not even the clock settings). This was evidenced on several occasions. The save will either be missing upon turning on the GBA, or i will get a message 'corrupt save, deleting', or something to that extent.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Even though the installation was painful, I did get it fully installed (after a system format, which actually wasn't the problem), unfortunately, a further problem has occurred where I can no longer access my flash cart. When it was working, it worked great. I don't doubt that others have had good success with this product, however, it hasn't worked out for me. I suppose I just got unlucky. It happens. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have been in constant contact with Mark from e2city regarding these issues. He has always replied to my emails the same day or latest within 12 hours. He has offered to exchange the EZF Advance no questions asked. I will be replacing it with the EZ2 Powerstar 512 (of course I will pay the difference in price). 
<br/>
<br/>
He will not charge me for shipping the replacement. He even offered to refund me the cost of shipping the return to him. But it's not a problem for me, so I will just cover that. In my exchanges with Mark, he has always been courteous and detail-oriented (ie. he takes the time to discuss something; he has not been curt or rude). I will post again when I receive the replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
e2city has come through with great service and support so far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Been a bit overdue for posting here, but back in September, I bought a 256-megabit EFA card (the combo deal) from e2city, and it arrived about a week after I bought it (the timing overlapped a weekend, so it was 5 business days).  The card's been great; I've used it heavily since, and it's never once given me any trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the only glitch was that e2city's shipping-tracking numbers are pretty much useless, because Canada Post doesn't update their web site with any details until after the package has been <span style="font-style: italic">delivered</span>.  <span style="font-style: italic">*chuckle*</span>.  Oh, well.  But I still highly recommend buying from e2city, both for the quality of products and for the support (when I e-mailed them with questions about the shipping-tracking, they e-mailed me back within 12 hours every time like clockwork).
<br/>
<br/>
I just hope their web site comes back on-line in time for the holidays, because I'm considering buying another EFA cart as a gift...<br/>_________________<br/>Do you suppose if I put a signature here, anyone would read it?
