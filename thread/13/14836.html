    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently ordered two M3 Simply cards and a USB power cable for the Lite, as well as some microSD cards from this retailer.
<br/>
<br/>
Originally I'd ordered an M3 DS Real, but too late I realised that it wouldn't work in my friend's phat DS. I emailed support, and they responded within five minutes, with a useful suggestion for an alternative to the Real (for playing GBA homebrew) that *would* work on a DS phat. I decided to just change the order to an M3 Simply, which Paul happily did and refunded me the difference.
<br/>
<br/>
The merchandise arrived promptly (ordered on Tuesday, arrived on Friday) and in good condition. The only gripe I have is that I couldn't work out how to track the package, but that's not really 01media's fault (it's rather the Netherlands postal service's).
<br/>
<br/>
5/5. Would buy again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
