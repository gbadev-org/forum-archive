    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered an EZ flash 2 from Jandaman's.  It was sent out 2 days after I ordered and arrived after 9 more days (longer than usual but it was right before xmas and actually arrived on xmas eve!).
<br/>
Nicely packaged.  
<br/>
It works!
<br/>
Very good price and the retailer is in the US so no extra fees!
<br/>
I would definitly recommend checking this site out, overall I was very satisfied and am now heading over to resellerratings.com to say the same thing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered an EZ-Flash 512Mb kit from Jandaman's Import Video Game Accessories recently. They take paypal along with the normal methods of payment. I payed with paypal and did not have any problems with the transaction. They also sent several prompt emails providing me with verification and confirmation that my order was completed. There were no problems with my order at all and it arrived in a timely manner. It's great to find someone here in the US that sells these types of imported items. These guys know what they are doing. I will be doing more business with them in the future. Highly recommended!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#27687 - Joat - Tue Oct 19, 2004 4:03 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered an EZFA 256 a week ago Sunday and it shipped last Tuesday.  It arrived some time between Thursday and Saturday (was out of town).
<br/>
<br/>
I'd certainly reccomend Jandaman to others, especially because of the cheap shipping to US addresses ($2.50 for USPS).
<br/>
<br/>
A word of caution to people about the EZFA (nothing to do with Jandaman): They used a USB interface chip made by FTDI, and did *not* change the default USB ID code, so it gets a driver auto-installed by windows XP if you don't have any other FTDI devices installed (the installation instructions at Jandaman cover this situation), but if you own or build other devices using FTDI chips (which really are quite nice), you're in a spot of trouble, since the EZFA drivers and the standard serial driver cannot coexist (all for the sake of the idiots changing one value in the EEPROM)!
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be looking into how to get around this (in case it affects anyone else), but I'm not using any of my projects that use a FTDI chip on a regular basis, so its a low priority right now.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

First I ordered some of those "Adaptoids" way back, then some GBA devkits, and more recently I ordered two Supercard SD's. Each and every time my items arrived in exactly three days of purchase. With so many scams out there (I know, I have been ripped off by Aheadgames), it is nice to have someone you can really rely on.

I ordered a EZ Flash III (1gb) on a sunday, it shipped early on thirsday morning, and i got it today, 1 week and 2 days did it take for the package to get here in my mail box(It was a in a nice little package.) I'm currently charging it.

And to pay $6 to ship to norway is a SMAL price from those who took like $27 just to ship it to norway. It was fast too ^^

Edit:
<br/>
Well I'm not exactly sure where everyone got these "ton of confirmation emails" but I've only received one that vaguely states it's either "processed" and/or "shipped" with no real specifics if it actually WAS shipped or not, let alone any way to track it.  If it was shipped, I'm only two states south (CA) it really shouldn't take more than 3 days to get here... ugh

I sent a customer service email, no response after 2 days.
