    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a less than admirable experience with Sky2k.
<br/>
<br/>
My initial impressions of them were very favorable.  Their website is clean and professional, a welcome change from the HTML soup of some other retailers.  They also appear to have a good grasp of the English language and reasonable prices on both their products and their shipping.
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered an N-Card 16Gb from them, and it took about a week to arrive. (I live on the West Coast of the United States, for comparison.)  I was somewhat surprised to find that the package had come from Hong Kong, given the trouble they go to on their website to point out that they are a Canadian company.  Their Canadian address is valid, so presumably they have their office in Canada but actually ship from HK.  This should be factored into one's shipping expectations.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, they sent me the wrong item.  (An N-Card 8Gb, and with a broken USB adapter to boot.)  When I contacted them by e-mail, they were very helpful and friendly about resolving this.  I had to ship the broken item back on my dime, but it was only to their Canadian address, so it was less than US$1.50.
<br/>
<br/>
They claimed to have sent out a replacement "immediately."  However in actuality they did not send it out until two weeks later.  I found out about this when they sent me confirmation that my replacement had finally shipped, two weeks later.  Shipping took exactly as long as the original shipment, although this time it came from their Canadian address.  The package that arrived was peculiar because instead of a box, I received an envelope containing a cardboard sheet for constructing the box the product should have come in and the unit's various parts bouncing around loose.  But the product seems undamaged, so no harm, no foul.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the product ended up being from a known defective batch of N-CARDs and could not save correctly.  Sky2k was very helpful and even bent their rules to give me a refund, as I had decided I had had my fill of N-CARD and was going to get an R4DS instead.  They promptly refunded my money as soon as I returned the defective N-CARD to them.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I have mixed feelings about this retailer.  They have a good website with excellent prices, and when things went wrong they were very responsive and willing to help.  However, there were significant communications problems, and I feel misled by them on several points.  I would not recommend them to a friend, particularly one not used to dealing with import houses, but I might buy from them again myself if the price were right.<br/>_________________<br/>This post was spawned from an Undefined Error.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
