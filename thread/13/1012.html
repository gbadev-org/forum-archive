<br/>
They took quite long time to deliver, but that can be becuase of the storage shortage...<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My first (ex stock - 24 hours delivery) order with them took 14 weeks, with no explanation.
<br/>
<br/>
I emailed them 5 days ago to ask if they had stock for a further 250 pound order. They haven't even bothered to reply to that.
<br/>
<br/>
Guess I'll be turning to hong kong, from where I've always had good service.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Next day I gave up and bought from Hong Kong. Had my goods 2 days later at 60% of the price. I can only guess CDworld didn't have the stock their web site said they had or presumably they would have wanted to sell it to me.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really enjoyed GBAX's service.
<br/>
<br/>
I got my "gift" from the development compo yesterday, 2 days after I told them what I wanted.
<br/>
I choosed a Gamewallet, but then I asked them if I could get a Afterburner, since it was cheaper than a wallet!
<br/>
They were extremely nice to me, and they gave me a Afterburner + 2 extra AR films + A replacement screen!
<br/>
<br/>
I am very happy with their service and support, thank you GBAX :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My experience was very positive. I ordered an EZ-F 256 kit on Thursday.
<br/>
<br/>
The same evening I got an email saying that they were temporarily out of stock. I replied and asked if they could replace the EZ-F with an F2A should they be unable ship the original order by next week. They said it would be done.
<br/>
<br/>
The next day I got an email saying my order had been shipped. I emailed them and asked which system I was getting. The reply came in half an hour, saying that it would be the EZ-F as they just got more in stock.
<br/>
<br/>
I recieved a tracking number from GBAX and the package arrived a week from the order! Excellent work - the EZ-F is working perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a resounding 10/10 for GBAX</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Viktor Laszlo on Fri Jul 18, 2003 10:53 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
I had the unit shipped to a friend of mine in another country and they didnt have anything againts doing that.
<br/>
They accidently sent the unit to me though, but sent another unit to the correct address straight away without waiting for me to return the first one.
<br/>
<br/>
Good service, fast delivery, no hassle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i recently e-mailed this company for advice...
<br/>
<br/>
 i needed to know what kit to buy that was also compatable with my old flash card as my old hardware for my flash card had broken.
<br/>
<br/>
 i promptly got a reply and was told i did not have to buy a FULL KIT i could easily just buy a new cable that would be compatable with my flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
i have nothing but praise for this company not only did they help me with my enquiry (we exchanged about 5 e-mails and each was as polite as the previous) but the company saved me a lot of money buy advising me to buy just a cable
<br/>
<br/>
my cable has been shipped already (i only ordered this morning) and will arrive with me before 12:00pm tommorrow.
<br/>
<br/>
service 10/10

advice 10/10
<br/>
delivery 10/10
<br/>
web site 8/10 (not a great deal of content but easy to navigate)
<br/>
<br/>
i received fantastic service and will be using this site again in the future
<br/>
i would also reccomend anyone else to use this site
