    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This guy has good prices and decent shipping.  Being in Canada it was a lot more convenient for me than Jandamans which is in the USA.  The EZF 256 is perfect for me, not too big and not too small.  I've had a 512 that's corrupted on me but the 256 is solid.  
<br/>
<br/>
thanks Digital Mods, look forward to getting more stuff off you in the future.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a EZFA cart from digital mods and he's a great guy to deal with.  He offered to deliver it and saved me the hassle from ordering overseas and dealing with customs.

<br/>
I would highly reccomend him to anyone looking for a cart in toronto or surrounding area</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
