    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a GBA SP + F2AU 256mbit there, they sent it from Honk Kong in under a week (but i had to pay extra for fast delivery). But as i received the packet i had to pay 30? VAT, they didn't tell me about VAT in first place... Anyway, the stuff works just fine!

<br/>
This is also very interesting for all germans because the website is german and you can contact them in german!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Best price for F2A ANYWHERE that I've found.
<br/>
<br/>
Good selection of goodies
<br/>
<br/>
Website not as easy to navigate as I'd like
<br/>
<br/>
Ordering system is a joke (You find what you want, then write them an e-mail to place the order)
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I didn't find any hidden costs.  On their site, they do have warnings about customs charges that are out of their control and, as a result, are unpredictable.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I'd rate this site a 9 out of 10.  Lose half a point for site design, half a point for a lack of selection, a full point off for the ordering system, but they get a bonus point for such good prices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At least when you order, you get a reply back from them. It shows that they have a more personal touch to things, like I'm talking to a real person.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very true.  There's a nice warm feeling you get dealing directly with people.
<br/>
<br/>
... unless they're jerks.  
<br/>
<br/>
But for the record, the people at Lan-Kwei that I've dealt with have been very polite, and a pleasure to deal with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
