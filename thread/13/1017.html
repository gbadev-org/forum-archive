    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am rather satisfied from their service. And they're less expensive than others.
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered a Flash Advance 2 256 mbits USB Linker. Then decided to add to it a Flash Advance 2 128(parallel) Linker. This took some time, but only because i gave them an email address to a full mailbox(which i hadn't realised). The status of my order on their WebSite helped me realise it.
<br/>
<br/>
After we settled to join both order in one, it promptly shipped and i'm happy with the product.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, i would order from them again, without a second thought.
<br/>
<br/>
And i think this topic is great, having had to browse everywhere to find where i should buy my stuff. Good idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-weight: bold">Shipping</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered a Flash2Advance on a friday, very early. I received an order confirmation immediately via auto-respond. I suppose they took liberty with their "next <span style="text-decoration: underline">business</span> day delivery" poilcy because it was not shipped until late monday. I received the package around noon on thursday. The Flash2Advance box was wrapped in bubble wrap. Overall, I was pleased with shipping and ordering, it took less than a week to get the package, and I live in a remote area of British Columbia!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Customer Service</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I emailed them a day after it was shipped to ask if it would take longer because I live in a remote area. I received a human reply (no joke) about 5 minutes after I sent the email! He replied in broken english and somewhat rudely, but answered my question nontheless. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess that sums up my experience with them, but I am quite pleased overall. Highly recommended.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After giving up on UK suppliers who couldn't even be bothered to reply to email requesting stock position, I ordered 2 256 F2A sets from these people, using Speedpost - the cheapest option ($20.80). Received goods 2 days later; kit works fine. Declaration marked 'Gift - toys', no duty to pay.
