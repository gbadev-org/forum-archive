    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I placed my order 2 saturdays ago at aprox 11am though Paypal.
<br/>
They updated the status at aprox 11pm to paid
<br/>
The item was shipped on the following Monday and I received it on Friday
<br/>
Considering the item is shipped From China to Canada and I received it from start to finish in less than a week I would say I'm pretty happy.
<br/>
I didnt have to pay any duty although I dont know if its the same for everyone...shipping was almost as much as the item itself but 67.00 US for the Supercard total and the ability to have unlimited storage in terms of CF cards i'm not complaining!
<br/>
item came in its own box and the box itself was within a cardboard box...although the cardboard box came in rough shape from the trip the item and its box were in "perfect" condition. I emailed them a couple of times and they replied each time within 1-3 days...considering it was Chinese new year in China that week I would say that's pretty good...
<br/>
The SuperCard works great in my Nintendo DS!
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In short: Hopebuy is great.  Got exactly what I ordered in about half a week's time.
<br/>
<br/>
Placed my order for my Supercard ($40) on the 14th of February.  I got a notice that it wouldn't ship until the 16th. On the 16th, I got an email confirming that it had been shipped, and a tracking number.  Received it 22 February 2005 (last Tuesday), it took a total of four business days to get here (to Kentucky).  Highly recommended.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered two Supercards, a Superkey and a screen protector.
<br/>
I didn't get any email confirmations, neither when i ordered, nor when the order was shipped, but i could check that on their site, so it's okay.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway i received my order within five days and even the box was in perfect shape. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm very pleased.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Got an EZ-Flash III from their site.  A week later, it came to my house.  Good price too.
<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that I don't like about them, though, is that they put this damn sticker on the linker and the flash cart itself.  The sticker says "ROMMAN.NET", which is apparently their parent and is a massive pirater of ROMS.  I know that these devices are primarily made by the Chinese for piracy but knowing I purchased it from a company who's primary profits come from piracy makes me feel bad.
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that sucks is the sticker is ugly and its impossible to remove without shredding whatever's below it.  They put a sticker on the EZ-Flash III cartridge's sticker, so it'll be impossible to remove without screwing up the look of the flash cart.  I may do it anyway, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
