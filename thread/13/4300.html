    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On Tuesday I placed an order after much research and debating with my self.  Being a newbie to this scene I really waited a long time and read almost everything that I could find.  After looking at all of the recommended retailers I stumbled upon this guy and man was I happy.  I ordered an EZ-Flash II 1 Gb for 144.00 plus shipping and handling.  On Thursday I received my product.  After 8 hours of charging the battery I have successfully burned some home brew ROMS and I am loving this gizmo.  I can't wait to start some home development myself.  Great price, great service and very fast delivery.  I would defiantly recommend this place to anybody.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered my DS Lite and an M3 mini-SD from these folks - I had no problems to speak of.  Everything arrived quickly and in good condition, and were $15-20 less than other US-based retailers (jandaman, divineo).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
