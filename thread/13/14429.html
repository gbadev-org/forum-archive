    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bought an R4 from them a few weeks ago. Soon after, the site blocked Australia (due to a DoS attack) so I couldn't track my order. It arrived after 12 days, and the site went back up again. 
<br/>
<br/>
Coincidence? Conspiracy? I dunno.
<br/>
<br/>
A few days after the package arrived I received an email to make sure everything was okay. I would buy from them again, but I don't know if I can trust them with orders over a few hundred dollars.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered an R4 along with a 1GB MicroSD card and an EZflash 3-in-1. The package arrived after 12 days here in Germany.
<br/>
<br/>
They had marked the package as a gift on the customs form and declared that a "flashlight" would be inside. Some might argue that this practise might get you into trouble but I personally prefer it over going to my customs office. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Also noticeable: Standard shipping is free.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i got that 128Mbit Fire Linker card for $9.21 w/ free shipping.  Took a lil bit of time, I can't remember... but it was fun hacking, and I got my NDSL to flash it using a modified GBAldr.  I like the layout of the site, the support team does their very best at answering questions and of course THE PRICES CANNOT BE BEAT!  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Great prices. I would buy from them again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a DS Fire (2GB) flash cart and linker from them, and although it took them a couple of weeks for them to get a new batch from their supplier, they did a great job of keeping me up to date on the status, and once it WAS in, they shipped it right away.
<br/>
<br/>
Once shipped, I was shocked to see it arrive at my house in Southern Califiornia only two days later.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would absolutely buy from them again, as I feel that they are reliable, even if they are a little slow in their supply chain for the particular item that I wanted.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just ran into this site and I'm a little skeptical.  For there to be free shipping on items that cost barely anything seems weird.  The prices are great and even if some of the stuff is off-brand or what not, you can't beat those prices for many situations.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling many things there are bootleg-type things though...but for electronics, if they work and don't blow up, I think they would be fine (Figure bootlegs are what really bug me, as I collect them and the bootlegs are really hurting the figure market....completely different topic though).

Anyone have any comments?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ordered a dstt, an efa linker 512Mb and a white replacement shell for my ds phat, the price is just wonderfull, everything came in 10days. but unfortunately the white shell had one of the hinge part was shatered. I just took a picture of the defect part, send it trough the RMA system of DX and they send me a new one the next morning without even needing to send back the broken part. RMA service seem pretty great, I'll surely order more from them.
<br/>
<br/>
hum by the way, I did no choose the "gift package" option, but my order came labeled as a "gift" and with a declared value of 45hk$... it went trough customs without any additional taxe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
