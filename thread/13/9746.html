    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This one should be interesting..  Personal experiance.. my order was 1 day short of taking a whole month! (I'm in the USA).  But, others have received their order in just a few days (UK people, I believe).  When I requested info reguarding my order (via e-mail), their response was quick stating they were waiting from the product to be shipped from their UK location to their USA office.  Once I actually received my order, product was as stated on their site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered from them and received an email a day later that my order was rejected as they couldn't charge my credit card. I checked my credit card statement and found that I was charged and I began sending them emails, sent 3 emails a few days apart for each and never received a response. However, the max media launcher came a few days later so I assume that it was just a mistake in their system and that their customer service is terrible. Either way it works out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Order: 100189242
<br/>
Order Date:  6/9/2006 10:03:53 AM
<br/>
Order Status:  Complete &amp; Despatched
<br/>
<br/>
Today is the 18th, so it's been 9 days, but from a previous reply it looks like it will take around 13-29 days if you are in the U.S.
<br/>
<br/>
I am situated in KS.  I also tried emailing them to check on the order, and when you email them, they lead you to this site:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.datelcustomerservice.com/" target="_blank">http://www.datelcustomerservice.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
And they tell you to solve your problems there and you will NOT receive a follow-up email.  If you STILL haven't resolved your problem, you tell you again to email them, with the subject heading "Order Status" and to include your order number in the body of the email, as well as any inquiry.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'll post when I get the product in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I sent them an email with the subject heading "Order Status" on Sat. the 17th, and they replied that Mon. the 19th.  Wouldn't you know they DO have a tracking number for every order.  They gave me the tracking # in the response e-mail - it's via UPS.com.  I don't know why they don't provide it on their website when you go to log in to check your order.
<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention there are two types of shipping.  Standard which says it requires up to 10 business days, and Express, which requires up to 5.  Of course I stuck with Standard, and it cost me a little under $7 for the shipping fee.
<br/>
<br/>
Today is Tues. the 20th, and I have received the MML in the mail.  The "FROM" address is from a 'Linda Smith C/O Datel' in Clearwater, FL 33760.  The packing slip inside of course had England on it, since I suppose that is where CJ is based.  
<br/>
<br/>
Item took 12 days total from the day I placed the order, to the day it arrived.  Not counting Sat. and Suns., it took 8 days, and not counting Suns, it took 10.  
<br/>
<br/>
Not as bad as I thought, but shipping from Clearwater, FL, it could of came here a bit faster.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought the Max Media Launcher from them. It took 9 days to get to Canada and I ordered it on a Saturday. Great product no complaints about the company. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, a word of caution for all those who order from Canada. It turns out the UK postal service made a mistake with declaring the value of the package and so I was charged for the duty and taxes on a $40.00 CDN item instead of a $20.00 CDN item. The total cost to pick it up was $18.64 CDN. I am resolving this issue with Revenue Canada.
<br/>
<br/>
Update: Codejunkies was nice enough to refund me half the money of the purchase to compensate for the accidental mislabelling of the package.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by zazery on Tue Jul 18, 2006 4:28 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I placed an order for a GC Action Replay and a GC SD Media Launcher (after seeing that their Games n' Music was a good product [bought it in stores] I wanted some homebrew on my Cube).  The site immediately screwed up my order, then two weeks later after slow emailing back and forth, found out that my order got cancelled and didn't go through.
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I ordered again from a different place (ConsoleSource.com) where I could get the old (more supported) Action Replay.  Hopefully it'll get here soon :)<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
