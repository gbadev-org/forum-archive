    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I may be naive, but I did scan my VISA card and ID and sent it to them.
<br/>
<br/>
Only a few days later I got a UPS package in the mail with a 512mbit X-rom  (I was ordering to norway, so the shipping time was very good).. The shipping price was a bit high ($37), but I appreciate it appearing in my mailbox as fast as it did.. It also came in a discrete package, with value set to $5, so I didn't have to pay any VAT..
<br/>
<br/>
I too think the credit card scanning thing was strange, why don't they use some authorized credit card service?
<br/>
<br/>
Even if my experience was rather good, I must say I'm a bit scared of all the negative publicity, and I don't know if I would trust them again. And their return history also seems a bit dodgy..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought a modchip from them and it arrived broken.  It was packaged in just a standard envelope and the chip was taped to a piece of plastic, neither of which is good for an electronic chip.
<br/>
<br/>
I emailed their tech support but didn't get an answer until it was conveniently passed the return time window.
<br/>
<br/>
They said I can have store credit but I had already purchased a chip from someone else.
<br/>
<br/>
I would strongly suggest staying away from this company</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered the 512MB flash at beginning of may and they have problem with their billing system for a month. I still haven't got the card so I cancel the order. 
<br/>
<br/>
They didn't mention about billing system anywhere at their web site and their confirm e-mail. For those people who made order but expect to get them within a week, you better check with them and make sure their billing is running.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I purchased an X-Rom from them, it arrived the day after they shipped it (I paid $11 for shipping) and works perfectly. From what I have read, this retailer is decent but has trouble with support after the sale. I risked it because of the much lower price, everything turned out fine.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.landofbob.com" target="_blank">www.landofbob.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I asked kicktrading.ca a question about Supercard and received a reply within minutes.  I think I know where I will place my order.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I had ordered an X-ROM 512 Mb cart/link cable from them and it was supposed to ship Nov 1.  Now their web site says to expect availability on Dec. 15th and I received an email from them that they cancelled my order since the item was out of stock "indefinately".
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm a bit bummed that I didn't get the merchandise I wanted, but I don't feel badly about easybuy2000 since they handled the matter appropriately.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
