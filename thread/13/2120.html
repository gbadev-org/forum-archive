    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They have the lowest prices, but how do you pay them.  You pay a service fee to western union that gobbles up most of the savings or a bank transfer, Bank of America charges $45 fee.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm in Canada,
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered 2 EZ-Flash II from Winsunx thursday november 25th and received my ordered the following monday (november 29th).  Very fast shipping (but a little pricey: 22$us to ship to Canada) and best prices around.  Very fast reply by mail, and now with the possibility to pay via paypal (that's what I did) this store is one of the best around... I would buy from them again nytime!
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this comment may help you in choosing the right dealer!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was alittle uneasy ordering from them since the last hardware reply was from 2004, but this was the only online store that still had the EZ-Flash Advance USB linker and cart in stock. (and it had the cheapest retail price)
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered it online, paying with paypal on Thursday, November 3rd, and I recieved it on Tuesday, November 8th. Tested it out, and it works great.
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote them an email asking about paying with paypal, because you have to go to the paypal site and pay to a specific address, you can't pay directly off the company site. They replied to my email the next day; after I had already found the answer to my question in their service section of the page, of course :-P
<br/>
<br/>
While you may get a few laughs from their bad english grammer, their english is more then clear enough to get the message across.
<br/>
<br/>
When I recieved my packaged, it came in a larger MP3 player box, wrapping completely in tape. The five minutes it took removing all that tape was scary because I thought they sent the wrong thing, but thankfully, my package was packed snuggly inside with some padding.
<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely recommend this site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believe the total was about $117 including shipping to UK via 5-day EMS.

Hopefully should have my goods by the week's end - let's see how this one turns out. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used them a couple weeks ago to get my M3 and a passcard.  Cheapest site by a few bucks even with international shipping.  I ordered my microSD from newegg though because their memory prices seemed a bit high.
<br/>
<br/>
Was a little leary about the paypal setup too, but as soon as I entered their e-mail, paypal recognized them as a several year old business member, which gave me confidence.  And there was no service charge to me for using paypal.
<br/>
<br/>
Order arrived within a week, no problems at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I paid with PayPal.  It was a bit odd, requiring me to separately send a confirmation email, in addition to what they received from PayPal, but I appreciate that they may need additional verification.  This procedure is described clearly on the ordering form and was not confusing.
<br/>
<br/>
It shipped quickly, arrived intact, and the price was good.  I'd buy from Winsunx again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
