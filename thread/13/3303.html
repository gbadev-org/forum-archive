I'm new at all this stuff and they were very helpful and responsive to emails I sent them.  I'm very happy and would buy from them again.
<br/>
<br/>
As for delivery I guess it took about 6 days, but I guess it's because I'm in Texas and they are in Canada.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got my EFA from Kicktrading.ca in today, exactly 48 hours after my purchase. The extremely fast shipping may be due to the fact that I'm only a few hours drive away from where Kicktrading is. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the packaging was nice, no components were broken or damaged in the shipping process. There was e-mail correspondance from the company for every step of the purchase, they had notified me of them receiving my payment, when my product was shipped out, and the tracking number of my product.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheap prices, fast shipping and good service.

It's kind of weird seeing everybody here has one and mine is a preorder! (that just doens't make sense) Now if their site would just say backorder that would make a litte more sense.  Either way they replied back very quickly which is a first when it comes to online shops..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ordered an EFA256, took about a week to get here. It was DOA...didn't work in my DS, my friends DS, or my friends GBA.

<br/>
Sent it back for replacement. Round trip time for replacement was about 2 weeks. 
<br/>
<br/>
Replacement worked for about a week, then stopped working. 
<br/>
<br/>
edit:
<br/>
Returned the replacement for refund, 8 days later the money was refunded to my paypal account. Their customer service is pretty good i'd say, just bad luck that I got two defective EFA carts in a row. I ended up getting a free neoflash cart, so that worked out ok in the end.
<br/>
Again, their customer service was very good, letting me return it twice, always responded to my emails within 24 hours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I ordered an EFA512 from them about a 8 months ago, and 6 months into using it, the card became defective in that it wouldn't read from teh second memory bank (so it was effectively a 256mb card). I emailed EFA themselves, and they said to email kicktrading first to try and work things out. Without question, they gave me an RMA number and an address to return it to. Withink 10 days (I think it was US&lt;--&gt;CA mail's fault) I had a new working EFA512 for the low cost of the postage.

I now have the Supercard SD with reader and the Ezflash3 2Gbit flashset and i love them both.

This order was supposedly processed on 12/8/05.

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">bassizzzt</span> order was processed on Decmeber 8th, but this does not mean it was shipped.  Our site states that "processed" means we have reviewed the order and payment was successful.  The item was on back-order it was shipped on Decmeber 21st and delivered December 29th, this is good time considering it was the holidays.  
<br/>
<br/>
We feel strongly that the comment by <span style="font-weight: bold">krystalskreation</span> is not fair.  His order was placed on January 3rd (24 hour shipping), it should have shipped on January 4th but was not becuase the item was on back-order.  We did attempt to communicate the availability issue to this buyer, but buyer claims that email was not received.  We refunded the buyer the shipping costs and gave him an additional discount for the inconvenience.  Item was also finally shipped on 2006/01/06 (2 days late) - Are we really a scam?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I don't know where to begin. I could go on and on about how good these guys are.
<br/>
<br/>
Kicktrading.ca were simply amazing. The only 2 words that could describe them are; the best.
<br/>
<br/>
These guys are truly the best &amp; true professionals. I ordered the EFA-Linker 512Mb on Saturday night and they shipped it on Sunday! That fact alone made me feel safe with my purchase and knew right then that I was getting exactly what I wanted and for the best price that I could find.
<br/>
<br/>
The shipping was also incredibly fast. It took 2 days to deliver it to me, not counting the weekend. Every step of the way they were with excellent support. The moment I sent the payment, they sent me confirmation emails, status update emails and a quick tracking number as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
I give these guys a 120% on everything. I have no complaints whatsoever. 
<br/>
<br/>
These guys' know how to treat their customers and are the best example of how online retailers should be. I hope Kicktrading gets the respect and reputation they deserve because I have never dealt with such incredible customer support. I am truely speechless. 
<br/>
<br/>
I will definately be making more purchases in the future from these guys, and if they expand their product category, that'd be even better.

If you're looking for a place to buy a flash kit, look no further. Just get your money ready and order!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my only complaint against them is that my paypal account has my funds in US currency. I am in canada and was looking to buy from them. All their prices where in US, but when I went to order it switched to canadian. And the exchange rate was WAY higher than what paypal charges. SO I had to convert my US money to canadian, and then on top of that pay for their MUCH higher exchange from US to Canada.
<br/>
<br/>
They looked like a good price for the efa 256 in US funds. But once it changed to CDN funds it came in at $100! It was a moment of weakness for me and I bought it anyway. I would have rather paid the extra for the 512 or 1g unit, but once it switched to CDN funds I decided to cheap out.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention that somehow I figured it was rated in MEGABYTE not BITs. So I was extremely suprized that it only would let me put 3 games on  it when I was epxecting it to take more than 20+!
<br/>
<br/>
Thats not their fault though since I was stupid and did not notice. But I was looking at getting a supercard since I had 256mb SD cards here. But decided the efa would be better since it seemed to have more compatability and was the "same" memory size. Now I know its now.
<br/>
<br/>
Shipping was pretty fast though, and communication was good. I wish I was more patient though and reasearched out my purchase a little more. Maybe asked more questions too</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems like a lot of people have had a really pleasant experience with this retailer and I hate to do this:
<br/>
They have one contact point on their whole website and they claim speedy replies, and phone contact is pointless because they're so quick with emails.
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I ordered the G6 1G flash, I decided that this was a stupid move, and I wanted a M3.. 2 hours later, so i emailed. about 8 hours later I got no response. So I emailed again. Then a couple of hours later I email again. It's now been about 28 hours and I still havent received a response. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they normally do have quick response. But I'm not seeing it. Maybe it's a one man operation and he's sick in the hospital or something. I hope this isnt the case. I'm sorry if it is, but I'm not satisfied. I didnt even want to leave negative feedback. 
<br/>
<br/>
If they can satisfactorily resolve this, I will edit my post and rescind my comments.

------UPDATE-----
<br/>
<br/>
About an hour after I posted here they finally replied. Granted it was almost 30 hours before I got a response. I am VERY VERY PLEASED with the way they are resolving the situation.

 Your order has been processed and is being shipped today. we will send you the car charger  at no charge and we will send you an m3-cf combo with the travel bag you ordered.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In general I am pretty pleased with kicktrading. I placed my order for PassKey2+M3SD on Jan 21, 2006 (Saturday). They had just got a new batch in stock. I got notification from both kicktrading and paypal that the order had processed (i.e. the money went across). By Wed Jan 25, I still hadn't received any tracking # or notification of shipment so I emailed kicktrading. They replied the next day and said that my e-check just cleared and that they would send my order ASAP. I don't totally believe that as paypal said it cleared that same day, but whatever. I got my tracking # on Friday Jan 27, and it arrived on Monday Jan 30. Worked great, no issues with the product itself.
<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing the delays were due to kicktrading probably receiving a lot of orders that week. I think they went right back to being backordered on the M3s within a couple of days so I have no issue with that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a G6L and a PassMe3 seperately, as I had been drooling over the combo for months when it suddenly went on backorder before I worked up the nerve to actually buy the thing. The standalone versions weren't listed as backorder, so in my impatience decided it was worth the extra $15 Cdn. if I could get the product sooner. I placed the order on Tuesday September 05.
<br/>
<br/>
Then the G6L itself also went on backorder. :|
<br/>
<br/>
So I emailed KT and they responded saying they would update the order to be the combo and save me some money, also stating that the item would be in stock by the end of the week. Sure enough, my order was "shipped" on friday (C.O.D. - still anxious about ordering things online, so it's an appreciated option :P ). The tracking # they gave me doesn't bring up anything on the CanadaPost website... just says the order cannot be found.
<br/>
<br/>
It's only Sat. anyway, so it's obviously not going anywhere until next week sometime. So far I have nothing but good things to say about the level of service these guys provide. I hope to get my package by Wed (seeing as I'm off on that day), I'll be sure to update my post once I get any further info.

<br/>
<br/>
Kicktrading is a real safe place where to buy those carts.  I Recently bought a EFA Linker 512 M...My unit was unstable...they sent me the adress to ship my unit back and they sent me a brand new.  So if you want to buy in confidence, don't hesitate.
<br/>
<br/>
Shipping is fast and trackable.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, their package come with a small wood ((or maybe wood fiber)) box  which is an artwork :-)  The edges are very precise.... and like the rest.....impressive  !

Kick Trading...two thumbs up !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Kicktrading responded to my queries promptly and efficiently. Paid on the 22nd, expecting to wait awhile for the out of stock card reader - received items on the 26th. Icing on the cake: Granted me a very good PriceMatch with absolutely no hassle.
<br/>
<br/>
All items working great. Top quality, will order here if I need anything else for my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If you live in Canada, preferably outside Ontario, Kicktrading is absolutely your best best for a great deal. Especially if you find a good match price.

Fifteen thumbs up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I ordered a card for my daughter, and it arrived in just three days, one day after they sent me the tracking number.  I also ordered a couple for my nephews, and made an error in my order, and forgot to order the second one.  I ordered it, along with a note asking if they could possibly ship them together, instead of as two separate orders.  They refunded my shipping charge on the second order, and shipped them both together.  I was not expecting the refund, very happy about that.  Also the card works great too.  Highly recommend them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered a 1 x M3 Perfect LITE (micro-SD) &amp; Passcard 3 (M3-LITEP3) on Sunday the 26th of November, received an update e-mail on Tuesday that it was shipped and it arrived in the UK today (Friday 1st of December). That's extremely fast, considering it usually took 6-10 days for me to send stuff from Germany to Canada, but perhaps the mail service between those former Commonwealth countries works very efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, on top of the order they also sent me a game card keychain and about 4 spare M3 shells. This was quite a shock, because I initially overlooked the M3 and thought they had only sent me shells, heh.
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't able to test the product itself yet, as I don't have a micro SD card. I am going to buy that today. However, since they padded the stuff very thoroughly, I have a good feeling about things working.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, so far I am very pleased with my order and would get things again from kicktrading.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: All right, I have purchased an SD micro card - apparently those are sold in mobile phone shops rather than computer shops, heh - and everything works A-OK!
<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,
<br/>

My second order, however, isn't going as well as my first one. :( But I blame Canada Post, not kicktrading since they processed and shipped my M3 Simply within a day.

Canada Post tracking is no help whatsoever since it hasn't updated since my order shipped.

I know it hasn't been 15 "business days" yet, but it's frustrating to wait and not know where your package is.  Especially when my friend's order shipped the same day and he received his on the 12th (shipped to Illinois).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, like most U.S. customers my order seems to have gotten stuck in shipping limbo for a little over a week now. I know this is not Kicktrading's fault so I'm going to withhold judgment until my order finally gets here, but the slow shipping is very frustrating and I just need somewhere to vent in the meantime. Canada Post's infamously ineffective tracking system isn't making things any bearable either. As was the case with some other customers, the tracking status of my order seems to be stuck at "Item accepted at post office." I'm going to assume this is a normal occurence with shipments to the U.S. and that my order hasn't just been sitting forgotten in a post office somewhere for a week and a half.
<br/>
<br/>
While I can't say anything as to the integrity of kicktrading.ca or the quality of their merchandise, I can say that Canada Post is excrutiatingly slow when shipping to the U.S. and that any U.S. residents ordering from kicktrading.ca (or anywhere else in Canada for the matter) should be prepared to wait quite a bit for delivery.
<br/>
<br/>
Update: It's been two weeks now and still no sign of my order. At this point I'm beginning to doubt that I'll get it within the month, or ever for that matter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
On Friday I ordered a EZ-Flash V 3-in-1 Expansion Card from them. Their website was off at the moment but I e-mailed them and they quickly responded saying I could still buy it even though the website is offline (and still is...). So I payed them $35 CAD for the EZ-Flash and Express Shipping for $8. Regular shipping was $6. At lunchtime today, the package arrived, everything worked perfectly. I am also buying a M3 Simply for my friend from there.
<br/>
<br/>
I am somewhat satisfied with the product (EZ-Flash V 3-in-1 Expansion Card). I knew what I was going to get... I kinda wouldn't mind a new interface though. That boring M3 Simply 3 buttons is getting so... boring. It plays a single GBA game, I want to use Dipstar but I have no idea on how to use it with M3 Simply and EZ-Flash 3-in-1. If someone knows please PM me. Thank you.

My rating for kicktrading: 10/10

-Fast shipping
<br/>
-Pretty cheap prices

-Located in Canada...fast shipping (again)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Kicktrading (or Kickgaming as they call it now) is very good. I just received two R4DS and two cheap headphones from them today. I ordered it last Tue night, it was postmarked on Wed. Unfortunately this was Easter weekend, and Fri/Sun/Mon were holidays. So even with Express Shipping (1-4 days), that meant it took until yesterday (Tue, 3 business days) to get here. Well I didn't check my mailbox until today though, because I was expecting them to deliver to my door. I only checked it because of the tracking website (which sucks, more below).
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:
<br/>
- It's good to combine orders; whether I ordered 1 item or 4, it was the same shipping ($10 CAD). I split mine with a friend.
<br/>
- if you're in Canada, you have to pay GST... <span style="font-weight: bold">if you're in Ontario, you have to pay GST <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> PST</span> like I did.
<br/>
- Canada Post's tracking system is wonky... they don't update it right away when things happen. They updated my status to shipped today, but it was yesterday's date. And I didn't see that it was accepted at the post office until days later. Don't worry, it'll eventually get there.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, a very good store. They process quickly! Any problems can be blamed on Canada Post =P. Cost of shipping and tax are things to be considered, but I ordered when they had the $10 US off R4DS sale going and saved a bunch, so I'm pretty happy with that =).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">KickGaming has given me rather good experience thus far, and consistently.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, since last year, I've made several orders from KickGaming, and all have been processed without any problems. The prices are excellent, the selection is pretty great, customer service has worked with me on any and all requests I've had.
<br/>
<br/>
Considering some of the other shops I've bought from in the past (who shall remain unnamed), this site is really top-notch. Definitely suggested for anyone looking for a good price and good service for NDS carts.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that I'd ask for from this site is UPS and FedEx, because I'm OCD when it comes to tracking packages. However, despite living in California, Canadian Post has shipped without a hitch and on-time on all my orders so far, just lousy tracking.
<br/>
<br/>
Definitely will be ordering again in the future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
