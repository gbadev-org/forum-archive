    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a EZF Advance 256 from Electricbirdland. I payed via paypal with an e-check and at first it didn't go through because they were having trouble with accepting money through their paypal account. So I emailed them and asked what was up, they emailed me right back and said they would look into it. This was on a Friday so the following monday he had me send the money to one of his "sister store's" accounts. Once I was finally able to pay for the thing he shipped it that day. It took 8 days to arrive to me here in California, not to bad considering the store is in the UK. The owner of the store was always really friendly and helpful to me as we arranged the sale via email. He also responded to my emails quickly most of the time. The electricbirdland site is down right now, maybe because they are getting that paypal problem straightend out, but once they are back up I would recommend purchasing from them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Excellent Service. With this being ym first flash cart, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I didn't think it would arrive this quickly. Ordered on Tuesday night and it arrived on Thursday morning. It was so quick seeing as both I and the company are in the UK. GREAT!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
