<br/>
The price was right, so I ordered a GBAMP + SuperPass, and the very next day, I got an e-mail letting me know that the order had shipped.  Apparently, they ship on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll update this post when I get my order delivered.
<br/>
<br/>
****UPDATE****
<br/>
<br/>
HOLY SMOKES!!!  I posted the above earlier today (Monday), and my order is here already!  Fantastic!  I would buy from <a href="http://www.dspassme.com" target="_blank">www.dspassme.com</a> anytime!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****SECOND UPDATE****
<br/>
<br/>
The GBAMP-V2 with updated firmware and the Super PassKey both work exactly as advertised, so not only were the products shipped and delivered super-fast, but they are also in perfect working order.
<br/>
<br/>
So nice to see my application running on the hardware with such minimal fuss.  Thanks so much!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you are ordering the GBAMP and live in Canada, you will have to pay GST($2.06), PST($2.06), and handling($5.00) which comes to a total of $9.12 CDN.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
