    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have finally got to admit to myself that I have been ripped off by a game cartridge supplier. Foolishly I ordered a number of F2A 256M USB kits from this 'supplier' at a time just after most others had been forced to stop selling them, as I needed to protect future software development.
<br/>
<br/>
I should have realised when it was made clear that credit cards were not accepted. (These offer the purchaser good protection in exchange for a little work writing letters). These people insisted on a Bank telegraphic transfer or Western Union payment. these are both irrevokable transfers confering no legal rights.
<br/>
<br/>
I was promised dispatch within 24 hours of receiving the TT.
<br/>
<br/>
The company had responded to all requests for prices within 30 minutes. After I sent the money there was a long silence. Then they finally responded that they didn't have the money, although the paperwork I had from the bank indicated that they did.
<br/>
After several more mails they said:
<br/>
"Due to no stock , We will dispatch the Goods in next week ."
<br/>
<br/>
Now - 6 weeks later - I realise that I have been robbed.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want any one else to be taken like I was so I am presenting the contact details, so that you know who to avoid. The web site of ChinaToys is now:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.chinatoysco.com" target="_blank">http://www.chinatoysco.com</a>
<br/>
Take a look, but REMEMBER: they do not have any of these goods and they are even claiming to be selling cheap excess stock of items which they are failing to supply to me!
<br/>
Although it hurts to be saying this: It is madness to send money to someone you don't know and trust, unless you use a credit card and therefore have some protection. On no account send any money to:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This has put me right off the scene, as I can't afford to continue.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Three weeks ago I thought I would email the Hong Kong police, about my problem (above). I was pleased to receive a reply from them requesting more details.
<br/>
<br/>
Well.  Three weeks after sending my file of emails to the Hong Kong police, I suddenly got 8 emails from China Toys full of apology and promising to send me F2A Ultras to replace the F2As I had originally paid for. Today (3 days later) they arrived.
<br/>
<br/>
I leave it for you to speculate on what prompted this, and whether anyone should buy from them. I notice that they are *still* advertising cheap excess stock of the F2A 256K which they did not send to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really should finish off the story. I just had a further mail from the Hong Kong Police who 'interviewed' the supplier. They were just making sure that I really had received the goods.
<br/>
<br/>
I have to say Full Marks to the Hong Kong Police. I doubt whether the police in my country would have got involved in a similar matter.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
you are "lucky". You are not the first one and not the last one, which will be ripped off from HKT....
<br/>
<br/>
I think this company was only founded for this kind of "making money". :-((</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am having the same problem with this store, I ordered a G6Flash 1G, I have e-mailed him to check on the status and he told me he did not have it in stock and that would I accept the ultra F2A 1g. Well this started 2 months ago, I sent him an e-mail asking for the ultra F2A and have had no reply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Also the HK police is doing nothing. I?ve contaced them, too and they told me they will start with action (or not), if i have contacted my local police.
<br/>
<br/>
This was 4-5 months ago without any result.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by AC-Commo on Fri Oct 28, 2005 9:57 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am going to contact the visa card company to see what they can do, I used it to send the money. This will teach me not to send money again, next time I will use paypal or the credit. I'm out 135.00 + the 33.00 to send it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
