<span style="font-style: italic">Only Status 2 means the parcel have been shipped. If there is a tracking number, but the status is shown "in processing", it means the parcel is in processing in the Shipping Department.

But customer do not consider the "in processing" or "shipped". They guess, if there is a tracking number, it means the parcel is in Fedex, UPS etc.......well, actually they are partly correct, because Fedex, UPS will send workers to our company to follow parc</span>

Maybe they should have it say "back-ordered" instead.  If they ran out of stock, they should have contacted me and let me know, maybe offer to cancel the order or substitute another item.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ordered my EZF Advance III 256m on the 11th, selected Air Mail shipping, and had to pay manually w/ paypal by inserting linker4u's email address, however order came today, the 21st, running perfectly!  The box was slightly squished, but the contents were 100% working including the mini cd-r.  No problems with the cart so far, flashed it twice, once with one .gba, another time with 5 .gbas, and the EZFIII has a built in OS that auto-detects it and will give you a selection if you have more than one game on there at a time.
<br/>
Although there was a slight lack of communication (the order status page still says recieved and processing), the product came in 10 days with the slowest shipping method, and everything was as it should be.
<br/>
<br/>
From my experience, I'd give them a 3.5/5
<br/>
<br/>
Good:
<br/>
    - Cheap products
<br/>
    - Accepts Paypal for secure transaction
<br/>
    - Fast shipping to the west side
<br/>
<br/>
Bad:
<br/>
    - Cranky website (doesn't always load!)
<br/>
    - Doesn't make paypal payment automatic, you have to enter linker4u email and amount yourself
<br/>
    - Very small communication with customer</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So, is it just a handfull of people having problems with linker4U, or not?  How can you stay "affiliated" with a company that doesn't communicate with their customers.  HK or not, it shouldn't take a month to receive a product..  What are they shipping it, by boat?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
we are purchasing some of our products at success-hk and we "know" linker4u, too.
<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problems both have (is one company) is the bad customer support. You don?t know when you will get your order, you don?t know if your order is shipped or not and if you wil get a trackingnumber for your order, it can take up to 3 weeks, before this order is really shipped.

Man I did not read this thread in time.. i would pay 50% more to have it ship from US... HK is (im almost sure) going to take a long time.

<br/>
One of those 'standard of living' points we're so used to in the USA.
<br/>
<br/>
You pay for service as advertised, you get it fast, if you don't you complain and you will be refunded or rebated (taken care of anyway), plus good customer service.
<br/>
<br/>
And I don't think taking things lightly is ok just because the company is in China.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
