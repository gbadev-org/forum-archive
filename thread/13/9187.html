    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i guess they are good.... but not enough payment options.  I mean, I GUESS i could go and set upa  pay-pal accoutn but meeeeeeehhhhh...... i just went to kicktrading.ca and got it (which was also cheaper, but it was a combo deal) and used a credit card.  This site sells more things than kicktrading soooooo i guess I'll give it a 9/10 (kicktrading being a 10/10).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just finished placing my order with them a fairly hefty one in my book so we'll see how it goes. After what seems to me of weeks of research I've finally kinda figured out all the parts and pieces I need for my DS Lite so I finally placed my order and placing the order went very smooth, I didn't right off see that it was a Paypal only deal as on the site it shows a few credit card logo's though it wasn't a big deal for me as I have a Paypal account. I didn't have a acct with Gamersection yet but through the shopping cart it was very simple to set one up and unlike other online retailers I've delt with in the past I didn't lose my items once I'd set up my acct so that was nice once through check out though you are fairly limited on shipping choices though. If you do live outside of Canada as I live in the US this is the part that I found a bit confusing as you start to check out and go through the payment part it shows all the pricing in your current currency rate, it shows your sub ttl, shipping, handling and ttl, then just before you go to paypal a little popup says something like it will now convert to CAD pricing so the numbers may change but it should still equal out, but when my paypal acct charged out it was a bit higher then it was supposed to be. So the numbers don't quite look right as of now anyway's but I'll see once I get my actual online billing statement which should be in a couple of days, I did get the automated confirmation back from them a few mins later saying that the order should be arriving in 2-5 days, so we'll see. 
<br/>
<br/>
I did do alot of checking and comparison shopping and Gamersection has  good prices, delivery and inventory and that's the reason I went with them over some of the other online retailers, it's quite possible that the pricing thing was or is just a conversion deal that looks funky once it goes from their checkout and into paypal I dunno I'll just have to wait and see I guess.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.mygamernews.com" target="_blank">http://www.mygamernews.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I received an email from Gamersection on June 6th with the Fed-Ex tracking info and I received my items on June 9th. The items were packed very good and all items were packaged with care and un-harmed, all items were exact as described. 
<br/>
<br/>
Summary: (Pros) I was very pleased with their inventory and range of items, I looked at several other online retailers that had some of the same items and less of a selection and many of them did not have the same items nor did they have them IN STOCK or ready to ship, and they emailed me my order confirmation, tracking info etc right away and I got my items within days. (Cons) Their prices aren't the lowest online and I knew that going in, but as I stated they do have a good selection and a good inventory and at checkout through the conversion rate of CAD and USD the payment processor (paypal) as Tepples pointed out ate up a certain percentage and I wasn't aware of that going in and as anyone should be aware when dealing with overseas or out of country shipping, shipping is expensive so whenever you place any order if you can you should try to combine orders with some friends etc to make it worth your while on the overall order to make up for it on the shipping (just an FYI).<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.mygamernews.com" target="_blank">http://www.mygamernews.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
