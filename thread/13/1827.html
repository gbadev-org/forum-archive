    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got contacted by a salesman in #gbadev when I talked about that I broke my current F2A linker. He told me that they sold them from germany, and that sounded pretty usefull, since I live in Denmark.
<br/>
I ordered the linker, and I even got it sent to me by letter mail, as it was cheaper. A linker was 16 EUR and the letter was 8 EUR, so it wasn't that expensive.
<br/>
I payed by bank, and when they recived the moneys the goods where sent imidiatly, and i got them 2 days later.
<br/>
<br/>
Thumbs up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
