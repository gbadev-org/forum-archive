<br/>
Quick delivery, a great product, and the lowest price on the net.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest this product, and this supplier, to anyone interested in game development or just to play their ROMs.  Plus the cable doubles as an MBV3 multiboot cable (download 2M files without a cartridge).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The website looked very professional, and the prices were unbelievable (the only place I've seen them lower is directly from Hong Kong, but that requires a ton of $ in currency and shipping fees), but the PayPal only payments and the crazy low prices made me skeptical.  
<br/>
<br/>
However, after e-mailing the retailer with questions and receiving a response in under two hours, then seeing this topic, I was reassured enough to take the plunge and see what this company can do.
<br/>
<br/>
For all of you out there considering purchasing from MW Electronics, consider me the average joe and let's see what happens.  My PayPal e-check should clear either today or tomorrow, so early next week I'm hoping to have a product in hand and a glowing review for these fine folk.
<br/>
<br/>
I will say though that even though I don't know what would be involved in setting up the site to accept credit card payments, it has to be eternally preferable to PayPal.  Not having a PayPal account, I had to wait days and days to confirm my checking account, only to have to wait another handful of days to clear an electronic check from myself.
<br/>
<br/>
But then again, it's a small inconvenience compared to having to spend $50 more to get the same product from more popular sites.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just ordered a EZ Flash Advance 256 cart from this company. I paid through paypal, easy enough and seems like a secure way to pay.. for them and for me. Either way, I noticed that my email was deactivated, the one paypal had, so i emailed the company about this and asked if there were any problems with the payment. I got a responce in like 2 or 3 hours. On a Friday... at night. You do not see that kind of reponse from companies now a days. That already made me feel great about ording from them. They said my order was fine and should go out on Monday and should get to me by Wednesday. sounds VERY Great to me. I will post back when I get my cart to give feedback on the shipping packaging and what not.
<br/>
The customer rep who i had a small email conversation made me feel like i was actually talking to a person and not some machine. He/She told me that they like to treat their customer with respect and like to make them feel good... he/she told me about a bad customer service experience and told me that because of that, they like to give A++ customer service. So far, everything has been good, but the real test comes when I recieve my cart. I am hoping i can give a great feedback when I get my cart</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">WOW.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me reiterate, I have seen the 256MB versions of these products offered for anywhere from $155 to $180 all over the internet, but NEVER for the crazy cheap price this site charges.  <span style="font-style: italic">And</span> the guy only charges 7 bucks for shipping so he's not trying to pad costs that way either!  I don't know how he can be making a profit like this, but at least now I'm aware how much the other sites inflate the costs of these kits.
<br/>
<br/>
Just so you know, I'm not affiliated with these MW people; I'm the guy from above who decided to take a chance with this company.  Like I said above, I was skeptical because their prices were so low to begin with.  BUT my check cleared late Thursday afternoon and holy fuggin hampster, what did I find in my mail 2 days later on SATURDAY?  My EZ-Flash 256MB kit complete with card and cable and brand new just like the website promised.  
<br/>
<br/>
The card is awesome and these guys are awesome.  Please do yourself a favor and save a wad of cash.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you're all lucky I tore myself away from my new toy long enough to write this up.  I'm outta here; the <span style="font-style: italic">[removed by mod]</span> rom....oops, I mean a few choice 'public domain' roms are waiting for my loving attention.

I have recently ordered a 256mb cart + Linker cable (EZF-Advance) from <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b>. They are currently on Pre-Order, which (by the site), means they will be shipped out by the end of this week. I can't wait to see how it goes and will definitely post back with any information.

I did, however, include a comment to the "business" when paying through paypal and received a promt reply email within the hour answering the quick little question I have.

I can't leave any comments on how it actually works and all. I can't really use it until christmas. ;P

As for all the stuff being there, perfectly great. I really like the receipt splip as well, giving me information on where to download drivers for the unit. Although I'm not a moron and anybody could find them, I find it a nice touch, instead of just a simple receipt that tells you nothing. I can't wait to use it.

If you live in the US, THE best place to get a flash cart is <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Electronics</b>.  You're wasting your time with Success, GBAx, Jandaman, and everyone else.  They might have great service and support and whatever, but for most folks the deciding factor is PRICE.

And I'm not talking about the pre-shipping prices either.  MWE is selling the EZFA 256 kit for $107 SHIPPED.

I paid and had the cart in my hands within three days.  I never had to write them to inquire about anything, so I can't comment on their response times.

They did send me an email when my order shipped, and it included a USPS tracking number.  Keep an eye on your email box!  Once you get that shipping confirmation you should have it in two or three days.  It ships from Florida, btw.

The receipt even contained instructions on where to get more information about the EZFA as well as the software for it.

Always answer emails....very, very professional.  All around has great customer service.

It should be absolutely no guessing with this one.  If you want great service, located in Florida (for all of US people!),  and fast shipping...go with <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Electronics</b>.  You will not be disappointed.

<br/>
<br/>
I needed a present for my 12 yo step daughter.  What the hell do you get her???
<br/>
<br/>
"I want this game, this game, and this game..."etc...
<br/>
<br/>
So I decided to get her a EZ Flash Advance 256MB to test out any games before we buy.
<br/>
<br/>
At last minute I searched around.  Came across <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b>.  Had a question about payment (I don't keep funds in my PP account until I need them so that would push off an instant payment), and emailed on Friday before xmas.  I got an email back within 2 hours or so, and still had several emails sent back and forth in a short time.  Very attentive.  They told me they would accept Money Order, and ship out to me Express Mail (shipping extra, only Post Office rates of $15!).
<br/>
<br/>
I sent a M.O. on Saturday, scanned my reciepts (M.O. stub, confirmation stub, and transaction reciept) and emailed it to them.
<br/>
<br/>
THEY SENT the EZ Flash Advance 256MB BEFORE they even recieved payment!!!  They sent out Monday night, I received on Xmas eve early A.M.!!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
I have nothing but praise for these guys..!  Excellent emails, superfast, trustworth shipping.  Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
(PS, they didn't even receive the M.O. until AFTER I got the EZFA!!!!)
<br/>
I will be purchasing more in the next couple months!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I knew there would be a delay due to the holidays, as the web page clearly indicated this (Bravo!).
<br/>
<br/>
My order shipped on Friday, and I was e-mailed so by 1:30pm MST.  Now that is quick (Bravo again!).
<br/>
<br/>
My order arrived today JUST before I left for work.  This enabled me to pack up and send my EZF 128s to a friend as I upgraded to the 256s.
<br/>
<br/>
So all in all it took three USPS business days for me to get my order.  (Bravissimo!)
<br/>
<br/>
The price is unbeatable, the shipping cost is unbeatable, and the delivery time is unbelievable.
<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing stopping me from ordering again in the future, or heartily recommending this service to anyone who inquires.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I ordered from Montreal Canada on Thursday and got an e-mail with tracking number within 24h. The item got here the following wenesday (4 open business day) and was within the 3 to 5 open business day delay they have promised. The item got here by purolator and the packaging was flawless. Mwelectronics are the total package, they deliver fast and answer very quickly to there e-mail. I would recommend them and will surely do business with them again.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I cannot say enough good things about <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Electronics</b>. A few weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to order an EZ Flash Advance, but they were out of stock at the time. I sent them a couple of e-mails, which they responded to promptly. When they got in more shipments of the EZFA (about a week later), I ordered it and they shipped it in the same day. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday (Monday was a holiday and there was no mail). I highly recommend these guys over any of the other flash cart retailers out there. Here's why:
<br/>
<br/>
- U.S. based (Florida). Why deal with the hassle of importing from Hong Kong or Asia? What happens if you need to return the product for whatever reason? Sounds like a major pain to me. You won't have those problems with <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Electronics</b>.
<br/>
<br/>
- Best prices for EZFAs anywhere that I've seen.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">About a week ago i ordered an EZF advance flash set from linkerworld.com. It said it was in stock. Also it is an official vendor of the product as well as being said to be reliable by a few sites. Well now i am beginning to doubt my assumption. Everytime i check my account it say my order is "pending" even though im sure that this product cleared through my card. This leads me to believe it may be out of stock and yet there is no indication of that on the site and when i try to contact them about it i get no replies.
<br/>
<br/>
Also it seems the site doesn't get updated much as the last news article listed dated to DEC. 30, 2003. I asked gamboy-advance.net about it but obviously they didn't read my concern well as they stated that the EZ flash 2 powerstar set (which IS labeled as OUT OF STOCK) was out and suggested that i order the EZF advance. That was irritating to say the least seeing as these guys highly recommended the site.
<br/>
<br/>
As of right now the website is down. I am extremely irratated that i paid $167.50 for your product and have nothing to show for it after a week and a half.  It looks like form this forum that i am not the only one who has had problemd with this site and i feel like i made a huge mistake. If someone could please help me find a way to get a refund form these guys i would love to bring my business to the highly acclaimed <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">electronics</b>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The product itself is great. It's so nice to get a product that just plain works. The drivers/software are simple to download from the Internet and worked first try. The device was recognized, without any hassle, on my Windows XP laptop and the EFA software worked flawlessly. I wrote nine ROM files to the cart and it was quick and easy. So far, everything has loaded and played properly from the cart using the included loader.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was first introduced to MWElectronics by someone on FatWallet. I was at first skeptical since the only method of payment was PayPal and the prices were so good. But after doing a google search and reading these feedbacks, I gave it a try.
<br/>
<br/>
I accidentally used the wrong method of payment initially and emailed <a href="mailto:sales@mwelectronics.com">sales@mwelectronics.com</a> and requested a refund stating that I had used an incorrect method of payment. The refunded my money within 2hrs in which I then sent the correct payment 15mins later.
<br/>
<br/>
I paypaled the payment on saturday. i received the item on monday. knowing priority mail takes 2-3 days, i was amazed that i got the item in 1 day only (sunday is a postal free day, which i didn't count)
<br/>
<br/>
i've purchased the EZ-Flash Advance 256Mb for $100. i've tested it with several roms and they work perfectly. even the save files which many gba flash rom products have problems with. I was hoping to get a 512MB, but that'll just have to wait till they have those in stock. hehe.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a EZFA256 kit from <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Electronics</b> a few months ago. To my dissapointment, my battery eventually just died on my and would no longer charge, not matter what I tried. Terrible, huh? Not really. I simply emailed MWE asking what I could do about this situation (I didn't even bother to look up that the cart was actually under warranty at the time.) 
<br/>
<br/>
To my dismay, it seemed I never got a reply! I was thinking "How could this be? These are the guys that usually email me back the <span style="font-weight: bold">same day</span>! I guess I must have accidentally deleted it, because upon mailing them back again about my situation, I received a prompt reply; which is great. Even more, I hadn't been able to read the email for a few days, and MWE even went to lengths to email me once more just to make sure I received the email. How awesome is that? I've never had an experience having to return something where the place I'm returning it to wants to make sure I got all the information right and will be sending it back soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Returning it was easy enough; no RMA number, not nothing. Just include my email message and send it away. I received my cart back pronto and it works perfectly fine now. I haven't had a bad experience with <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Electronics</b>, seriously. If you're going to buy equipment, and they have what you need, definitely choose them. You'll never have a better experience anywhere else. In fact, don't even consider anyone else. <b style="color:#FFA34F">MW</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">Electronics</b> is just so much of a great deal, and it comes coupled with customer service that doesn't really exist anywhere else.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd have to say that as a first time customer I'm really impressed and pleased.  I placed an order late on 3/30 for the ez flash advance.  I figured (hoped) based on what everyone else experienced in this forum that they would get the email the following morning, and ship it out by the end of the day, sending the confirmation email sometime later in the evening.  When i didn't get a confirmation email by 2 days later i was a little concerned - sent an email to them the morning of 4/1 to verify they received the order.  when i got home and checked my email again i received a very apologetic message explaining that they were in the middle of a move / server problems which delayed the shipment by 1 day, but they did receive it and send it on it's way.  Understandable.  Later on that day I got my official email confirmation and tracking #.  Then <span style="text-decoration: underline">another</span> email from them following up to make sure i received the first two!  So the package is officially on it's way 4/1, and here 2 days later 4/3 it's arrived - not bad at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Take it from me - i usually order from the 'big places' and it's usually hit or miss.  i'm the kind of person that is constantly checking up on companies at the better business bureau, and also refusing to use any of the smaller companies because i figure i just can't trust them.  mw electronics really was an eye opener.  prompt response, prompt shipping, and excellent prices.  you can't go wrong.

Great service, great product [EZFA], great price! Now I can take all my homebrew and public domain games wherever I go!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Calm like a bomb</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just received my order from MW Electronics, and they told me to visit their site to download drivers. When I arrived, I got the "we've decided to move on" page... :(
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just wondering if anyone knows where I can download the drivers?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure I'll find it somewhere online, but thought maybe someone knows already.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
