Most likely, you screwed up the card number (should be 16 digits), the verification code (for Visa and MC, 3 printed digits on the sig panel), or the expiration date. Less likely, you may have maxed out your credit line.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

They did explain to the best of their ability. W331 means "the bank declined the charge". I'm assuming that the bank says it's none of WorldPay's business why the charge was declined; otherwise, it would open a door for account thieves, as brute-forcing one field at a time is much faster than brute-forcing an entire web form. Contact your bank if you need more help.
<br/>
<br/>
And in general, don't use spaces in card numbers submitted over a web form.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If your bank won't do anything to help you get a legitimate payment through, I'd say that unless you live in an area with a monopoly bank (such as Terre Haute, IN), you should look into switching banks.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a warning to those considering success-hk.com for their GBA cart needs.
<br/>
<br/>
Last Monday (Aug 4th) I ordered a total of 6 GBA carts from success-hk.com.  When I was paying at WorldPay, my first attempt with my credit card was unsuccessful (got the W331 error).  However, my second attempt went through fine, and I received an email receipt from WorldPay (along with a call from my credit card company to make sure the charge was made by me).  
<br/>
<br/>
All seemed well, and I never received an indication that it was otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
Now this Monday (Aug 11th) I go to their website to find tracking info on my package, only I can't find a valid UPS tracking number (and the order is listed as "Received and to be processing").  So I use the support ticket system to contact them and ask what my tracking number should be.  Tuesday I receive a response that my order was never paid for, and that I should send a scan of my credit card or driver's license so they can attempt to charge my credit card again.
<br/>
<br/>
I replied (early Tuesday) by email saying that the second attempt had worked, and forwarded them the WorldPay receipt and suggest that they ask WorldPay to double check.  Since I received no response by Wednesday, I double check that my card was billed (it's listed on my bill, and I called my credit card company to confirm).  I use the support ticket system to contact them again, saying I've confirmed that I paid and they should send the order or at least cancel the order (and charge to my credit card) and I offer to resend the receipt from WorldPay.
<br/>
<br/>
Now it's Thursday and I still have no response.  In a few hours I will attempt to have my credit card company remove the charge from my card, since it is apparent I will never recieve anything for my nearly $300.  If anyone knows a more reliable way to contact success-hk.com (direct phone number or CEO direct email), I would appreciate the pointer.
<br/>
<br/>
I've only heard good things about success-hk.com, but obviously at this point I have to advise anyone thinking about ordering something from them to be very cautious, since you may end up paying for nothing.

<br/>
<br/>
I had a hard time finding an EZF 256 cart to buy on the net, because of expensive prices and unavailability on stores that had a decent price. The first time I tried to order through Success-hk was on August 8th. I paid and emailed them after a couple of days, since my order was not shipped yet. A woman replied saying EZF had sold out and that they would be cancelling my credit card charge. Said and done, no charges to my credit card.
<br/>
<br/>
When it was restocked, I ordered it on Semptember 17th, it arrived here today, September 25th. 
<br/>
<br/>
Oh by the way, I could track down my package (EMS to Brazil) using the hongkongpost.com's website, tough the only kind of information was: Shipped Sept 18th and Arrived in destination country on Sept 24th (awaiting for local delivery). 
<br/>
<br/>
My only complaint is that the card-sized CD that comes with EZF was cracked, so I cannot use it. It may have cracked during shipping, who knows... I won't go through any hassle just for a 50mb CD replacement ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I had already heard that the CD contains old drivers, so I downloaded the drivers and read the simple instructions on the net, and the cart works perfectly!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good customer service...? They didn't even reply to my help ticket for five days! I understand they have a shortage, and can respect that. Their problem is that they don't reply to the help tickets in a timely manner, which is really frustrating because the buyers have to pay upfront instead of being charged only when the order ships. It was really frustrating to get no response whatsoever and to have no idea if my order was going to ship or if I was just being ripped off, for over a week. Your experience with them may have been good, but I think they have some work to do. :P Maybe with the help ticket thing they need to hire a few more people so they can process them more quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
If my credit card was only charged when the order ships, if they updated their site with current information on what's in stock, and if they had a way for customers to cancel their order themselves, I wouldn't have worried about the delay at all. Or, alternately, if they had replied to my help ticket within a day or even two, it also would have been fine. I just wanted to know what was going on.

And success' quality will make you cry. There is a HUGE problem with the new and very expensive flash2advance ultra cards (256 Mb - 1 Gb) and their respons to it is..... nothing. They ignore it. And to make matters worse; they keep selling it. Without warnings or even links to reviews. They answer service tickets with very general and vague wording and they seem to be trying to sit the trouble out. I'm no longer buying there. Even worse; i'm returning the card I bought there.

(I'm in the UK)  I understand I can not track the delivery but I kept an eye on the status of my order.
<br/>
<br/>
It reported something like "ready and to be processing" until the 17th when it now says "shipped".
<br/>
<br/>
I'm now getting concered about it because its been a long time since I ordered it.  I'm not used to buying things online so I'm a little paranoid about it all.  Also, the item is now "out of stock" which doesnt help my confidence..
<br/>
<br/>
Is this timescale normal?  Anyone had any problems receiving to England?  Should I wait longer, or just contact them?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.. .all the positive feedback has relieved me quite a bit and I'll definately be sure to add my feedback when/if it arrives!
<br/>
<br/>
Kind Regards.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi wiz, I'm in Canada and I also ordered my EZFA-Advance carts from them in early February. They said they'd ship out on February 16 or 17 but they actually shipped out on February 20. As mentioned before, the EZFA manufacturer lagged behind during the Chinese holiday and they couldn't catch up to the consumer demand until recently. Now, success-hk has to finish shipping out a <span style="font-weight: bold">lot</span> of EZFA pre-orders. Don't worry, you'll get yours, albeit a little late.
<br/>
<br/>
I received my order on February 25 because I paid extra for EMS shipping (either that or UPS is recommended because airmail can take a week or two. I once had to wait 3 weeks with airmail from the US). I bet your order is already in the air right now... it's just gonna take a little longer.
<br/>
<br/>
Since I have a wholesaler account with them (I'm a Canada-based GBA Flash cart distributor), I have a good contact w/ one of their staff and I can have them check whether or not they have shipped your order out of their door yet. Email me your order# at <a href="mailto:sales@e2city.com">sales@e2city.com</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My order (EZFA-Flash 256mb) from Success-hk arrived today!  As Malone reminded me it was a little delayed due to the Chinese holiday.  I'm now a very happy customer and will definately order from success-hk again :)

but with their recent release of the "EZFA II", i can say i dont trust them much anymore.
<br/>
stealing the good name of EZFA and passing it off as their own, i expected better of them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a F2A cart and some other things from them a while back and they seem to be good for an overseas retailer.  There were problems with communication due to their not so good english (engrish) and delays due to hong kong time differences but those are to be expected.  Prices are decent though shipping costs are quite high.  Also returns can be an issue, the GBA Super Memory Stick I ordered with my cart was defective and it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it, but that isn't their fault.  I would recommend sticking to a company located in the country you are in (USA in my case), but if none of them have what you are looking for or you live in Hong Kong, Success is quite good though I will try to avoid all retailers not in the USA or Candada if possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a 512MB F2A Ultra cart and paid the $20 for expedited shipping.  They listed a FedEx tracking number the next day...however after several days of checking the number on FedEx's website and getting no results, I emailed for support.
<br/>
<br/>
They responded and said that due to a mistake they didn't realize they were out of stock.  They said they had some more in and were going to ship ASAP.  Meanwhile...a couple days later and nothing shipped yet (and no response to my 4/19 follow-up question).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I just submitted another ticket requesting a discount on my shipping since the FedEx tracking number still doesn't show anything and my order still isn't updated with a new FedEx tracking number (plus I've received no notice of shipping).  7 days later and $20 paid for this...hoping they'll discount or I told them to cancel my order.  I'll get this from someone else...not worth the hassle that I've had to go through so far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I've just come back home this morning to find a UPS letter/invoice asking for payment for custom charges for an order (flash cart obviously) which was placed back in January of this year! Has anybody else got anything like this and did any of you guys order from Success Compu and pay customs on your order?
<br/>
<br/>
Any info appreciated. I'm not too happy atm as they want ?37 from me!!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
The letter says they carried out an internal audit and found this outstanding. I have called them up and the person I spoke to could not give a satisfactory answer apart from why he does'nt know why the driver did not ask for it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, I thought I read in here that linker4u.com was fast, but I ordered my EZF Advance III (256M version) on the 3rd/4th (it was late), and it is listed as "Received and to be Processing".
