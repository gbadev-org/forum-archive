I purchased a Flash2Advance ultra 512 from this company, not only was it the cheapest I've seen than anywhere else, but I got free shipping too!  And on top of that all, it came to me the SAME WEEK I ordered it!  Amazing!
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend this seller to anyone and everyone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A good site, from one person's experience. (me)after I read the above poster's message, I decided to buy my Smart Card Flash 128Mb USB kit from Goodylands. I had them ship it to me economy, which was 2 bucks cheaper. I 
<br/>
would have rather paid the extra 2 bucks to have the box and USB Drivers. *sigh* Well, they shipped it in me in two days! (Post Office days) And over the holidays too! I ordered on the 22nd, and they shipped it the next day within 24 hours. since over the weekend was christmas, and the post office wasn't open on monday, I recieved it today, the 27th. I e-mailed them to see where I could get my grubby little paws on the driver, and if they respond timely and curteously, I'd definitely give this company an excellent rating.
<br/>
(and afte rI get the drivers, if the cart works)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
