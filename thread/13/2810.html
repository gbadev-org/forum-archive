    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently bought a 128Mb XG1 card and linker set from Peegou.  The price was the best I could find on any card or linker set on the web.  Shipping was fast, only 3 days after I ordered it.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I did have to contact them to get a confirmation of my order other than the standard Paypal receipt, but they replied to my inquiry within a day, so support is pretty good.  I can't say anything further than that, regarding returns or exchanges other than they charge a 15% restocking fee, which is pretty standard these days.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too just bought the XG 128mb set (I know it's not the greatest, but like radjago says, you simply can't find a comparable set for 45 bucks anywhere else).
<br/>
<br/>
Ordered early Sunday morning, arrived in Iowa on Friday.  Reasonable speed, especially considering the bad weather.  Communication was poor though - by Wednesday I was a little concerned, so I emailed the sales@ address to say "hey, just confirming my order, let me know when it's sent" and got no response.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, whether or not the unit works, I don't know - I don't have a GBA yet! :D
<br/>
I can tell you it plugs in and the little light is green and that LittleWriter works with it..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
