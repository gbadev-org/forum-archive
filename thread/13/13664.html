    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just received my order today for 2x R4 DS, 2x 1 GB microSD and a Super Card Lite Rumble came with it since the order was over $100. At the time I placed the order knowing that he wouldn't get the next shipment of of R4s for another 2 weeks. It came within 5 business days once the cards were shipped. Email responses were prompt. Excellent service.
<br/>
<br/>
While the price is a few more dollars than a few other places I'd rather support a homebrew developer that has contributed to the DS community than a store who couldn't care less about homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My R4 &amp; microSD was shipped quickly and arrived on time!

Great service! Supports Homebrew!  What more could you ask for!  Robots with lasers?  They've got that too!! :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awesome service. Even got an email to ask if I wanted to switch which SD card to get, since the one I picked was out of stock. I said yes, and it was out the door less than 24 hours after I placed the initial order. You rock, Natrium!<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was about to order a DS Motion Pak (slot-2). I was wondering if i'd get the slim cases to fit the ds-lite. I thought i'd get an R4, and wondered it it was the version without a spring. I asked via the contact form, and got a nice email in reply just 1h after, in which all my questions were answered. I placed the roder right after. I'm now waiting for my parcel to arrive, but i think it'll just be smooth.
<br/>
<br/>
Last remark : the shipping options available for France are either uber-expensive FedEx/Purolator/DHL &amp; co, or untracked "normal" pricing. Sadly, i'm not willing to pay as much for the shipping as for the items i just buy, so it would be perfect if there was another tracked option with a reasonnable pricing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now i can give some <span style="font-weight: bold">awesomely positive feedback</span>, as i received my parcel.
<br/>
I ordered a DS motion PAK (slot-2), plus an additionnal R4DS.
<br/>
It seems there's an 8 hours shift between Paris/FR and Kitchener/CAN.
<br/>
<br/>
To sum things up 
<br/>
- i placed the order on Thurdsay, January 10th on 3:23pm (Paris/France time) which is 7:23am at the seller's place
<br/>
- parcel was dropped at the Canada Post office on Friday, 11th
<br/>
- i received the parcel in my mailbox on Thurdsay, 17th.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pros :</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">- Shipped to France in a week</span>
<br/>
- Untracked shipping arrived safely
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">- Cheap untracked shipping method</span>
<br/>
- Packages in a A4-sized <span style="font-style: italic">bubble-enveloppe</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">- Full content detail on the custom invoice
<br/>
- Exact pricing shown on custom invoice
<br/>
- Classified as "samples"
<br/>
</span>- Pay in US$, my bank's commision was 2.2%
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Cons:</span>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">- None !</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Another note to french people : </span>
<br/>
- <span style="font-weight: bold">if</span> you receive the package to "metropolitan" France
<br/>
- <span style="font-weight: bold">if any item</span> in the parcel has a value <span style="font-weight: bold">above 45 euros</span>
<br/>
- <span style="font-weight: bold">You will have to pay the 19.6% VAT</span> on the <span style="font-style: italic">total declared value plus the shipping price plus insurance fee</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
In my case, <span style="font-style: italic">each item was below 45 euros</span>, so even if the total amount was above 45 euros,
<br/>
the customs consider you could send each in it's own parcel and as a consequence consider you package
<br/>
is worth less than 45 euros. And <span style="font-style: italic">when a parcel is worth less than 45 euros and is for personnal use,
<br/>
it's import tax and value added tax (VAT) free.</span>[/u]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a CycloDS Evolution from Electrobee on March 7, 2008.  Arrived within a week, nice and neat.  Kudos for quick and reliable service; I wish everybody I bought chips from did this well.
<br/>
<br/>
(At the same time, I bought for the CycloDS a MicroSDHC card from <span style="font-weight: bold">YesAsia.com</span>, and I'm <span style="font-style: italic">still</span> waiting for that chip to arrive, a month later, and they keep giving me excuses on the phone when I call.  So I know all too well how bad the shipping experience can be:  Electrobee is definitely on the good end of the scale.)<br/>_________________<br/>Do you suppose if I put a signature here, anyone would read it?  No?  I didn't think so either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
