    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> post feedback when you actually have experience from X retailer and you have comments on how this experience was. This could be either feedback on support, prices, delivery time, condition of an ordered item etc etc. Please <span style="font-weight: bold">do not</span> post stating that you have ordered from said retailer and are waiting for the item to be delivered, unless you have been waiting for several weeks and are confident that you will not receive your order. Also, please do not post questions regarding the retailers (how much do they charge in shipping if I order X and want it delivered to X etc). Questions about retailers should be posted in the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=2" target="_blank">offtopic</a> part of the forum. If you want someone to clarify their feedback post, feel free to ask them to do that.
