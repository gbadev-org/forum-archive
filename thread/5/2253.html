<span style="font-weight: bold">Scott Lininger</span> has released an AI engine port of <span style="font-weight: bold">GNUGO</span> for the GBA:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">GNUGO is an open source Go Ai engine. As a learning exercise, I ported version
<br/>
1.2 to the Gameboy Advance and gave it a pretty face. It's not the smartest Ai in the
<br/>
world, but you can set any handicap you want to make it a challenging game.</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Excellent...I've been waiting for something like this!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I didn't realize how far GnuGo has come since v1.2.  This version plays worse than my girlfriend's 6 year old sister.  Still, great start. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GnuGo 1.2 is indeed a poor opponent. I'm working on the next version which will use a more recent (and much smarter) version of the AI.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is really great, i've been looking forward to Go on the GBA. Agreed that it isn't a very strong AI, and it plays a bit funny in the opening game, but it's still enjoyable and good looking too. 
<br/>
<br/>
However it freezes on the hardware itself. This might be because of my XG2 linker, but I don't usually have problems running homebrew and demos through it. Any clue? 
<br/>
<br/>
Which linker is sure to write the flash correctly? i'd love to have this running on the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's really interesting. The game works fine on hardware through my Flash2Advance linker. 
<br/>
<br/>
Does it freeze up at a consistent point, or is it random? It's possible there's a logic problem in the code somewhere and that I just haven't ever played the game with a particular pattern setup that makes it freeze.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It freezes constantly just after the Nintendo logo at startup. The funny thing is that when i plug the flashcart back into the flashreader it won't register the rom. I've tried with the latest versions of flashingsoftware and so fort, both with and without multibooters. I suspected it was my cart, but it clears the diagnostics and handles other demos and stuff just fine. i'll look into it a bit closer, i don't have the equip here atm. I'll also test it with another cart/flasher.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently tried to create a multiboot with a game I built with the Krawall sound system, and it displayed the same kind of "hanging" behavior you're describing.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect your link cable setup is creating it as a multiboot, which apparently makes Krawall barf. Since GBAGO uses Krawall, it's kind of hard to get around.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking into it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont know if this has anything to do with the hang/crash but I solved the problem on PocketNES, PCEAdvance &amp; Goomba by not reading from 0x08000000 when copying the game to EWRAM (instead starting from 0x08000004 and having the first word hardcoded in the code) for multiboot to work.
<br/>
The XG2 (or rather its boot menu) has a "feature" of reseting the GBA when the program tries to read from 0x08000000.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
