An update to <span style="font-weight: bold">Bejeweled</span> by <span style="font-weight: bold">thegamefreak0134</span> has been released:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This is the update for the Bejeweled game I sent in a while ago. It's fully playable
<br/>
now with a scoring system and everything. The name should now be changed from
<br/>
Bejeweled 0.7 to Bejeweled 1.0. The readme file, screenshot and everything in the
<br/>
folder has been updated. There is now a history in the readme. As an added note,
<br/>
the folder should be fully buildable using <span style="font-weight: bold">DevKit Adv</span>.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Grab the new version of <span style="font-weight: bold">Bejeweled</span> plus the full <span style="font-weight: bold">C</span> source straight from the main website!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
