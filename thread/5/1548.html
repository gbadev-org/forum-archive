Here is a simple code sample from <span style="font-weight: bold">Lupin</span> to display text using DMA:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Erm... just curious.  What's the copyright like on the font that was submitted with this?
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote my own algorithm for text out weeks ago, but I never actually got around to hunting down a font to use with it, and when I saw this one... well...  I could help myself.  ;) 
<br/>
<br/>
So am I free to actually use this font for making stuff with, or is it just a placeholder until I can find/make something more original?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Copyrights on fonts is rather dodgy. By that I mean that it is really hard for the creator (owner of copyright) of the font to sue anyone. As far as I know, you are allright using pretty much any font as long as you do not directly distribute the file (ie. .ttf) with your application. In this case, the font is converted into a bitmap so it should be ok. (If lupin did actually use an existing font and not created it himself!)
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, you might want to be carefull using corporate fonts like the typical Coca Cola or Mars font. I wouldn't worry about it too much!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
