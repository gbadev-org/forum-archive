    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Justin Ronco</span> has announced a new GBA game project:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Over the past few months myself and two fellow students have developed a
<br/>
GBA game based around stealth and mini-games.  We have hosting for the
<br/>
game on SourceForge already, but were hoping to let people know that
<br/>
it's there.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The game is called  <span style="font-weight: bold">"CODENAME: Monkey-Bots"</span>.
<br/>
The url is at: <a class="postlink" href="http://cmbgame.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://cmbgame.sourceforge.net/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">"CODENAME: Monkey-Bots is a 1-4 player sneaky/puzzle game.  Players work
<br/>
cooperatively to complete levels by sneaking by security bots and
<br/>
playing mini-games.  The game was developed for a class project by a
<br/>
team of students; the semester is now over so we're releasing the game
<br/>
under the terms of the GPL.  Please check it out and let us know what
<br/>
you think."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
