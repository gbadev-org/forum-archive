A nice and very addictive game made by <span style="font-weight: bold">Aaron Shadis</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This is my FIRST game on the GBA. The last game I wrote was on the Apple IIe in 1988. (I've been busy with other things for a while!) I really wanted to try writing games on the GBA, so I threw together the first things that came to my mind... Pac-Man &amp; Space Invaders. The rest of the game grew from there.</span>

erm I can actually *feel* the mail from IDSA being delivered as
<br/>
I type this :P so..erm...remember the author is responsible for
<br/>
the legality of each demo/game on gbadev.org. If you have any
<br/>
problem with this, take it up with the author who can then contact
<br/>
us to resolve the situation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
