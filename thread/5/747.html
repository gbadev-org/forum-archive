    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks like a cool gadget, but isn't the hardware of the gba used
<br/>
for anything at all?
<br/>
<br/>
I mean is it just displaying and processing sound from the 'java processor'
<br/>
or is the gba processor involved in processing java codes?<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
