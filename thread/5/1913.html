A new demo from <span style="font-weight: bold">Matt Current</span> has been announced by <span style="font-weight: bold">Janne Toivanen</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Matt Current (popularly also known as Matti Nykyinen) is a finnish demogroup
<br/>
making art for a great range of platforms. We released a new demo for
<br/>
Gameboy Advance at Assembly 2003 and we're here to promote it.
<br/>
<br/>
Some features included this time are antialiased lines, radial blurring, raycasting,
<br/>
radiosity lighting and transparency effects. Only mode 4 is used and everything except
<br/>
radial blur runs in full-resolution. Krawall is used to play a ten channel module and
<br/>
graphics are converted with our own utils.
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings to the deadline, to the polyfiller bug from Poland, and to the people feeding us.
<br/>
To contact Matt Current, mail to the coder (janne.toivanenATkolumbus.fi).
<br/>
We like constructive feedback and massive amount of beer.</span>
