    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">HpJcHobbes</span> has created a basic front end for CoG for Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">It makes using CoG a bit easier, in my opinion. Hopefully, others will find it usefull as well.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
from the readme:
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I made is because there were just too many options for CoG and I got tired of typing in all the command lines. It is still in it's infant form, so there are bound to be some bugs and such. I am also going to be adding more options and features and try to get better error detection in the program.</span>
