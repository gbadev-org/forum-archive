    <h4>#7624 - SimonB - Sat Jun 21, 2003 3:45 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im sure you have all read about the Nintendo vs. Lik-Sang trial the last few days.
<br/>
This is Alex Kampl/Lik-sang's official comment on the whole thing:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I hope with the following Information I am able to give you a little insight into the recent
<br/>
happenings and about the misleading press release of Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
Before the Nintendo Press release has been distributed, I have delivered a Notice of
<br/>
Appeal to Nintendo, as well as to the High Court of Hong Kong. I am not exactly sure
<br/>
why Nintendo?s press department didn?t mention a word about it.
<br/>
The Judgment was not a real trial yet, it was a Summary Judgment with a single Judge.
<br/>
Usually such Summary Judgments are in case of bounced bank checks where no trial is
<br/>
needed and everything is straight forward.
<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect to the High Court of Hong Kong, but no Intellectual Property (IP)
<br/>
specialist was assigned to this case. Already at the first hearing the Judge mentioned that
<br/>
it?s a pity Hong Kong has no IP specialist anymore and that he finds the Copyright Law
<br/>
of Hong Kong very confusing. After some research, it looks like the Judge is a specialist
<br/>
for maritime laws. He made several comments during the hearings which seemed to
<br/>
observers like this was his first IP case ever.
<br/>
<br/>
The Summary Judgment itself was based on the Section 273 of the Hong Kong Copyright
<br/>
Ordinance about ?circumventing a copy-protection?. No copy-protection exists in the
<br/>
Gameboy or Gameboy Advance game cartridges. The Judge didn?t hear a specialist or at
<br/>
least an independent 3rd party expert opinion - he took it for granted from the
<br/>
explanations by Nintendo that there is a copy-protection.
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the Judge found that ?by analogy with drugs, it[the setcion 273] is not
<br/>
aimed at the drug addict but at the drug trafficker?. I fail to understand his logic, as this
<br/>
would mean that the drug store selling the injection needles to drug addicts or maybe
<br/>
even the manufacturer of the container where the drug addict keeps the drug could be
<br/>
held liable?
<br/>
<br/>
After legal actions in the USA against Bung Enterprises in the late nineties (for selling
<br/>
and manufacturing videogame development and backup equipment) this was the second
<br/>
Court Judgment ever regarding products of this nature. Regarding information made
<br/>
available to me in the Court Room, the case against Bung and its US distributor Carl
<br/>
Industries Inc was brought to an end in their disfavor by Bung not complying with Court
<br/>
Orders and not paying ordered penalties. The actual judgment was written by Nintendo
<br/>
representatives, without the Judge properly going through the arguments. The legality or
<br/>
illegality of the products in question has therefore never been argued in a real trial
<br/>
anywhere in the world. A serious trial, with competent Judges, is now definitely needed
<br/>
to settle the question once and for all. This is why I have decided to appeal.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not happy about the direction where this is heading, neither are supporters and
<br/>
legitimate users of the tools. Again, I have to stress once more, that the very same
<br/>
hardware under attack is used by thousands of hobbyist users and even professional
<br/>
developers for legitimate purpose. Very embarrassing for Nintendo: even the large
<br/>
publisher, who made the original game used in Court for demonstrating purpose, bought
<br/>
hundreds and hundreds of Flash Cartridges from my company for beta testing. And so did
<br/>
numerous other top 10 publishers listed in the stock market.
<br/>
<br/>
The products I have sold are not circumventing any copy protections, same as a Floppy
<br/>
Disk Drive and a 3.5" Disk doesn't ? in fact there is no copy-protection existing, as
<br/>
commonly known by the gaming industry.
<br/>
<br/>
I completely understand Nintendo?s fight against piracy, but I believe they are aiming at
<br/>
the wrong targets. With Digital Media and the Internet nowadays, publishers will have to
<br/>
change their strategy. They just can?t win the fight against the Progress without removing
<br/>
our primary rights: presumption of innocence and the right for backup. Nintendo doesn?t
<br/>
need to prove you are a pirate anymore, it is assumed you all are if you have the technical
<br/>
means to copy.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If summary judgments in Hong Kong are anything like summary judgments under Anglo common law (UK, US, Canada, Oz), a judge issues a summary judgment when there are no material issues of fact and only issues of law remain, that is, when a judgment for the moving party would be reasonable even when viewing all disputed facts in favor of the other party. For instance, the <span style="font-style: italic">RIAA v. Grokster</span> case was decided in a summary judgment.
<br/>
<br/>
The breakdown of the logic, assuming Hong Kong copyright law has been sufficiently "harmonized" to Euro-American copyright law: Both sides agreed that Lik Sang was distributing devices that can copy computer programs copyrighted by Nintendo. I'm guessing that either both sides agreed that the devices have a non-infringing use (homebrew), or the issue was not raised in court. The judgment appears to have concerned whether or not the non-infringing use was substantial enough to warrant a finding against contributory infringement.

<br/>
<br/>
We all know that 99% of the people who buy flash carts buy them merely to avoid paying the cost of buying GBA games.  It's much easier to download a game and put it on a flash cart than to actually pay for the game after all.  It makes me very happy to see that Nintendo was able to do something about this.

<br/>
I disagree with you here.  Piracy does not benefit the game industry, nor does it encourage the creation of new games.  It does, however, benefit those who manufacture and distribute the pirated products.  Any money they get just encourages them to stay in the piracy business.
<br/>
<br/>
I think a big lawsuit is what the pirates need.  I also applaud nintendo for the effort, but I'm not 100% convinced that they are aiming at the right place.
<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I also agree with Nintendo's publishing policy.  They say that they "typically look for companies that are established game developers."
<br/>
That sounds reasonable to me.  Learning the AGB hardware does not necessarily mean that one can actually produce a game.

<br/>
And I have to agree with Lik-Sang that a flash card + reader/writer is nothing different from a 3.5" disk. If any, it is way more expensive!
<br/>
<br/>
Just imagine that all the illegal ROM sources on the internet weren't available at all. Then the people that merely have their flashlinkers for playing copied games will be very limited as they then have to get their games from friends (which will have to *buy* games).
<br/>
<br/>
If the GBA would've been equipped with a copy-protection mechanism, then Nintendo would have a much bigger point!

Here in Brazil we have an enormous piracy market. You can go downtown and find a dozen stores every street, selling chinese pirate carts, for $15. Guess what, nobody there knows what a flash linker is.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo has a valid point, but a wrong and brute way of dealing with it. The flash linker is not the guilty part, and most people who think it's used illegally 99% of the time is also wrong. It simply costs too much - the regular kid who downloads ROMs won't  walk around with a hundred dollar flash cart on his pocket. Better pay $15 on a pirate cart with 32 games or so. And if the linker is used to "extract" the game, well, if you have a chinese foobar company that can *build* pirate carts, you surely wouldn't need the Evil Flash Linker to read the ROM. Come on!
<br/>
<br/>
So, what do they get with this? They irritate homebrew developers (moot point), they move another step against freedom, and they didn't do ANYTHING to end piracy here, for instance. Should they lower their cart prices from the actual $65 that they cost here, well, that would be a start. If they *do*end the piracy, people won't be able to pay for the games, therefore they won't buy consoles. Do you guys still think PSX is number one because of anything else other than piracy? Or Gamecube low sales is due to their "bad market"? Saying that nobody wins from piracy is naive at most - it makes console sales raise through the roof.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, full support to Lik-Sang, and full support to the homebrew developers.

{skip to the bottom for the point of the very long post}
<br/>
<br/>
Are you right on several points.  
<br/>
1) Pirating increases console sales.
<br/>
2) Pirating CAN decrease cart sells
<br/>
3) carts cost too much
<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple counter points
<br/>
<br/>
1) Every console maker bar Sony losses money on every console they sell.
<br/>
  1a) Sony has only recently streamlined the PS2 mgr process to teh point where they break even.
<br/>
2) Carts cost so much because that is the life blood of the games industry.
<br/>
Every cart sold goes through many hands.  I work in the games industry and for our recently release GC title we get  10% in royalites.  The Nintendo gets a cut.  They deal directly with the publisher of the rate, and I am not privy to that info.  Which brings me to the next middle man the publisher.  The publisher funds the project, pays for the advertisments.  Set up meets with the press, etc.   Let me give you the figures as Iknow then on our project.
<br/>
<br/>
Publisher paid our company 3.5 million to make the game.  The company after expenses (salaries, building expenses, computers, DDH's).   So far the game has cost 3.5mil or 116,000unit at 29.95$ (side note most commerical game do not break 18K units). This expense is fixed regardless of the number of sales.
<br/>
<br/>
Publisher paid 2mil in advertising.  This is a decent budget of advertising.  You probably saw one of the ads in a mag or on TV.  But this is nothing compared to the big boys.  That is another 67k Units.
<br/>
<br/>
Publisher paid internal staff of testers, producers, etc.  I do not know this figure I am sure it is some where around 1.5mil or another 33K units.
<br/>
<br/>
Now this is just the publisher.  That is to say the publisher sold you the game directly (i.e. the internet) which they did not.  Now for secondary cost.
<br/>
<br/>
Physical costs
<br/>
  CD's/Manuals/Boxes/shipping  2.85$ per units
<br/>
<br/>
Retail
<br/>
  Suprisingly enough Walmarts does not sell it for free, in fact they mark up their price. &lt;insert agast shock here&gt;  WalMart makes a couple bucks off each unit.  2.50$ per unit.
<br/>
<br/>
So after all is said in done the product that the publisher has paid 7million dollars to produce they have to make up for in sells.   They could do this if they sell 206,000 units directly to the public.  But they can't, they rely on retail which drops the wholesale price of the units to 24.65$ or 284,000 units.  Like I mentioned before the average game sells 18K units.  18000*24.65=443700.  Hmmm So unless the average game has a budget of 443701.  The game will not turn a profit.  This does not count the skimming of the top that nintendo/sony/microsoft does.
<br/>
<br/>
[Moral of the story]
<br/>
Pirating is a killer in the console world. &lt;- that is a period
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew is good because of the very nature of homebrew.  Look at Steve Wosniak and what happened from his "homebrew" computer.
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrewer should not compare themself to the professionals.  I have yet to see a homebrew project that would pass Nintendo's standards guildlines.
<br/>
<br/>
Making a good viable game is nearly impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
Bad games are destroying the industry (Bad Games = Major losses, good games = major profits).  Unfortunatley the bad/good ratio is terrible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think it has two sides. One is exactly like that. The other - considering that they're trying to make the money back because they dropped their console prices recently - has the piracy market as target. The strategy goes a little like this: let's sell as many consoles as possible, just as many as possible, and if we get back some of the money from software, fine. But let's just build a huge platform first, and let piracy run "under control". Just like MS-DOS back in the day. It's not that a crazy theory - if you were here and checked out the bootleg market, you wouldn't believe it. It's like you MUST have a PSX at home, because there are so many games to choose from, and for about $3 each you'd be crazy not to have one! As for the GC doing well outside America, then it must be outside SOUTH America too. Almost everyone couldn't believe I bought a GC - there's no bootleg software for it, what was I thinking??? PS2 is first, and XBox is right behind, and it's precisely because of piracy.
<br/>

But that's a side note. I just wanted to say that if you compare prices for bootleg carts and the Evil Flash Linker, the last could hardly be the sole responsible for the piracy industry. We have the same amount of pirate games around here for NES, SNES, Genesis (Mega Drive), Dreamcast, N64, PS1, PS2 and XBox as we have for GBC and GBA. Somebody, somewhere is *manufacturing* these carts/CDs/DVDs, making them way much more available than ROM files, and it's not by suing Lik-Sang that Nintendo is gonna stop it. It was brute from them - like arresting the wrong person.

I completely agree with you. I know why a game turns out so expensive. I left the explanation out because that's how the regular consumer addresses the issue: it's expensive -&gt; I will not buy till I find something cheaper, or I won't buy at all.

Homebrewers that think they are going to make a successful game need to re-examine what a successful game is.  Many games that have huge bugets are utter failures.  That is with a legion of testers, dozens of artists, a handful of programmers and a couple game designers. I guess my point is this.

Even if they should be obvious, that doesn't mean that they are.  From what I can tell, Nintendo is most interested in the financial stability, ability to market, and ability to provide support for a game.  After the above is satisfied, I think it would have to be a really bad game to be rejected... (assuming it is a game, and it is complete.)

Nope. From what I remember about this subject being discussed a long time ago in the old gbdev list - in which the Army Men game was given as an example, there were specific do's and dont's. The guidelines (applying to the GBC at the time) were something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
- Games shouldn't be too violent, and should not have adult content (there were exceptions, but this was the general guideline, especially for new license applicants).
<br/>
- Attention should be paid to the battery - i.e. don't make a crappy code.
<br/>
- Commands should either be very intuitive, or the game must have an instructions screen.
<br/>
<br/>
...and so forth. I think this is the kind of reply we are *still* waiting for - myself included.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Both actually,  neither actually.  There are crappy games published, there are amazing games from teh homebrew crew.  I have seen the official documentation and trust me you are not missing much. :)  It is teh most cryptic piece of garbage int eh world (for the AGB, not the GC). I was specificly talking about the anal retentive requirements nintendo forces a game to go through.  Things like on the GameCube you have to Say "Press Start" and the AGB you have to say "Press Start Button" (I might have those backwards).  If you program crashes, even once while the big N is testing your program fails and you have to resubmit.  There is a whole books on standards.  I will see if I can get the standards guildline for a successful submission of a AGB game for publication.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Example are the rotation of sprites.  They do not mention SIN or COSINE, They actually base it off of length and run shearing.  The translation, language wise seemed fine.

I was wondering about that, actually.  Using trig, I can't figure out why the scaling works.  I've never studied affine transformations, so there is probably something about them I just don't know.
