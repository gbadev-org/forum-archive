    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">An update to the useful emulator <span style="font-weight: bold">no$gba</span> has been released by <span style="font-weight: bold">Martin Korth</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Some Bugfixes. It's re-fixing a fatal crash that happened on using flash backup memory, though only 1-2 people seem to have noticed it, so maybe it wasn't &lt;that&gt; fatal. Plus some other bugfixes &amp; details for some rare situations. 
<br/>
<br/>
Debugger &amp; User interface. Debugger file menu is now memorizing the most recently debugged cartnames, Search menu comes up with a new Goto Area function, and the built-in assembler does support to enter "ldr Rd,=immediate" pseudo opcodes in debug mode (that is, if it finds a literal pool space, for more info see Help - Debugging - Assembler - Ldr Imm).
<br/>
<br/>
And, not directly gba related, I've implemented ARMv5 instruction set in the disassembler, assembler, specifications, and in the actual cpu emulation. "ARMv5" instructions are used by the "ARM9" which is used in the Nintendo DS. It's almost the same than the old ARM7/ARMv4, though it's been quite some work alltogether. In no$gba, it's de-activated, and shouldn't cause compatibility problems, of course.</span>
