    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Jim Bagley</span> wanted to let us know that he has finally updated a few
<br/>
roms on his site (download section). They are playable through BOAonline.
<br/>
<br/>
He adds: <span style="font-style: italic">the fighter game and cosmic smash game is a tech demo only, even though it plays, it's not a game as such</span>
<br/>
<br/>
His site can be found at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.jim.bagley.btinternet.co.uk" target="_blank">www.jim.bagley.btinternet.co.uk</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
