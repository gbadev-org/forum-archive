<span style="font-weight: bold">Saikou</span> has just completed his first ever GBA game called <span style="font-weight: bold">Jomo</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Jomo is a puzzle game, similar to the classic Sokoban, but with some
<br/>
differences, such as rolling blocks, and 'mover' tiles. It has 100
<br/>
levels, some pretty nice graphics and sounds, and is my first ever GBA
<br/>
game, so don't be too critical ;).</span>
<br/>
<br/>
This game is very polished and features a great intro, with good music
<br/>
and lots of levels for you to play. It even includes a password system!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
