Thanks, it's nice to get some feedback :)
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I'm afraid I won't have much time to work on this game in the coming few months (actually this is the reason why I wanted the source code to be available for download now - I would be happy if it can be useful for some people). But don't worry, I haven't given up yet , and I'll try to continue the development! (I'm mostly interested in adding some characters to the game, with basic rules, and let them do what they want: eat, sleep, drink, work, play, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
If possible I'll soon do a few modifications and recompile everything: I've learnt things recently that I'd like to include (compression of textures, use the bios for the vwait, etc.).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe, but not by me ^_^  (I haven't started to code on the NDS - I will, but I don't know when!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
