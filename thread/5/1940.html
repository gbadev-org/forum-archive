<span style="font-weight: bold">Paul Timson</span> from <span style="font-weight: bold">Reality Fakers</span> has informed us of his great new puzzle game:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Just a small demo of a game I`ve been working on for a while.
<br/>
The object of the game is to collect all the stars on a level within the given number of moves,
<br/>
as you move the number (bottom right) decreases, when it is your last move the `move`
<br/>
arrow icon will turn red to warn you - this last move must be used to reach the `open` exit
<br/>
(chequered flag tile). When you make your move you will not stop until you hit a solid tile
<br/>
so choose your direction carefully!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Grab the puzzle game straight from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It will be finished but I moved onto a side project (a shoot em up game) for GBA as I wanted to practice more advanced stuff (A.I etc).

<br/>
Hopefully will be be able to add the stuff I`ve learned back into Eyeborg to make it a more interactive experience.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks
