    <h4>#16427 - Tursi - Mon Feb 16, 2004 1:40 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not *exactly* 5:1, more like 4.8:1 (33 bytes in -&gt; 160 bytes out). Close enough, though. The internal accuracy is 13 bits, so some is wasted here.
<br/>
<br/>
GSM is meant, of course, for 8-13khz speech. Using it for music like this is a gross abuse of the codec, and I'm still using the default tables - they could probably be tweaked better for music, though possibly at a greater accuracy cost. Dunno yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Just to answer the question, though, I linked a different song into my Sand demo and uploaded it to a temporary folder:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.harmlesslion.com/temp/Sand2_Pentium44k.zip" target="_blank">http://www.harmlesslion.com/temp/Sand2_Pentium44k.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This one plays 'All About the Pentiums' at 44khz, which is roughly the top end for the CPU in the current version of the code. The real GBA gets about 5-7 fps on the graphics while the music is playing, emulators tend to vary (if it stutters a lot, your emu isn't keeping up).
<br/>
<br/>
The GSM compressed version, (mono, 44khz), came out to 1907k, which compares well against the MP3 (stereo, 160kbps) at 4193k. (stereo-&gt;mono and slightly less than half the size).
<br/>
<br/>
The codec really prefers rich music with a good range, especially something that can mask it's decoding errors (especially with my GBA port, since so much has been removed for speed reasons). Tinny, simple music (bells, xylophone, that sorta thing), and quiet/bassy sounds (such as the rumbling after my thunderclap at the beginning of the demo) so far generate a lot of noise and sound pretty lousy. I'll be working on trying to compensate that.
<br/>
<br/>
Stereo can be achieved, of course, for twice the CPU usage, though I don't have a demo of that at this time.
<br/>
<br/>
I realized that 'Sandstorm' made a lousy demonstration, since it's so repetitive and synthy, but I was pretty addicted to the tune when I started. ;) It also sounded decent through GSM at 16khz.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, the quality is darn impressive for that kind of compression rate. And if you used that to compress a voice-only channel and played it alongside a regular MOD-type song, it would sounds totally awesome. If you've ever played Tales of Phantasia for the SNES (Japanese only though, so you have to find a ROM), they did something to that effect in the opening demo. Very cool, especially for how hard I've heard it is to work with the SNES sound chip. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility would be to compress individual sounds and decompress to EWRAM for MOD playing. Could save abunch of ROM space at the cost of limiting the max samples for a song/EWRAM usage for everything else.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, great work so far<br/>_________________<br/>___________

I doubt it will at 60% CPU consumption... any idea what it would be like more around 11 KHz? (Based on 11 KHz probably being a reasonable minimum for acceptable playback quality on the GBA, although MOD instruments are only recorded at 8 KHz, so who knows?)

<br/>
<br/>
It's just a straight port, all data has been encoded with Toast.
<br/>
<br/>
I got my performance by moving to IWRAM, a great deal of code optimization (do away with some of the code tricks they pull here and there, the optimizer does a lousy job with tricks), manual loop unrolls, and playing with the optimization options to see what worked best. 
<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't yet had a chance to look at the output waveform, since my real work is eating most of my time at the moment. The zero bytes aren't what I was expecting. I'm a bit surprised that the DMA would fall out of sync regardless of the sample rate (do the interrupts tend to lag?) - and I would expect it to be much worse in the 44khz sample?
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples - I'd be interested in sharing notes to see what you trimmed from Short_term_synthesis_filtering(). :) I don't believe I changed the codepath in there at all, so if we put our heads together maybe we can improve the CPU use even more.
<br/>
<br/>
Poslundc - Although it's not 100% accurate to do so, the CPU usage as the bitrate increases is relatively linear, so knowing the usage at one bitrate, you can reasonably estimate the usage at another.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My port is set up to decode an entire waveform to EWRAM before playing any of it. If you have clicks, you might want to try adding that as a debug feature. Or you might want to try building the decoder as a native program, which I did to familiarize myself with the codebase before attempting the GBA port.

<br/>
DMA, such as a big copy triggered on vblank or in the main thread, will delay an interrupt from triggering. I notice that you're doing a bit of palette animation in the clickiest part of the demo; do you use DMA to copy a block of palette data? I just synchronize the entire engine to vblank so that I can make sure that an interrupt will never happen at the same time as a DMA. This does, however, restrict the choice of sample rates, which is why I chose 18 kHz.

There were also some calls to gsm_sub() and the like that I got rid of. The lowercase version of gsm_sub() incurs the overhead of a function call; the macro version GSM_SUB() doesn't.

I used PALRAM[0] to zero in on the identity of the bottleneck. PALRAM[0] profiling changes the background color at the beginning of each function to produce horizontal bars proportional in thickness to the time taken by a function.

Might be a good idea for troubleshooting, yes. I still need to test your theory about the DMA falling behind (probably this weekend.) My demo does not do very much DMA besides the playback itself, and it double-buffers the audio, processing the 'next' buffer as soon as it swaps the banks, so it's very unlikely that it's a buffer underrun. It is possible that the buffer swap (which is interrupt-triggered) is being delayed by something, especially since my audio interrupt may be triggered at literally any time. I considered using the VBlank and can't remember why I decided not to use a compatible rate (I think when I made my decision I was still in the early stages of the engine and targetted 16khz as a magic value).

I did use unroll-loops, and I felt it did help.

I'll certainly look at Short_term_synthesis_filtering(), but after a quick look I don't see that I can do much (besides insisting on register variables, which I'll remove and test). Might try unrolling the loop.

While this is true, there's some overhead in the interrupt calls in my decoder, which of course would happen more often. I'm not sure if there's additional cost, there probably is NOT, but I tend to err on the side of caution when providing estimates. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The code may be used freely in any *free* production, but I'll want some compensation for my time if you use it in anything for charge. ;) As for how to plug it into your own code - play with it a bit, it's not too hard.

<br/>
<br/>
I took a brief look at your optimized decoder ("combined.c" which corresponds roughly in scope to my decoder's "gsmcode.c"), and it appears you got rid of each instance of <span style="font-weight: bold">struct gsm_state *S</span>, making it a global variable instead. Did that optimization in fact make the code run nearly twice as fast, as it would appear from comparison of your results to mine? It would also seem to restrict the decoder to one simultaneous mono GSM stream. I can think of a few cases where this restriction would be a pain.
<br/>
<br/>
However, it appears your "non-commercial" license precludes linking your codec with Free software (as defined by gnu.org). I'd suggest a copyleft license such as the GNU GPL if you don't want the proprietary software industry to make money off your hard work.
<br/>

Oh, and regarding Vblank-compatible sample rates: I just made <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/samplerates/" target="_blank">a tool for those</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks very much for your donation! I appreciate that and the comments. I'm glad to have inspired a challenge. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I don't imagine the change to a global variable provided the speed boost - in fact testing with other globals actually cost me speed, as far as I could tell the compiler was less likely to store global pointers in registers than locals. The biggest reason I made it a global was to reduce stack usage, back before I increased the size of my interrupt stack.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't really think about the multi-streaming considerations of that, but at the same time, my thinking on stereo was to decode one channel, then the other. Each 33-byte GSM frame is completely independant of the frames around it, and so as long as you decode whole blocks at a time, concurrency is not a problem. This does double the CPU usage, and I was considering ways to pack the data to work around it, but I didn't really have time to get very far. (One thing that I wanted to try to take advantage of was the 13-bit resolution of GSM, when we only need 8 bits. I considered packing 6 bits per channel, but being a lossy codec, I haven't yet come up with a decent way to pack the channels.)
<br/>
<br/>
The largest speed boost, I believe, came from the fact that I completely removed one stage of the decoder. I can't remember anymore what that stage was, though. I also believe I started from an older version of the decoder than you did, though again, I have no idea where I found it anymore. :) Not very useful, eh? I played a *lot* with removing/simplifying stages in the decoder to see what was needed and get some idea what was really going on.
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that helped a lot was the removal of the clipping code. This means that some samples could sound very bad if this isn't taken into account, although playing with the de-emphasis value can compensate some for that, which is why it's exposed.
<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that this version doesn't click anymore. ;) That turned out to be letting the interrupt timer tick one too many times before reloading the buffers. Sometimes we made it, sometimes we didn't. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not really a fan of GPL for every case, but you're right, my license prevents people from using it in their own GPLd software, which would be the most useful place for something like this (ie: Pogoshell? ;) ). On the other hand, I did the work specifically to use it in a non-free, non-open project, and I felt releasing it as GPL then using it as not myself was, at best, a small conflict. But, that may be a lessor issue now...

A PogoShell plug-in would be a great idea. But I thought of one thing: If one were to use GSM RPE-LTP in a PogoShell plug-in, then one would have to specify the sample rate. The PC codecs (such as QuickTime, which installed itself as the *.gsm handler on my winbox) assume 8000 Hz, the same rate used in actual mobile telephony, but 8000 Hz isn't so hot for music.

If you own copyright in the work, then dual-licensing is perfectly fine, as seen in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/" target="_blank">LZO</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I still see hits for this thread in my referrer log, so I should probably clear up this one thing - the hypothetical employer was myself, so this is not a work for hire and only myself and the original authors hold any claim to it. :)

The project got shelved anyway. So if someone wants to use this, just ask me. Even if it's going into a GPL project, I'll probably say yes (and then lose it, but whatever ;) ).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
