Saw that <span style="font-weight: bold">Yiri T. Kohl</span> made a post on <a class="postlink" href="http://devrs.com/gba" target="_blank">devrs.com/gba</a> about
<br/>
a port of Oil's Well. tried it and couldnt put it down ;)
<br/>
sooo thought i would post about it here aswell, just incase you
<br/>
missed it...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Nearly complete, fully playable version of Sierra's 1983-classic "Oil's Well". I haven't done any work on this one for almost a year now, and although it doesn't seem too likely that I'll have the time to wrap up it's loose ends any time soon, I figured it'd be a pity if nobody out there would ever know of my puny GBA efforts. Therefore I am hereby releasing 'my' recreation of Oil's Well upon the public, featuring:
<br/>
- all 8 original levels (repixeled by hand for 240x160)
<br/>
- hiscore-list</span>
<br/>
<br/>
you can visit Yiri's site <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~shintaro/shinlabs/" target="_blank">here</a> and you can download the game from our server by clicking <a class="postlink" href="http://gbadev.org/download.php?section=demos&amp;filename=oilswell_v09.zip" target="_blank">here</a> [88kb]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
