<span style="font-weight: bold">Kon</span> mailed to tell us about his latest project, <span style="font-weight: bold">GWGBA</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I have made an adapter that allows a user to attach a PSOne LCD monitor to a GBA Transverter outfitted GBA and view video using the high quality RGB video connection. I made a similar device called the Miracle Ray over a year ago, but unlike the other one the LCD is not fused with the adapter, but plugs in via the ports and screws in the front. This makes it compatible with PSOne LCDs from any manufacturer. Some of the features are pass-though video, stereo sound, on/off switch for the LCD, and the image is fully stretched to fill the 5" screen(unlike with the GBA TV adapter). I call it GWGBA because its front reminds me of George W. Bush. I will also be selling it on eBay soon. Once again, I have no plans to mass produce this device. More features and photos are listed at the top of my MiracleRay web-page at <a class="postlink" href="http://pages.prodigy.net/tan.ax/GBALCDProj/GBALCDProject.html" target="_blank">http://pages.prodigy.net/tan.ax/GBALCDProj/GBALCDProject.html</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
