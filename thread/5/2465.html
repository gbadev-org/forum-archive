    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whoa, that's really impressive. A little dark on a real GBA, but the framerate is still high enough to be playable. The outdoor place looks great though. Can't wait to have something around to actually shoot at^_^<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
