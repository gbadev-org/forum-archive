<span style="font-weight: bold">yaustar</span> has submitted a great third year university project based around <span style="font-weight: bold">Metal Gear</span> by Konami:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This is the final version of a third year project for University 
<br/>
between myself (Steven Yau) and MGFox (Andrew Buckingham). The game
<br/>
design is copyrighted by Konami but everything else is written from
<br/>
scratch and there is a supporting document to read in PDF as well. Have fun!
<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that we knew very, *very* little about the GBA hardware....
<br/>
and we still do :p</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to the project page to find out more: <a class="postlink" href="http://yauster.com/dev/gba_mgs2d.html" target="_blank">http://yauster.com/dev/gba_mgs2d.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The included documentation contains all of the steps taken to develop the project
<br/>
and is a great resource for anyone that is thinking of making this style of game.
<br/>
<br/>
You can download <span style="font-weight: bold">Metal Gear</span> straight from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for comments as we everybody ! :) we poured a lot of hours sweat but no tears into this. Much appreciated :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Greetings, I'm glad you like the game, as yaustar stated it was created using a concoction of blood, sweat, tears and agonised sqealing.
<br/>
<br/>
We talked a while back about continuing the project but no conclusion occured and we since took upon another project which has hit a brick wall that goes by the name of 'Soggy'.
<br/>
<br/>
Yaustar, did you want to upload my report docs as well (if i can find them) and have you changed any of the code since the Dissertation release stage?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,

** looks at yaustar's post***

yaustar said there wasn't any tears! Maybe he was speaking for himself only. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seriously though, it was fun AND strenuous, we did have both ups and downs, but nothing we couldn't overcome with all-night programming sessions. But when things finally worked, we very happy...to get sleep!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">haha... yeah sure, I can upload your report as well... would give an interesting contrast to readers.. nah I havent changed the code although it be tempting to rewrite the engine..
<br/>

As for the tears comment ... definintely no tears but lots of headbanging when things went strangely wrong *cough*AI radar*cough* ;)<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think he means that my report is 'NOW' uploaded on the download page :-D
<br/>
<br/>
Don't expect too much information about programming the GBA hardware, my main focuses were the A.I. (As simple as it is, we ran out of time) and the Sprites (Characters, yauster did the backgrounds).
<br/>
<br/>
I also did the player controls (movement, aiming and shooting), which i've just realised went undocumented, oops. However, yaustar modified the movement code to move the BG rather than Snake, so hopefully his report covers that (I have completely forgotten whats in your report, sorry yaustar).
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I suck at reports, I got a 2:1 (upper second class)
<br/>
