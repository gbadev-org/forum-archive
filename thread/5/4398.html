    <h4>#29251 - krom - Mon Nov 15, 2004 3:21 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Francesco Napolitano</span> has informed us that the <span style="font-weight: bold">GBA Wins Devkit 1.0</span> is out:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">It took several months to get to the final version, but finally here it is.
<br/>
GBA WinS, as some of you already know, is a windowing system intended to
<br/>
simplify and quicken the development of non-game applications for the GBA
<br/>
(and possibly other handhelds, in the future). Like Windows and other
<br/>
windows-based OSs, it offers a common application programming interface
<br/>
allowing developers to build their apps relying on an expandable library of
<br/>
graphic controls. GBA WinS also deals with text input, using a system called
<br/>
K+. From the final user's point of view, GBA WinS is a Windows-like
<br/>
environment directly on his GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
GBA WinS is an ambitious project and cannot be handled by a single (already
<br/>
busy) person. For this reason I decided to make it open source (under GPL
<br/>
license) in the hope that someone will want to help making it grow strong.
<br/>
The project is currently hosted on SourceForge (<a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gbawins/" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gbawins/</a>)
<br/>
and awaits for other developers to join. The most urgent task is the
<br/>
development of a memory manager.
<br/>
<br/>
Peaple wanting to build their own applications for WinS, instead, can get
<br/>
the GBA WinS Devkit 1.0, including libs, documentation, examples and a
<br/>
one-click installer and refer to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbawins.com" target="_blank">www.gbawins.com</a> for support, news, etc. The
<br/>
same site is also the home of all GBA WinS final users (people just wanting
<br/>
to get GBA WinS).</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Here's a list of features:</span>
<br/>
   - Cooperative multitasking environment.
<br/>
   - Hardware and software sprites support.
<br/>
   - Customizable set of installed applications.
<br/>
   - Graphic pointer.
<br/>
   - Expandable set of window controls.
<br/>
   - Fast text input system (K+).
<br/>
   - Flexible graphics library (WGL).
<br/>
   - Variable width fonts support.
<br/>
   - One-click devkit installer.
<br/>
   - A bunch of other stuff...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
