A GBA game called <span style="font-weight: bold">TrainX</span> has been released by <span style="font-weight: bold">WHowe</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This game is a clone of a windows game "Special Training" which is written by a Japanese. I don't know the  author's name. Sorry.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Features</span>:
<br/>
1. Many bmps is simply copied from original game, so thanks to the original "Special Training"'s author.
<br/>
2. I used a thumb sound engine called "GBA MusicWave" developed by Sergej Kravcenko. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.codewaves.com/gbaplay.html" target="_blank">http://www.codewaves.com/gbaplay.html</a>
<br/>
3. And the mod music is from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.modarchive.com" target="_blank">www.modarchive.com</a>, the  sfx is morphed from windows xp media resouces, or my voice.
