noticed earlier that <a class="postlink" href="http://www.success-hk.com" target="_blank">Success</a> has posted news about a USB version
<br/>
of the Flash2Advance. Apparantly its going to be called Flash2Linker.
<br/>
Now is it just me who are totaly confused by all the 2 advance,
<br/>
advance 2, flash advance etc etc names? I mean ffs :P
<br/>
<br/>
The unit is compatible with flash2advance flash cards and is set to
<br/>
be released soon.
<br/>
<br/>
They also mention a <span style="font-style: italic">Compact Flash</span> version of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.flash2advance.com/gw.htm" target="_blank">GameWallet</a> but I
<br/>
dont think I will say anything about that ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
