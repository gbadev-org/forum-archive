Many of you have already had a look at the preview page
<br/>
of <span style="font-style: italic">Shiggsy's Place</span> that has been up for almost a month now.
<br/>
Well Im glad to tell you that I just got off the phone with
<br/>
Shiggsy himself and he confirmed that his site will be ready
<br/>
this week, perhaps even as soon as tomorrow! oh joy! ;)
<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who havent heard about <span style="font-style: italic">Shiggsy's Place</span>
<br/>
before, I can tell you that it is a site dedicated to
<br/>
Nintendo development units both old and new. Im not 100%
<br/>
sure what Shiggsy has in mind but Im sure he wont let us down.
<br/>
Has he ever? :)
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to have a peek, just head on over to:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://shiggsy.gbadev.org" target="_blank">http://shiggsy.gbadev.org</a>
<br/>
And dont forget to stop by later this week when the whole
<br/>
site should be up and running.
<br/>
<br/>
erm...sorry for going on and on about Shiggsy, but its the
<br/>
least I can do after all he has done for me, no, for all of us!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
