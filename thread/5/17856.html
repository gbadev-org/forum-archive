    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">krom and I have spent a few hours the last couple of days fixing gbadev.org; making sure the downloads are working (they weren't!), fixing links to websites and touching up on some code.
<br/>
<br/>
Today we have also done actual updates with "new" content. Unfortunately some of the news items posted today has been sitting in our inboxes for 2 years or so. Sorry about that! :=)
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, if anyone has any nice GBA-related material worth putting on the main site, please feel free to post here or e-mail us about it!
