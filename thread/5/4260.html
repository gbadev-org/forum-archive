<span style="font-weight: bold">Allen Ussher</span> has sent in a great <span style="font-weight: bold">Street Fighter II</span> style engine:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I emailed you guys before about my project called Project Hazuki.  Anyway, I 
<br/>
have a working build now that demonstrates a Street Fighter II-like engine. 
<br/>
Moves work, combos work, there's sound, health meters, and more.
<br/>
You can play through one match right now against a computer-controlled Ryu.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
This is version 0.11 of the engine, to find out more details read the
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">hazuki.txt</span> file stored inside the zip archive.
<br/>
<br/>
The demo is very playable, it features polished controls, fast gameplay
<br/>
and has satisfying sound effects!
<br/>

A "practice" mode with a sleep-walking opponent would be a nice feature.

Hey, thanks for the comments, guys.
<br/>
<br/>
The AI is actually pretty easy to beat once you can do all the special moves well enough.  I still have to work on making good AI.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want a "practice" mode.  Just hit the SELECT button to turn off the CPU's actions.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice game. It plays like I'd expect a professional game to play.
<br/>
I would really like to see the source for this, but if you dont want to release that, could you explain the animation you used.
<br/>
I've never made anything that needed more sprite data that could fit into vram, but i've watched your game playing, and it seems to copy blocks of animation into ram when needed. But I dont know how it decides where in ram this data goes, or how you keep track of how the sprite will be animated.<br/>_________________<br/>-pb</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Basically, I wrote a caching algorithm that checks to see what sprites
<br/>
are in OAM space first before displaying them.  If the sprite is there
<br/>
already, I don't bother copying it in.  If it's not there yet, I look for the
<br/>
oldest sprite in OAM that has not been used recently and overwrite that.  
<br/>
Since I'm using 4-bit sprites and have only a fixed number of sprites on the 
<br/>
screen, I am guaranteed to have several tiles in OAM that I can overwrite
<br/>
without affecting the sprites being displayed.  
<br/>
<br/>
The caching technique is a standard one used on micro-processors and
<br/>
operating systems.
<br/>
<br/>
For details on the sprite state machine, there are some notes in the
<br/>
hazuki.txt file included with the archive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
