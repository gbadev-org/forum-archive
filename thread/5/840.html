    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pbwhere.com" target="_blank">peebrain</a> released a tool called <span style="font-weight: bold">gbAmp</span> the other day.
<br/>
<br/>
from the readme:
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Here's my personal clone of gfx2gba.  I think I really improved on it.
<br/>
First, one obvious improvement is that you can either run it via the
<br/>
command line (for batch conversions), or you can run it like a normal
<br/>
windows program.  While running it as a normal windows program, you
<br/>
don't really have that many choices - first Open an image file, then
<br/>
use the Export Wizard to produce the binary/C file that you want.  I
<br/>
also added a cool feature so you can see the command line equivalent
<br/>
of what you choose with the wizard so you don't have too think too
<br/>
hard ;-).</span>
<br/>
<br/>
more info in the readme. oh and yep...source code should be released
<br/>
soon aswell.
<br/>
