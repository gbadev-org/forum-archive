    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">made some changes to the demo section earlier today.
<br/>
its now possible to list the games with screenshots (as some people asked for).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, heh finally got around to fixing the source section a bit. It should now be easier to find stuff in there (only tools atm but demos might be done today or tomorrow). erm have a look see what you think.
<br/>
<br/>
try it out and feel free to give feedback on these changes and on other stuff you would like to have...
<br/>
<br/>
either e-mail me or reply in this thread on the forum...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
