    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Martin Korth</span> has released a greatly improved version of the <span style="font-weight: bold">no$gba</span> emulator:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Debugger. Now also supports memory read breaks, the new syntax for Ctrl+B input is: 
<br/>
 [start..end]?    break on any read from specified memory area 
<br/>
 [start..end]!    break on writing changed data (different than old value) 
<br/>
 [start..end]!!   break on writing any data (regardless of old value) 
<br/>
And of course, also supporting combinations like ?! and ?!! (ordering is don't care, ie. !? and !?! and !!? does the same).
<br/>
<br/>
Flashcards. The upload function in utility menu now also allows to write rom-images to flashcards which are plugged into the gba cartridge slot, via parallel port "xboo" cable. The function uses a highspeed checksum mechanism to identify/skip unchanged sectors, reducing the erase/write time when uploading different builts of the same program. Should work with most or all Flash Advance carts, please let me know about any problems with flashcarts from any manufacturers! It'd be no problem to fix that.
<br/>
<br/>
Emulation Accuracy. Low-power Halt mode doesn't hang if interrupts are disabled in IME or CPSR. Emulates SPSR Bit4 being always set. Doesn't mirror EEPROM to addresses with upper four bits nonzero. Emulates more bios-prefetch garbage even when not having the bios rom-image, or when booted &lt;with&gt; bios intro enabled. Emulates Vcount=99h when booted from cartridge. Allows reading from second channel 3 wave ram bank.
<br/>
<br/>
Other News. Sav and Sna files now using simple data compression, of course still compatible with old files. Re-fixed eeprom emulation (crashed in last version). A22i assembler fixed crash on invalid "adrl" parameters. Debug window automatically moved to entrypoint when (re-)loading rom-images. Added new help chapter with flashcard specs, plus notes on gba sp, and on Halt, Siodata32, and SO During Inactivity.

Webpage. I am just moving from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash" target="_blank">www.work.de/nocash</a> to <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/" target="_blank">http://nocash.emubase.de/</a> aside from the new no$gba update, there are also updated standalone versions of the gbatek specifications, and of the xboo package, and a slightly modified magic floor version.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Download version <span style="font-weight: bold">2.0</span> of the emulator straight from the main web site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
