A demo for the GBA released in Easter has been announced by <span style="font-weight: bold">Raimo Gratseff</span>:

<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Last easter we released a demo for game boy advance which won the console demo competition at breakpoint2003 demoparty in germany and I was thinking about submitting it to gbadev.org as there might be people who are interested to see it. (even if they don't know it)
<br/>
<br/>
The demo has a wide range of effects and a 3d engine which is able to render fullscreen, full resolution, fully texturemapped 3d scenes. It has also two parts (with different music) and has a total running time of almost 6 minutes. This also makes the rom file as big as some of the commercial games, 4MB.
<br/>
<br/>
9 persons participated in the making of the demo but most of the work was done by dairos, an 18-year-old coder who coded everything alone. other people were 2 Musicians and 6 Graphics artists (who i count myself in).</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold">Name of the demo</span>: Phloam
