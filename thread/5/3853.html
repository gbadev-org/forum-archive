    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Martin Korth</span> has upgraded his emulator <span style="font-weight: bold">no$gba</span> to version 1.9a:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Last two weeks I've spent on adding cheat support to no$gba, a just for fun nonsense 
<br/>
feature, included in the freeware gaming version only (not in the 'serious' versions). 
<br/>
<br/>
Cheats are loaded/saved in ascii format in file no$gba.cht, the codes &lt;may&gt; contain modifiers 
<br/>
(eg. "xx" or "??"), codes can be entered, activated, and modified in no$gba cheat window. As 
<br/>
<br/>
far as I know it's the first win95 compatible gba emu with cheat support, looking quite nice 
<br/>
so far, though it probably can't take up with cheat support in open source windows xp business 
<br/>
emulators   
<br/>
<br/>
Didn't have time to test the cheat feature with commercial games, but it should support all 
<br/>
known codebreaker, gameshark, and action replay v3 cheat codes. 
<br/>
<br/>
The HLL debug version is now demangling (almost) all c++ labels, and demangled names are 
<br/>
displayed everywhere in the debugger, and are properly sorted alphabetically in profiler list. 
<br/>
<br/>
And as general emulation bugfix, no$gba is now supporting sound DMA with decrementing source 
<br/>
address - pretty strange playback method, but it's actually used by Elite. 
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I've started working on better DOS memory managment, it's unfinished and currently 
<br/>
doesn't work at all, so I'll be updating only the windows version this time.</span>

It has been stored in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Tools/Emu</span> section, grab it straight from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
