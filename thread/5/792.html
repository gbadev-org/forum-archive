<span style="font-style: italic">HAM 2.71 update from 2.7 has been released tonight. The most major change in this update is a more stable compiler tool chain, which also fixes the C++ issues people experienced with HAM 2.7 ... Although it does not look like it, many things have changed "under the hood" , so even if you do not use C++, this update is highly recommended.</span>
