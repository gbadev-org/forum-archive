<span style="font-weight: bold">Ethos</span> has released a nice Final Fantasy 2 RPG demo:

<span style="font-style: italic">Here is my first Demo, I like it and hope you do.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The demo features mosaic transition effects like in the original game.

Right now I am transitioning into a new engine with concurrent movement for NPC and character (done), and a base (paralax) background.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am just finishing up animated tiles with more than two frames, and will have to harvest a few more graphics for door opening, switches.

<br/>
Well it was my first demo, a lot of the basics of an engine and GBA graphics had to be learned first, also 50% of my development time is taken to update my Java map creator.
<br/>
<br/>
But as a teaser these are the features implemented on the new Demo:
<br/>
1. Whole Castle Baron
<br/>
2. Chest opening, with flag marking
<br/>
3. Switches will work (tile fliping + collision changing)
<br/>
4. Animated Tiles
<br/>
5. Animated NPCs (fixed or random movement)
<br/>
6. The framework for Paralax backgrounds (2 Layered Backgrounds)
<br/>
7. Door opening
<br/>
<br/>
Removed: 
<br/>
1. Saving, the code is there, but it is unneeded in a Demo (pain to have a .sav file)
<br/>
<br/>
To be added in the next Version:
<br/>
1. Message Layer
<br/>
2. NPC dialog
<br/>
3. Party Menu
<br/>
4. New/Load Menu
<br/>
<br/>
Any other Ideas??
<br/>
<br/>
I am also looking for resources, like item lists, monster lists, ripped graphics.  Just respond if you have any good links :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I said a week or two,
<br/>
Right now its just me making the maps, I've implemented most of the code.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are two additions that I added yesterday,
<br/>
1. Movement for the Paralax background (moving water)
<br/>
2. Alpha blending water sprites (lower portion)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. Battle system is my last phase, after world map.
<br/>
2. Inventory is implemeted in the backend, but without menus/dialog layer it is pretty much useless.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I have the demo 90% complete, but I am implementing windowing right now since I can't use my fade effect with the Waterblending and also the bed-blending in FF2.  I have Windowing working, I am just trying to find out how to do my updates during hblank to make them smoother.
<br/>
<br/>
I will release at the latest right before I leave for 2 weeks to Scotland on the 3rd.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but not in this phase.  I originally put in all the structures for sending script commands to the engine, but removed it about 2 months ago.
<br/>
<br/>
The engine still has 2 modes, Script Mode, Default Mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
The way it was written to work was if there is an event in Default Mode, it points to a script and flips the mode to Script Mode.  The script completes and will give parameters back to the engine to load the new map that is needed after the script in Default mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Script Mode would also be used for the Initial game intro.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I am done all the engine now. And map creation is at 65%.
<br/>
<br/>
Just need to pull out that map editor I made and finish up the left and right towers.
<br/>
<br/>
Cross your fingers, I may do a release tonight. (Therefore you'll see it in a week, or so it seems)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, a check from everyone on menus.
<br/>
<br/>
This is my proposed menu design (since of course the usual menu is way too large to fit the gba screen).
<br/>
So instead of full screen scrolling (ugh), I think that this'll work nicely
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, I would suggest squeezing the options closer together on the right hand menu, so they all fit on the screen at once. One nice trick is to use HBlank to change the text BG's REG_BGxVOFS to get less than a whole tile of spacing between each of the options. Easiest to just make a static table of vofs values and use HDMA to copy them in. 
<br/>
The left side looks ok that way, just scrolling it. Not much way around it unless you make a font that's less than 8 pixels tall and use the partial-tile spacing trick on that too, but that would probably look like poop, and the portraits would still be scrunched.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
