Oh you have to try this classic! <span style="font-weight: bold">Grumpy Cat</span> has ported
<br/>
the Atari ST game <span style="font-weight: bold">Thrust</span> to the GBA and what a great job
<br/>
he did. Nice intro aswell. aaaah the sound, the game the memories :)
<br/>
<br/>
from the readme...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">ABOUT THE GAME
<br/>
==============
<br/>
Grumpy Cat's "Thrust" is based on the Atari ST version of "Thrust"
<br/>
by Alan Butcher - which is the version I played the most in the 80s.
<br/>
It includes the following:
<br/>
    + Complete game: intro, info screens, demos, high score table (and
<br/>
      the game itself).  All 80s style.
<br/>
    + All 10 missions from the Atari ST version.
<br/>
    + High scores saved to battery backed RAM.
<br/>
    + Antialiased sprites and tether.
<br/>
    + Reverse gravity.
<br/>
    + Invisible landscape.
<br/>
    + All-new sound effects.
<br/>
    + Original Atari ST "Thrust" theme by Rob Hubbard.
<br/>
<br/>
My Gameboy Advance has an Afterburner backlight and the color palette has
<br/>
been tuned for high contrast and good AA performance on that screen - that's
<br/>
why the bullet sprites are white instead of red...  red bullets were almost
<br/>
invisible on my screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Jeremy C. Smith wrote the original "Thrust" for the BBC Microcomputer.
<br/>
I used the status display and font from his version as I think they look
<br/>
better than the Atari ST version.</span>

<br/>
Very nice conversion.
<br/>
Shame that Jeremy died after he finished Exile - he could have made lots more games.

I've been thinking about putting a "save game" feature in - mostly because I keep getting partway into a game and then being pulled away (!!).  I'll probably start looking at it this week.

<br/>
<br/>
I've got a small suggestion however. Try tweaking the scrolling somewhat. It starts following you just a little too late, making you only see a little ahead of the direction you're going, making it rather hard to shoot the domes as you can't see the one you're shooting at most of the times. Also, in level 3 if you don't touch any keys you'll begin falling down and after a while the camera will follow you a little, then stop for a while, then begin following you again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it might have been like that on the original, but if not, I think it'd be better if made the scrolling code a little more helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lovely port of a lovely game :).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Gee, I hope I spelled that right.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
