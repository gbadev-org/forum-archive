<span style="font-weight: bold">Robert Parnell</span> has released an 8Bit 3D Lighting Demo for the GBA:

<span style="font-style: italic">Demonstration of 3D Lighting in 256 color mode 4, using a

256*32 entry color lookup table. Needs some serious optimization.</span>

I'm still far from being able to create 3d stuff like that.

<br/>
Its mainly hacked together from old dos source code I wrote a few years ago.  I was suprised the Gameboy could handle it. After I rewrite the inner loops in asm it should run alot faster. Due to its design it carn`t easily be turned into a proper game engine, not without some major rewriting but it should come in handy for some nice demos.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">niltsair, forgot to ask what emulator are you running it in. I seem to get wildly different speeds depending which emulator I use.
<br/>
<br/>
PS anybody out there like to try it on hardware for me. I`m still saving for my linker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When i'll re-flash my Card, i'll give it a try on Hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anybody know which emulator has the closest speed match to real hardware, or is it a case of really needing to test it on hardware to be accurate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't use anything but VisualBoyAdvance (other emulators lose sound sync), so here are my guidelines:
<br/>
<br/>
VBA runs code in VRAM and IWRAM at the normal rate, but it does not emulate wait states. Therefore, code in EWRAM will run three times as fast as on hardware, and code in ROM will run two to four times as fast depending on REG_WAITCNT settings and how much the code branches.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
