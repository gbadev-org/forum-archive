<span style="font-weight: bold">Lupin</span> has released a pretty Fractal plotter with a changeable palette:

<span style="font-style: italic">I would like to present you my latest creation - MandelBoy v1 =)
<br/>
<br/>
This little tool allows you to examine the mandelbrot fractal with your GBA, it supports zooming,
<br/>
editing the color palette, saving last palette/position to SRAM and it is only 4 kb in size.
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun watching how each pixel gets calculated and drawn ;-)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The archive includes the binary and source code in C + ASM.

<br/>
You can download the viewer straight from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't know if it's just me but I was not able to make this run correctly with VBA. I was only able to change the bg color. At some point the cursor could only move diagonaly. Is there a bug perhaps?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This program is beautiful! Very sexy, and the algorithm seems to run faster than others i've seen. I'm very impressed.
<br/>
<br/>
worked fine in VBA for me.... just took a bit of messing around to figure how to use the sliders. There is a slider above the pallette (bottom left) to control which section you want to change the colour of.
<br/>
<br/>
I think when you select a section of the mandlebrot to zoom in on, the cursor will only move diagonally in multiples of 246:160 so that you select a section in proportion to the screen, rather than a disproportionat section which would appear squashed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">heh thx for the positive comment pyros! I could even make it faster by reducing the palette and therefor reducing the itterations per pixel (i saw another fractal zoomer that only used 48 or 64 colors, MandelBoy uses 128 colors).
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the crappy selection method, but i just added it very quickly because i noticed how ugly the mandelbrot would look like if you don't zoom using the screen proportion =/
<br/>
<br/>
But I am quite sure there will be a second MandelBoy version, with better controls (it can be quite hard to hit the sliders with the cursors because they are so small)... julia fractals and another nifty feature that you probably didn't see in any fractal zoomer yet heh ;-P
<br/>
<br/>
I am very happy to receive any feedback at all, thx guys! =)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>
