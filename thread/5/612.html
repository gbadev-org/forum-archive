<br/>
Runes are little stones that have been used to look into the future since the dark ages. Each rune has it's own name, and it's own meaning. There are 25 runes - each was once a letter in an ancient Germanic alphabet. This program does all the reading of the stones for you. All you have to do is follow the messages that appear onscreen.
<br/>
<br/>
These are genuine layouts and interpretations of the runes. And yes, it does work so be serious when you use the oracle of the runes!</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
