Just in from pharg. Its <span style="font-weight: bold">RipaRoo</span>!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">RipaRoo</span> is a tool that will rearrange mame character sets into there repsective on screen sizes.
<br/>
Which is handy if you are porting a game to another platform, this means you no longer have to sit
<br/>
there for hours capturing screenshots.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Remember to read the readme before doing anything stupid! *cough*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, but if you are porting a game that is in MAME, then you have all the info you need to just convert the data from the format it's stored in the ROM -- just write some code to convert the data on either the PC or the target machine (for example, the GBA).  I used this method with my partial BombJack conversion, and it worked fairly well.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, by doing it this way instead of taking screenshots, etc, etc, the layout of the characters and sprites in VRAM is pretty much identical to the way it is on the real game -- which means that it's pretty easy in my case to drop a Z-80 core into it, and make it into an emulator (I know this because that's what I did with it :) )<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SmileyDude:
<br/>
If it's so easy to make a GBA-hosted emulator targeting a coin-op machine with a 4.2 MHz Z80 processor, then why are 'gbongba' and friends so slow?
<br/>
<br/>
And I don't see how this tool would be so useful for hobbyist developers, as the game publishers still own copyrights on the tile and cel images used in classic video games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
