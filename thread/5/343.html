<span style="font-weight: bold">Dave Mejia</span> has released his first game for the GBA called <span style="font-weight: bold">Touch!</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Touch! can be thought of as breakout with a few
<br/>
twists...
<br/>
The goal of the game is to move all the blocks to the
<br/>
bottom of the screen.  Your paddle can move up, down,
<br/>
left or right? and you can control the speed of the
<br/>
ball.
<br/>
To clear the level you must move all the blocks within
<br/>
the three-minute time limit.  Each time the ball hits
<br/>
the red line you will be penalized by a certain
<br/>
deduction of time.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The game includes</span>:
<br/>
+ A High Score system (not saved to SRAM though)
<br/>
+ Instructions are built into the image
<br/>
+ Proper credit to the people who made the game possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Download the game from the main site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
