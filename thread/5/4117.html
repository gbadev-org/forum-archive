An anonymous person has sent in a nice platform genre demo:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Just a small tech demo ...</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The demo is a test for a platform gaming engine based on the
<br/>
graphics from the classic <span style="font-weight: bold">Shadow of the Beast</span>.
<br/>
It features a great use of parallax scrolling on the grass fields in
<br/>
the background, and has decent sprite animation and controls for
<br/>
moving around and crouching.
<br/>
<br/>
You can grab the demo straight from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very nice work.  No feedback was requested, however I had some thoughts that would make the demo look even better.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Putting the moon on its own BG layer seemed a bit wasteful?  Considering the cool parallax effect going on in the world, doing the moon as a sprite and using this free layer for a second tree layer would make the woods section look quite a better, IMO.  ie, they would fit in with the scrolling style you have going.
<br/>
<br/>
2) The artwork overall is good...I really liked the tree artwork.  The only thing that really stands out is the artwork for the moon.   Reserving a few extra colours for it would help a lot...  Maybe even make the colours closer to the background colour, to make the moon look like it's further away, as if you were seeing it through a dense atmosphere (kind of like how fog works in a lot of 3D games).
<br/>
<br/>
3)The last thing is that the character animation speed does not feel like it matches at all with the scrolling speed of the world.  He either needs to animate faster or the world needs to move slower...or maybe even a bit of both?  So, just fixing this one thing would make the whole demo seem a lot more solid, IMO?  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, nice work!
<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold">[edit] </span><span style="font-style: italic">Doh, I should have read closer...it's based off of an existing game.  Oh well, I think my comments still hold true unless you are attempting to make as close to an exact copy/port as you can.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
