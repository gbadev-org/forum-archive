<span style="font-weight: bold">Fran?ois Pessaux</span> has sent in an alpha of a puzzle game called <span style="font-weight: bold">Blocktrap</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Blocktrap is a small puzzle game in which you have to
<br/>
fight against blocks invading your territory from 3
<br/>
directions. Some blocks with special properties come
<br/>
to mess up you life.
<br/>
This is the first released version but development
<br/>
will still go on. Once reached a more complete stage,
<br/>
source files (in C) will be available. Inside the
<br/>
archive are the documentations (in French and
<br/>
English).
<br/>
Here it is. I hope this will give you a bit of good
<br/>
time...</span>
<br/>
<br/>
You can download the game from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
