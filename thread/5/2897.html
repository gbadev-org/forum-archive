<br/>
AGB_Hack is a highly accurate adaptation of PC Hack 3.61, released in 1986.
<br/>
Hack started out as a clone of the original Rogue, but was later expanded
<br/>
and eventually became the basis for the modern classic NetHack in 1987.
<br/>
<br/>
The included guide and readme files are absolutely essential reading before
<br/>
starting a game, even if you have played Hack or NetHack in the past.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
You can download the game from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
