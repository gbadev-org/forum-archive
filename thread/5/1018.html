erm heh I will also mention a site I came across mebby 6 months
<br/>
ago while looking for pictures from ECTS 2002. Not only did I
<br/>
find pictures from the show on this site, but also pictures from
<br/>
how the company (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.realismstudios.com" target="_blank">Realism Studios</a>) moded 2 GBA's to run inside arcade
<br/>
cabinets. Many nice pics (be sure to read the bottom of page 2 ;)
<br/>
I think I may have mentioned Realism before. Not sure if you remember
<br/>
it but they won "best handheld game" at ECTS 2002 for super monkey ball Jr.
<br/>
