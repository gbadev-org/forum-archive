A new game has been sent in by <span style="font-weight: bold">Daniel Crowley - Wilson</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Here's my first GBA effort, Jewel Crash. In truly original style it's a
<br/>
clone of that popular game that debuted on the original Game boy some years
<br/>
ago. It is nearly complete, hence its version number of 0.9 Beta; There is
<br/>
just a couple of bugs that need to be solved, as discussed in the readme
<br/>
file. I'm sure one of the talented coders at gbadev has the answers, if so
<br/>
please email me.</span>
