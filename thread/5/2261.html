<span style="font-style: italic">I write to report that the first beta of Keyboard Advance is out. Keyboard Advance is, as far as I know, the only GBA text editor around. The reason for this resides of course in the hardware constraints of the GBA input capabilities: 10 buttons (including control pad directions) for 26 higher and lower-case letters, 10 cyphers, punctuation and other symbols. In addiction the software has to deal with conventional user-interface inputs (move cursor, skip page, pop menu etc.). KA is my personal attempt to face this apparently unsolvable problem. Of course the result is not like having a 103-keys keyboard, but I think it's still worth a look.</span>
