<span style="font-style: italic">One Man Band is pleased to announce the release of Converter of Graphics
<br/>
(CoG), its latest image conversion tool for the Gameboy Advance, which is
<br/>
now available for immediate downloading.
<br/>
<br/>
CoG is a command-line tool that easily integrates into any 'make' process.
<br/>
It can convert images to source code, raw data and even directly to an
<br/>
object file. Other features include: header file creation, tile
<br/>
optimization, image quantizing, data compression and direct-to-ROM
<br/>
exporting.
<br/>
<br/>
CoG is not just for programmers! By exporting directly to a ROM, artists can
<br/>
quickly check to see how the image looks on an actual Gameboy Advance.
<br/>
Simply convert the image and specify the ROM exporting option, flash the
<br/>
newly-created ROM to a cartridge, power on your Gameboy Advance and view
<br/>
your image. It's that simple!
<br/>
<br/>
Download CoG today and see how quick and easy it is to convert all of your
<br/>
images.
<br/>
<br/>
CoG - the only Gameboy Advance image converter you'll ever need.
