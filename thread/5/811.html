<br/>
hope you all had a lovely weekend :=)
<br/>
<br/>
anywhooo...I was just asked by someone how the new gbadev
<br/>
site is going. We have made some progress actually...not
<br/>
sure if youve noticed though as its mostly the updating
<br/>
stuff that has been changed. Something you might find useful
<br/>
however is the changes to the tool section, where its now
<br/>
possible to list the tools by name, platform and author.
<br/>
The demo and source section will be fixed this week hopefully
<br/>
to do something similar (make it easier to find what you want).
<br/>
Also, a table based version of the site should be finished in
<br/>
April or so...
<br/>
<br/>
While we are working on the site feel free to send in suggestions
<br/>
and comments as we really have nothing better to do...honest!
<br/>
<br/>
I can also mention that the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org" target="_blank">forum</a> now has over 600 members and is
<br/>
quite active with its 50 posts / day.
<br/>
<br/>
and finally...some sad news. after thinking I was going to have
<br/>
the week around E3 off, I was just told last week that I will have
<br/>
to work :( this will prolly save me a lot of money though since I was
<br/>
going to buy everyone who said 'hello' to me at the show a drink...
<br/>
*cough* heh...erm....no really! ;) *cough*
<br/>
<br/>
think that was all for now.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
