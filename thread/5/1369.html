while cleaning out some drawers I found this 128mbit Nintendo flash cart (with 4kEEPROM). I had completely forgotten it was there! Glad it didnt end up in the bin :P errm anyways....I realized that others might be interested in it so I took some pictures and added it to the <a class="postlink" href="http://gbadev.org/hardware.php" target="_blank">hardware</a> section...
<br/>
<br/>
I also added the old reviews of the gba flash linker and the gba2tv thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I think Im gonna go and finish the rules for the development competition...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
