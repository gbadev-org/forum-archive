    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really enjoyed this game.  The production quality is right up there with some commercial carts, except perhaps the music... it wears thin quickly.  The power-ups and bonuses add a nice dimension to the solid tetris play.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Still a few odd bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
In one instance, where your supposed to keep the number of blocks less than a certain number,  it ended up being more, and the game failed to give me a game over.  Don't know exactly how to reproduce the bug, but it has happened a few times.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the game is excellent, addicting, and challenging.  some levels even seem like they are impossible, but you just have to know how to lay the given set of pieces.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I am the developper of Tris Fighter.
<br/>
Thank you to post a news about my game.
<br/>
<br/>
You can post here or send me a private message if you can reproduce some bugs, or if you have some ideas which could improve the game.
<br/>
I can also write better english text with your help ...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://trisover.free.fr" target="_blank">TrisOver</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I also enjoyed this game. The special "blocks" are pretty cool and add a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
One bug (at least I think its a bug) I noticed is the Score. When you use Up (or maybe Down) to put the block down faster, the score gets all high (like it's multiplied by a factor of 10) and then goes small again sometimes. I dunno, it's weird.
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that if you hit Pause, and then hit L, you can advance to the next level, but maybe that's there on purpose (I like to use it).
<br/>
<br/>
Overall pretty cool game though!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was toying around with Teleport, and found that there are spots that you are not able to teleport any pieces from 1 left of center to the very right hand side,  while all the magic weapons will teleport from 1 left of center to the right hand side no problem.   Also, there is no problem teleporting the pieces from the very right hand side to 1 left of center, but you are not able to teleport the piece back to the right hand side.  Is this a bug, or is this intentional?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Rather a Bug ...
<br/>
In fact, I never use teleport in "standard" stages.
<br/>
Teleport will be usefull in next Episode of Tris Fighter, with new stages having a central column, and work fine here.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://trisover.free.fr" target="_blank">TrisOver</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just finished ripping the music from your game, to the upcoming GSF format.  3 music tracks, right?
<br/>
<br/>
It took me a few hours to track down the music process function, and the music selection functions.  Then I added some code to cause the code handler to go into a dummy vblank routine, and make the music process code wait for a vblank interrupt with the swi interrupt, rather than by the if VCOUNT == 0 loop.  Doing it this way, saves battery power on real hardware, and real cpu cycles on an emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Fun, well done.
<br/>
Hate to be annoying here, but did you know that tetris is protected under copyright laws up to that you can't make a game based around blocks like tetris with the name 'tris' in its title. Ah well, who cares, well done!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
