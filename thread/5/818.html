Here is a demo by <span style="font-weight: bold">peebrain</span> that shows the effects of Color on the GBA:

<span style="font-style: italic">Whipped up this demo to look at the color capabilities of the GBA in
<br/>
a nice pseudo-GUI environment. It has three "sub"-demos. Use L and
<br/>
R to cycle through the demos. The source is included as well. I tend
<br/>
to write a lot of Qbasic code to do some tedious work, so I put those
<br/>
in there as well. Intended to be run on the hardware, not emu's
<br/>
(although it works fine in them).</span>
