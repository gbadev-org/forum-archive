<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I just coded a set of SWI libraries and figured I'd share them with the gbadev community.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Features</span>:
<br/>
- Interrupts 0-24 (see CowBite or GBATEK spec sheets for more SWI info)
<br/>
- Coded in assembly
<br/>
- Compiled in ARM mode (with -mthumb-interwork for compatibility with Thumb code)
<br/>
- Header file included, which externally defines?the library?functions
<br/>
- Each function compiled from an individual source code file, so library will only include functions you actually use.
<br/>
- Three libraries included:? swi(text).lib, swi(ewram).lib, swi(iwram).lib;? Each library will place the functions in the corresponding section of memory
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Instructions</span>:
<br/>
Include swi.h from your source code
<br/>
Link desired library when building rom</span>

Get the set of SWI libraries straight from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
