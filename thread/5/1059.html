<br/>
yes indeed! Were thinking deadline will be set around mid september
<br/>
but more on that later on. first of all we have to make some rules, and
<br/>
thats where we need your input. How do you want the compo to be
<br/>
divided? one game and one demo category? how about a misc category
<br/>
where you can submit other stuff aswell? if so, should this include tools
<br/>
to aid in gba development or just misc stuff ON the gba?
<br/>
<br/>
how should the winners be selected? by a few judges? by all participants?
<br/>
<br/>
etc etc! any comments will be taken into consideration. oh and remember,
<br/>
if you dont make any suggestions now, you will not be allowed to complain
<br/>
later on :P
<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to discuss this in this thread on the forum</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be cool to have the winners selected by participants, but I think selection by a few judges would be better.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there should be a speed-coding type of thing.  Release the subject in the chat (say like "Make a solitair game") and give everyone 48 hours or something.  I was somewhat pissed that Wonkie Guy won GBAX because that game's been in development for as long as I can remember!  I like the idea that everyone has the same amount of time to work on the project.  Not "oh, there's a compo?  ok, I'll just add a few URLs to an exisiting game I'm making and submit that then go on about my life...".  Not that Wonkie Guy didn't deserve to win, the game kicked ass, just that I was a little mad because I couldn't even compete with that :-P.

Anyways... those are my thoughts...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Few sudgestions. Some are probably no brainers.
<br/>
<br/>
1) One entry only  (so you can only do a tool, demo or game.)
<br/>
<br/>
2) Keep the three group idea (game, demo, tool)
<br/>
<br/>
3) Game &amp; Demo section should be given a theme. So say a theme is post apocolipse for games then any game entry would be based on this theme. Both should have entirly different themes. So the theme picked for games should be nothing like the theme picked for demos.
<br/>
<br/>
4) Voting should be 50/50. 50% of the final score is based on the judges desission. The other 50% is based on open polls. This way nobody can cheat and win by rigging polls &amp; also keeps people from complaining about what the judges gave them (see costis about this one).

<br/>
Agree.  A misc category is good.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think the 50/50 thing is a good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't like the idea of letting the "public" as it were, vote.  I think that a popularity contest poll for the public would be neat.  It would have to be carried out after the judges final their scores, but before those are released.  A prize for the highest non-judge based winner(s) of the popularity contest?
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Will it have to be completely new coding, or can I improve a really
<br/>
&gt; old game I had written a long time ago and polish it up?
<br/>
<br/>
I think that there should be a little weight (or a lot, depending) against previously released stuff, but nothing other than that to prevent it.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also, I hope there are some good prizes ; ).

<br/>
<br/>
A seperate tool category would also be neat for similar reasons.  It could yield some pretty neat tools that otherwise would not be made (at least not soon).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course we need game and demo categories.
<br/>
<br/>
I kind of like the themed game category idea, as opposed to having a general game category.  It limits people from using stuff they have already been working on for a year and also solves the 'What the heck to I make!?' problem. :&gt;<br/>_________________<br/>"Never, never suspect the dreams within the dreams of dreaming children."

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My suggestion for a original compo ^^:
<br/>
<br/>
Categorie:
<br/>
1) <span style="font-weight: bold">Thematic Game</span>: You must, create a game with a specific genre &amp; a specific character/mascotte (made by gbadev.org)
<br/>
( Exemple : Genre: Plate-forme games | Character/mascotte: A bleu cat )
<br/>
( with this, you can have a really good comparison of all the thematic Game Entry)
<br/>
2) <span style="font-weight: bold">Technical Demonstration </span>: Make the best gba demo
<br/>
3) <span style="font-weight: bold">A tools utility </span>: Make the best tools for the gba coders (compatible for windows 98/2000/ME/XP)
<br/>
(I don't like so much the idea of a Emulator on a compo, because is very difficult to make a good judgment )
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">For judge The Thematic Game:</span>
<br/>
-only judges can vote for all the entry. 
<br/>
-the score of the entry must be show to the public.
<br/>
-only make original stuff:
<br/>
 -Remake of a game (like the same presentation, the same gameplay, the same sound, ... ) or copied stuff will be discalified.
<br/>
-the notation of the game must :
<br/>
Presentation 20/20
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This category include the main menu, option, story</span>
<br/>
Graphics 20/20
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">The game looks, the animation quality, ...</span>
<br/>
Sound 20/20
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This category rates the quality of the sound effects and the music in the game</span>
<br/>
Gameplay 20/20
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This category rates how fun the game is to play.
<br/>
This category rates also the controls, design, and overall feel of the game.</span>
<br/>
Lasting Appeal 20/20
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This category rates the time you are likely to spend with the game before you get tired of it.
<br/>
The depth of the game and another stuff options</span>
<br/>
<br/>
-First 3 places win The Tematic Game 
<br/>
-A Consolation Prize for the game that have not a very good stuff ( like bad graphisme, no sound, a bad gameplay, etc... ) but sound good for all the judges.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Other:</span>
<br/>
a website of the compo (rules and result) sound good.
<br/>
<br/>
( the idea of 50% polls, is not correct because bad people who make a entry can vote 0/10 for a another,maybe good, game entry... you know...)

And yes, tools would be good for everyone. I don't know how you could judge a tool against a game or demo though, so it might be better to split the prizes up between the top 3 of each category.

An open theme compo seems a nice idea,

And for rating a game, use judjes and contestants, but contestants

shouldn't be able to vote for their own entry.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sometimes you need limits to be creative. with a specific theme you can generally count on a lot of variation...
<br/>
perhaps, a theme of "space" or a genre theme "rpg" (guess you might want quite a bit of time if thats a choice" or "platformer"
<br/>
Ive always thought themed contests come out quite well, but I guess its more personal preference
<br/>
<br/>
As for voting I'd say to keep it to the judges, but perhaps a single prize for the highest publicly voted game, always nice to get appreciation from the community. You could at least keep the entries anonymous until polls are in to keep it from being a popularity contest

Yea, I say open theme all the way. Actually I guess it doesn't matter to me if it's just like a 2 week thing or something, cause then I'd just do a demo anyway^^
<br/>
<br/>
But I think you should be able to enter in more than one category, so like you could make a toolkit to make your game with, and enter both. Just no more than one prize per person, so like if you win first place in 2 things, whichever was farther ahead of the second place guy gets first, and the other is technically disqualified in terms of prizes, but still say it ties with the next best for first, just so you still get some recognition.

I disagree, setting a theme could prevent some people from participated, or even worse, make some cast aside an idea they've had for awhile, and could probably make a better game with, for something they haven't put much thought into and don't know how to approach as well.
<br/>

Too many rules = slower (and sometimes crappier) production

Depending on what resources are available for prizes, perhaps the categories could each have two subcategories - work in progress, and never before released?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://lorrd.fearware.net" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzep3wth/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/lorrdbanner.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think we should have 4 categories.

<br/>
1) Games
<br/>
2) Demos
<br/>
3) Apps (any program that runs on the GBA, but isn't a game or a demo)
<br/>
4) Tools (Any software that assists in the development of GBA games/apps)
<br/>
<br/>
I also think there should be a rule that the program can't have been in development for a long time previous to the compo.
<br/>
<br/>
Contestants should be able to enter as many categories as many times as they want.
<br/>

I think to prevent things like wonky guy from winning (not going to argue whether that was fair or not), you might want to make up some specific, but abstract rules; things that the game should contain rather than specifying a specific genre. 
<br/>
<br/>
Example: All games should contain the planet Mars, have an A.I. player and a ufo. This does not limit you to a specific type of game; the judges should decide whether the game fits within these rules to prevent people doing the bare minimum like one picture at the start of the game only.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That sort of thing is still doable in a current project by changing a few graphics files - look at Dangerous XMas, that could have been a Dangerous Mars (or whatever).  I think a theme is unecessary - so what if someone has been working on a game for ages? As long as they haven't released a version already, I think it doesn't matter. If they have released an earlier version then I agree that they shouldn't be allowed to enter with that.
<br/>
<br/>
Wonky Guy was "new" for the competition, wasn't it? I mean, there wasn't an earlier version available. How do you know the author wasn't writing it specifically to win a compo and put in a lot of extra effort to finish it for the deadline?

<br/>
<br/>
My personal take on a future compo is thus:
<br/>
<br/>
Categories:
<br/>
  Games (any form of interactive software)
<br/>
  Demos (non-interactive)
<br/>
  Tools (both PC and GBA side, anything that will help make GBA games)
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this penalizes non-game software that is still interactive (say, a PDA thingy or something), but maybe they should have the option of entering in the Tools category.  The reason I didn't include a fourth one is because if there are going to be prizes, theres a finite limit on how we can divvy them up.
<br/>
<br/>
Emulators: 
<br/>
Emulators ON the GBA should be banned IMO, they're of no use without ROMs, and they've got no developmental value, they are solely for piracy.  Anyone who wants to argue with me on this one, feel free, but you'll not change my mind.
<br/>
<br/>
Open versus Closed:
<br/>
I would prefer an open compo, in both time and subject.  However, if people want to close it, then at worst, pick a theme and let people design any game or demo that fits within the theme (the mars example is a good one).  Time limit compos are great too, and this summer I'd certainly be interested in competing in one, but for a large compo from gbadev.org, it limits the number of people who can enter.  Shen is currently hosting one, and I'm sure other people would be glad to as well (prizes aren't quite as important for a time limited compo, since people enter for the challenge and recognition).
<br/>
<br/>
Judging:
<br/>
A panel of judges prevents it from becomming a popularity contest, and maybe some special mention awards: a peoples choice, best technical feat, and best musical feat maybe.  We could have more hon. mentions if we have lesser prizes for them, or maybe just prestiege awards.  I agree with the comments that the gbadev.org open compo was very difficult to judge (hell, I was a judge), because of the inclusion of games and demos into one catch-all category.
<br/>
<br/>

Doesn't sound like you care to much for applications.  I do, but I like to be fair, so I'll suggest having three categories: Games, Demos, and Other.
<br/>
<br/>
The other category can include both tools and apps, I don't think the two would be as hard to compare as games and demos.
<br/>
In addition, this will balance the number of entries in each category, as games and demos seem to individually outnumber apps and tools combined.

Yea it'd be cool to have a hardware competition.  A lot of nifty, helpful, devices could come out of it.

I guess the number of categories the compo can have is related to the amount of prizes available.  If we have a ton of good prizes, we could surely have several categories.

I think that this is a key point for any compo-  What are we holding this compo for?  For a hardware compo, it looks like the goal would be to produce "a lot of nifty, helpful, devices".
<br/>
<br/>
I think the the purpose of the software compo should be to produce "a lot of nifty" demos, "a lot of nifty" games, and "a lot of nifty, helpful" tools and applications.  Everything should be done to facilitate this, and nothing to hinder it.
<br/>
<br/>
People should participate for that end and not worry about winning or being able to win.  Having fun doing it ought to be a by-product of the event.

First:

Simply because it's very fun to start to coding/drawing a compo game with preset ideas.

It a motivation and especially, at the end of the contest, to compare the style used with others entry.

You can make a different game if the genre is a plate-forme game, or a pinball game( why not ;-) )
<br/>
<br/>
and I don't think that 20 others peoples make the same game, you know, It's possible to make a different game, if you have a lot of imagination. The different is only about the skill of the coder/graphics guy (Yes, it's a coding competition)

That sounds like a good goal for the compo.  Are there any others?  I'm not convinced that a themed game requirement is enough to prevent people from creating a game and showing off a game at the compo, as opposed to creating it for the compo.  I think a more specific requirement is needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, is the goal just to make an original game for the compo?  If so, then who is to say that a game somebody started in 2001 (or so) wasn't being created for this compo?  I must admit that I would find that hard to believe.

Assuming that the goal is to get people to make a new project for the compo, I'm just do not think that a themed game requirement is the sound strategy to achieve this goal.  I'm not convinced that this is an enforceable goal.
<br/>
<br/>
A rule could specifically state that the project must have been started for the compo.  'Been started for the compo' would need a proper definition, and then it would (supposedly) work on the honour system.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that the best way to go about forcing a person to create a new entry (as opposed to the honour system), would be to create some really bizarre requirements, such as:  must be open source, must use no global variables, must be able to be compiled with any of the other entries, and must be able to start any other entries.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If there are going to be a lot of GBA side application entries, then yeah, it'd make sense to have a category for them, but they've not made a big inroads as far as I know.  Text readers, slideshows, and pogoshell are all I can think of off the top of my head.
<br/>
<br/>
J-Rod, doh, omitting an Art hon. mention was an oversight on my behalf.
<br/>
<br/>
I still don't think theres any reason to require people to make entries just for the compo.  Its overly restrictive, and it cuts out people who have something neat they've been working on, and aren't willing to start from scratch for a compo, thus, fewer overall entries, and quite possibly, of lesser quality.  A timed compo is one thing, its designed to test your skills in a limited period, but I don't think thats what we are trying to design here.
<br/>
<br/>
Brendan, WTF?
<br/>
I don't even understand half of your 'bizzare requirements' like "must be able to start any other entries", and a requirement to use no global variables is well, plain stupid.  I won't comment on a requriement that entries should be open source, but I'd say its quite likely to discourage some people that might have entered otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
The vibe that global variables are bad comes from multi-threading and namespace pollution.  Use the tool that best fits the job, GBA games aren't multithreaded (well, not without writing your own thread library, and even then, why?), and as long as you don't expose your variables to modules that shouldn't see them, they are often the best fit for a number of things, as well as more efficient than passing a ton of state parameters to a dozen different functions.  If you write OO code, you will often encapsulate the same information that would be in a global variable into objects, but some things still make plenty of sense as globals, like a handle to the active framebuffer, or the top level node of your physics model, the active level, etc...<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

Bizzare requirements could be anything.  I'll repeat I think that the best way to go about <span style="font-weight: bold">forcing a person to create a new entry</span> is with mandatory bizzare requirements.  Some requirements would work better than others.  The specific example I gave is unimportant.

<br/>
What I really want to know it: <span style="font-weight: bold">What is the goal of this compo?</span>
<br/>
Clearly the bizzare requirements I stated would discourage some people.  Other requirements (themed compo) would discourage more or less people from entering, depending on what they are.  What is the <span style="font-weight: bold">goal</span>?
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think that the goal should be to have neat stuff get made.

<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a themed compo isn't the better solution. One drawback about a "non-themed" compo  is that people that have been working  for a long time on their project will be able to bring better entries than people that would start to code as soon as compo will officialy started.
<br/>
One advantage of this, is that entries may be "better", as they may result of a long time work. And I think that very good entries may show that our "amateur" community (for the most of us) is very capable.
<br/>
<br/>
But I think that if we want to promote that "amateur" / homebrew development, then we should promote all that stuff that made this community active. Most tools are either GNU tools, and most docs are homebrew docs. So I think that entries of this compo should be open-source. Open-source doesn't necessary mean open-source in a GNU way. There are plenty of licences : GPL says roughly that if you make a derivative work of the provided source, you have to licence it with GPL. BSD allow you to do (roughly) whatever you want with the source. But there's also licenses that allow you to have a look at the code, but don't allow you to use/distribute it.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's only my point of view :) But I'm an amateur GBA developer, and I think that most of people here are also amateur developers. And I think that such a compo shoud revendicate that amateur status :)<br/>_________________<br/>GBA,GC,NGPC,GP32,FPGA,DS stuff at <a class="postlink" href="http://torlus.com/" target="_blank">http://torlus.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here are my thoughts on what the compo should be:
<br/>
-There should be a seperate catagory for games themselves and shouldn't have a single catagory for everything
<br/>
-No emulators, or at least not with the games catagory
<br/>
-Any programs that have previously been released publicly can not be entered, even if updated by adding new assets
<br/>
-Each judge will be required to give their reasoning why an entry scored the way it did if the author(s) want to find out why their program ranked in such a way. If a judge can not tell why they gave a program a certain ranking, are they really fit to judge?
<br/>
-Release all entries almost imediately, and then release the results when the judges are finished. That way everyone can see all the entries ASAP, illegal entries can be disqualified easier because more eyes can see them, and it takes some pressure off the judges because people will be occupied while they are making their decisions
<br/>
-I don't feel there should be a set theme. I do believe there are positives to having a set theme, but looking at the last compo I think just an "anything goes" approach is still best. 
<br/>
-One entry per person
<br/>
-Open source not required

why place restrictions on the types of games that can be submitted? it seems to me that this would just limit creativity and innovations in games. and, ultimately, isn't that the whole point of development contests? isn't a lot of the interests in these contests to see what everyone comes up with?

a lot of the arguments seem to be that the winning games are "too good", but how can that be a bad thing? shouldn't that just motivate others to work that much harder? is winning in such a competition really winning when the vision of games the creators want to create have to be crippled? plus, knowing the proposed deadline is september, doesn't that give everyone all summer to work on a project? and how can you draw the line at development time making the game unfair? some people, despite effort, cannot draw as well as others, so should we remove graphics as well? some cannot program as well as others, either, but if you keep adding handicaps it's really no longer a contest...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree that it is too concerned about prices and rules etc. (for my taste at least), and since there is a lot of heteorogenety in the participants programming skills and the effort/time spent in the projects, I would very much like to see some small competitions along with this one; that is, a competition with very few rules and no (yes, no!) prices involved so that beginners also may join; in fact, a small beginners competition sounds great!
<br/>
<br/>
In other words(!), I think that it might get too big and professional for the most people to join, so - along with this competition - I would like to see some smaller ones with no prices but the honour of winning itself and the fun of game making on the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that the projects should be new code, and each participant should submit their project idea to the judges BEFORE they begin their projects. Part of the scoring could be based on how closely the end result matches the intended goal. Each project should be able to show some development history at the end of the project (thus showing it is a new code or idea). 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the project should be able to run on a real Gameboy Advance.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, it should just be fun! Competing to win the Gameboy Coding Challenge!
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to competing. I hope you all like my ideas! Thanks,

<br/>
anyone can make a professional-quality game if they put some time and effort into it. banning or coming up with silly rules that penalize those who are willing to put this time and effort into a project is counterproductive. fierce competition is great; it means better games for everyone to play! if your game isn't at the same level as some of the others, keep working on it until it is. how is it a contest if rules are set up to favor one group over another?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I can clarify. Game design is an art form. It is difficult to judge an art form based soley on the fact that everyone has a different opinion about what art is. However, if you know what the individual was trying to do, and you can see how closely they got there, it might create some additional points of reference for the purpose of judging. 
<br/>
<br/>
I already have a very good idea of what I want to write. How closely I am able to hit that could be an additional part of the competition. 
<br/>
<br/>
In skating competitions, as well as gymnastics competitions, they have programs that they set up with the judges. They try to get as close to their program as possible to score the highest points. 
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, it is just my two cents... you can take them or leave them. I did not mean to make you upset :)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, can we enter multiple entries? Will there be a cost to enter a project? (I hope someone has not already answered this question)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I'll take your two cents... That'll be the first 2 cents of my million then!;-)
<br/>
<br/>
I like your point of view! However, I would be surprised if it would actually work (Submitting the idea, and then make entry). I think a compo is for some, quite a chaotic experience. I can imagine people will want to change their idea into something else after the "idea submitting deadline". Telling them they can't will disappoint many, and if they can, the concept doesn't work anymore imho.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what if someone says he is going to make a tetris clone and makes a really perfect one. And another will try some realtime physics engine en will get only halfway. Who gets the most points then? I mean, it would be quite hard to judge.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this idea would work for (far) more experienced coders, and not really for newbies. No offense to them (we've all been one!), but I think they lack a a certain bit of focus.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I believe it is only one entry/person (you gotta have TONS of time to do more than one anyway), and it'll be free to enter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, would judges be allowed to give extra points for general cool stuff, like fitting it into 256K for multiboot? It would be cool to use tricks like using VRAM for temporary stuff, and overwriting the already played data that won't be used again in a demo, but it would take some extra work, and wouldn't actually make it look any better while running, so I'm not sure if I should bother doing it or not.
<br/>
<br/>
But overall, it sounds like the rules couldn't get much better. My main entry will be a demo, but I might as well enter my RPG in the game section too^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, this whole thread seems to be going around in circles a little bit, but good work guys, you are still coming to more sensible conclusions than the Australian government has in it's whole history :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless: how about we have at least one judge that reads the code and scores on that, because I have seen games that people have released where 90% of the code is identical (including comments) to a tutorial I have read. Basically, a person gets a slight advantage if they REALLY know how to code, instead of copying and pasting. The person to judge this would have to be pretty good at C, C++ (OOP) and ASM of course.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have been writing an OOP engine and adding to it when I write a new game with a new feature, and it's almost at the stage where all I need to do to create a new game is make the artwork and define one or two classes, so feel free to set a topic fr the game, wont slow me down :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Also - an idea. People want a section for non-game programs on the GBA, how about making this part an optimisation catagorie, something like calculate all prime numbers under 2 million, and see who can make the best algorithm and coding choices. Of course I wouldnt enter such a catagorie because I dont know ASM for the GBA and someone who did would undoubtably win.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just throwing some ideas into the pot. But remember - you can spend alot of time saying what you can do when it would be easier to say what you cant...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
