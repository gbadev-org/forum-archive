Here is a GBA tonal guitar tuner sent in by <span style="font-weight: bold">MadBob</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I have written my first GBA program and it is Tonal Guitar Tuner,
<br/>
you play the note and tune your string along with the tone,
<br/>
<br/>
You do have to have a fairly good ear to tune along to a tone
<br/>
but even if you haven't yet developed a 'good ear' it will still
<br/>
help you get the strings very close, then you can tune across
<br/>
the strings as you would normally do.
<br/>
Thanks to OrR for his GBAkkord which inspired me to write FreeTune Adv.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">It covers:</span>
<br/>
Standard, Standard b(flat), Standard bb(double flat)
<br/>
and Dropped D Tunings.
<br/>
<br/>
Two versions are included in this archive:
<br/>
FreeTuneAdv.gba for VBA or Flash Cart.
<br/>
FreeTuneAdv.mb for Multiboot Cables.</span>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is absolutely hilarious. What an awesome use for a GBA! I never would've thought of that. But then I can't play guitar.
<br/>
<br/>
Good job.
