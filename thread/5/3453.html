    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">TECHNICAL:
<br/>
The whole game seems to run at less than full speed. It seems you're waiting for vsync instead.
<br/>
<br/>
You've put code in .h files. Bad bad bad.
<br/>
<br/>
GAMEPLAY:
<br/>
The menus are way too slow.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't really seem to get the hang of it. I keep getting "Your matter dispersed". Perhaps you could show the other map layer in the background using a darkened palette. Even if not, I remember that Zelda 3 didn't send you back to start if you switched Light World/Dark World on top of an obstacle; it just sent you back to where you switched.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
