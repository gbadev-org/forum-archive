<span style="font-weight: bold">Brooksilver</span> has informed us of an interesting project in the works:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">In August 2001, two Syracuse University alumni began work on an independent game project. In 2002, Lightspire Studios, Inc. was created to push the limits of interactive storytelling within the game industry. By March 2003, the obvious platform for this project was the Gameboy Advance System offering small developers a realistic opportunity to compete on a commercial level. Many volunteers from the art, music, and GBA development community have graciously contributed since that time. Thus, "Chronicles of Eden, Vol. I: Vangarde's Tale" was born out of thousands of hours of work dedicated to a single vision: create a truly epic and original title with rich story and character development that will last the tests of time (are these kinds of games sadly missing or what?). The next step is to secure a publisher to complete its development. 
<br/>
<br/>
Check out a preview of the game at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lightspirestudios.com" target="_blank">http://www.lightspirestudios.com</a>. Over the coming weeks and months we'll provide updates as development progresses.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The lightspire website was updated last week to provide more details on the characters and features for the game. A screenshot of the skills customization screen was added as well. An official press release was issued on Sept. 3rd.
<br/>
<br/>
So far we have had a positive response to our project from gamers, media, and publishers. Many gaming sites have picked up our news such as gamespot, n-philes, warcry, and others. We should have an interview with a German gameboy advance website very soon (and translated into English!).
<br/>
<br/>
Although we've invested several thousand hours into the project and completed many tilesets, sprites, animations, and prototype engine, we're hoping to have the opportunity to re-evaluate our current direction to really make this game competitive. As a team, we've just barely tapped into our potential having worked largely part-time and independently across the internet. As many of you know, this can work somewhat but it is not ideal. So I want to bring "in-house" at least 80-90% of our team to create the synergy needed to finish this ambitious game. That requires funding which is not easy to come by :).
<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate any feedback on the project, so feel free to lend me your thoughts, constructive criticism, suggestions, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The graphic looks brilliant, hard to tell about the other things without actually playing it ;)
<br/>
I hope you get some funding for it, looking forward to play it.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
