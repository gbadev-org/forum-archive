<span style="font-weight: bold">Mike Hawkins</span> has released a game called <span style="font-weight: bold">Android 2 Advance</span> which is a remake of 
<br/>
a classic <span style="font-weight: bold">spectrum</span> game:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This is the 1st and final release of A2A. The game IS COMPLETE with FULL SFX
<br/>
which I took time to get as accurate as possible to the origonal spectrum game.
<br/>
Written in 100% ARM assembler, the game also features an options screen where you
<br/>
can change the background graphics if using 8x8 pixel block mode or change to 6x6
<br/>
pixel block mode and have a 24x24 maze window.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The game is very playable, and features good sound effects.
<br/>
<br/>
You can get the full game from the main website!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
