A great version of <span style="font-weight: bold">MineSweeper</span> has just been sent in by <span style="font-weight: bold">tony cai</span> from China.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">The demo features wonderful graphics, sound and music effects, with polished
<br/>
screen transitions, and a great visual layout. Also the games options even though
<br/>
they are in Chinese are easy to figure out and should not be a problem for english
<br/>
speakers, who are familiar with the classic MineSweeper gameplay.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
You can grab the game straight from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
