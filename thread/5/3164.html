<span style="font-weight: bold">David Sharp</span> has released a great remake of an old <span style="font-weight: bold">Acorn RISC OS</span> game:	
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Following a devastating moonquake, you have been called in on a well
<br/>
paid contract to clear the 10 levels of the lunarbase of rubble using
<br/>
your explosives. Your task is made more complicated by the malfunctioning
<br/>
security robots that are roaming the base and the delicate nuclear
<br/>
reactors that are keeping them running.
<br/>
<br/>
A bomberman-like game with a difference that has been converted from 
<br/>
an old Acorn RISC OS game with the permission of the original author.
