    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Jeff</span> has just sent in a few big news items related to <span style="font-weight: bold">Dragon BASIC</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">The SimForth site is gone, and Dragon BASIC has switched hosting
<br/>
services. The new website is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.jm-basic.com/" target="_blank">http://www.jm-basic.com/</a> I encourage
<br/>
everyone to update their links and stop by the new site and let me
<br/>
know what they think.
<br/>
<br/>
Next, Dragon BASIC 1.4 is about to be released in the next few weeks.
<br/>
It is a major leap forward not only for itself, but compiler design in
<br/>
general. It gives access to the underlying language: TIN and the
<br/>
entire Dragon BASIC API is open. You can create your own API functions
<br/>
in TIN or ARM assembly and PROTOTYPE them for use in Dragon BASIC
<br/>
code. Dragon BASIC is now strong-typed and can handle multi dimensional
<br/>
arrays and much more...
<br/>
<br/>
While working on the new site, the download and registrations will be
<br/>
inactive until 1.4 is released. For those interested, after 1.4 is
<br/>
released, I'm going to be working on an e-book for programming the GBA
<br/>
using Dragon BASIC.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
