A great demo including sourcecode has been released by <span style="font-weight: bold">Pete Gunter</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I wanted to submit the following demo which I completed as my final year 
<br/>
project at university. I've included the full source 
<br/>
code and graphics within the zip file.
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to say a big thanks to everyone at gbadev.org, as there 
<br/>
would be no way I could have completed the project 
<br/>
without the help of everyone on the forums.
<br/>
<br/>
A summary of some of my research and a few little sample demos can be 
<br/>
found on my wesite at :
