    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Torlus</span> has released his 3d engine source code &amp; website:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I submitted a demo some days ago, called "3D walking demo" that you put on your site.
<br/>
I finally packaged it, with source code, documentation, and tools (as behind the demo
<br/>
there are tools for windows and linux that allow to import 3D models into the engine).
<br/>
I set up a webhost about it (and other stuff)</span>: <a class="postlink" href="http://heliscar.com/greg/" target="_blank">http://heliscar.com/greg/</a>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">On this site, but not related to gba, there's also a windows build of a gcc cross-compiler that
<br/>
may be suitable for gamecube development... when some tricks to run things on hardware will be found.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Check out the new 3d engine and website from the link above.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
