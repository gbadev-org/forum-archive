<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I want to let everyone know that Alarm is now available to be licensed for GBA development! Just to remind you that Alarm is the game engine used in Wonkie Guy, the game that won first prize in the GBAX 2003 Coding Competition. Now, it is available to everyone to create games of their own. The Alarm website is now online at <a class="postlink" href="http://seanreid.ca/alarm" target="_blank">http://seanreid.ca/alarm</a>. This is great news to all who want to enter the upcoming gbadev.org coding competition. For less that $20 US, anyone can have access to the Alarm SDK and projects including WorldDemo, CompressedDemo, LevelDemo, and the full source of WonkieGuy! And it doesn't end there... the Alarm website contains complete documentation, news, HOWTOs, and forums for anyone who needs help.</span>
