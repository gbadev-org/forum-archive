<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I made this utility here to fix some problems with inegrating the ARM ADS (the ARM development system) with Microsoft Developer Studio. You've seen similar things for GCC. It brings back the double click on error/warning lines. Plus I added a filter to filter out some warning messages that you can't control with the tools them selves.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
some more info from the readme:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">This program is a small utility to fix some of the problems integrating the
<br/>
"ARM(R) ADS v1.2" (ARM Developer Suite), with "Microsoft Visual Studio v6".
<br/>
<br/>
What it does:
<br/>
1. Restores line number info in the proper syntax so you can double click
<br/>
on the warning or error in the output window and it will jump you to
<br/>
the offending file (just like you can when you are working with Windows
<br/>
executables). 
<br/>
<br/>
2. Filters out unwanted compiler, assembler, and linker warning messages.
<br/>
This is necessary because the ADS doesn't have the proper support to filter
<br/>
out individual messages that it spews out so profusely.
<br/>
The filters are hardcoded into the exectuable (ADSMSGFIX.EXE), you'll have to
<br/>
recompile the source to make changes.
<br/>
Also refer to the ADS documentation as there is some control over messages
<br/>
that one might be able to do from the command line before adding them to the
<br/>
filter lists.</span>
