    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Much awesomeness, very faithful to the original. One of my all time favorite games too. Any plans to do the battle system? That would be the coolest.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Just went and checked the other thread on this and saw the full plan. It would be nice if you could find a way to rip maps from the game though, and just drop the whole thing in. Redrawing every map by hand would probably take many times longer than coding the whole game.
<br/>
Good luck though, looking great so far.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very very cool! Impressive work Ethos. :)
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, is it unusual for it to take upto 2 weeks after demos are sent for them to appear on the front page? I know Ethos sent this particular version of his demo around the 24th of August, and I sent my demo about a day later.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

[krom] has got a new job in the game industry and whenever I have any time over I try to work on the news submission system so everyone will be able to post news, demos, tools etc.

<br/>
I hope everything will be running smoothly soon

Oh, good. I thought krom was in some accident that preventing him from using a computer, the ultimate punishment for a programmer! :)
