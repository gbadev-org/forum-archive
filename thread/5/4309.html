<br/>
A good 3d engine has been released by <span style="font-weight: bold">Tomer Shalev</span> here is an excerpt from the readme.txt:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Well, I decided to contribute a litle to the community and release this 3D demo.
<br/>
This demo was done as part of my 3D programming learning for the past 
<br/>
year, and for some reason I fell in love with GBA development, so I 
<br/>
decided to do it as GBA project. This engine will be called : The Quake 
<br/>
GBA homage, as it was based upon other people knowledge, so this is my 
<br/>
contribution.
<br/>
The level featuring in the demo was made using a Quake editor. This 
<br/>
engine can run all Quake 1 levels I'll probabely release it open-source, but that depends on demand.
<br/>
Would like to thank you all for knowledge pouring in the forums, and to 
<br/>
Yeti3D, which was a real motivation for me to code 3D software.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Find out more about the features of the 3D engine from the <span style="font-weight: bold">readme.txt</span> file.
<br/>
<br/>
Grab the 3D engine demo straight from the main web Site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
