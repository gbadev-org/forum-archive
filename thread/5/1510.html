    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bmts.com/~gdonald" target="_blank">Josh G</a> has released a new (Windows) Map Editor.
<br/>
<br/>
Release notes:
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">The program is a map editor with many options including tile flipping tiles, colour palette editing, 4-bit palette selection for each tile, editing several layers and displaying them in a way that emulates the GBA. It also contains a Tile Editor for editing tile libraries. The maps can be directly outputted to a GBA rom file and opened in an emulator so you can quickly try out your maps and tile graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
The map editor supports a couple formats used by simpler map editors and I've made some new formats to help anyone making map editing tools of their own and that want their files to be compatible with my editor. The formats are all explained in html documents.
<br/>
The help is quite thorough.</span>
