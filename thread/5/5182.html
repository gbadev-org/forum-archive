A <span style="font-weight: bold">Forth</span> implementation has been released for the GBA by <span style="font-weight: bold">Torlus</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">PandaForth is a Forth implementation for GBA based on Bradford J. Rodriguez's CamelForth for the Z80.
<br/>
<br/>
If don't know Forth, basically, it is a stack-based language using "reverse polish" notation.
<br/>
It provides an interpreter which is able to compile new definitions.
<br/>
You can test the language features with the help of a Java applet on my site <a class="postlink" href="http://torlus.com/" target="_blank">http://torlus.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the original features of PandaForth is that you can use the interpreter directly from
<br/>
your computer if you have a MBV2 cable, by using the "console mode" of the tool bundled with it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have such a cable, you can still test the interpreter features on
<br/>
hardware or in an emulator, as PandaForth is able to "embed" source with the
<br/>
help of Damian Yerrick's GBFS library for GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
It is bundled with full source code, a small demo written in Forth, and all 
<br/>
the scripts to build your own programs.</span>
