A <span style="font-weight: bold">Snow Bros</span> demo has been sent in by <span style="font-weight: bold">fjsantos</span> &amp; <span style="font-weight: bold">Sergio</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">We've been creating games for nearly two years, sometimes just for
<br/>
fun, sometimes with a little economical motivation...
<br/>
<br/>
We are specially proud with the project we want to show you. It
<br/>
consists in a playable demo of the first stage of the recreative Snow Bros.
<br/>
A perfect pixel conversion that works on real HW (tested on Flash Linker Pro 128 And Ez Flash Card 128).
<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, it's far from beeing completed, but we think it's a good start
<br/>
and it's worthy to try it and take a look. We hope to find a bit of time
<br/>
in the nearly future to continue with it. Until then, hope you enjoy it,
<br/>
and feel free to let us know anything you got to say.</span>

You can get the <span style="font-weight: bold">Snow Bros</span> demo straight from the main site!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
