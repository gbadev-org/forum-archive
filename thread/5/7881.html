<span style="font-weight: bold">Nrx</span> has released a great remake of the classic game <span style="font-weight: bold">Bomb Jack</span>:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">I've done an adaptation of the Amstrad CPC version of Bomb Jack for the GBA. (For
<br/>
those who don't know what the Amstrad CPC is, it was a 8 bit computer quite
<br/>
famous in Europe in the 80s - don't expect graphics to be amazing ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to keep the ROM small, and think I succeeded: it is less than 47 KB. So it
<br/>
should just fit in any flash cart, even though you've already put plenty of big games.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I release "Music Jack", which is a Windows executable (well, a "DOS
<br/>
executable") that makes it possible to easily add music to the game. Simply drag &amp;
<br/>
drop a wave file onto the program to generate the ROM. Note that the wave's
<br/>
sample rate must be lower or equal to 22050 Hz.</span>
