I think they main reason that GB/GBC flash kits are not available new is because the GBA was released over 3 years ago. The Bung people are still around but working on GBA instead.

Theres even more competition in the gba flash market so theres more companies and factories for NOA to shut down.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">According to what Nintendo is saying, the Nintendo DS is like a third pillar to the GCN and GBA. Obviously flash carts have become more and more popular for pirating games. Even though some people use it for development I'm sure the majority pirate games. Having only a few companies with not so great carts wasn't a big enough threat for Nintendo. Now there are more and more flash carts released including ones with internal clocks and 1G memory. I'm supprised how many more have came out since I bought mine about a year ago. 
<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if there was a solution besides sending a C&amp;D. If possible it would be great if a small website selling carts could sell it to starting up business or people proving that they want to program the GBA. I'm sure some would still pirate games however Nintendo might over look it. There's got to be a solution for homebrew developers.
<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would be very happy if NOA could put an end to the 'less than honest' use of 3rd party gba flash cartridges but since its the "only" way for many amateurs and startups to test their stuff I dont want production to stop entirely.
<br/>
<br/>
I just happend to post something yesterday about selling flash carts to amatuer developers from gbadev.org for a low price. If Nintendo would do this themselves for a reseonable price,there would be no 'real' reason for 3rd party flash carts to excist and sites like ours would never want to be affiliated with companies making or distributing these products.
<br/>

Maybe the community should come together and put some pressure on NOA...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SimonB:
<br/>
Why would Nintendo want to waste time, resources and money to set up a small cart shop for homebrew developers. I agree with your point that there would be no 'real' reason for 3rd party flash carts to exist then. However Nintendo will definitly not care about homebrew developers. I'm not sure how many there are but I'm guessing less than 10,000 or so. I'm sure at least 5 times that number flash carts have been sold. Nintendo looks at the problem they are facing, not the problem we are facing.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be a good idea to put presure on NOA but I doubt Nintendo will even look into the issue. Who knows, it's worth a shot. I'm just starting in GBA dev so I don't think I'd be the best one to start this sort of thing. 
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend that we stress the fact we don't care about 3rd party carts as long as we can get carts to develop our own games using devkit advance.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe making some sort of boot loader for a cart, and that cart would contain some sort of encryption key which can be used in a program on the computer to confirm the rom is not licensed by Nintendo. Obviously this isn't a fool proof solution but Nintendo may possibly agree to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I hope we can organize ourselves to approch Nintendo so that they will actually listen to us. It could be hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an idea: How about making carts with 128 KB of mask or OTP ROM mapped into cart space and a heck of a lot of flash memory mapped into the savegame space? Then multiboot programs could be stored in several banks of flash, and the ROM could hold (among other things) a DOS to read and write programs and data in a filesystem in savegame space. A multiboot-only cart could probably seamlessly run standalone multiboot programs and programs designed to work with the DOS, but it wouldn't run your typical proprietary GBA game.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like a good idea. I don't have the knowledge that you have with GBA development but wouldn't your idea mean we would be restricting ourselves to only small multiboot games? 
<br/>
<br/>
I want to create a big game and possibly talk to a developer when I'm done. I'm putting a lot of effort into it at the moment. Eventually my game will become more than the Multiboot size limit, so wouldn't that cart limit the size of my game? I believe Final Fantasy Tactics has a 128M cart, I've got the same size cart so I could potentially make a game that big and get it published by developers using that cart size. I know not everyone is planning to create big games.
<br/>
<br/>
I do think it's a good idea for the small games some of us make. It would work actually, but then again who would make it for &lt; 10,000 people?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One reason why I think it's too late for Nintendo to do something about it is because the system doesn't have enough copyright protection to do something like this.

I know several Hong Kong based internet sites were hit

your American site was overlooked. Also it seems you
<br/>
only have the "EZ-Flash Advance 256Mb

<br/>
coming in and is that one still available? Also any

plans in the near future to have the 512 version?

Heck no. Functions in the DOS (which would kinda-sorta operate like GBA BIOS) would allow one multiboot program to load another multiboot program and pass arguments to it. The menus and the game engine could be in separate programs. In addition, each multiboot program could load assets from the "disk." They could even load common libraries compiled with -fPIC into EWRAM or IWRAM.

That sounds interesting.  As a potential alternative, why not offer 4 Mb, 8 Mb and 16 Mb carts.  I think that that is actually enough for most home brew developers, and those carts are way too small to play commercial games.  (Were there any first gen GBA games that can fit in 16 Mb?)
<br/>
<br/>
As another alternative, why not carts with x 8 Mb banks and dip switches?  (Maybe I'm just sick, but I think that a "Please manually switch to bank 3 and press A" prompt would be really funny if somebody wanted to make a larger game. =P)
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the homebrew crew can figure something out with eReader cards?

Wether you run from ROM or multiboot EWRAM you still have to move the graphics somehow to the VRAM, if you decompress it on the way will only imply a (small?) cpu hit, I don't see why you have to decompress it every frame just because you run from EWRAM?<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
