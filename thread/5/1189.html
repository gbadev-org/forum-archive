<span style="font-style: italic">DevKit Advance R5 Beta 3 is available for download.
<br/>
<br/>
It contains many new features, and many other improvements. It is mainly
<br/>
lacking documentation. I really want to talk about those features, but
<br/>
without documentation I would feel guilty for it ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
For beta 4, I am going to try and get the documentation caught up with the
<br/>
implementation.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: The interrupt service routine provided in the file isr.S is just a
<br/>
rough draft and has never been tested. I probably should have added a
<br/>
#error directive to the source before releasing it to warn people.</span>
