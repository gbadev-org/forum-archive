    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
Ive started to code the ultimate map solution for the Game Boy Advance!
<br/>
(in Windows using OpenGL)
<br/>
Well, Maybe not the ultimate but I think it will be nice.
<br/>
Anyway its called GBA Map Kit
<br/>
<br/>
It has three components (apps):
<br/>
GBAMK Property Editor
<br/>
GBAMK Tileset Editor
<br/>
GBAMK Map Editor
<br/>
<br/>
I posted here because I need help to do things that Iam to lazy for.
<br/>
1.
<br/>
The Property Editor
<br/>
It will be a quite easy win app, If you know how to program win progs and are interested to help, I'll tell you more about the file format and how everything is connected.
<br/>
<br/>
2.
<br/>
Compression, A Ulimate solution needs compression in the program itself, dont u think so?
<br/>
I want to support, RLE, Huffman and LZ77
<br/>
I also need functions to find out how big a compressed would be.
<br/>
Cause I want to support BEST as a choice for compression.
<br/>
So I need compression functions, like this for LZ77:
<br/>
<br/>
int GetLZ77CompSize(BYTE *byData, int nLength);
<br/>
int WriteLZ77CompFile(char *szFileName, BYTE *byData, int nLength);
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested to help, contact me at <a href="mailto:aron_aggrieve@hotmail.com">aron_aggrieve@hotmail.com</a>
<br/>
And plz also repost here cause I dont check my mail that often.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you understood everything!
<br/>
And want to help me!
<br/>
<br/>
I also want to say:
<br/>
That this will be freeware, so dont think you will earn some money:p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I may be in.  Have you already started the project, or are you in the planning stage?  I've experience with compression and file formats (and file I/O), so I might be able to help in those areas.  And as a matter-of-fact, I'm reading a tutorial on the Windows API :-)
<br/>
<br/>
No pay?  Do we at least get our big-fat name in the "about" box?
<br/>
And why OpenGL?????
<br/>
<br/>
[edit]Also, RLE may not be the best choise; I may implament my own mixed-compression method, which works great with tile maps, etc.[/edit]
<br/>
<br/>
Si.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, Nice that you are interested.
<br/>
OpenGL will only be used for the Tileset and Map Editor
<br/>
Not the Property Editor.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is finished, But Maybe it is things that I'vent thinked about.
<br/>
So its perfect to have a partner that can came with new ideas.
<br/>
Ive started with the Tileset Editor and it is about 35% finished.
<br/>
Maybe we can work with the map editor together!
<br/>
<br/>
Of course your name will be in the About Box=)
<br/>
E-Mail me and I will send you all the info, and the Tileset Editor (what it looks like, right now).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
