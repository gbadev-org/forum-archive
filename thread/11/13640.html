<br/>
<br/>
I'm lookinf for programers. I'm not a programer, but i want to coopertate in this homebrew....
<br/>
<br/>
A DDR is a dance machine... so I'm thinking in a homebrew that people must push the correct botons...
<br/>
<br/>
If there are interested people to know more about that...
<br/>
<br/>
mail me to <a href="mailto:e3skudo@gmail.com">e3skudo@gmail.com</a>

EDIT: I guess there are some really bad patents out there, and the applications that haven't yet been granted or denied are even worse. I've found a <a class="postlink" href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=5&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s2=dice&amp;OS=dice&amp;RS=dice" target="_blank">recently published patent application</a> where the inventor claims to have invented games that choose a set of events based on the song selected by the player. Trouble is that every music game back to Beatmania is prior art.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, as with most other "ideas" from non-programmers (like myself), they will never be born, as this isn't a new idea.  Unless you can start the project, get it off the ground, get people to like it, it's hard to get a programmer to drop what they are doing to make a game for you.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, talking about a direct DDR clone, the first issue that comes to mind is pressing multiple directions at a time (if using the touch screen) or it would have to be ABXY only, as you can't press left and right dpad at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, prior attempts seem to have failed with timing as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you could hook up an external dance pad using a DSerial, that would be awesome!  ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The lawsuit also stopped the production of Andamiro's "Pump It Up" brand cabinets for ITG2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To be honest I'm on the fence with that one. The whole DDR thing is very novel, it is no result of technology since the technology has existed for years and you can hardly do anything original with it! As far as I know the only new feature since the first one is that you can hold a button.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that Konami deserve the monopoly on the arcade cabinets with this one to be honest, but it may not stop you from making clone games. The lawsuit was about Andamiro using (a) the hype from DDR, (b) the public's confusion of which was which and just taking a free ride on the popularity of DDR. This was about the arcade scene, since users see the floor mats and immediately put their money in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
