    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I previously posted a topic about this in development but haven't gotten very far. What I am trying to do is make a fake fingerprint scanner that detects your finger or maybe heat of your finger, on the touch screen, and pretends to scan it. I thought it may be a cool concept. I currently have it compiled into several frames that could possibly be coded to a homebrew app.
<br/>
I can't code so could someone tell me what to do, or do the coding for me, If you would do it for me let me know how you want me to send you the files.
<br/>
Please respond.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a nice concept, but the DS' touch screen is pressure based, which is why you need to use a stylus.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i just wanted to say that the "New Super Mario Bros." DS game allows you to use your whole finger to select your power up so it is clearly possible to do. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is the only game i know of that does this though. All other games simply ignore that you even touched the screen if you try to use your whole finger.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know anything about programming but it's my guess that you could just make the program know whether or not the touchscreen had any pressure applied to it at all and then trigger based on that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well of course you can use your finger to touch the screen, but the DS still needs to pick a coordinate that the touch was placed at, so anywhere the finger can touch can be chosen.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this would be great as something before a game starts, like the "press start button" or "touch the screen to start". but u have to scan your finger lol

nice idea</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DynamicStability has done a demo to use multi touch :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a fake fingerprint scan in the "Kim Possible : Kimmunicator" game, you might want to check this out.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also a puzzle in "Hotel Dusk" (*warning: spoiler*) where you have to swap two switches at the same time by double-touching the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
From my understanding of the NDS tech specs, you can detect if there are multiple touches at the same time by using the diagonal positions (Z1 and Z2), but you cannot detect the coordinates (X Y) of each touch precisely. Z1 and Z2 were originally used to detect how strong the screen is pressed but can be tricked to detect double touch (as shown in Felix's example).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course this is not of any importance if you're only interested in faking it! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
