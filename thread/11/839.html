<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering what you meant when you said you need "a full download for gba programming"...???
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, good luck on your projects. I wonder how many people in my age group are part of this forum...<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The first thing that you has to do is to release yourself from the gba-junkie tutorials.
<br/>
If you use stuff like bg2.baseBlock, then try not to do it! write directly to the registers instead! (set REG_BG2CNT)
<br/>
Also, try to figure out what you can do and what you can understand. By knowing the borders of your knowledge you can break them and add some new! :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lord Graga on Mon Mar 24, 2003 9:12 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you and your friend are good at graphics, specialize in that. There is plenty of work available for skilled artists. If you have a site with examples of your work I'd like to check it out. You need programming or a game engine, and we need an artist... check out our game here: <a href="http://www.imagegames.com/bsc.html" target="_blank">http://www.imagegames.com/bsc.html</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
