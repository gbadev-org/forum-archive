    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there! My name is Sean and i'm looking for someone to do graphics for a game based on the Dragonball series, not the Dragonball Z series. I am interested in making an RPG style game so the graphics won't be so bad. I am looking for good artists who are interested in showing lots of detail! I will take care of coding and the rpg engine. Please let me know if you are at all interested! This is just for fun, although if it starts looking really good, we could even ask nintendo what they think. My AIM name is GoodUltima and my AOL name is TrptUltima. Hope to hear from someone soon!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
