    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess you're right muffles :) The game is a kind of platformer/arcade/puzzle where you control a grashopper(or maybe a frog, I havent really decided yet). At the top of the screen you have a energy bar that increases when you press the D-pad right or left, this energy is the force used to make a jump, so when you press the A-key your 'grashopper' will jump in the desired direction with the force displayed in the energy bar. This might not sound to thrilling at the moment, but I was hoping for some input from you guys.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hehe, well actually I didn't know about that game, but it seems its kind of what I was thinking about. Seems to score well on gameplay too which is very important.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I hope the *grin* showed you I wasn't trying to be insulting.  Hell, the back catalog of semi-obscure Spectrum games is ripe for.. uh.. "re-invention".  I've often thought of doing a Bugaboo game, and I think I started one on some platform.. forget whether it was Amiga or PC or ST, but I think I started.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll stop taking up your thread, just wanted to say it should be a fun game if you can get it pulled off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not necessary, but I am not all into Spectrum and it dodin't sound that interesting to me. Skotter was because it is only one screen based, so no scrolling and no tiles :)<br/>_________________<br/>-----------------------------------------
