    <h4>#168440 - Ruben - Wed Apr 29, 2009 12:20 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So basically, after doing a fair bit of work, I realized that my ideas simply weren't enough for making even a small demo of a sequel to FFIV on the GBA. That is, my programming ideas. :P
<br/>
<br/>
What my plan/outline was, is something like this:
<br/>
The game's main characters are Cecil, Rosa, Kain and a character that still needs a name. The fifth character may be swapped out throughout gameplay, or whatever; not really picky.
<br/>
It starts off 12 years later, after Damcyan was fully rebuilt. While they were building, they hadn't realized that they had built a resort/thing on a new island to the left, namely Onigashima. Only after the construction, the people started to see strange things, such as people being murdered, but when they arrived, they were no longer there, and seeing threats in an encoded thingo. As soon as the news reach Baron, Cecil fears the worst and heads to Mysidia. Once there, he asks the Elder of Mysidia if he knows of any legend regarding to this. Upon being asked, the Elder says something along the lines of saying his prayers and enters a battle with the demon that launched out of him. Cecil and the party defeat the demon, after which the Elder is left agonizing and tells them that the prophecy of Xuan is true and is being fulfilled now. He doesn't get to tell them the prophecy and so they set out on a journey to find clues and find out what's going on.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, enough story telling cos I have yet to come up with the rest. :P
<br/>
<br/>
I can provide a battle engine, music, music player/sound mixer, sounds, sound effects, graphic effects, and lots of help to those who need it.
<br/>
<br/>
So I was wondering if anyone was interested in helping me make this FFIV sequel, Final Fantasy IV-2 - Dawn of Darkness?
<br/>
<br/>
I would prefer that it be coded on the GBA as I'm much more familiar with it but can be slightly flexible on that aspect.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
I can actually write up a lot of the engine, if not most of it, it's just that I need a bit of motivation.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm 18 and have Asperger's, so if I don't get something at first, just bear with me. *nod*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Ruben:  I wish you the best of luck, but what you're talking about is a HUGE project that will take you years.  
<br/>
<br/>
The failure rate of these projects is high enough that you'll likely not get a lot of takers without a whole lot of demo code/art/engine/something to indicate that you might actually finish, unlike every other person coming here with a similar idea. 
<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion:  get the engine working, even if it's a bit simplified and has ugly art.  Create tools for level/map/script editing, and make the first town and dungeon.  When you get that working, it should be pretty easy to find a few other people that will get excited enough about your project to help with the rest of the art, level design, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you really want to do a modified FFIV, you will be better off reverse engineering the FFIVadvance ROM and then modifying it.  It already has an engine that supports all of FFIV's features.  =)  Also, there is a fair amount of documention out there, more for the SNES version than GBA version.  Evidently customized SNES versions exist.
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to do an RPG from scratch, do something original.  And strip down your requirement to the point where you can complete your game.  Something on level of FFIV would 5 ~ 10 years to complete alone, if you have the skills to do everything yourself.
<br/>

If you can pull off a demo, just make it user friendly and extensible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Doesn't necessarily matter -- whatever you're more likely to actually complete.  My point is that we currently don't believe you'll finish.  You're job is to convince us that you will (by showing us partially finished work).  
<br/>
<br/>
I'd expect you'd need to put in 6 months to a year of work before you'd have a demo that would convince anyone -- a simple tiled walkthrough of a static map with no interaction (like the 700 rpg demos that already exist out there) isn't convincing enough.  Neither is a title screen and menus.  Or mockups/sketches of possible art.  Or your proposed plot.  
<br/>
<br/>
What would be convincing is an engine that lets you walk around and talk to people, where you have random monster battles that actually work and are playable.  On top of that, have an easy-to-use tool that lets your team make their own maps that integrate seamlessly with your engine.  When you have that, you might be able to start convincing people to help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What stopped you from making a demo? Your ideas or writing the code?
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you take a look at Liran's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.talesofdagur.com" target="_blank">Tales of Dagur</a> homebrew RPG for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It might also be worth taking a look through the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/demos.php?listby=category&amp;category=RPG" target="_blank">gbadev RPG demo's</a>. There is some source in some demo's.
<br/>
<br/>
It might save you some time to look through some existing engines and perhaps even modify them for your own game (with permission from the original author of course).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by headspin on Thu Apr 30, 2009 4:17 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I don't think you will have much problem getting people interested the main problem is getting people to take your dedication and skills seriously. As other people have said the best way to do that is with a working demo/engine.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so far, everything seems to be going smoothly, so far:
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to design maps, you can make them in Mappy, using 16x16 tiles, and either 256 colours or 16 colours. You can make it as so the map can wrap around at the edges and continue (for example, the world map) or just have a fixed tile fill in when you go over. You don't have to export anything; just send me the FMP file and I'll do "the magic." Tested and working.
<br/>
<br/>
Music can be written in any sequencer that supports Midi export.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, map jump as in changing maps.  These ultimately boil down to changing to a specific x and y coordinate on a specific map number.  As for the maps themselves, the simplist way of doing things is the really old school way:
<br/>
*) 2 layers, one below the PC/NPC sprites, and one above them
<br/>
*) attach hit detection and other map attributes to the tiles in the tileset
<br/>
*) have the PC/NPCs interact with only the lower layer
<br/>
*) drop scripted events on specific spots on the map
<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example.  First, tileset attributes:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Tileset Flags
<br/>

<br/>
. Land, Can enter
<br/>
@ Land, Can enter
<br/>
= Land, Water, Can enter (a bridge)
<br/>
~ Water, Can enter (but only if you have the means to do so)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Next, a map made with them:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">MAP001 (bottom layer):

A single # tile at 1, 8.
<br/>

All of this is on the level of pseudo code, but I guess my challenge to you is add random battles and a couple more maps to this and turn it into a simple demo.  If I were to do this I would a have onUpdate() and onMove() scripts attached to each map, and onEnter() scripts attached to individial tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd also have an onSearch() script for events and a canEnter flag for events.  This way, an NPC is just an event with a canEnter flag set to false and an onSearch() script that displays a message.  If you go this route, events will also probably want onUpdate() events, and they will need to be able to move and display themselves (although many events will be invisible).
<br/>
<br/>
There are lots and lots of scripts involved in an RPG.  Every one of the critters that runs in your battle engine will need AI scripts.  The FFV advance algorithm FAQ covers how that game handled monster AI.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
My plan for the map collision, etc is to have 2 layers, and the player can be on layer 0 or layer 1 (i.e. Baron Castle to the right), and that all tiles are referenced to a table with "status" data (like forest, water, land, wall, etc) so it's more flexible.
<br/>
<br/>
What I plan to do with the maps and onEnter() scripts, is set up events (warp points and what not.. can't believe my friend lost the last demo I sent him with full map collision, events, etc -.-'), chests, entities that only need appear at a specific point, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm 18 and have Asperger's, so if I don't get something at first, just bear with me. *nod*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I suppose it might even be able to handle NPCs, chests and other visible events depending on how you do things.
<br/>
<br/>
RPG Maker is actually a blueprint of everything you will need in an RPG.
<br/>
If you have not done so already, download it and play around with it for a bit.
<br/>
In your demo or complete RPG, you will essentially need to take every feature in RPG Maker and either clone it, customize it (improve, simplify, etc), or leave it out.
<br/>
<br/>
Because the challenge right now is finishing the demo at all, and not making the best game ever, you should focus on what to simplify or leave out.
<br/>
I would decide on a minimum feature set, and then make a throwaway prototype, and then do everything to finish that throwaway prototype ASAP (including hard coding things and giving up flexibility).
<br/>
After you have a working prototype, you can either refactor it or build a proper engine from the ground up after looking at the weaknesses in the prototype.
<br/>
I'd opt for the second option after deciding on final feature set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In short, I can do big maps fine when they're 256x256, but they become funny when doing anything else. By funny, I mean that the baseblock thing is driving me bananas. It should be sorted out by the end of the night so...
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I've used RPG Maker in the past.. RPG Maker, Game Maker, Sphere, you name it.
<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing about Sphere, is that you had to write the battle engine yourself and other nifty little things.
<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to do for chests and stuff is make them NPC's whose "OnQueueEmpty" script is 0 (or, do nothing) and have them modified on map entry if needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Now back to Tonc and my code.. -.-'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This strikes me as a matter of lesser importance because it doesn't prevent you from completing a demo.  I'd document it and fix it later.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd probably give events a userData field.  This way you can use the same scripts for similar behavior.  Ie, give the chest script a contents id, or a message script the message id, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When in mode 7 (for airships), you'll need a map bigger then 256x256 (namely 512x256) so you don't see retardedness on the sides.

<br/>
So... starting today, I'm going to actually start implementing maps (again), as I deleted the old demo on purpose and forced myself to re-write everything, in doing so making things MUCH better and organized. So far, I've got working my Midi player/converter, message boxes, special effects, etc. (And yeah, in the Midi converter, it handles track looping: It uses a Data Entry MSB value of 127 for loop start and 126 for loop end, as this is one of the rare commands that I can use in NoteWorthy Composer) so hopefully, by the end of the day, I'll have the "map" structure and a test map setup using Mappy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
So anyway.. About 10 minutes ago, I finished coding the map and sprite interaction thing (that is, non-players move locally, while player moves globally (that is, scrolling camera)), and the only thing left before I release the first demo is to add these things:
<br/>
<br/>
-Collision [Completed as of 06/08 (MM/DD) @ ~8am]
<br/>
-Interaction with other entities [Completed as of 06/09 (MM/DD) @ ~1am]
<br/>
-Another map [ended up using same map, warping to random locations]

When that's done, I'll release a demo. :)

with your "static EvCnt = 0;" when is the initializer executed? it look obvious it is not initialized at every call or your code would be bogus, but i'dd just like to be sure.

<br/>
<br/>
static on a local variable essentialy changes it to a global variable that is available to the current function only. it gets initialized in the same manner as global variables - space is reserved by the compiler and constructors (if applicable) are called by the c runtime sometime before main is entered. I think it can get a little tricky with constructors as the order is compiler dependent.
<br/>
<br/>
in this case space would be reserved in the bss section and the c runtime zeros the bss section before main is called.
<br/>
<br/>
static on global variables and functions allows the compiler to optimize more aggressively.
<br/>
<br/>
static on local variables is usefull for allowing global variables that do not pollute the global namespace.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<ul>Overall, it looks really good.

You have a lunatic mode, but the description for deathwish mode is "for lunatic gamers".

Your "mode 7 demo" is nice; flashing noted.
<br/>
You should run a soft reset routine instead of terminating the program.
<br/>
As a black box observer, your scripting appears to be impressive, but without looking under the hood it is hard to tell if you are on the right track or not.  Naturally, you can always refactor and improve things later.
<br/>
Both of your test map NPCs delete themselves.  It seems like there should be a couple persistent NPCs with simple messages ("Hi.") one that walks around and another that stands still.  The event in the forest illustrates you engine is capable of persistent events.
<br/>
Your demo is still lacking map jumps.  If you create a couple of small towns or whatnot that the PC can enter and exit, I think that will add a lot to your demo. They need not be complex maps, just enough to show that your engine can handle map transitions.</ul>Questions about your demo:
<br/>
<ul>Why the GBA and not the DS?
<br/>
Why the Square Enix splash screen?
<br/>
Are the scripts and messages hard coded (C/C++), or are your game events linked to script and message resources?

Because, quite honestly, the DS is simply horrible to me.. not in terms of specs, but rather programming for it.

Um, not really sure what you mean by this.. But the events are coded in C, with messages calling the "PrintMessage" functions. It can do frame waits (with \x02 ~ \x08) and can clear the space it writes to with \x01.

Using a sandboxed scripting language is ideal.  Scripts written in C have the potential to do horrible horrible things.  Also, writing scripts is presumably easier than writing C code, so scripting should make it easier to grow your team.  To the extent you have the C side of the scripts written already, binding a scripting language to them should be fairly simple.

A full scale RPG is going to have hunderds of maps, with a bunch of scripts and messages for each map, as well as global scripts and messages.  Given everything that needs to go into an RPG, I think taking advantage of the SD card's drag and drop filesystem would simplify development, especially if there are multiple people working on the project.

Scrolling a mode 7 map is just like scrolling a mode 0 map, but you need to work out some math to get it to work.  You might want to consider always running in the mode 7 camera mode, although IIRC you might not have enough background layers.

I noticed that your mode 7 test does not play music.  It also does not display any diagnostic information.  When you use the tilt screen, I noticed that some internal values are destructively overwritten.

My thoughts on source code at this point are, just release it with each demo.  A lot of people like to wait until they clean up the code, but it often does not get cleaned up and the source is never released.  If people can glance over your code, they might spot potential bugs or architectural weaknesses for you.

You are free to do this, but personally, I absolutely hate the push button scripting RPG Maker uses.  It is very useful if you can open the scripts in any text editor (some have fancy features) or pass them through perl scripts, etc.  If the event scripts are edited after exporting, the editor should be able to pick up on these chages.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as NPCs go, I'd give them two values, a script ID and a data parameter for the script.  This way, you only need to create one inn script, one chest script, one local message script and you can change the exact behavior with the data parameter.  (This inn costs 120 gold; this is chest 77, so used flag 77 and chest contents 77; this event prints the MES_HELLO_WORLD message.)  I think you will find that you have a few global scripts that get used more than anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as messages go, inline text is a Bad Thing when it comes to localization and it also make reuse difficult.

It was bad enough realizing that the anti-clockwise x/y rotation matrix wasn't what I needed and then re-organizing :P

All I do with it right now is, on suggestion from DekuTree, I have a vector which I'll name P, which is simply (0.0,Cy,0.0), where C is the camera position vector. What I do during the "moving" loop, is simply rotate P to get P', and then use Py' for Cy' and Cz' is calculated using Pz'+Cz.

You only need a few custom file handling routines, and after they are written you just call them and everything magically works.  (If they still have bugs, everything has not been worked out yet. =)

Another advantage to a filesystem is that you can test changes without an engine recompile.  You just drop your new map in and see how it works.  As an army of one this is not a big deal, but if you are working with other people it is nifty to give them the most up to date version of the engine and let them work on and test the content.

By attaching functionality and and a piece of data to your NPCs, you only need to write each generic event only once and the exact funtionality can be changed simply by replacing the data field.  The function pointer (or index into an array of function pointers) answers the question "What is this NPC in a generic sense?" (an inn keeper; a chest).  If you attach data as well, that answers the question "Specifically, what is this NPC?" (the guy who charges 120GP; chest 77 (unopened, cointains an ether)).

There are many ways to get the job done.  One nice thing about having a clearly defined spec is that it is easy to tell if you have enough flexibility built into your architecture.  My thoughts are, why attach an inn cost to every map when only a handful of them will actually have an inn?  What if you want two inn keepers on the same map?

None of this is hard stuff.  In case you have not noticed, embedded string functions are very useful:

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">MES_FIND_ITEM

"You found #wait(10).#wait(10).#wait(10).#wait(10) #red()#an_item($0)#normal()!"</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
A text display system that combines embedded functions, precompiled text, and message parameters will be able to do everything you want it to.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">void DisplayMessage(int pId, int pParamCount, int *pParamValue);

<br/>
int count = sizeof(param) / sizeof(int);
<br/>
DisplayMessage(MES_FIND_ITEM, count, param);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I'm not sure if you need a text display system that is this powerful.  It would require precompiled messages, although a regex filter in perl could probably handle the conversion.

If your engine supports drag and drop assets, the DS makes a lot of sense.  To the extent you have written the engine once, you should be able to do a better job the next time around.  (The GBA version would be your throw away prototype.)  I like 2D RPGs.  Not fussy about music, but I suppose "both" midi and tracker would be the friendliest.
<br/>

If I were you, I'd spend a week and tie Lua to your GBA engine before doing the DS one from scratch, but if you have no interest in that, skip it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The scripting issue

COM is for "Communication" or "Command", SCV is for "Scripting Conditional Value", VAL is for "Value" and BATWIN is for "Battle Win".

Basically what it does is, if the battle has been won, then it jumps to 1f, otherwise it does some other stuff then jumps back to 1b.

This is the kind of stuff Square used in the 90s.  The person writing ASM style scripts can keep track of what is going on, but they are really hard for anyone else to understand, let alone edit.
<br/>
<br/>
Development ease/speed are just as, if not more, important than execution speed.  Nobody should be coding scripts in an ASM-like language anymore.  If you have the time and energy to write a compiler for your VM and you want to do that, go for it.  Personally I would stick with something like Lua for development ease, speed and portability.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Scripting:
<br/>
I personally don't care much for scripting systems. I would write events in C unless a) I needed to crunch for cart space, or b) I wanted someone else to write my events and they liked some other language.
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the case, my general criteria for these things is "least total time". There's time to write the system, time to write events, and time to go back and edit/debug events. The edit/debug time is the most variable, depending on the skill of the scripter and how thoroughly planned out the game's story is before you start building maps and events.
<br/>
<br/>
Music:
<br/>
Whatever you prefer to write in. I write more easily in MIDI, but my MIDI editor doesn't have an easy way to do pitch/volume slides, which I want, so I'm using tracker for my game. On GBA, I would also use tracker for the finer control over channel allocation.
<br/>
<br/>
DS/other system:
<br/>
Actually I love the GBA, and have been wanting to make another game for it. But the second screen is kind of nice so you can keep walking around while you mess with equipment in the menu :)
<br/>
Plus the GBA's sound is crap.
<br/>
<br/>
If not GBA or DS, then I'd suggest cross-platform with OpenGL/SDL for graphics and stuff. The GP2X community is pretty cool, and they have a new system call Wiz, and upcoming system called Pandora, which don't need so much special care like GBA/DS. And then you could also release for PC to get a lot more players.
<br/>
<br/>
2D/3D:
<br/>
2D. 3D doesn't make it exponentially harder, but just the basic time to get an engine set up and all the exporters and map editor and stuff to actually create data is just too big to bother with. Especially because I think 2D looks better in the end.
<br/>
<br/>
But using the DS's 3D hardware to display 2D graphics is a definite option. Just keep in mind that there's a second screen that doesn't have 3D hardware, so you'll have to write some things for both anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

<br/>
<br/>
For this example, I'll say the world map.
<br/>
<br/>
As you know, the map is made up of "water" "terrain" "grassland" and "desert." Some tiles are joined up to the water tiles, which we know are animated to simulate the sea.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem here, is that all maps I've found have one or more 'sections' of the snapshot taken from a different animation frame, which bloats the tiles a bit. That wouldn't be much of a problem, as animated tiles would be modified on runtime anyway, but it does mean I have to copy to two different places because of a single mismatch.
<br/>
<br/>
The pixel problem is that, for example, a certain section of the map is accidentally offset by a few pixels, which 'destabilizes' the whole thing, as all tiles can be different, and it could be that they ripped the 'land' and pasted it over the water tiles, which would mean the water tiles would be fine, whilst the land tiles are offset a bit, which mucks up the tiles even further.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm 18 and have Asperger's, so if I don't get something at first, just bear with me. *nod*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I think what Ruben saying is that he wants to rip and use the actual maps from the original FF game.  So he found images of the maps ripped online, and is trying to use (or write?) a tool to automatically convert that to be used in his game.  But this automatic conversion falls apart because the source image isn't consistent.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not a simple problem to overcome.  As far as I can tell, you have 3 options:
<br/>
<br/>
-You could write special exceptions into your import tool to handle all the inaccuracies
<br/>
-You could go back and fix the source images by hand
<br/>
-You recreate the maps yourself based on the originals.  
<br/>
<br/>
None of those sound fun.  If you wrote a special tool to do #3 (where it could display the source image behind the map as you're creating it), that may be slightly less work.  I dunno.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I meant that I want to use the maps used from FFIV and the rest is correct, too.
<br/>
<br/>
Option 1: That does NOT sound fun &gt;_&gt;
<br/>
Option 2: Yeah, I've been trying that, but it's EXTREMELY hard to find inaccuracies with a 55200 tile map &gt;_&gt;'
<br/>
Option 3: That option has been looking like the best one, lately, but it would take a HELL of a lot of time, so I'm not sure it's worth it. However, seeing as how long I've been taking to do all this other stuff, it may seem like the way to go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A tool that does something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Read in a tile from your source image.  Rank it versus all known tile types via RGB channel deltas.  This can be done via horizontal and vertical scans to catch alignment innaccuracies in different direction.  It should also phase/pixel shift the tiles to catch off by 1 or two or more pixel shift errors.  Have it output the info in a usable format - say a text csv type file.  Take the file and render it.  And hand fix the few tiles it misses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IIRC, even the maps in FFIV are at least a couple of layers.  Working from screenshots, it will be hard to split the map into layers.

<br/>
FFIV has been reverse engineered backwards and forwards.  To the extent you don't want to make your own maps, I think the easy way to solve this problem is to dive into the RE documents and rip the data from the SNES version of the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Grr, well this is an news-only update I should've done LONG ago but..
<br/>
<br/>
- My desktop computer (the one that has all my data, programming, documents etc) is currently not working (and hasn't been for quite a while), as my PCIe port got damaged by a faulty video card, and have since been waiting for AGES to get a PCI video card. So until I can get a hold of a PCI video card, there's not much I can do. :-/
<br/>
<br/>
- My laptop had been damaged, too, and I only got around to fixing it today (even if the keyboard became faulty which makes me use a USB one &gt;_&gt;), so I wasn't as active as usual as we only have one other computer working.
<br/>
<br/>
- Said laptop has, quite literally, *no* programming resources at ALL, therefore I can not program until I can get on my desktop. (Even if I wanted to program, I can't as this computer is VERY slow even on WinXP so compiling takes too long for my own good)
<br/>
<br/>
- I will (hopefully) be more active on the forums now that my laptop is somewhat functional. However, as I've mentioned a few times, I can *not* program anything on here until I get a video card (which I ordered today; should be here in ~2 weeks).
<br/>
<br/>
So yeah. Sorry about this major 'episode' guys, but I seriously can not do anything with nothing. :-/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so... I finally got my new computer, so...
<br/>
<br/>
For the last 2 days, I've been ripping sprite graphics from FFIV advance; I've ripped most of the sprites using 80kb. What is interesting to note is that all that 80kb use only 3x 16 colour palettes.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've also finished the map engine and the sprite engine. What I'm doing right now is currently re-organizing all the sprites into a format I can use and then I'll be able to include them all into the maps' enter scripts. Also, I made a camKill() function that disables the camera and restores some blend values used for shading, and disables all sprites in camData.obj[].
<br/>
<br/>
So... I'm gonna keep working on that for now and upload a release ASAP.
<br/>
Bad thing is that I don't have internet on that computer for another 2 weeks &gt;_&lt;'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I still don't have internet on the other computer, so all I've done is be bored because the world map is WAY too big to be done all at once. I have done some minor programming, but it's still pretty alpha-stage.

You can hold KEY_SELECT down just before it starts to enter a 'debug' mode where you can test the music (along with a cool volume effect) and the [two] maps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you must use the original map, I still think you would see productivity gains if you ripped it.  Evidently there are tools out there for customizing FFIV.  I do not know exactly what they do, but I suspect all of this has been reverse engineered already.  Why reinvent the wheel?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think there's a program for the SNES version of FFIV that lets you edit the world maps. I could probably use that for ripping the map, but it's probably more understandable to write it from scratch?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are very few cases where one needs to reverse engineer anything as a games programmer.  Almost all of the time you are engineering new systems from pre-existing specifications.
<br/>
<br/>
Hand coding maps is data entry, not programming.  If I needed a small amount of this work done, I'd use cheap non-programmer labor to do it.  If I needed a lot of it done, a have someone program a conversion tool.  Without knowledge of the original data format, I'd need a very good reason to bother fussing around with it at all.
<br/>
<br/>
My question for you is, what do you really want to get done?  If your goal is to make a game, put as much of your time into getting the game up and running as you can.  If your goal is to write tools, then write tools for your clearly defined specs.  If your goal is to reverse engineer FFIV, then reverse FFIV.  If your goal is really to hand code maps, then go for it, but it does not sound like it is.
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend that you look into the SNES tool you mentioned.  See if it has source code.  I don't recommend rewriting the tool unless it is trivial or missing a feature that can not easily be added.  There will be plenty of other opportunities to practice and develop your mad skills.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I've been doing since yesterday morning is writing my own functions (sound, FIFO, etc.) for the DS, as I now plan to start on the DS cos as I've noticed, it gets easier when one has a foundation one is comfortable with.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, I seem to have most things done (sound, FIFO, video, memory, ITCM/DTCM, etc.), and just need to tweak a few things. So aside from that, I have made ARM7/ARM9 stuff and joined them using ndstool. From what I've seen, it works just fine. So for now, I'm'a sleep. =P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a similar type experience of experience as you, and all I would say is beware of reinventing every wheel. It's a great to be versatile in your programming but at the same time it is very important to be able to <span style="font-weight: bold">reuse</span> existing code rather than recreating all of it.
<br/>
<br/>
Look at what Google did with Chrome, they took lots of existing systems and created *in my opinion* the most powerful browser!
<br/>
<br/>
And as well as the low level stuff (which did allow me to achieve many things in my work that others could not have), it's important to develop your project management skills and games systems as well.
<br/>
<br/>
It's all fine being able to do everyone's job, but it's probably equally good to be able to work with code that isn't "to your standard". <span style="font-weight: bold">Communication</span> is the word!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One of the main goals with devkitPro was accessibility to a wide range of skillsets. Recently the world and his dog seem to be trying to write their own frameworks from scratch and unleashing them on the poor defenceless homebrew community who are left not knowing which choices to make :/
