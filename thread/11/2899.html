    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well the script was started 2 days ago and still has a very long way to go. But we plan to start working on the real game in about a month. But the battle System for the new earthbound would be similar to the old battle system except with graphic improvments(if i can get a screenshot ill post it) as of for the other RPG I was thinking somewhat of a final fantasy, where you wait until the bar is full then its your turn to attack.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I saw some screens for the new FF x-2 an it looks ace :) For the rest I am not that well-known with FF. I liked the gfx style of the mana games. I love chibi style. I found some tiles from earthbound at <a href="http://www.rpgmaker2000.4players.de:1027/downloads/chipsets/3d.png" target="_blank">http://www.rpgmaker2000.4players.de:1027/downloads/chipsets/3d.png</a> and <a href="http://tsgk.captainn.net/sprites_snes_earthbound.html" target="_blank">http://tsgk.captainn.net/sprites_snes_earthbound.html</a>
<br/>
If you want gfx like that, you need way more pixel artists :)<br/>_________________<br/>-----------------------------------------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well for Ebound I was thinking about using the same GFX, for the most part except for the battling. See I want the sequel project to feel like the old game, but in a sense be different. But anyways would you be willing to help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well like I probably said in another thread I don't have much time because I am commited to commercial projects. I think for an rpg you need more artist, like a backdrop (tiles) artist and a sprite artist.
<br/>
A Earthbound part 2 sounds like fun, but when you use original gfx I think you can do most of it yourself. I am not interested in copies of games, because the things you can do with them are limited. I think you basicly make them for the fans then, which is good but too time-consuming for me. Ofcourse I also like retro games and ofcourse I like to do some of them, but i always look into the possibility of making money out of it. I already make games for money, so i don't need a bigger portfolio at the moment :)
<br/>
So first try to get some more artists interested. You can look at <a href="http://www.gfxartist.com" target="_blank">www.gfxartist.com</a> for really talented people who make my gfx into shame :)
<br/>
Work on the storyboards, compile some examples with borrowed gfx and then post it on here again and then we can see what we can do. I think that is the best way for most games though. Even mine :D<br/>_________________<br/>-----------------------------------------
