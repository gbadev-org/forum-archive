    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At the risk of getting my mailbox revoked here on volume, I want to get an idea if anyone here would be seriously interested in a developer position at Griptonite games.  While I am not the person responsible for any final hiring decisions, qualified individuals can PM me with contact information and we can see if there is a possible fit.  
<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for both DS and GBA developers.  Strong GBA platform knowledge is required for both type of positions.  You will have to relocate to Seattle, WA and work on site - no internet contract positions.  In the past, I've privately been contacting people, but as I'm on vacation for the moment, I believe I can handle a few extra requests :)
<br/>
<br/>
Any other questions, I'll respond in public or private as needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
