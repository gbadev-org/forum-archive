it's a question of cost (time) and payoff.

I'm not sure if you have ever seen lego cad 3d which is a similar homebrew app, but it won't work on the r4 and it uses only legos and there is no 360 degree rotation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On the other hand, I had the idea of a 3D sculpting app (see <a class="postlink" href="http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=MhDKLaVsdxc" target="_blank">here</a> for example). The touch capability would make it quite interesting and unique to the DS... Imagine a portable 3D sculpting tool!

Unfortunately the NDS  low 3D and float performance would make it quite a challenge to code. I may want to give it a shot one day, though. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

me too. but, it would be very simple. maybe we could use the pressure sensitivity to "mold" like clay.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be cool to create new 3D objects and animations (even characters) while you're on the go, saving them to your flash cart, then later integrating them with your game or application.
<br/>
<br/>
If it saved and loaded data in binary DS display lists, that would be pretty sweet.  Then it would be fairly future-proof, since the format is already defined.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I once saw a full version of Blender running on a PDA, so a little 3D modeling/animation tool on a DS shouldn't be out of the question.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you would probably need extra ram (for blender like software) and zbrush or anything in that direction would be out of the way, as simply diplaying a *reasonably* (and usefully) tessalated model would already be a problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
well, you still can write a software renderer for that, but... (yeah: but...)
<br/>
<br/>
i'll leave it at that. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
what i can imagine is some sort of *extreme* low poly modeller and animator (for "boxy" characters, like in resident evil for the PS).
<br/>
<br/>
saving to the hw's native "format" wouldn't be something i would advise. simply because modelling and animation software is so much more than a simple display list renderer, thus needing additional information. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
saving to milkshape's binary format (it's quite popular and supports all needs games have) would be reasonable, i guess.

Given that the DS and the PS1 have similar capabilities w.r.t. triangles per scene, that might be useful.

Let me repeat what I said more clearly:
<br/>
<br/>
If a full-featured modeling and animation app like Blender can run on a PDA, certainly a simple little specialized modeling app could be done for a DS, right?
