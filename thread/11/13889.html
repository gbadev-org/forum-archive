    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not some big fancy corporation like a bunch of these guys I noticed.
<br/>
I'm just a teenager with a goal of becomming one of the best there is.
<br/>
Everyone needs to start somewhere, and this is my turn to start!
<br/>
<br/>
I need 3D graphic artist and programmers.
<br/>
I also really want someone that can make official games, maybe someone liscensed, but If homebrew is the best you have, I'll take it.  Any help is better then nothing, and I should be grateful I was even able to find a website like this one.
<br/>
Because I really want my games to be published and marketed... who doesn't?  But Like I said, I'll take any homebrew help.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on two different projects.  One for DS and one for 360.
<br/>
For those of you interested in making a good first person shooter on DS and a third person on 360,
<br/>
this is your chance, because thats what I'm aiming towards.
<br/>
I am also really creative, you should be ab;e to tell that by my name.  I added the 51 there by myself, hehehe.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested check out my site, and register on the forums or email me at the address below.  Thank you for your time, Peace.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bah.  Do your homework:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Tell us what you bring to the table.  If all you're bringing is the creativity and game ideas, you better have a really good design doc.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Have you accomplished anything so far on these projects?  Unless you have something to show us, we'll assume (which I do right now) that you are just one of the 5000 people with an idea that you don't have the energy/time/motivation/talent to really do anything with.
<br/>
<br/>
3.  Are you paying people?
<br/>
<br/>
4.  Read the thousand other posts exactly like yours, and look at the response they got.  Now tell what you have that's different.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll just say, one difference that I see between this post and dozens of others like it is that Arya51 has put together a nice website. That's worth a little encouragement.

<br/>
Arya, you obviously have some motivation. I applaud your efforts. Hey, if you can learn how to code a webpage, why not learn to code a game? It's not easy, but the rewards are immense. It will be very difficult to find a coding+art team who will sign up to your vision... but there is NOTHING stopping you from learning to do it all yourself. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you get an engine up and running, it's fairly easy to find artists who will reskin your game. Or, if you finish all of the art (sprites, cut scenes, etc. etc.) and it's really good, you might be able to find a coder to help you.
<br/>
<br/>
The final option I'd suggest if you're more artistically inclined would be to download an existing game or demo with source code, and reskin somebody else's game.
<br/>
<br/>
Start with something *simple.* Your global warming game might need some mini games in it at some point, so maybe start with one of those? Get your DS to play tic-tac-toe or pong, then expand from there. If you start too big, you'll NEVER finish.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,
<br/>

Heck, a web developer who wants to branch into games could even prototype game logic (though obviously not 3D graphics logic) in JavaScript if that's what he or she is comfortable with.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
