<br/>
<br/>
Ok, heres the insight. basically, me and 2 of my friends are making an RPG in C for the gameboy advance. its called the Last Dome, we're still working on the story line and everything. We're looking for a few people that mite be interested, its not a very big project, itl just be to get a little bit of practise. Im the lead (well, only) programmer and was wondering if other people would like to help out. Ive been doing C for quite a while, though im not great... classed as about Intermediate going onto Advanced level but the thing is that ive never actually taken on a project like this. So, we've got the following positions open if anyones interested:
<br/>
<br/>
1) A few more programmers to help me
<br/>
2) Some sprite artists
<br/>
3) Musicians
<br/>
4) A few imaginative people for the storyline
<br/>
<br/>
It doesnt matter how good you are, as long as you know atleast something about what you're applying for though a few people who are experienced at GBA programming (in C or C++) willing to sacrifice only a few hours a week would be nice
