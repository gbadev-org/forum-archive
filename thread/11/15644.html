I had an idea about an updater for the ds so openttds could be updated from the ds but the developers dominik81 is too busy on the project self so he is seeking some developers that can make an updater for his project it would help other projects too. But he also have other problems maybe someone could him.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
