    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">greetings people of the free gaming network,
<br/>
<br/>
my name is Andrew, im an 18 year old college student from Montreal, Quebec(Canada) but art is my passion. ive been doing 2D pixel art for a couple of years now and i had gotten together with a Programmer to make a 2D platformer. because of creative differences, he decided to pursue his own projects so im stuck here with my background artist and a buttload of graphics. im just wondering if there is anyone here who is willing to program this game. i will give more information only by email because of confedentiality purposes between the artists and the rest of the world :P.
<br/>
<br/>
so email me or respond here if you would like to help. here are some of the graphics currently done. i have enough for a basic movement/attack demo at the moment and more are comming as we speak.

I'd love to volunteer, but I'm still a padawan, so I'll store your email for future reference.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, some Jedi Master will see that art and send you an email, so good luck with all your projects.<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The current artwork you have looks very good.  I am a long term programmer with experience on the GBA.  Me and one other friend (also a programmer) are working on programming demo/games and need good artist/s and sound guy.  Right now we are stuck with lame programmer art :(
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can't see your graphics they're all dead links for some reason. But if they're good I'd like to talk. We have a very serious game project that has been in development for 9 months and we desperately need another artist that knows GBA pixel graphics. Check out our game here: <a href="http://www.imagegames.com/bsc.html" target="_blank">http://www.imagegames.com/bsc.html</a> and maybe we can team up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
