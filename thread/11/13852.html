    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure many of you are familiar with the energy ebb and flow of working on a big project. I'm currently really low energy and I think maybe some fresh blood would really help get this done.
<br/>
<br/>
What I have:
<br/>
Amazing professional art
<br/>
Working flight physics
<br/>
Functional art pipeline (converters/importers)
<br/>
Experienced lead programmer (handheld stuff isn't my regular job though)
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm looking for:
<br/>
Excitement/Energy to get things moving again
<br/>
Experience with "arm7" (networking/audio) stuff would be perfect, but if you were a 3d fiend I could switch
<br/>
<br/>
What you get out of it:
<br/>
Credit on a cool project
<br/>
All the tools and code to use on your future stuff (no use of the art)
<br/>
Maybe a tiny (beer-money) bit of $ if you're a student or starving artist type
<br/>
<br/>
Demo, screenshots, etc. available by request. If you're genuinely interested and feel you need a design doc I'll expand the current 2 page outline. It hasn't been necessary for the two person team.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm curious to see the thing. I'm kinda low energy on a couple of projects myself. Maybe we could trade enthusiasm.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you post screenshots, etc. someplace? Or could you send me whatever you want to scott[zat]scottlininger[dot]com.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds interesting. I'm currently tied with getting Dicewars DS finished properly, but nevertheless if you could PM me the demo/screenshots I could give it a thought. Even if I didn't have time to participate full-time, I'd be happy to give pointers/help with sound and networking functionality (especially the latter is what I've been coding on DS for the past few months or so).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Demo is still available from me, and I'm happy to try and help out with team member's other stuff as Scott suggested. I've mostly worked on 3d display including capture/screenshots/multipass rendering and bone animation with display lists.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hey, I got your email. Thanks for the demo. It really looks sweet.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I don't think my current skill set would be of much use to you. I haven't done any DS stuff yet, only GBA. But best of luck! (And if the project is still open when I "catch up", I'll be in touch.)

I would currently be somewhat excited about working either on a Flight Sim or a Software Synthesizer, possibly both.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if it would make much sense to join your project; I'll describe what I had in mind for my sim:
<br/>
<br/>
Publically available even if not entirely useable.
<br/>
Possibly/probably Open Source.
<br/>
My first (useable) release would be (would have been) a pure IFR sim with a C-172; an outside view, if at all, only once "runway in sight". Inspiration: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/vic20/carts/8k/IFR.txt" target="_blank">VIC-20 IFR Simulator</a>, something minimal, with touch control for flight stick. I'm not trying to port Flight Gear to the DS.
<br/>
If 3D at all, just very basic stuff like the very early FS.
<br/>
<br/>
What is your outlook, and how do you think we can perhaps combine the projects (mine doesn't exist except in my head and a few pieces of paper)?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Perhaps the best way to get started would be if I take a look at the sound side of things. I am an experienced developer, DS/Embedded is new to me, and I'm interested in learning more about the ARM7 sound side. That way I could work on my possible Synth and contribute a bit on your FS, without starting a second project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I started with the code from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/physicsgame/" target="_blank">Physics for Game Developers</a> which is a pretty simple rigid body model. I converted it all to fixed point math and fixed a few weird bugs with things like inverted flight. I'm not sure how well it would work for you, since it's probably more generic than you'd want if you're going for an accurate feeling model of a single plane, but I'm happy to send you the code. Email me if you want it. I was an Atari boy myself, so I don't know the VIC-20 IFR, but it sounds impressive for the time.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as audio work goes I'll take any help I can get. I'm hopeful that the upcoming libNDS will have the promised new audio library in it so I can work with something standardized.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

well, it sounds as if our interests are more or less complementary.
