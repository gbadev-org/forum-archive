    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on an action RPG engine on GBA for some time now, and it is starting to come together. I would like to get in touch with an artist, and possibly a story designer, who wants to help make a simple game with it.
<br/>
<br/>
This will be a hobby project. The goal is to have fun making it, and to create a small, simple and fun game. What I require of you is that you are self-motivated and that you take control of your part. I would basically like to be the programmer (not the creative director) on this project.
