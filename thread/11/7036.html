    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It has been a long time since I actually posted something usefull, so here it goes!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is the plan?</span>
<br/>
Maybe some people know about Dual-Soft.COM wich I wanted to be a DS devving portal and great community, too bad it never happened. So I decided to make some BIG changes and offcourse I can't do all alone. What I am going to do is really simple but it will cost alot of effort and alot of money. The plan is to create a multi developers site (DS,PSP,GBA,XBOX,PS2,NGC, PC and feature Revolution, PS3 and Xbox360). Not only it will be a developing site, but also you can go there for your daily needs of game news regarding <span style="font-weight: bold">ALL</span> platforms named earlier. Every brand will get it's own subdomain, for example: nintendo.dual-soft.com (DS,GBA,NGC,REV), microsoft.dual-soft.com (Xbox, Xbox360), sony.dual-soft.com (PSP, PS2, PS3) and pc.dual-soft.com for all your PC needs. Of course Every subdomain get's a filter so you can see what you want. For example, when you go to the sub domain of your choiche (or simply go to dual-soft.com and click your platform of choice) you will see all the news available (homebrew, news, reviews, previews,articles, tutorials etc.). Now this looks pretty messed up but then comes the filter. If you are only interested in Hombrew of the chosen platform then simply filter to Homebrew, so only homebrew is visible. Not only you can find game and homebrew news there, but projects from various developers can be found there too. Also we except new projects that we can host and so we can give it the attention it deserve's! Also we will host tools, resource's (sprites, source code's, BGM and more), tutorials and alot more. I have alot more ideas for dual-soft.com and I will also except other ideas from users here to make dual-soft as comfortable as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Why this big idea?</span>
<br/>
The main reason behind it was simply to let gamers and developers be one. As it goes now the Homebrew scene deserves too little attention and I think it should get more to stimulate developers and encourage gamers to get into the scene! Als it could be the place were die hard PC hackers get interested in DS hacking and starts too explore new worlds. Or a gamer who is fascinated by the Homebrew scene and wants to start too. All of this could work out great but I need alot of financiel help and off-course, crew!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What do I need?</span>
<br/>
I need at least the following for every subdomain:
<br/>
<br/>
2 News posters (games)
<br/>
1/2 News posters (homebrew)
<br/>
1/2 Articel writers (reviews)
<br/>
1/2 Articel writers (previews)
<br/>
1/2 Admins (wich are responsible for the sub domain)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Qualifications?</span>
<br/>
What are the qualifications? For the first 4 descriptions you should master and have an superb vocabulary of the english language and you should be atleast 16 years. For the Admins it is the same but only I request a minimum age of 20 years. I'm not too selective but you should also have some fantasy and try to make your articles fun to read. If you wan't too apply on the following descriptions be sure to write an review/preview for qualification purposes (dual.soft.info@gmail.com)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Anything else left?</span>
<br/>
Yes, I need more =P
<br/>
<br/>
PHP / MySQL scripter ( I'm also working on a script but I just started with PHP/SQL)
<br/>
Layout designer (This is allready done, but might change if needed)
<br/>
Projects (New teams that are willing to join the Dual-Soft team, you will get hosted and will get enough space and easy to find domain * )
<br/>
Resource's ( Resource's that were made for dual-soft )
<br/>
Tutorials (tutorials written for dual-soft regarding homebrew)
<br/>
<br/>
I think I have told alot by now, if you are interested in one of the above descriptions or have questions, send them to <a href="mailto:dual.soft.info@gmail.com">dual.soft.info@gmail.com</a> or post them here. Please do not forget to include any form of reference so we can judge if you are suited for the job.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What will it cost?</span>
<br/>
The service's Dual-Soft.COM is going to offer will NOT cost you any money, however, the proper servers will cost alot. You can understand we can't do it on our own. If you might want to help to invest in Dual-Soft.COM you can donate through paypal or just click google ads (you can find both the paypal donate button, and google ads on the old Dual-Soft.COM ). If there is any other way you would like to help please reply in this thread.
<br/>
<br/>
If you know about other dev/game sites please consider reposting this so we get more then just handheld coders, or just place a link to the site so I can post it there myself.
