    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey everyone. First of all id like to say this is my first post now to the point. I am currently writing a Game(I didnt know if I could post for non-gba game related creation here) it is in C++ using SDL. Currently me and my co-webmaster are writing the engine. But do to the fact that I have a ton of homework I usually dont get to much time to work on it. After the engine is starting to look good I want to make a Zelda like game with it.(Just for fun, but maybe possibly use the engine for some commercial Projects later on)
<br/>
<br/>
I need help making the sprites(I have them but not enough time to get them to how the engine reads them (100% green back drop, 150x100)
<br/>
<br/>
Also I cant code this engine by myself(even though I would if I cant get any more help, sprites is the major issue right now) 
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This site has a zelda engine and you can make your own zelda adventure. You can also download other adventures that others have made which are cool.

If you want to just make a 2D engine then that's another story.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
