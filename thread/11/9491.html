<br/>
Anyway, I need sprites for this fighting game I'm working on. It's not on the GBA, but this is the best place I could think of. My aim is Street Fighter Alpha style, but I'll accept King of Fighters.
<br/>
<br/>
But what I won't and can't accept is to simply use actual SF/KOF sprites. I need original stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can do fighting game sprites and don't expect monetary payment, do contact me and we'll talk.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Use dummy graphics until you find an artist. Try looking for an artist on a pixel art forum, if such a place exists. =) Artists are low supply, high demand here. That means that they generally won't be available. (Copied, but it applies.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had great success googling for "Nintendo Sprites" or similar variations under the google Images search. That's the fastest way to find sites that actually have graphics people have ripped or created.
