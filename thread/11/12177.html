    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently making a GBA Pokemon RPG game called PokeQuest.
<br/>
<br/>
The story is when an evil pokemon name King Mew(a Mewtwo) destory a city, Pikachu( the main hero) manage to escape, but is seperated from his family. He walk around the desert and gets attacked by Sperows. Just when it was the end, a Pidgeotto saved him. He was actully from a rescue base called PokeQuest. He flys Pikachu over there and he soon became a PokeAgent. As Pikachu, you go on different missions, find friends, and defeat many enemies.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got the whole story made and how the game will go, but I have a hard time getting started. All I have completed is the title. It would be great if I had some help. I really need some:
<br/>
<br/>
Programmers (I can be one of them)
<br/>
Map designers
<br/>
Sprite maker
<br/>
People to help make music and sounds
<br/>
people who can help me write the script
<br/>
<br/>
I have some programming experence(except with programming sounds) and this is my first real game.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested or have any questions, Please post me a message or E-mail.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by JJGamer123456 on Wed Jan 17, 2007 5:12 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">I have this awesome game idea.  Can somebody help me make it?</span>

Short answer: probably not.
<br/>
Long answer:  unless you:
<br/>
        1.  have something detailed to show and offer (a detailed and compelling design doc, part of the game engine functional, another game you've done to show that you can complete a project, etc) 
<br/>
    OR
<br/>
        2.  can pay people to do it

The game will also have a interesting battle system as well. As for the design docs, I will work on it and have it ready in a few weeks, along with a demo of the battle system.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many professional studios don't bother with RPG based on ROI alone.  The problem with RPGs is the sheer amount of time it takes to make them- ten <span style="font-weight: bold">experienced</span> people might be able to pull of an RPG in ten months, assuming that everything goes right.  Ten people, some of them experienced could probably pull off a standard RPG in 18 months.  Ambitious RPG projects can take 30 people from 3 to 5 years, and you can push the time/effort higher than that if you want to.
<br/>
<br/>
All of those figures are for full time paid employees.  Less people will take longer.  Part time will take longer.  Unpaid people will probably either be unskilled or lose interest- either way the project takes longer.  If you are efficient and can do everything by yourself, you could probably complete an RPG in 6 to 10 years, alone.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be curious to see your time estimate for each aspect of the game.  If you have a clever workload reduction strategy, you might be able to make something in 3 months with 3 people, but it certainly won't be on the level of Final Fantasy VI.

FFVI was more towards looking good rather then being better a Final Fantasy.
<br/>
<br/>
A more heavly programed game is Tales Of Phatasia or Mother. Then Wonder Project J is also a consideration with Dragon Quest which barely had anybody on it. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you say things like we need a billion dollar production to get somewhere you are wrong. All you need a programmer, a artist, and a sound musician and presto instant game.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact you don't even need a musician or sound person programming is the key element in game creating.
<br/>
<br/>
Just because somebody has a degree does not make them a professional in anything. A professional is just somebody who has done work in there field and is highly respect threw there activities.
<br/>
<br/>
If you look into past history most respected game developers did things that had to barely do with the game creating process.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

A professional is actually someone who does their work as their profession. A semi professional is someone who is paid money for their work (and therefore is not amateur) but for whom the work is not their full time job. An amateur does not get paid for their work!!!

This is a content issue.  It had a mature RPG system from a technical standpoint.  You could make anything, even an RPG about surfing monkeys, using that engine if you really wanted to.

My point is this- if you want to compete with FFVI, you are looking at investing a lot of time.  If you want to beat FFVI, even more time.

I am not convinced that this is true.  I don't know anything about any of these code bases.  I do know that given either of them as a template, you could basically make any other pseudo standard RPG.  To a greater extent, the content makes a game good or bad, not the engine.  The engine requires a guy with "mad" skills.  Content takes time/money to produce.  Scripted events are the worst of both worlds; they are expense to make.

It depends on what you want to make.  A 1,000,000,000 budget gives you a team of 4,000 people for 5 years at 50,000 a year (it will shrink a little after taxes/benfits/social security).  I think you could make a commercial OS with a team/budget like that.  (Even 1,000,000,000 will run out.  I hope games never get that expensive to make.)

<br/>
I disagree with "instant".  It depends on the scope of your game.  It depends on how long you can keep people from getting bored.
<br/>
<br/>
You need content.  Content will not make itself; it takes time to make.  Amazing things take 1000s or 10,000s or 100,000s of hours to make.  Those hours can be paid or free, but either way you are looking at a time budget.  Either way you are looking at people going crazy with dev tools for days, weeks or months depending on the scope of your project.

Schooling is not one of the requirements for flying your own company.  Contacts are good.  You need a lot of business sense, and money helps too.  You can issue shares for money, but you will need to be able to persuade investors to buy them.  I don't know much about LLCs.  (I believe that Bill Gates "dropped out" of university to focus on Microsoft.)

<br/>
Yes.  If they had really wanted animated backgrounds, they could have pulled it off.  It looks like a budget/space issue to me.  Commercial RPGs without animated backgrounds are still being released today.
<br/>
<br/>
Animated backgrounds, like anything animated, need frames to be drawn.  Animation cycles need to be made.  Someone needs to do the lay out.  The encoding will be a little more complicated.  The ROM will be bigger.  All of these things take time and effort.  If they are an option, simple palette animation and scanline animation will be cheaper to implement.  None of these things make an RPG "better" as such, but they will make it "prettier".
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic, if you want drawn animated backgrounds in your homebrew RPG, you are looking at a very long or expensive project.  I don't see this project getting finished if it is a first attempt at a game/RPG.  Feature creep kills projects.  To have a chance at finishing, you'll need to strip features, not submit to feature creep.

This is the hardest part of indie development.  People program, people make stages, people make art, people make music, people like to test beta products.  Connecting all of those people, getting them interested in the same thing, keeping them interested in the same thing... this is very difficult.  Big companies can do it because they throw money at everyone.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are ways, we just need to use our understanding of why it does not work to make it work. You need a glue, a strong coordinator, and the right people to coordinate. If you plan for your people to belong to the group for 3 months then maybe you will notice that having the appropriate documentation, designs and contracts in place and well documented.
<br/>
<br/>
Every team management model is built upon the premise that your team is constant; and very few (if any) account for work not being completed. I posted a link to an article about <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html" target="_blank">worse is better</a>; maybe that is part of the answer. Begin with a small project; when that is completed the goal is to then document it; then the next stage is to build the next version, then document that. Like the waterfall cycle, but note that without a documentation stage nothing can mutate from that state (or something of that nature). It somehow seems like I am saying nothing new.
<br/>
<br/>
There is theory on peoples short term attention in hourly terms, and short term behaviour in the first year of work. Initially there is a probation period where people are trying to see how this new job works with their real life, how this affects their commitments and availability. When you first enter a project you may find that until there is movement there is little commitment, so then when movement occurs you don't have as much time as you pre-empted. Maybe you soon find that the commitment is beyond that which you can maintain; a good coordinator will need to know not just where the project is but where his/her people are in life.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
