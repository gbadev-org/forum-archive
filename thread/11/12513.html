    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have come up with an idea that I think would make for a great rhythm game on the DS (actually, I have a number of elaborate ideas for various rhythm games, but most of them are probably too complex to really be feasible).
<br/>
<br/>
The actual idea is a bit difficult for me to put into words, but I can create a mock-up animation if anyone would actually be interested. It involves tracing a moving line, and is intended to be more smooth/flowing than most rhythm games which have you pressing buttons on each note.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm mainly looking for someone who would be interested in helping to code the majority of the game. I have some programming knowledge myself, and could help code some aspects of the game, but I have little practical experience, so most things would be out of my league. I would be able to create the art assets, and create some song files for the game to run.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone finds this interesting, let me know and as I said, I can make up an animation showing exactly what I have in mind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Like in Eurotunnel, or like the "freeze arrows" in Elite Beat Agents?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess I would say <span style="font-style: italic">kinda</span> like the freeze arrows in EBA, but the lines you trace would move across the screen, and you would simply trace it up/down along a vertical line. But of course not just a solid line throughout the whole song--it would have breaks where you need to let go as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I went ahead and made up a quick demo of it (3 seconds). I just tossed this together in about 15 minutes, but it shows the basic premise of the gameplay.
