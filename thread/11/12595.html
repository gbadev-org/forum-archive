    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am looking for a programmer to help convert a flash game I co-created.
<br/>
<br/>
I would provide the art in whatever format you need in what dimensions that work best for the GBA. while my GBA knowledge is limited , I have done art for a demo once before. you can download it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mindchamber.net/showcase.php?view=148" target="_blank">Here</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I would be willing to compensate, but this is for a game that would be free to download, so it be a modest offer
<br/>
<br/>
You can play the sample  the Flash version of the game <a class="postlink" href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/347399" target="_blank">Here</a>
<br/>
<br/>
you can drop a line at <a href="mailto:mindchamber@mindchamber.net">mindchamber@mindchamber.net</a>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you make it sound like Im trying to be lazy.

first thing, check the offers section, Ive already offered my services before for free,

I thought I would make it even easier by having the artwork already done, and on top of that, this time Im willing to compensate. for a free game and some fun.

The operative word here being "Fun"  so if the programmer wanted to add his own twists to it, and it worked for the game I would be totally down.

you make it sound like all I would be doing is sitting back and watching.
<br/>
<br/>
I will be doing the art conversion, and translating all the frames into an acceptable format, I would be the one refitting all the art, and effects.
<br/>
<br/>
No ones "doing anything" for me. it would be a team effort.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I dont think what Im offering here is so bad, I've made an offer, have put my abilites on the table, and thats it.  you on the other hand,  are taking the effort to tell me you can do it , but wont. Even though you haven't  even shown me any example that even suggests that you  "could"
<br/>
<br/>
so instead of telling me, you're not interested, why not just let the person who is, possibly answer for themselves?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do not mistake my text for an argument. Note that (1) I posted as a suggestion to note that you are offering your skills as an artist and that (2) the people here are more than capable of carrying out such a task. That was in response to (a) my observations on how people respond to posts that appear in that tone, (b) your comments regarding puzzle games, etc and (c) my knowledge of what people are capable of doing or have done.
<br/>
<br/>
As you have already made a post offering your skills you have already made the right step. Hang tight, you may not [immediately] find people willing to start a new project in response to what you have said, however there may be people who have already started such a project or people who are going to start a project of that nature.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was more of a joke than anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
but to be brutally honest Thats all I have really seen in this forum in the 2 or so years I have been visiting aside from the ones you have from the 2004 comp.

I think that has to do with a general lack of level editors (and to some extent, competent and available artists).  Puzzle games are nice because a single programmer can make a decent one.  Once you get into these games that have more levels/etc, you get into doing level editing, which many of us (I know I feel this way) think is BORING.
<br/>
<br/>
If we got a bunch of people coming in posting in the "Help offered" forum saying "hey, I want to help do the tedious work of making levels for your game" we might see more traditional action games.
<br/>
<br/>
That's just my guess....I could be totally wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can see where you are coming from.  all I can  do is offer to help with making the levels, as I did create the levels you see in that Alloy demo.

Do you have any idea how much time it takes to complete something?  A small project will probably come in at about 500 to 1600 combined hours.  100 to 400 hours is only so much time, but it is still a fair amount of time to ask for.  If I asked for a couple hundred hours of your life, would you give it to me just like that?

<br/>
the level doesnt change in layout at all, just that the characters get harder to kill, like some block, and retalitate with combos themselves, while others have projectiles.  theres about 14 different enemies but obviously we can reduce that.
<br/>
<br/>
the the game is very combo driven, if you've played killer instinct then you have an idea how the system works.
<br/>
<br/>
theres only one attack button and continuing a combo is based on hitting the attack button when the enemy is hit.
<br/>
<br/>
A really good example of the combo mechanics would be "Busters Bad Dream" by Treasure for the GBA</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by MindChamber on Sun Mar 04, 2007 3:01 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

No one is asking for something they cant give.  I was simply asking if anyone wanted to create a GBA version of this game, since after all, this is a hobbyist site, and this is the section where you post projects is it not?

seriously. whats the point of this forum if not to see if people are interested in investing time on a joint project?

obviously ANY project that shows some considerable quality is going to take some time, and effort.

Although funny, I do think we (the gbadev forum in general) have become harsher and more negative in the past year or so.  
<br/>
<br/>
Here is somebody with at least a semi-reasonably designed game asking if anyone is interested in helping, and offering modest compensation.  That's worth asking without getting jumped all over.  
<br/>
<br/>
I know I'm not interested, and I doubt anyone else is, but at least it was a reasonable post in the "Help Wanted" section for once.....instead of the standard "hi can you port gears of war to gba for me?  I'll lead the team and provide concept art"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is my proof of concept. A majority of the people who could help you out right now have ongoing projects. People have agreed that I was being honest, so do not confuse what I am saying with negativity. You have completely missed the point of my post.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When someone misunderstands what I am saying and responds to it then others can follow suit and believe those opinions about myself. That is one thing I do not take lightly, so I prefer to correct the incorrect image being presented.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally tend to knock up game engines pretty quick depending on how my insomnia is this time of year; but with it being the end of the financial year, the time of AGM's, supervisions are coming up, reports needing to be filed (by me), funding bodies throwing money away I am pretty busy. Notice [first] that my posts are both informative and helpful to being able to visualize the situation for what it is.
<br/>
<br/>
So again let's not mistake what I am saying as being in opposition. I offered suggestions, you have already taken them (using help offered section); let's both agree to agree!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To be honest I am simply the animator and the designer of the game, im am not the coder. So telling me to get started on the code, after I have posted in the "Help wanted" section" makes no sense to me. this was supposed to be a fun little project, that might have actually gone some where.

I'll create a document then, I simply assumed C++ would be different from Actionscript.

I also wouldnt expect an exact duplication of the flash game, since there are more limitations with the GBA.

are you implying the design document 'assumes' the programming to be done in Actionscript?
<br/>
As far as the 'game mechanics', sure there is the swf, but it is not that easy to see everything that is going on; and with most people here probably not having flash they can't look at the code. Which would help to give an idea about the real mechanics, even if its another language.

It appears that MindChamber may have misinterpreted Tepples comment about not having Macromedia/Adobe Flash to read the .fla source code to mean that it would not be possible for him to understand the Actionscript.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can download a 30 day trial version of Flash if all you want to do is look at the actionscript. Actionscript itself is easy to understand, particularly if you know something like javascript.

It takes a lot of work to find a person who is genuinely interested.  tepples isn't the only person with other priorities.  He may have been genuinely interested, but unable to commit.  Money is generally a good way of getting people to adjust their priorities.  It also lets them know how much those priorities need to be adjusted.  (The <a class="postlink" href="http://forums.awn.com/" target="_blank">AWN forums</a> appear to work the same way.)

Your problem is that you immediately took to the negative of what I was saying and not the positive advice. I would be interested and able to pull this off but this is a very busy time of year as I must put in as many funding applications to fund bodies trying to get rid of their money by April. while filing reports, while dealing with my other projects! Do I really have time to be the only programmer for another project with all of this on my hands. <span style="font-weight: bold">In fact</span> if people hadn't been so preoccupied with the idea that I was grilling someone I wouldn't have felt the need to correct their interpretation of me and been looking. But [as noted later] those who are capable are most likely not interested.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that I said be patient, not give up. Note that I suggested to offer your skills as an artist - you end up with the same outcome. If you offer your skills, someone says they are developing something of that nature, you can then direct it to be just like yours as they are already committing to the project and are likely to be happy to want to make a clone of something else.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead you took the negative. And yes I know programmers capable of doing this, but they wouldn't be interested in doing it for free; and even then since I haven't spoke to them for a while they could be working full time anyway. Most of the good people have been snapped up.
<br/>
<br/>
And would you be willing to share time with a full time student (may I ask), but nevertheless you have taken my advice and information out of context. I was informing you of the reality of what you was asking, and how it appears, and the likelihood of your request.
<br/>
<br/>
Knowing the information (such as those who would be capable of completing this project are most likely doing their own projects, employed full time, studying full time but nonetheless not sitting around in their house with free time) is what I am saying <span style="font-weight: bold">not true</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold">realistic</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold">accurate</span>. Note again that <span style="font-weight: bold">you are still asking for someone to program the game</span>; the status quo has changed with having money to offer.
<br/>
<br/>
As you said you were looking for people generally interested; I am generally interested, but at the moment there is little that I can do for free. I get paid ?20 ($36) an hour for my piano tuitions with little kids, about the same for sitting in the studio doing only what comes natural, plus everything else that I do.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my mistake was being informative; I should have reversed everything I said as a positive suggestion - I only chose not to because I didn't want to be patronizing. Clearly you are too busy taking offence to anything that opposes your idea. <span style="font-weight: bold">So stop protesting me being negative; and look at the information and advice given!!!</span> Be patient, besides someone has shown interest; but note what it took.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact for your information it might be good to know that most people who would have assisted you would have assisted because they had not done a project like this before and simply want to try it out. Fortunately you now have an experienced programmer; so you have a project that will get finished and be a smash ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
And finally I will not respond to anything related to me being negative; my time on that conversation ends here. You can continue to argue it amongst yourself, but that is it for me; you can have the last word I have said all that needs to be said it is your choice to read it and understand it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

this the "help wanted" forum , a place to post jobs and offers.

not a place to vent out your problems.  Posting to tell me you weren't interested, or are too busy doing something else was not only negative, but wasteful.
<br/>
I would love for you to apply to any company, and fill their application with nonsense about how you<span style="font-style: italic"> can't</span> take thier job..

and here you are now, writing me some book.

Maybe my mistake was being informative; I should have reversed everything I said as a positive suggestion - I only chose not to because I didn't want to be patronizing.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
and this isnt patronizing?   For someone who doesnt even have samples connected to their profile. you are incredibly arrogant. 
<br/>
<br/>
 and to be honest, your lecturing was wasted on someone who knows what they are doing, and what they are looking for.
<br/>
I stated this was a for a game that would be free to download, and I stated that the compensation would be a modest offer. (WHich is something that could go professionally,as I would have submitted the demo to my boss)
<br/>
Telling me you make forty bucks an hour after all I stated means you don't like to read as much as you like to type.

And finally I will not respond to anything related to me being negative; my time on that conversation ends here. You can continue to argue it amongst yourself, but that is it for me; you can have the last word I have said all that needs to be said it is your choice to read it and understand it.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Nor do I expect you to, I merely suggesting you take the fla open it and remove the code to text.

I'll simply ask him to move over the text.

thats fine, I believe I still have the original document, But it needs some updating as the final game was tweaked many times over before release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
with the Wii, Ps3. and the DS soon to be browser ready, there will be no point in making a GBA version for this game. Especially since I had planned to give this away for free anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
the money and effort will go towards the second version of this game which will be pitched as an actual XBLA title.
<br/>
<br/>
and to be honest. no one was really as enthuised about this prospect as myself. No on likes to feel as though they are twisting someones arm when someone is willing pay them to work on a hobby they love.
<br/>
<br/>
At least the idea of a second version geared towards XBLA seems to get more people excited.. Im not saying it WILL happen but its exciting to try none the less.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, incase people might be questioning my contacts, I do know a few as I was a secondary animator on the game Alien Hominid, thats on XBLA now. just check the credits.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
good luck to all. with the GBA Homebrews.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
