    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to create a simple video game for a friend.  He's a comic book artist and I want to create a video game with his characters.  I don't want to do anything fancy.  Maybe take a tried and true video game and merely replace the graphics.  Maybe take some kind of side scroller with a spaceship and replace the ship with his character who flies and turn the background to a sky and change the enemy ships to the characters in the book.  
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone who might be able to help?  How much might something like this cost?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What you're looking for is ROM Hacking. This is the wrong place. Try something like <a class="postlink" href="http://jul.rustedlogic.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Cost? Nothing but some time to learn how it's done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think he's not sure whether he'd rather hack a rom, or rather get someone on here to either help him put together a small game, or retrofit their small game with his graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
So yes, one option is to learn to do rom hacking. 
<br/>
<br/>
Are you set on this being a gba/ds game?  Would a pc game be just as useful?  Or flash?  
<br/>
<br/>
Another question:  who would provide the actual graphics of his comic book guys?  It's significant work to get them into a small image that looks good for a game.  Would you be doing the graphic work, or do you need help with that aspect as well?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't want to hack an old game.  I want to create something new that is like an old game for a Gameboy.  I want something that can be downloaded and played on a Gameboy Advance with the flash cards.  
<br/>
<br/>
I can make the graphics.  I'm going to need to learn how to do all of this of course.  I wanted to use this as a learning experience.
<br/>
<br/>
Any takers?  Can I get a quote?  I want to make the game as simple as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

If the big bad guy at the end of the board could be Skullboy that might be pretty damn cool too.  He could send out his robot and monkey to fight G-man.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know how a state machine works?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#147494 - euge04 - Fri Dec 21, 2007 4:28 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No I do not.  I bought a book on C once and got through half of it.  That's the extent of my programming knowledge unfortunately.
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you ask?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#147497 - keldon - Fri Dec 21, 2007 6:11 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, well in short think of it like this. A light bulb has two <span style="font-weight: bold">states</span>, on and off; when it's off the <span style="font-weight: bold">action</span> of pressing the switch changes the state to on. When the light is on, the action of pressing the switch changes the state to off.
<br/>
<br/>
So a simple state machine for that would look like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">enum BULB_STATE
<br/>
{
<br/>
   BULB_ON,
<br/>
   BULB_OFF
<br/>
};
<br/>
<br/>
enum ACTION
<br/>
{
<br/>
   PRESS_SWITCH
<br/>
};
<br/>
<br/>
void handle_state_change ( ACTION action )
<br/>
{
<br/>
   switch (state) // state is defined elsewhere as type BULB_STATE
<br/>
   {
<br/>
   case BULB_ON:
<br/>
      if ( PRESS_SWITCH == action ) state = BULB_OFF;
<br/>
      break;
<br/>
   case BULB_OFF:
<br/>
      if ( PRESS_SWITCH == action ) state = BULB_ON;
<br/>
      break;
<br/>
   }
<br/>
<br/>
}</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Now this is very basic, but that's the whole point of it, you handle the state with the minimal set of properties to ensure you are correctly tracking its state. <span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine" target="_blank">Read on!!</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because he didn't quote which post he answered, so I just assume that he is saying no to knowing about finite state machines :D
