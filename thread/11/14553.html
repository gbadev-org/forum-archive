I can t find it.

MoonShell Licence.txt said that the libmpeg2 and the mplayer is under GPL.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to sell a card with a preinstalled version of MoonShell on it? (Under the terms of GPL) 
<br/>

Heh, that's pretty much every commercial media adapter these days.  If they say it plays video and music, they borrowed moonshell.  Of course, there are a few that made their own media players, but most of them didn't.
<br/>
<br/>
As for DSO, download the source zip file and open the "COPYING" file.  It is the GPL License V3.  Of course, I would request that you contact DragonMinded first, as he has asked nicely that DSO is not abused.  Sure, there is nothing legally he could do about it because he is using the GPL, but we all do like it and if he stops working on it, that wouldn't be cool.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. See my reasoning below. Before reading further, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the license: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_blank">version 3</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/info/GPLv2.html" target="_blank">version 2</a>, and the Free Software Foundation's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html" target="_blank">official GPL FAQ</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">I can t find it.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Look in DSOrganize 3.1 source code package to find a file called COPYING. This is a text file that contains a copy of GPLv3. Then look in arm9/source/boot.cpp to find this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code"> *  DSOrganize is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify     *
<br/>
 *  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by   *
<br/>
 *  the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or      *
<br/>
 *  (at your option) any later version.                                    *</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Are you with me so far?
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">MoonShell Licence.txt said that the libmpeg2 and the mplayer is under GPL.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
MoonShell links to libmad, a program under GPL version 2 or later. From the various .c files in arm9/source/mad:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code"> * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br/>
 * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br/>
 * the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
<br/>
 * (at your option) any later version.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
As of today, any program that links to code licensed under GPL version 2 or later may be distributed only under GPLv2 or GPLv3. Therefore, all of MoonShell is under one of these licenses.
<br/>

<br/>
Yes. But you will need to include the source code for MoonShell and all libraries that it includes, or you will need to make this source code available on, say, CD-R for a nominal fee.
<br/>

Technically, my R4 adapter didn't come with MoonShell on a card. It came with the R4 menu and MoonShell on a mini-CD. Incidentally, it didn't come with the MoonShell source, so per the GPL, that entitles me to a supplementary CD containing the MoonShell source from the R4 people.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Thx for your detailed explainings and your effort. 
<br/>
This is a great help for me. 
<br/>
Lockjaw was a good hint. I wrote to Damian Y. too. Super nice game.
<br/>
<br/>
To Lynx:
<br/>
<br/>
I have contacted DragonMinded by email and tryed to contact one of the MoonShell-Team. We will put all sourcecodes and GPL-Licenses on the card too.
<br/>
<br/>
These guys are doing a great job. 
<br/>
By selling our cards, there work will get more publicity. (hopefully) 
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote an detailed manual to install MoonShell (in german). 
<br/>
<br/>
For most of the newbees and parents who buy a flashcard, it is annoying when they try the card for the first time and nothing happend.
<br/>
They are astonished that they have to download and install software.
<br/>
Then most of the software is not in german lanuage. 
<br/>
<br/>
We want to make the start to the amazing HOMEBREW-WORLD a little easier for beginners.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone of you knows about GNU-soft running on NDS pls let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
My personal favorit is SpidersolitaireDS ( <a href="http://jt0.org" target="_blank">http://jt0.org</a> ). I have contact too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, you could always do what Datel did for the Games N Music card.  They hosted a competition, where they required you to release your game for packaging with the card.  In return, you received goodies.  I think you will find that people are more likely to provide homebrew for you to package if they receive something in return.  A "Good Job" and "More widely available" aren't really incentives to homebrew devers as most don't care what others think.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that most have put a large amount of time into their projects and you are going to make money from your hardware.  The least you could do is compensate them well for their effort if you plan to capitalize on their work.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
