    <h4>#113110 - NAveryW - Sat Dec 23, 2006 5:45 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I like making text adventure games in QuickBASIC, and thought it would be great to make a multiple-choice text adventure for the GBA. However, once I tried learning C, I found it overwhelming and gave up out of stress a couple of hours later (I know, I quit easily.) However, shortly afterward, I found QB2C, which can convert BASIC programs to C. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, since GBA programmers must understand C, which I don't, if I gave you a game that I converted to C to make into a GBA game, would you be able to do it? It would be a fairly simple game, no graphics and probably no sound. It would just be a text adventure game where you make choices by pressing the A, B, X or Y button. 
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, well... is anyone willing to undertake this, and is this a reasonable request to ask someone to undertake?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it would probably work. Please post a small example of the C code so that I can see what kind of libraries I'd need to write to get everything working smoothly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
I think there was a devkit where you had printf functions, so you could just write as if you have a console window (with limitations of course) 
<br/>
If not try to write it yourself the only things really needed are backgrounds and and their scrolling and button inputs which is pretty easy imo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most people who post to this board don't sell copies of their works. There just isn't a recordable GBA cartridge or DS card that's cheap enough to let a homebrew developer make and sell copies.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Not entirely true...the $10 GBA carts are cheap enough that you could sell a game for $15 or $20 (which is reasonable) and still make a small profit.  I've had a few requests to purchase copies of my latest game, which I will provide on these carts.  Of course, if you are referring to selling homebrew games with the goal of making money, then yeah, it's not likely to happen at these margins.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've often thought of making a 'DSLinux kit' (ie Branded Slot-1 card, maybe DSerial2, with branded Slot-2 card), but like you say, you wouldn't be able to offer it at a competitive price when compared to buying any old Slot-1/2.
<br/>
<br/>
Amadeus sort of made an attempt with this with his DSMEM device, but this was made redundant with Slot-2 ram support.  DSMEM support has now been dropped and I don't actually think he made them in any great numbers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if you have the money to invest (which is a lot) and you really wanted to give it a go, you could buy the hardware used for mass producing fakes and burn your own software onto it instead off making illegal copies of commercial games.  
<br/>
<br/>
But, the risk it to high for the potential profit (IMHO).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, I mean they <span style="font-style: italic">are</span> cheap enough.  I made a post in that very same thread about it.  I'm getting mine for less than $10 each.  Although for my game, I'm just charging for the cart plus actual shipping, so I'm not going to make any profit at all.
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, there's no need for us to argue over technicalities or minor details (there's enough of that on this board already).  I think the point is that  we're both in agreement that the prices of hardware are too expensive to make much profit off of selling homebrew games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
