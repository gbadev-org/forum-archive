    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A small company is looking for an AI Programmer to work on a game project for Gameboy Advance. We can't offer a salary yet, as this is a once-it-has-been-released kind of thing. We need DEDICATED people. No apriori knowledge of GBA is required. What *is* requered is an ability to aquire new skills and work as a team because this is an international project.
