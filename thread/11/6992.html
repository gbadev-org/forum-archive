    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have this really great Idea (at least i think) However, i am not a programmer but I am loving the DS and think that some really creative and entertaining games can be made for this system.  I am looking to assemble a team of online developers to work on creating a game for the DS, if all goes well hopefully published and released.

Here is the concept: 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
Working Title: The Restaurant DS</span>
<br/>
Platform: Nintendo DS
<br/>
Genre: Tycoon \ Simulation
<br/>
<br/>
Description: 
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to The Restaruant!  Have you ever wanted to learn how to cook? Or how about create your own signature dishes? Have you ever wanted to manage your own restaurant? From designing the look and feel of your dining room, to purchasing equipment (and using it!), to making your own signature meals.  You are in control of this exciting new game. 
<br/>
<br/>
You will start the game in chef school, learning your way around the kitchen and basic skills for cooking, baking, and how to use the interface via an intuitive tutorial. You will also be given mini-challenges to test your knowledge and skills.  Once you have graduated chef school you will move on to select your city in which you will call your home. Now keep in mind just because you graduated from school doesnt mean you can start your first job at a world famous 5 star restaurant in Las Vegas, you will have to work your way up the ladder. You will find work at a small cafe or fast food restaurant in which you will need to learn speed and accuracy in cooking and baking vs. presentation and desirability. However that will reverse in some occasions as presentation and desirability become more and more important as you move to bigger and better restaurants. Once you have proven yourself through a series of tests and promotions you will then move on by receiving job offers from more upscale and trendy restaurants to eventually owning and running your own.  You can also apply for a position via a job listing board, however be ready to win the challenges that are given to you or you will find yourself in the back of Bob's Diner for quite some time, or until another job offer is presented.
<br/>
<br/>
Each dish that you create in the kitchen could be from one of the hundreds of recipes that are provided in game or one that you created from scratch, you will see the science of things when you experiment in your test kitchen what works, and what doesnt.  What will happens if you mix flour, sugar, salt and vinegar into a salad and then bake it at 375(d) for 20 minutes?! Something you probabaly wouldnt want to eat, however, if you can think it up, you can make it.  Your dishes that you create will be scored on several different areas: Taste, Presentation, Food Safety and Overall Satisfaction.  If your meal scientifically works you can save your recipe to cook at home or share with your family and friends.  
<br/>
<br/>
In the kitchen you will see the meat brown (or burn) before your eyes, you will add ingredients, spices and other garnishments to your meal. Decorate your plate with lettuce, sauces and spices.  Bake your deserts and watch them brown to a golden perfection.  
<br/>
<br/>
Stir, Mix, Shake, Roll, Dice, Pour, Measure and chop all of your ingredients with your stylus!
<br/>
<br/>
Hire / Fire your kitchen staff. Train them by doing player vs. cpu mini games to enhance their speed and efficency.  
<br/>
<br/>
Watch out for the Food Safety Inspector they will make random visits to test your knowledge and inspect your kitchen to ensure your not putting customers in harms way of bacteria and other unsanitary conditions. 
<br/>
<br/>
Dont forget about that dish!!!  Your kitchen could errupt into flames, dont panic, kitchen fires happen all the time, however it will be up to you to put the fire out correctly. (ie. Water wont work to well on a grease fire! But hopefully the knowledge you learned from Chef school will help you to take care of this) If your kitchen burns down, you will have the option to buy insurance and have your kitchen replaced (at a cost to you of course). 
<br/>
<br/>
Get great press by pleasing VIP's from the Movie, Music and Fashion industry!  Or fail a top-rated food critic and your restaurant could be doomed!
