    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking for Programmer &amp;/or Pixel Pusher
<br/>
<br/>
FAQ:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">"What's up with GT? ----&gt;"</span>
<br/>
<br/>
We would like to know who out there is making the coolest GBA games/demos and is interested in working with us.  We have a title that we particularly need help with.  Most people join us because they have established a <span style="font-style: italic">relationship </span>with us and are interested in turning their hobby into a career.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">"relationship? ----&gt;"</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, yea.  We dont hold hands in the park with you or anything.  but just sending us a resume and a salary request is too generic.  When I was 18 I banged on Williams/Bally/Midway's door for a long time, doing demos and helping them out anyway I can.   I landed the job.  Of course I saw the prototype for the first Mortal Kombat before it was released and this was in 1990.  But we expect the same enthusiasm.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">"What's in it for me? ----&gt;"</span>
<br/>
<br/>
If your good enough, and you show enough interest you can join us.  Depending on what we are doing and how much money we are making on that project &amp; what you contributed will determine the finances.  Also, and most importantly, you get a GBA game on the shelves with your name on it.  That is forever your credit and can never be taken away from you.  (its a nice feeling)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">"No, what's really in it for me ?---&gt;"</span>
<br/>
<br/>
cya.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">"Why are you not posting on like, Gamasutra? ---&gt;"</span>
<br/>
<br/>
We placed in the early GBC Bung competitions with IRONHIKE and FRODE.  We came from the dev scene.  straight from the underground.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">"Game Titan ? ---&gt;"</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Literally for years we have been working on GBC and GBA games.  Our work makes it out the door.  We get paid to do what we love.  We will never stop.  period.  
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">"what next ? ---&gt;"</span>
<br/>
<br/>
say hello by sending an email. <a href="mailto:jobs@gametitan.com">jobs@gametitan.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
introduce yourself.  spark our interest with a link to your gba work site. or a link to a demo you have uploaded to gba dev.  Tell us about it. 
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">do not send us bin's unless we request.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Eric Kinkead</span>

<br/>
<br/>
That sounds fun :D
<br/>
<br/>
Is it online conversations only, and could you eventualy "buy" our HB games, tweak them a bit up, and publish them?
<br/>
<br/>
I know that they got to have some quality, of course :)
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, why cant we hold hands in the park?

Where the hell is that in the faq?   Where did I say I dont '*really* pay you.. or whomever you represent. ('us'? who is 'us'? are you speaking for the entire board?  Are you the new GBADEV.ORG rep?)  How would I have run a company from 1999 and not pay anyone?

Who is this group you represent? 'our' ?? I am going to publish your tweaked up HB games ??? [sarcasm] Sure pal, I have 350k sitting here that I would like to risk on manufacturing costs of your awesome HB game after I 'buy' it and 'tweak' it up a bit.  [/sarcasm]

Game Titan is comprised of people that came out of the indie dev scene. I have done my share to let those in the scene who want to go pro, do so.  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/demos.php?year=01&amp;month=06&amp;screens=show" target="_blank">Premandrake</a> came from this board and worked with us on writting our awesome in house tile editor and sprite editor.  I made it possible for <a class="postlink" href="http://www.1000klub.com/Qbert/" target="_blank">Paul Chinn</a> to get his GBC game published. And does this <a class="postlink" href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2002-07-19/screens_feature.html" target="_blank">office</a> sound like no one was payed and I ripped everyone off?  Everyone at my company came from the underground dev scene.  It's almost an unwritten requirement.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You should do your research before you jump to assumptions.
<br/>
If the faq doesnt make sense to you, I think you should read this part...
