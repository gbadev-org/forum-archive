    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I want to make a game, too.
<br/>
<br/>
But I haven't learned enough yet.  I've done some of the work myself, well actually it's just a demo and won't be used.
<br/>
<br/>
I need:
<br/>
(1) Battle engine programmer
<br/>
(2) (Map) Exploring engine programmer
<br/>
(3) 3D graphics designer
<br/>
(4) 3D to 2D graphics scaler
<br/>
(5) 2D Graphics implementer/compressor
<br/>
(6) Music deisgn
<br/>
(7) Sound effects design
<br/>
(8) Music/SFX implementer/timer
<br/>
(9) Input handler designer
<br/>
(10) Character designer
<br/>
(11) Enemy designer
<br/>
(12) Plot designer
<br/>
(13) Item/Weapon designer
<br/>
(14) Spell designer
<br/>
<br/>
10 through 14 need to work closely with the 2D and 3D graphics designers who also need to work with the SFX designers and timers.  The plot designer needs to lay out the ideas first so that everyone else will know where to go with the project.
<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to lend some ideas, but being short handed I can't promise too much.
<br/>
<br/>
So, any 14 skilled programmers, graphics or sound deisgners please send an e-mail to:
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm with Miked0801 on this one.  And to look at it from a more serious perspective, these types of people need to be shown what they're asking of us, and how we feel about it.
<br/>
<br/>
So I may have been a little childish.  But at the same time, children lack the wisdom of how to go about asking for help without asking for someone to do their dirtywork for them.  By this comparison, I name Pirro as this particular child, and I felt this situation needed a more childish approach so as to explain to him (her?  I dunno from the name) in a way he could understand.
<br/>
<br/>
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to call Pirro a child.  I'm not trying to insult him in any way.  But at the same time, it's kinda annoying having these requests made.  Heck, I feel guilty asking for so much help, but at least I <span style="font-style: italic">try</span> to figure things out.  And there are many projects I'd like to do, but do not posess the time, skill, and/or knowledge to do them.  So I don't.
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to re-make one of the Strike games from the Genesis (Jungle Strike, Urban Strike and Desert Strike), or even use the same concept and make a 4th game for the trilogy.  But I haven't figured out isometric views or "mode 7" (I would do the game in one or the other), and I don't have the means to render a helicopter, landscape, people, vehicles, etc.  But you don't see me asking for people to do that for me.  And if I did, I would at least make a fair contribution to a <span style="font-style: italic">joint</span> project.  I wouldn't just say "I want to make this game, but I can't do it.  Can someone else?"  
<br/>
<br/>
And I don't know exactly what Pirro was going to contribute, but it seems like he was saying "Go play the game to get the idea, then turn it into 2D for the GBA."  He didn't mention anything he was going to do, but he did say what he was <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> going to do (programming), and that he didn't have time to learn to program.  So would he have had time to do anything else?  I have found that learning the programming aspect is very time consuming, but so is learning how to write a mod (a GOOD mod), designing graphics, recording SFX, etc.  If you don't have time to program, then you shouldn't be in the programming game asking other people to do the work for you.
<br/>
<br/>
So poslundc, I apologize if I sounded rude, and I won't take any offense.  I know you're just trying to stick up for "the little guys".  Pirro, I apologize to you too.  And I will take back anything I said, and rephrase as such:
<br/>
<br/>
I know it can be hard to figure out how to make an entire game yourself, especially one as big as Harvest Moon 64, and many people would be willing to <span style="font-style: italic">help</span> you on this project, but in the future, it would be more useful if you knew some programing, and/or could design the graphics/sound.  Come back when you have more experience.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pirro: "Try playing HM FoMT and HM 64 emulators and roms" is not a good design document. For one thing, it depends entirely on copyright infringement. For another, it depends entirely on somebody else's subjective interpretation of a game. Try restating what you see in those games in your own words.

mymateo: In meatspace, children sometimes want me to do all the dirty work, and I tell them the following: "Give a man a fish, and he eats for a day. But teach a man how to fish, and what happens?"
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make a helicopter game, and you don't know how to make an isometric view, then draw the ground with a plain old orthographic map drawn to <span style="font-style: italic">look</span> isometric (as in Starcraft's maps), and use sprites for the buildings. You don't need to model the buildings and units in 3D if you're not so good at blender; you can go for a more hand-drawn look.

<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I think you have the saying wrong...
<br/>
<br/>
"Give  man a fih, and he eats for a day.  Teach a man how to use the internet, and he won't bother you for months." or something like that :)
<br/>
<br/>
But a quick question totally off topic (not that we've really been on topic) regarding isometric.
<br/>
<br/>
I imagine you could use a rotational background and skew the view.  Am I correct?
<br/>
<br/>
Question two, if I am correct about question one.  I would have to design the tiles pre-skewed in the opposite direction so when they're skewed again, they will be aesthetically correct?
<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.  Pleased if you could confirm!  (But if I'm wrong, don't ruin the fun of finding out how to do it!  It's on my list, along with a dozen other things I want to learn)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But google was of no help there.  So Google is a good idea, and a great search engine, but sometimes it's just not as easy as that.  Often, finding the specific thing you want can take forever, if at all.  
<br/>
<br/>
And it's not like I was asking for a handout, just a "Yes, you're on the right track" or "No, you're a little off" or "No, you're going in totally the wrong direction".  Like I've said before, I like to figure things out and learn for myself, but a little help and guideance is very helpful.

But google was of no help there.  So Google is a good idea, and a great search engine, but sometimes it's just not as easy as that.  Often, finding the specific thing you want can take forever, if at all.  
<br/>
<br/>
And it's not like I was asking for a handout, just a "Yes, you're on the right track" or "No, you're a little off" or "No, you're going in totally the wrong direction".  Like I've said before, I like to figure things out and learn for myself, but a little help and guideance is very helpful.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wasn't planning on rotating the layer, just skewing it.
<br/>
<br/>
By changing the registers
<br/>
<br/>
REG_BGxPA
<br/>
REG_BGxPB
<br/>
REG_BGxPC
<br/>
REG_BGxPD
<br/>
<br/>
you can skew the frame (I think it's the B and C values, but I haven't played with it enough yet).  You don't necessarily need to rotate the entire layer.
<br/>
<br/>
Please, correct me if I'm wrong!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So if you say that a plain text BG is <span style="font-style: italic">easier</span> to do iso view than skewing a rot BG, I then have somewhere to go with it.

It's possible to make a pseudo-isometric engine, where the world looks isometric but is actually straight 2D. Starcraft exemplifies this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you might be better off making a smaller game first. When I started out I wanted to always make the best game out there. It's not possible at first.  I'd suggest try to learn how to program breakout or tetris and then make some cool game on your own. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know I am still not capable as a programmer to create massive games which will sell for millions however I write down and plan every single game idea I have on paper. I suggest you do that too while you learn how to program.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's true in many cases. However if someone was to create a prototype with the entire game fleshed out (minus the programming and the majority of graphics) and then apply for a job indicating that you could bring a great game with you and that you can't do it by yourself they might consider it. I know it is a long shot for someone with no experience in the actual industry but if that doesn't work, you could show the demo to get yourself the job and once you move up in the workplace you can possibly pitch your game to them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

wasn't GP3 / 2 mostly Geoff Grammond's work; apart from the art
<br/>
<br/>
it was only GP4 where it became a team project
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't say it's impossible for a good game to come out from one person; but few people posess all abilities required so unless you do it would not be possible. If you want to be that involved you would have to take an executive producer / producer's role; that way you can involve youself with code a little, and direct the art team.
<br/>
<br/>
But on your own stick to small implementations of your big ideas; for example it's unlikely you could design 250 monsters for your pokemon style game (although I do know a guy who can do this in a few days) so stick to a few of them to flesh out your ideas etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
