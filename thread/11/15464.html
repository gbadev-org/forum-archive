im here to recruit anyone that is able to create quake engine if anyone can make a quake engine that uses .wad files instead of .pak file then pm me and we will talk  please check my doom3 ds vid

Anyway, your best bet of getting Doom 3 on the DS is to probably use simon's excellent QuakeDS port and using a Doom3 .pak for quake, if one exists.  I think that video is just doing similar with DoomDS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
NOTE: it takes so long, because they are making their own engine and tools... your post reads like you want someone to program you a quake style game engine just like that! come on! that's not a task for a weekend or two! btw: D3DS emerged from the never completed / released fan made doom (64 style) ds project (don't confuse it with ds doom!)
<br/>
<br/>
you better not continue what you started on youtube: asking others to code the hard stuff for you. replacing graphics is easy, programming is not. that's not cool.
<br/>
<br/>
all in all, that makes me a sad panda.
<br/>
<br/>
btw: there are .pak editors for q1 &amp; q2... for free. you could always try to port one of the "advanced" doom engine ports... or read the code of q and code your own .pak support...
<br/>
<br/>
ps: punctuation is cool.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: to get this clear, i don't want to pick at you. you just have to realize what you are doing is not goint to be accepted by (i assume) anyone. that's what i want to tell you: wake up! you're daydreaming. try to start *working* instead of searching some fool that will do the hard work for you (anyone knowing *how* hard it is will not join you). trying to do things on your own will bring you more in live. although, that is just an advise you may follow or not.
<br/>
<br/>
... and stop stealing project names, when you clearly are aware of the (by far older) project! again, not cool. rename it to something like DooM 3 (Weapons) Mod for DS DooM or something.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by silent_code on Wed Apr 30, 2008 11:17 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

I'd normally give some kind of sarcastic and mildly-funny answer here but for once I'm not going to bother. That doesn't really get us anywhere!
<br/>
<br/>
So, some questions:
<br/>
- why are you so desparate that it'll load wad files? You know that wad is just a container for game assets (in the context you're talking about) such as textures, right? Pak is just a container format too, it's just that it's relavent to Quake here. It's the assets you should be interested in, not the file type.
<br/>
- do you already have a wad file (made by someone else) that you just want to play "in a 3D game" or something? ie you can load it in Doom, but it's just a bit too 2D for you?
<br/>
- why do you not want to do the work yourself? That's where the fun comes from, y'know? Making your own stuff is great, and getting recognition for it is just awesome!
<br/>
<br/>
So I ain't gonna write any code for you, and I won't help you make any game mods (as I honestly don't know how to), but if you do make a mod/TC for Quake (on the PC) but it refuses to run on the DS (assuming you've read the instructions on how to load mods) then I'll try my best to help you out. How's that?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: and to reiterate the other guys here, punctuation is definately cool. And please learn how to use your/you're properly!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

it's still being developed, but the guys don't like to act noobish and post a video of every like of code they write... ;^D

the page, that offered them space for the site closed down, so since then there was no project page.
<br/>
<br/>
well, the project shifted from a doom 64 style to a doom 3 style game and proprietary engine and tools are being developed,  so this takes time. also note, that they are just a team of two (programmer and artist) guys who also, like most of us, have a real life, too. :^) the posts on youtube have a bit of information on it. look for "doom 3 ds"... which brings me to the next topic:

knowing about it isn't equal to accepting it. i guess given that they are in their mid 20s, they don't bother much about you. and clearly you pissed them off a bit by asking if the already busy programmer could write you an engine "just like that" as that is *obviously* no big deal! every school programming class kid has to write a game engine, right?

dude, you first have to learn basic programming before you learn how to edit such most excellent and complex games like quake or doom, dude!

editing and creating "source codes" is also known as "programming"! excellent!

but before you get to start coding, you first need to get your grammar right, because an excellent compiler will allways shout at you (most understanably), if you keep *not* putting those semi-colons (;) at the end of the lines and some excellent commas (,) between commands!

i mean, dude, those are basic language elements in any language (when ; is a full stop, dude), yet you don't what to get them right, dude! how confused is that, dude? wow, dude! most confused, dude!

dude, get some excellent book on programming and try to educate yourself or forget about it, dude! and yes, you won't be taken seriously as long as you try to be haxor by not using those aforementioned excellent language basics, man! "." and "," totally rule, dude! yeah!

yes, you are right. but we all agree we are talking about quake ds here and as *most* of us know what they are talking about, this implies the use of c. :^D

i hope for him that i'm wrong, but honestly i think he really doesn't want to learn, but to impress people. he obviously doesn't give a tihs about informing himself, what is shown by this use of words and the fact, that the ignores just every advise or constructive criticism posted in this thread!
<br/>
he doesn't want to learn, he want's to copy and paste and then tell everybody "i did it" (maybe even add "by my self").
<br/>
<br/>
that's crap. i'm not helping anyone *that* ignorant! i mean, did you see he just reacts to simon? is it because simon ported "the quake bros."?
<br/>
<br/>
well, if he wasn't that ignorant, he would already be learning basic programming in c/c++ (i would have given him all the info right away, if he had asked - in a read-  and understandable form!). you most certainly know what i am talking about, don't you? ;^D

<br/>
<br/>
(sniper) 109... I hardly know what to say to that last post... people have been giving you advice this whole time, but guess what: you have to follow the most basic advice before getting on to the more advanced bits, I should know. They have been giving you the only advice you are ready for, which was simply put oh so many times; "learn basic C++ then come back." You were so busy confusing yourself and everyone else on this thread that you missed it completely. Not their fault. I seriously try not to get ranty on forums, but honestly kid, if I had a dollar for every bit of advice you missed on this thread, I would be rich.
<br/>
<br/>
ps: contrary to what you may think, people aren't here to be jerks. A lot of people here are very helpful, and all you need to do is ask nicely without pissing everyone off with rude comments to the people trying to help. If you look around, you will see that people like tepples and silent_code are *actually* trying to help. And if you only *really* want to speak with one person, then pm them instead of ignoring the rest of the people attempting to reason with you. Now I will sit back and watch this post go in and out of your brain, then go insane trying to explain it to you afterwards... why do I let myself be sucked into these things? 
<br/>
<br/>
(also, the sam's series of C++ books is really helpful, I know, as I also still have a long way to go on my road to real programming. The difference is, I admit it and accept help.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, straight into your face. you need:
<br/>
<br/>
1) a brain
<br/>
2) a pc / mac
<br/>
3) an OS
<br/>
4) some form of energy to power the hardware
<br/>
5) some text editor (like porgrammers notepad, notepad, vi, whatever)
<br/>
6) source code (no "s"!)
<br/>
<br/>
then you can edit source code. was that clear enough? waht's next? maybe you also want to know how to "*compile* souce code" to make an executable? i don't know!
<br/>
<br/>
what you actually lack the most is the ability to ASK! AND GET YOUR DAMN SPELLING RIGHT, KID! this can't be repeated often enough, can it?
<br/>
i mean, i'm neither a native speaker, nor am i living in an english speaking country (never have been - in fact i don't even live in my home country), but still my posts are at least a KAZILION times more read- and understandable than yours!
<br/>
<br/>
also, i think you didn't get the whole concept of asking for help at all! just like tepples wrote, nobody with the skill to do it, will help you if you keep asking like that and treating people that way.
<br/>
<br/>
do something about it or delete your account right away, because you already scared away those people who were willing to give you ANY sort of advise. the sole reason i am still posting here is to HELP you getting help! still you treat my like poop. NOT GOOD!
<br/>
<br/>
SO:
<br/>
<br/>
1) get your spelling and wording right! at least to a "normal" readability level (as you might have noticed, i don't use capitals where they should be. i don't think it hurst much, as it is about the only thing i omit.)
<br/>
<br/>
2) repost your request by editing the original post (and make a note that you did) or create a new thread with a clean and polite request for a fellow coder for a DS doom mod with doom 3 contents (or what ever, just don't call it doom3ds, that might spawn negative opinion on the *actual* doom3ds project - anything else would be selfish and ignorant - what would mean "bye, bye help!" for you [i'm not just talking about myself here!])
<br/>
<br/>
3) try to learn simple things first before attempting such hard tasks! try to find a coder (programmer) for a small platformer game. that means, if you really don't want to learn programming.
<br/>
well, if you find someone, you'll be making artwork and content in general, i assume.
<br/>
what ever you do, start small and try to finish what you started.
<br/>
maybe then, you can start to think about going into the DooM modding direction.
<br/>
<br/>
i hope that helps. again, i'm not being offensive (at least i honestly try not to be), but in fact i'm trying to help you here!
<br/>
<br/>
greetings @ all.
<br/>
<br/>
ps: am i right, that what you said about the D3 style PDA "nearly working" is an outright lie? if that's rigth and you confess it here, there might be hope for you. i just can't imagine how you can get such a thing "nearly working" without the knowledge of how to edit source code. (????)

i can't think of anyone willing to read any of your post anymore. they might cause eye and brain damage. not funny, if you know how being blind is like (i know!)
<br/>
<br/>
minimum "effort" (this word is *overkill* in this context!) on your side will benefit you a lot. you sure know how to place full stops (.), don't you?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT (this reduces double posts - yes, that was a *hint*):
<br/>
<br/>
yes, it is important to read the whole post when it's an answer to something you asked...
<br/>
so, technically you just said you will give the project up, as obviously nobody will do all the work for you (this isn't an offense, it's simply the truth!)
<br/>
<br/>
i know other people of your character type and i totally can imagine how you "feel". you know your flaws (noone is flawless), so try to improve yourself. those issues could possibly be the root of some problems and sadness in your later life (think of relationships), so try to fix yourself in time.
<br/>
try to become more patient, look for self motivation and give all you can to achieve your goals and dreams. live in the now and *do* things for the future and don't spend all your time int the "now" by imagining the future, yet not doing anthing to progress in time.
<br/>
also, try to be helpful and to make people you care about happy. it's all about wanting things and giving your best when doing them. sometimes you'll fail, but "you can get it, if you really want" (in time).
<br/>
<br/>

@sniper: I think that last message of yours was the most legible one you've done so far - really. Well done!

I think you need to learn how to do pak editting. Although I don't know how to do this (as I told you via youtube) it can't be rocket science so persevere and find out why you had problems doing it before. There have to be hundreds of tutorials on this online, so I doubt it will take you too long.

you totally read my mind... "Oh dear." kid gone berzerk.
<br/>
all this fancy new tech makes it easy to start things (which will fail) in the believe someone can do more than that person actually "can" do (tihs).
<br/>
<br/>
my approach is: code first, advertise in the end. i guess that's also the way the DooM3DS folks go, by not releasing videos and demos of every little test to generate hype, like some of those youtube posters demand. ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
there's a nice analogy with musicians. i seem to see that all newcomer (underground) bands have one thing in common: they are all good at posing on photos! even before the first rehersal, the internet is full of cool band pics and bios and blogs and whatnot!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dude, you gotta stay on one topic. Every time we get into your absolute and total lack of program ming knowledge (yes, I did just make fun of you saying would int rather than "wouldn't" or "would not".) you change the subject. This is half the reason you are making it so hard to help. We are talk ing about a port, not a mod. There is a big difference. A mod is what I did to my halo 2 maps back in the day, a port is what simon did. Guess which one requires lots of programming knowledge. Yeah, I bet you can guess why I modded Halo 2 rather than ported it, huh. I found it easier to download a program that would allow me to edit select traits rather than the whole thing. Just think about this.
