<br/>
<br/>
I know people usually run software first and read the readme later, but if you read first, play NesSensitiveDS.nds/.ds.gba before making your own levels, this will show you 2 example levels to give you an idea of what the tiles do. (press B to teleport on a 'T' tile).
<br/>
<br/>
The level editor will create 2 files per level, one in the /files dir, to be used by the rom, the other in /data to be used by me to compile the levels for the final release.
<br/>
<br/>
I have released this level editor because i feel that anyone should be able to add to this game. The first 90 [good] levels I receive will be compiled to the game rom, the rest will be added to a selection on my website, so that they can be added by the user.
<br/>
The end game will have 100 levels in puzzle mode (the ones im asking for help with).
<br/>
approx, 70 levels in challenge mode (mostly finished), plus up to 999 custom levels added by the end player.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently the game is unfinished, but it is playable enough to test any levels created. To do this, simply create your level in the level editor, save it (do this step as many times as you like), then click 'build'.This will join you levels to the rom under the new name of NewSensitivDS.nds and NewSensitivDS.ds.gba. these should both now have you levels under 'challenge mode' so you can try them.
<br/>
<br/>
If you create some levels that you want to share, please copy the contents from files/levelxxx.txt to the guestbook at http:www.freewebs.com/sensitiveds, if you would like your level added the the final game, you must also submit the contents of data/levelxxx.txt if you dont, then i will have extra work to do (decoding the level data).
<br/>
Please do not submit the data to the forum you read about SensitiveDS, there is a chance I don't go there, so will not be able to add your level.
<br/>
<br/>
If by the time you have found this game there are already some levels submitted, you can download them from <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/sensitiveds" target="_blank">http://www.freewebs.com/sensitiveds</a> and place them in the 'files' folder, then run PAFS.bat to build the rom.
<br/>
<br/>
_limitations_
<br/>
For some reasom, the level editor will not detect levels already saved, so every time you run
<br/>
the level editor, it will start with level001.txt and overwrite anything in its way. If you 
<br/>
wish to keep your levels, back them up somewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
The level editor can not load levels, so every level must be started from scratch every time. 
<br/>
This will be fixed in a later release.
<br/>
<br/>
Youu ca only use SensitiveDS with a flash cart, or emulator, for now there is no FAT support and it will not run from gbamp andsimilar.
<br/>
<br/>
SensitiveDS has plenty of features missing abd bugs, it isn't finished yet, and it will be a while before it is.
<br/>
<br/>
Thankyou.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
