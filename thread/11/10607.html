    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is the middle of World War 3 and all countries are fighting alone. No one is safe now that nuclear power i being used. In this epic battle with an overhead 3-d view, you control the troops(tanks, soldiers, and more) with you own commander voice. The troops will respond to various commands involving movement, placement of bombs, and stategy. If needed, you can use the touchscreen to change the view or to also control the game. When you win the war, you think everything is over and youreturn home to your family. But 3 years later, there are asassins looking for revenge on YOU. You have to get away and you have to race in a car through traffic, fly a plane over uncharted waters, and control a submerine to the depths of the sea in order to preserve your life, but more importantly you family's life. You have choices to make. They might lead you to peace....or destruction. It is up to you to decide....<br/>_________________<br/>Homebrewer! Programmer! Graphic designer!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So what do you think? I need lots of help with this because I want it to be interactive and the best game so far released. I'll work on the basics for now along with my studies in C++, but eventually I will need a team of developers. I will need help in programming, graphics, sound, storyline, and more. If you have any ideas, please post them here or PM me. Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Homebrewer! Programmer! Graphic designer!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds like you have two games, which can be developed separately. The first is a war-sim; did you plan on turn-based or real-time?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
