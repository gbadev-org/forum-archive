Hi Fireslash. You are probably right - the site was new that week and we hadn't done much to get the copy checked through completely. All I have to say is: 
<br/>
<br/>
i) Thanks for pointing it out.
<br/>
ii) Point out any remaining typo errors for us and we'll get them amended.
<br/>
<br/>
;)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW all the rest of you... Even though Fireslash did not respond to our offer - please don't be put off yourselves. It is a genuine call for skilled, enthusiastic programmers who want to get paid for doing what they love to do!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Shared code base (Subversion or coder's own tool of choice). Most effective methods of collaboration and communication to be defined by both coders and myself at project start. By the way, Asylum requires both these aspects of working together to be practical, effective and well maintained throughout the span of the project.
<br/>
<br/>
Does that answer your question sufficiently? Let me know if you want further info.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would the UK <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sfep.org.uk/" target="_blank">Society for Editors and Proofreaders</a> be of any use?
