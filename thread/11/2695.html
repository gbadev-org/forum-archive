    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all - I am a programmer/artist with a 4-year degree, I just moved to Austin, TX and I am looking for someone with a little free time who wants to make a GBA game.  The game and engine code would be oriented toward a more-or-less Flashback-style game, though the engine code would be simple/low-level enough that it should be able to be used for pretty much any style of 2D game (not raycasting, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
DISCLAIMER:
<br/>
This is not a get-rich-quick scheme, or a "OMG GREAT GAME IDEA" thread. I do not know any publishers, I do not have any "connections" or know any "people." The point of this project isn't to make a blockbuster game (at least at first), just to make some technology that is useful - a GBA game engine, and some tools to work with the game content; also, to LEARN. From my experience with game design and GBA coding I think it's not too large an undertaking - maybe a few months of free time, tops.
<br/>
<br/>
Legally it'd be a gentleman's agreement, so you can take all the code we make and do whatever the hell you want with it. Sell it, whatever - I don't really care. This is a large enough project that I would really like a second person to work with me on it, and if you fit the following description it would probably be a good experience for you too!
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for:
<br/>
1 - Some experience with GBA coding (enough to know basically how the hardware works, so that you're not intimidated about jumping into the engine code.  You don't need to know ARM or anything, tho that'd certainly be nice!).
<br/>
2 - Some experience with pixel art. You don't have to be an absolute pixel wizard (lord knows i'm not) but being familiar with the art side of things and being able to help out with it is a must.
<br/>
3 - Chill personality. I'm a laid back guy (for the most part), and I work best with people who speak out when they need to but are open to change as well. You don't have to be Fonzee (sp?) from Happy Days, and all programmers have a bit of Type-A in them, but if you're an absolute maniac this probably won't work out...
<br/>
4 - Local!  It'd help a LOT if you were from near or around Austin. I'm tired of long distance projects. I have a second PC on which the GBA dev environment can be setup, so we can basically have code jam sessions once or twice a week for the first couple months, until we get something pretty cool up and running.  If you have a laptop you could bring that over too.  We can work something out.
<br/>
5 - MUST LOVE VIDEO GAMES. You don't have to be a career gamer or anything, but you gotta love em!
<br/>

<br/>
There are GBA programs and complete non-GBA games and also some random pixel art on there.

ADDENDUM: I have character sketches, outlines of the engine components, and a description of an image conversion tool all done and sittin' on my desk.  I just need someone who can help share the burden of getting through the code!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bombshelter.ghostopsmod.com/" target="_blank">Resume And Portfolio</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
