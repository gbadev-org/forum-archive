    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I'm looking for is this.  The game is a GBA port of an old arcade game which is supported by MAME.  I need someone to catalog (put down into a textual format) and 'capture', 'dump' or otherwise obtain all the sound effects in the game into wav files. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have used a 'jukebox' program to capture the soundtracks and know that some of the sound effects are obtainable via the same mechanism, however I don't believe all will be obtainable in this manner.  For any sounds that cannot simply be dumped using a jukebox or other MAME tricks you would have to compose (using whatever you like) the effect and render it out into a wav file.
<br/>
<br/>
This project is not necessarilly limited to audio folks.  A clever prorammer may be able to dump the adpcm roms out into a workable form or may be able to modfiy MAME or other suitable emulator to help with the task.

This is a paying gig (not huge sums, but not $100 dollars either), sanctioned by the copyright holder.  Ask any questions is this thread, but no discussion of the specific game name or money in public please.  I'd like to gage the interest here and then specifics could be discussed in private communications.

I know I don't have much of a presence on this board but I'm a verteran game programmer in and out of the business since 1983 (yeah, I'm that old) most of my work was on early consoles (anybody remember the 2600?), spent the 90s in the arcade business, a did a couple of PC games (to embarrassed to say which) after that.  Now I'm helping out on a GBA title and looking for some help with the audio.
