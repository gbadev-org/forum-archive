<span style="font-weight: bold">No one wants to waste their time researching and making a toy for you to play with. Most people on this board are only interested in either serious job offers or serious collaborations.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
You are not making a serious job offer unless you can afford to pay your programmers a real salary (as in money, not your pirated video games).
<br/>
<br/>
You are not looking to collaborate because a. you only want to hack someone else's game, and b. you don't actually <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Come up with a serious proposal for a serious project, and then either make sure you've got the skills and commitment to do at least half of the work involved, or be prepared to pay a real programmer's salary (think in the $15/hour to $30/hour range).
