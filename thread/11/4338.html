    <h4>#28723 - sthebig - Fri Nov 05, 2004 1:55 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I was wondering if someone here could create an alarm clock that I could put on my shiny flash card with RTC. basically, I want a program that I can set with the time, have it keep the time with the RTC feature of my flash cart, then be able to set an alarm that would make a beeping noise or something at the specified time. I would also like if this clock could put my gba into sleep mode to conserve my battery life.
<br/>
If anyone is willing to help me out, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:sthebig@gmail.com">sthebig@gmail.com</a>, or reply to this post
<br/>
<br/>
O, if there is already said program or something similar to it, then please tell me about it!
<br/>
thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So kind of like a real life alarm clock? 
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately after the GBA is in sleep mode, it can only be woken up by either an Key, Cartridge or SIO interrupt. Needless to say, all GBA devices such as sound, LCD, etc are stopped. The CPU is semi-stopped. The only thing the CPU then does it wait for the "wake up" signal and therefore no clock wake up code can be run at the same time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well if I knew what type of RTC chip they used I might be able to tell you :)
