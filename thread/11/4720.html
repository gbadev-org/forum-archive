    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought this section would be the one to put this in. I had an idea to get GBA's and GB sp's on the net for multiplable games. Like the pokemon seires or racing games. Im not talking about DS wireless but a modified link cable to hook to a computer and through a gaming software/ chat deal (think MSZONE)  you could get those games connected. then with that achitechure the same software could be used with the New DS.

Please do not dismiss this idea so quickly,  Please check out the site I created for this idea

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given that GBA games expect sub-millisecond latency, and my ping to Google.com over Comcast High-Speed Internet is at least 30 milliseconds, I don't think tunneling GBA multiplayer would work that well. It may turn out to be easier to tunnel Nintendo DS games, as they already run over Ethernet. But then I couldn't figure out how you meant the "Software on both computers" to work because I couldn't find the link to "(See Software Explanation)".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could probably make this work with homebrew games that are programmed specifically to work with slower traffic... Especially turn-based games that aren't as affected by latency problems.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be a fascinating technology project to try and implement. I'm kinda surprised that some publisher hasn't tried to do pitch this to Nintendo (though maybe they have). There are franchises like Pokemon that would probably support a fanbase large enough to make an online playing/trading market a good idea.

I wonder if Nintendo didn't pursue the development of this kind of connectivity in order to discourage piracy and hacking.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">THe software idea is basicly the design in my head. not much functionality but mostly design. I had no idea about the latency issue. I didnt think it would of been a problem. Maybe this idea wont work but with the DS I beleave it would but I am holding out till March to think of anything new. Apperently March is going to be a big month for Nintendo. THanks for all the info guys :)<br/>_________________<br/>Connect your GBA accross the internet Idea.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On a weird, related note, I was in radio shack a few months back, and they had a "gameboy kit" of some kind, with a pouch and a link cable and stuff. I could *swear* that I saw a sticker on it that said something about "download games via the internet!".... and I of course was too stupid to write down the name of the company.
<br/>
<br/>
I just told myself... "Oh, neat. I'll go look that up on the web." But then I spaced it and now I can't track it down.
<br/>
<br/>
Does this ring a bell for anyone? If it exists I'm sure it's not licensed.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know the name of the specific product either, but from what I can tell the product had equivalent functionality to the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lik-sang.com/info.php?category=6&amp;products_id=1415" target="_blank">MBV2 cable, which you can buy at lik-sang.com</a>, or the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gba-xboo.htm" target="_blank">Xboo cable, which you can build</a>. The way it works is you download multiboot games such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#tod" target="_blank">TOD</a> from the Internet, transfer them to your GBA's RAM, and play them.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
