    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello
<br/>
<br/>
As i can't get a mode7 + 3d sprite working, i need someone to help me.
<br/>
I will give you $200 (through PayPal) if you can do it in the next two days.
<br/>
<br/>
What i need is a very simple program (everything must be in one .c file!)
<br/>
The program just need to do:
<br/>
<br/>
* rendering ground (using mode 2)
<br/>
* rendering one 3d sprite located anywhere
<br/>
* CameraGoForward/Backward
<br/>
* CameraTurnLeft/Right
<br/>
<br/>
and that's all
<br/>
<br/>
I need very simple, no trick, no special optimizations (because we will recode real clean code around it)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks
<br/>
<br/>
Note: if i ask that on this forum, it's because i'm very in trouble, and i have no others solutions... thanks for your comprehension</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by mksoft_ on Mon Feb 14, 2005 3:16 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Hope you didn't work too much, because we will not use it, and anyway, as we

must use nintendo libs, we would not be able to use it if we wanted...</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

"Must use Nintendo libraries"? Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
<br/>
<br/>
Gaining the experience and helping the community are still worth it to me. Here is my entry:
