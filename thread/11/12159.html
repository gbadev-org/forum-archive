    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.
<br/>
I am a licensed Graphic Designer, with several non-profit projects done for open-source and free personal projects, mostly in the real of UI or GUI development.
<br/>
Since I purchased my DSL, one of the features I anticipated the most was the possibilities for a good eBook Reader program, I have searched &amp; tried every program out there, and while there are a few working solutions, mainly DSOrganize &amp; Moonshell, none of them are particulary geared towards this end, but rather general text reading.
<br/>
<br/>
After several forays into DS UI development concepts, proposals for a few collaborations and projects, I was sparked to actually do Interface development for an eBook Reader by a post in Moonbooks project blog, this quickly led me to the project with the current working name of FLIP. A full featured eBook Reader, with an advanced Interface, &amp; great care on what it should do best, read and manage eBooks.

<br/>
<br/>
The Interface is still in the early stages of development, but there are already plenty of working material and concepts ready to be guided to actually working proposals with serious backend requirements in mind.
<br/>
There are no real visual niceties yet because I am developing with the lowest amount of graphical memory footprint in mind, to leave precious ram to where it is more needed. I they can be done later, they will be implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">This takes me to the real question, is any developer or team interested in making this project a reality?... a true ebook workhorse, with particular attention to detail &amp; legibility in mind. With a streamlined interface geared for intuitive and easy control, but expansive enough for detailed &amp; powerful work.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I have nothing to offer in return for anyone that may seek it, other than offer my skills as a graphic designer for other personal projects. I have nothing to gain from this, other than a wonderfull program for myself and the community &amp; the friendship &amp; companionship that evolves from collaboration projects.

<br/>
What do you see yourself able to help with, especially considering all the info so far on the PDF.
<br/>
As i have stated, I is being developed with a low graphical footprint in mind, to leave more headroom for loading large books, and dysplaying beatiful rendered and formatted text, after this has been conceptualized (codewise) &amp; implemented, the UI can be reanalyzed for graphical appeal, taking in mind the resources needed for the improvement, and only it it does not affect the main features adversely!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well as a quite big opensource community it should be possible.
<br/>
I mean GPF has ported sdl lib. It includes font loading routines. Could be first step to grap source and take what you need :D ( i dont know licences stuff)
<br/>
<br/>
Well if there are opensource readers for pdfs or good documentations a team with 2-3 coders and you as artist should be enough. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well i dont have much time but i could help to get graphic stuff working and some gui parts.
<br/>
<br/>
So lets just say i am interessted, too. 
<br/>
But we need more ppl on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What a nice design!
<br/>
I'm also interested as a programmer. I'm currently working on a platform library(almost finished) and 2D/3D library that includes a GUI library(that require a few months more work).
<br/>
Both libraries are cross-platform and work on Windows, Linux, DS and probably more platforms.
<br/>
<br/>
Tech stuff:
<br/>
The first one is called "COW" and does things like streaming, RTTI, serialization, containers. It can serialize objects to and from XML with an adapted TinyXML implementation.
<br/>
The second one is called "AlterNova" and has a GUI library in progress, texture management and more.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the second library isn't mature enough(or might not meet the specs of the program), but the COW library might certainly be of interest to you. I wouldn't mind making extra features for it, for the project :)
<br/>
<br/>
My MSN is kenvh [at] hotmail [dot] com
<br/>
<br/>
I have hobby experience with the things mentioned above and professional experience with in-game HUD programming.

Well, it is being built that way, but it depends on the development! We are building a rendering engine to be able to take advantage of today's complex font formats, mainly TrueType and Opentype, possibly more. So it should support anything that the font format actually supports. Type encoding is a feature that has not been fully researched so at this point there are no guarantees on what will be implemented in that field.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing rests assured though, it will be unlike any reader program currently out there! Just how! hmmm that you'll have to wait and see :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We're developping some things before creating the application framework. I'm currently finishing off a few projects which will be merged into Flip when that's done. The other members are working on things like Wifi and other more hardware-related programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Things that I'm working on at the moment:
<br/>
- COW: the system-independant platform library
<br/>
- AlterNova: graphics framework
<br/>
- TINA: system-independant GUI library
<br/>
You can find more info and source code for these projects on <a href="http://home.lifeisdigital.net/" target="_blank">http://home.lifeisdigital.net/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
COW is 90% finished for usage with this project. AlterNova is at about 90% too and TINA is at about 50%.
<br/>
<br/>
The GUI library will have pretty advanced skinning support through XML and the application will ?lso compile on Linux and Windows for debugging and testnig, because that's a lot easier/faster than the DS. On those PC operating systems, one window will be created that holds the 2 (virtual) DS screens. We will probably not only use that as debugging/development application, but we might publish this as a demo for people without a DS cartridge.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been busy with the GUI library, which I need to finish first before we can continue. I've created the template system and I can already load images, text and buttons from XML, together with their templates.
