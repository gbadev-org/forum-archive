<br/>
<br/>
we are looking for talented people... of course and for free... of course ! Well, all we do is for fun and for the love of old school games. So no money is involved, but you will be credited and integrate this amateur team, this is obvious !
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, as our new website is up (http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=2878), but we first need a striking logo for our team and also for our Ximox C/C++ library.
<br/>
<br/>
As we are really short on time (we have professional activities and families to spend time with), a webmaster would be very helpful to enhance this first try and update it regularly.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, we are also looking for pixel pushers for our next project. We have something in mind, contact us if you want to know more. Or alternatively, a good shoot'em up would be nice to develop as well...
<br/>
<br/>
If you are motivated and are willing to bring your talent and expertise, do not hesitate to contact us: <a href="http://rmstudiogames.free.fr" target="_blank">http://rmstudiogames.free.fr</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
