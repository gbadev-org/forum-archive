<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a professional quality background/tile artist. This is for 3-4 months of full time paid work with minor profit sharing for those interested. If you don't know how to do tiles but can render great looking backgrounds of natural or industrial settings, I'd like to see your work too.
<br/>
<br/>
This is for a 2d game. The style is semi-realistic/semi-stylized and requires highly polished backgrounds.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>
Sock

Sorry to anyone who contacted me and didn't get a reply, the notices went into my bulk mail sorter. Anyway, we are OK for artist for now. Thanks everyone and thanks to Gbadev.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
