The primary position has been filled, but we might need part timers with serious experience. Thanks so much to this forum and everyone who has contacted me.

Hi guys,
<br/>
I need someone who really knows his stuff to code an action title. If you don't know GBA but are an experienced pro at SNES or a modern platform, drop me a line. This is a fully paid position with profit sharing. You can work from home.
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, time for an edit!
<br/>
People have been posting to me privately, and I've been very happy with this post and this method. If you want to contact me, this is the way to go.
<br/>
Let me detail this project a little more.
<br/>
<br/>
The company:
<br/>
Brand new company with veterans from inside and outside the industry. We are self funded and lean, so we do not need a publisher to finish.
<br/>
<br/>
The game so far:
<br/>
A simple design.
<br/>
99% of the sprites for the 11 primary and 6 secondary characters.
<br/>
Some special effects sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
To be done:
<br/>
The code.
<br/>
Sounds and music.
<br/>
Bacground tiles and remaining sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
The programming task:
<br/>
Fast 2d ranged and close combat with several characters on screen.
<br/>
Link cable for multiplayer, both cooperative and adversarial.
<br/>
AI smart enough for cooperative and challenging adversarial combat.
<br/>
Beta in 4-6 months.
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, this is a demanding full time job unless you are some kind of machine, not for amateurs. If you are interested, please be ready at some point to show a sample and/or resume that demonstrates this level of skill. This job pays professional level and includes profit sharing.
<br/>
If you are serious, please contact us, we haven't chosen a candidate yet. I will edit or remove this post when we do.
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sock on Fri May 21, 2004 1:36 am; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

Is it also a expected to be a fulltime job (ie. 8 hours a day)?<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
