    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We've basically got the design done and code ready for a demo, but we need someone who can use VHAM!
<br/>
Initially, we just require someone to do us a small top down street map + 1 or 2 vehicles so we can get the demo up and running.
<br/>
<br/>
If you like what you see and we all move forward, we can then go on from there.  We're quite behind now as we've been at this stage for too long - I've been trying to get to grips with VHAM myself, but just can't....   :(
<br/>

Anyone interested, please contact me - <a href="mailto:spyderbird@hotmail.com">spyderbird@hotmail.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought that VHAM was just an IDE? If that's the case, why does your artist need to use VHAM? Is there some proprietary map format that you are working with? 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just curious. :) And if it's something really rough you just need for the a demo, I might be able to whip up some graphics for you...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Vham comes with a full map making tool and we need the map format to be Vham.
<br/>
<br/>
For now, we do just need a very basic, simple top down map.  Wouldn't be much work at all.
<br/>
<br/>
LMK if you'r interested as we're desperate...

Cheers.
