    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Simply looking to partner with some programmers on 2D and pseudo 2D game designs.
<br/>
<br/>
Target platforms are next-gen Java cell phones and a GBA demo game.
<br/>
<br/>
There are two retro-style game designs. One is puzzle action, the other is a 2.5D comedy space shooter.  Designs taken as far as they can be without some tech demo's of gameplay elements.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm based in NYC and really looking for a serious partner to collaborate with over the long term (read, to build a profitable team).
<br/>
<br/>
If you're serious too, email me at gamedev[nospamm]@excite.com
<br/>
<br/>
I will provide design doc synopsis and art samples to serious inquirers (those with indie creds and working demos).
<br/>
<br/>
Preference for those who are over 18 and able to legally work.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
being a crap in everything concerning graphs (I mean drawing), I just want to know if you are looking for a "professional" partner (do you intend to publish your work) or if you want to do it for fun...
<br/>
It happens that I am desperately looking for a 2D graphist. I am interested into an "amateur" partner (well, for the moment).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
But if you're an amateur with a professional attutide, over 18, and already coding stuff for gba or cellular platforms, I would definitely want to talk with you further.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if we don't work together on a pro-grade project, it might turn out that we could collaborate on a simple game.  It would have to be for the GBA or a cell phone platform tho...

<br/>
You can have a look at my first shot. I'm the latest contribution to gbadev.org (the Tetris one).
<br/>
I have other projects in mind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
