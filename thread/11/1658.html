    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I've spent some time lately on a game concept, and I'm currently at a stage where I actually have enough assets for a working demo. (I've got player character moving, idle, attacking, jumping etc, enemies animated &amp; idle, a full set of platform tiles and bg gfx.)
<br/>
<br/>
The trouble is, I haven't got anyone at hand to build the thing, and I couldn't code to save my life. So: as this place is packed with serious coder talent, I though I'd see if any of you are interested.
<br/>
<br/>
The basic concept is a sidescrolling platformer set in ancient Greece. If you are interested in helping out, just PM me and I'll talk more about it. I'm not looking for anyone to build a complete game with me, just a basic proof of concept, just enough to try out the basic play mechanics. How does that sound?
<br/>
<br/>
There's no financial gain for me or you (unless we win the compo :) ), but I think it'll look real pretty and it looks like a lot of you are working on similar projects using dummy tiles anyway, so why not team up and we can help each other out? 
<br/>
<br/>
To whet your appetite, here's a coupla gfx:

Ok, just PM (or reply to this, of course) if you want to know more, or are curious...

<br/>
Thanks!

If you had posted this maybe two days ago I would have considered it, but I've already began work on a concept of my own for the compo, and of course, I like my concept better.
<br/>
<br/>
But perhaps if noone takes you up on the offer during this compo we can talk about it in the future.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://lorrd.fearware.net" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzep3wth/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/lorrdbanner.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry to sound snobby but you can, you just dont want to learn. I am a disaster with math (ive got dyslexia and it takes me 5 seconds to get the answer to 42+57). But i can program just fine though, I may need a little help but most of all you need experience with little DOS stuff. 
<br/>
<br/>
It might not be fun but you need to go through that. No one can make full fledged games within their first three months of programming (and i mean programming every day). Programming isn't hard at all, you just need to learn the ins and outs.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With all due respect, I can't code either assembler or C++, which makes the first half of your statement provable false. I am certain that I could learn the basics, as I know how to programming works and have done lots of scripting/coding in Basic, Lingo, Javascript, VBCscript etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The second half of your statement is true: I don't want to learn, as I'll never be as good as someone to whom programming comes naturally. I'll stick to what I do well, which is art &amp; design, and leave the coding to the ones who do it really well. Hence the title of the post.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to sound snobby :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey ctrl-k,
<br/>
<br/>
Your sprites look great.  I think it looks like a neat game. 
<br/>
You ought to make it a mythological ghosts and goblins (Gods and Monsters or something) and make it extremely hard to get through each level.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I hear you about the coding.  It is definitly not for everyone.
<br/>
I am trying to learn it and am moving somewhat slowly and I'm a programmer for an avionics company (we don't make games). I have almost no experience in games (other than a few generic college projects), so it doesn't come easy to me.
<br/>
<br/>
I am working on a game/learning to code for GBA, and I have my own idea or I'd like to help you.  Get some good gameplay in that game and you could win the compo.  
<br/>
<br/>
I seriously think that game would be great with gameplay styled after Ghosts and Goblins (or Ghouls and Ghosts).  You could have it where your hero pisses off Zeus and Zues decides to throw everything he's got at him to kill him (which would make the game incredibly hard).  The bosses could be other gods.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could help me learn how to paint sprites.  I can draw pretty well on paper, but my sprites suck and my animation is choppy.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow.  Good luck and feel free to use those ideas if you want (you probably have your own already).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all,
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, big thanks to everyone who offered to help, it's very much appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm now teamed up with a kick-ass coder (no stranger on this list, obviously) and we're already in full gear for that september deadline...
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, let me say that already after about 3 days, I've learnt *loads* about how graphics work in code on the GBA and all sorts of arcane detail. I have the greatest respect for people who understand code intuitively (I am clearly not one of them), and I would recommend anyone who wants to learn how to code (or just learn more about the GBA) to team up with someone who knows these things well, and then *pester* them with questions on absolutely everything. It's especially easy+useful if you're working on a project together, because then you'll have a defined set of problems etc to work on and you can share the tasks and solutions between you.
<br/>
<br/>
So, in regards to code, there might be hope for me yet...
<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice one,
<br/>
<br/>
K.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
