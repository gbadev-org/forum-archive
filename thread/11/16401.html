If you get the game mostly done, without sound or wifi, then come back with a mostly-finished game and ask if someone wants to help you get sound or wifi working on it.  You'll have much better success, trust me.

1.  If you want to raise excitement for a project, don't TELL us about a demo, SHOW us a demo
<br/>
2.  A splash screen is about the least compelling demo you could show.  (and really, one of the last things you need to worry about)  Anybody can slap together a pretty screen.  A partially functional game engine is what we'd want to see, to see that you (or your teammates) can actually put something functional and interesting together.

Like was discussed in the other thread of yours, most people with experience and skill won't go there...we don't want to invest huge amounts of time in a project that Nintendo will shut down.

I'm not even sure what that means.  Ura Zelda itself gets half the money?  (sorry, snarky comment there).  Realistically, you won't make any money.

Again, unless you show us something really cool, most of us won't even be interested enough to ask for the demo (a title screen?) or design doc.  
<br/>
<br/>
I know you're excited about this, and I don't want to burst your bubble, but a project of this scope is HUGE, would likely take years to complete, and will probably get a C&amp;D from Nintendo.   Am I saying it's impossible?  No.  But I am saying that you're not the first person to show up here and try to recruit a team for a project like this.  And 0% of those people have ended up finishing.  If you are dedicated, skilled, and insane enough, you could be the first.  But people aren't likely to invest a lot of time helping you on the off-chance that you are that dedicated, skilled, and insane.   
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want this thing to happen, spend the energy you're spending recruiting on getting started.  Spend 6 months or a year getting a gameplay demo working (even if the graphics and music are lousy).  Come back then and ask us if anybody wants to help you finish.  You still might get no takers, but at least then you won't be mocked for being the seventy-fifth person to come here with the same dead-end project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Speaking from experience, the thing that will kill your project is the artwork requirements.
<br/>
<br/>
Given a design, a modeller will spend a few days to model and texture a single character. They may be able to get two characters done in a week. But something like Zelda, where you got villagers and enemies could easily have 50 or 100 characters or more meaning it would take the best part of a year just to model and texture the characters. Of course the design phase itself takes time and also in and of itself could suffer delays as the "art/project lead" will have to approve all character designs and request time consuming changes.
<br/>
<br/>
But that assumes consistency, and with people having lives that is not gonna happen as they have holidays, exams, family commitments, just getting tired or maybe even find a job etc. In fact I'll say that finding a dedicated artist who'll do all this for free is only slightly more likely than winning the lottery. So you'll have to find 2 or 3 semi-dedicated character artists. This will be hard, even if you have a little money to pay them. I suppose you could pay a miserly $30-$50 per character(and design), in which case 50 character models will cost you $1500-$2500. Even then it will take a long time. Of course then on top of that you got any equipment like swords and any costume changes.
<br/>
<br/>
Even worse you need environments, villages, forests, dungeons, deserts, with skyboxes, filled with trees, rocks, castles, houses, etc. Stuff inside the houses and dungeons like chairs, tables, statues etc. All of which would have to be designed and modelled and textured. So you need to find more artists. This could easily dwarf the character requirements and thus increase the cost massively.
<br/>
<br/>
And then on top of that you gotta find someone to animate the
<br/>
characters...
<br/>
<br/>
If you have 5 or 10 thousand dollars to burn on artwork you might be able to scrape through if you're really lucky. But you would also need a really good programmer working over 12 months plus and someone to design the world/dungeons/puzzles/script/AI. This would have to progress before you can persuade artists to really come on board.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to proceed, I'd suggest just forget about trying to make a game, just design a demo, say one village and one dungeon. Then look for people to help you finish that. It will probably take a year or two(since you will need a complete game engine encompassing camera, collision detection, physics, combat etc). Even if you drop it after that, it would have been a good learning experience.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your project has the scope of a commerical project, it will also require the effort of a commerical project.  The figures I heard about 8 years ago were $2 million and 2 years to make a game.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming developers cost a company double what they earn, that amounts to 1 million in salaries.  Assuming your people are worth an average of $50,000 a year, that amounts to 20 people years.  If you spread that over 2 years, you get a team of 10 skilled people working full time.  Full time means 40+ hours a week, because everyone is salaried.
<br/>
<br/>
You either need to reduce your scope to meet your team size, or come up with a pitch that is good enough to build a team of about 10 people who can participate full time... for two years.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you devote 40+ a week to your project for the next two years?  Can the other members of your team?  If the answer is no, chances are slim that you will be able to find help.  Even you and your other team members are dedicated, most of the people here are either doing this as a hobby and they have jobs and other priorities.  This is why none of these "I have a good idea, help me make it" threads work out.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>  My personal opinion is that starting the project on the PC and porting it later is the way to go.  I think this for a bunch of reasons... but do not feel like elaborating right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't get too discouraged, hacker013. Gauauu's comments were spot on, and you responded very professionally.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's true that a professional game will cost a couple million dollars to make. But you're (hopefully) not aiming for a professional project; you're aiming for a decent homebrew project. And that <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> do-able. With the understanding that you want a game with the same caliber as other good homebrew games, you shouldn't have to worry about comparing your project and its funding to professionally released games.
<br/>
<br/>
Many found your original post humorous simply because there are <span style="font-style: italic">lots</span> of people that pop into the form, slap down an idea, and expect others to make it for them. But you've done a couple things differently. 
<br/>
<br/>
First, you've been learning about coding yourself, as we can all tell from your other posts. Gauauu could tell, too, which is why he spent time to write the frank and helpful post that he did.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, most people get discouraged when a team of programmers doesn't rush to start their project. First sign of criticism and they'll either get really angry or simply disappear entirely. Or both. You, however, took it all in and responded professionally.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if you'll ever manage to complete your game, or even a demo. But I know that you're already ahead of 95% of the ideas that show up here. Don't get discouraged!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like a much more realistic plan, if I were you I'd create a Zelda style dungeon (Similar puzzles, monsters etc) but stay away from the licensed characters.
