    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any musicians out there who would like to write a song for a demo in the upcoming compo? I'd planned on doing the music myself, but to be honest I'm pretty horrible at demo style.

Feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:dekutree64@hotmail.com">dekutree64@hotmail.com</a>, or just post here.

I'm willing to split up any prizes won of course, not really sure what a fair ratio would be though, it depends on what the prizes are, so we'll work something out if it wins anything.
