    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT - 040824:</span> A new version of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.areta.org/~lordmetroid/GBA-contest/specification.pdf" target="_blank">Game specifications</a> as well as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.areta.org/~lordmetroid/GBA-contest/specification%20-%20Artistic%20guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">Artistic guidelines</a> have been uploaded with some additional information added since last time, one shall note this is still a highly incomplete spec and the older file have been replaced with the newer. Musical guidelines have also been added
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT - 040822:</span> Seems like this thread has turned out to be more then a help wanted thread, it become my blog... So to show my progress I post a screenshot of what the current code has achieved.
<br/>
What you see is two dummy segments from my CZ-buffer being rendered.
<br/>
next step would be whole polygons... <a href="http://www.areta.org/~lordmetroid/GBA-contest/cart.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT - 040819:</span> I'm contactable either by e-mail, forum Private message or more preferably always in #gbacompo@Efnet on irc if online... If I don't answer I'm just away from my keyboard. And will for sure return at a later time and see your attempt to communicate And if you are still online a reply to that attempt will be made...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently writing <a class="postlink" href="http://www.areta.org/~lordmetroid/GBA-contest/specification.pdf" target="_blank">Game Specifications</a>, <span style="font-style: italic">Notice this document is incomplete</span> as it's still in progress of being written. The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.areta.org/~lordmetroid/GBA-contest/specification%20-%20Artistic%20guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">Artistic guidelines</a> which can be obtained as a seperate document is included as a part of the original and whole specification document.
<br/>
The palette as described in the specifications has a very absolute layout and so I created two files to aid any artists with their work.
<br/>
Both the OAM and tile palette will be the same, the only thing defining what colors you can use is what type of graphics you are working on:
<br/>
A <a class="postlink" href="http://www.areta.org/~lordmetroid/GBA-contest/real-palette52.pcx" target="_blank">pcx file</a> where all colors available for use in object images is shown in the image.
<br/>
A <a class="postlink" href="http://www.areta.org/~lordmetroid/GBA-contest/real-palette256.pcx" target="_blank">pcx file</a> which has all the different colors shown, this is either used as a 16color palette or 256 color palette depending on what menu art which is created.
<br/>
Both these files also contains the whole palette of course.
<br/>
<br/>
As I'm inpatient by nature, I have also written a little on the engine, and so far it's looking good, the pace is steady and fast. On the whole it's looking bright, expect some dummy screenshots in the near future.
<br/>
<br/>
Associates have shown intrest in the project and I a manageable group of graphic artists have signed up. All in all this project is looking bright!
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">END BLOG</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The game is a <span style="color: red">Turnbased Vs multiplayer RPG influenced combat simulator.</span> This will be done in my upcomming 3D engine which abuses text layers. If you been on #gbadev@Efnet you have probably heard of it.
<br/>
I can't promise anything, but this I know for sure... This game will not be finished by me alone. It's way too much to handle for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone feeling for:
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Music and sfx</span>
<br/>
One or two songs and some sfx for the weapons.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Coding</span>
<br/>
Coding of a soundplayer.
<br/>
Coding the game and it's function.
<br/>

In general people will have more confidence in your project if you *can* finish it by yourself.  How long would it take you to do alone?  Are you lacking any skills to get the job done?  If so, what are they?  What will you do if you have a team of a few guys and everything is going great but something happens halfway through and you lose a guy?

It's more like realising ones own capabilities and limits... staying focused on the project throughout the whole time would be more then difficult and the art would be limited.<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

Do you even have an engine or library of some sort ready for small tests or some sort? Or are you starting from *near* scratch?
<br/>
<br/>
It would be very difficult to make it on time even if you had other people working with you if you don't have some sort of base library to use. And those things take time to write, debug, and optimize of necessary.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got the 2D base system coded and debugged... It's just the general 3D functions for projecting a world and it's objects which needs to be coded. And it's not that much a of code. Their is no need to wait on the 3D engine to be finished when coding the soundplayer or the game functions... They are so independent they can be linked together as each part finishes within reasonable time anyway...<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Making a 3d engine for the GBA is a whole project on its own. To make it run fast enough will affect all other aspects of your game (sound etc...). I think you should orient your project based on the engine or code you already have. Contributors could be very disapointed if all their efforts were done for nothing because you realize in the end that your 3d engine is not adequate. Just my opinion, good luck anyways :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I said, this is only a part of the spec... I've yet to fully complete it, I don't even know if this is completed yet, but it should give some idea of what the graphics of the game will be if someone wanted to join in...
<br/>
And I'm fully focused on the engine myself... that's why I want to gather people wishing to take part in this game project. And hopefully finish it... I know I'll do my best to get it done at least!<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*
