    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do think that we need a lot more crossover between the coding, pixel art, and music composition communities, so I applaud your effort to create a group that does so, but I'm slightly confused about what you're going for.  
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people show up here with their plans to start some new awesome community/company/team/website and they have about what you have...some web space and an empty splash screen.  And it never goes anywhere.  I'm trying to figure out if you're another one of those people, or whether there's something valuable with what you're doing (Because I'm ALL for the idea of collaboration between communities to make quality homebrew).
<br/>
<br/>
So my thoughts/questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  If this is something more than a vague idea of "starting a cool team", hurry up and put some content on your web space explaining your goals, what collaborations and projects might look like and your ideas of how they might be organized.  And in the future, have those ready BEFORE making this post so we can skip the step where people wonder if you have thought through this at all.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Can you show us some more work (a homebrew game, sprite sheets, animations, etc) that your team has produced so we know to take you seriously?  I saw that we can email you, but it's more tempting if it's publicly available so we can browse it quickly to see what we think.
<br/>
<br/>
3.  Are you willing to work on other people's homebrew ideas/projects, or are you coming into this with your own project ideas and trying to recruit coders?  
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You are right.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I will do webpage and <span style="font-weight: bold">forum for developmen first</span>.
<br/>
And than you or another coders will decide...
<br/>
<br/>
We are brand new team (founded this month) but yes our pixelartists have sprites and spritesheets...
<br/>
<br/>
For example here... 
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.pixellicker.com/gallery_pixel/gallery_pixel.html" target="_blank">http://www.pixellicker.com/gallery_pixel/gallery_pixel.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes our team will be based on communication and listening to each others.
<br/>
So when you will have nice idea or not finished interesting game project as coder. We will listen to your ideas. 
<br/>
<br/>
Yes you are right so no promises for now. Wait 2 weeks (I will make deadline 10.2.2010) for our <span style="font-weight: bold">forum</span> and www launch first.
<br/>
Than decide. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways you can write me and I will send you more sprites and music...
<br/>
<br/>
Our first game will simple fighting game inspired by this Atari game by Mastertronic.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont suppose you would be at all interested in providing a generic tileset for use in the Drunkencoders winter coding competition?
<br/>
<br/>
A few tiles suitable for side scrollers or top down wintery places...
<br/>
<br/>
Often new coders are intimidated by the creation of art resources for their projects and having a small set of things to work with might encourage a few game ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone looking to donate some time to the compo instead of cash for prizes let me know...lots of things can be done.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know the Drunkencoders winter competition has become a bit of a tradition but it would be nice to have something new, and not always a snow, santa, holiday season themed version of games.
