A musician/composer is wanted for the head composer on our GBA RPG, <span style="font-style: italic">The Wotch: My Sister, Myself</span>.  We presently have two programmers, three artists, a character/storyline/level designer, and a sound-effects guy, but we're very much lacking in the music department.  All of the developers on this game are volunteers, and though this game is technically homebrew, we are shooting for professional quality, and may consider seeking a publisher at some point.

The gameplay style is a mix of action and RPG, somewhat similar to <span style="font-style: italic">Secret of Mana</span>; for those who don't know that game, think an equal mixture of the fights of <span style="font-style: italic">Zelda: Link to the Past</span> and the story depth of a <span style="font-style: italic">Final Fantasy</span> game.

The musician should be able to compose a decent-sized musical score from scratch.  We will require 30-40 separate 1-2 minute compositions.  The music should be ideally orchestral or band:  This is a serious RPG, so we're not looking for dance, techno, or hip-hop.  The sound library is Krawall, and we will likely be shelling out some cash for good instrument samples, if you do not wish to supply your own.  Thus mod-tracking skills are a plus, though really, we'd prefer someone with classical music training.
<br/>
<br/>
You must submit a portfolio of prior compositions to be considered; and several people already have.  A YIM or AIM account is not required, but it is a plus.  An e-mail account is required.  This position will be open until Saturday, October 22, 2005.  We expect the game to be nearing completion about one year from now.
<br/>
<br/>
The accepted applicant for this position will have full access to the game's bible, all concept art, development builds of the game, all of our private tools, and our private forum.
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that this is an unpaid position; all of the developers are volunteers.  <span style="font-style: italic">If</span> the game ever <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> get sold, the developers will be properly compensated at that time; but you should not <span style="font-style: italic">expect</span> payment for your work.  You will get a byline in the closing credits either way ;-)
