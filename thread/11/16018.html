    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just throwing this out there to see if there are any DS developers interested in helping me build a DS Puzzle game.
<br/>
<br/>
A prototype already exists (not on DS), has sold pretty well on Mobile, and we have graphic designers and marketing people on staff. 
<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I haven't been allotted a budget for DS development and we have not done any yet, but I am allowed to offer equity in sales of the game if we can secure a publisher.  If I can do this, I have a lot of contacts in Los Angeles I can shop this around to, so I'll do my best to get in on shelves.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're into the idea and looking for a challenge and a cool group of guys to work with, PM me!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
<br/>
<br/>
