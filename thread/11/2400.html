    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all,
<br/>
<br/>
My GBA project is at the point where I am looking to create a solid demo to shop around to publishers.
<br/>
<br/>
You can get some of the details (plus a link to an older version of the graphics engine) at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.danposluns.com/eod" target="_blank">http://www.danposluns.com/eod</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, no fancy website or company name just yet. This project IS happening, though. We are a small group of people, but very dedicated. Selling it is another matter, of course, but then that's why we need to create the demo. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Flat fee or royalties may be negotiated if and when we find a publisher. You retain the rights to your artwork, so there's no risk involved if you aren't happy with the deal. This is a springboard project, though, so it will not be a lot, and if you are in it solely for the money you will wind up very disappointed.
<br/>
<br/>
I also wouldn't mind some advice as to where else I might try advertising this. I have to wonder how many artists check the gbadev forums. ;)
<br/>

I responded to one of his ads for a programmer for their supposed promising RPG and he strung me along for weeks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">eh... after reading it over i do take back what i said to some degree, they are very professional, my main point was the way that Dan strung me along for weeks at a time making it sound like I'd soon be a part of the project.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't speak on behalf of Dan Bushman or Evil Genius Games, so I can't really comment, except to say that he has eventually (albeit slowly) responded to my e-mails, so his organization strikes me as most likely being homebrew with a lot of other stuff on their plate, which is something I can relate to since I am in the same boat with my production.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I don't personally believe that fancy websites or official-sounding names are what make a game, although they may have an eventual impact on being published. (Which is why right now I don't have any of that stuff for my game... it'll come when I'm closer to finishing the demo.) So you can rest assured that that aspect of Evil Genius Games hasn't affected my judgement at all; I'm treating them the way I would any other homebrew developer.
<br/>
<br/>
In sum, I think my main reason for posting this was so that people wouldn't confuse me (Dan Posluns, and starter of this thread) with Evil Genius Games (Dan Bushman, who is the one being alternately accused and defended). Not that I have anything against them, and in fact I hope to collaborate with them at some point in the future; I just desire to preemptively avoid any unintentional slander of my production. :)

<br/>
A couple of things regarding this debate that I have been missing, heh.
<br/>
<br/>
First, I agree that great pixel art does not make a great game or great development team.  I will say that if you go to pixelation or some other such forum where they hear programmer and production heads pleas for help constantly, and you can only offer royalties and walk away with ONE good sprite artist, it says something about commitment and the quality of your game.  Period.  I have brought together serveral extemely talented pixel artists for this project: st0ven, Emlan and Scuba Steve.  If you have been to pixelation, you know who they are.  
<br/>
These are not the only talented people on the team, and all are working because they have confidence in the project.  That doesn't some from me blowing smoke.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I would personally like to apologize to you TwinD, as the reasons for the "stringing along" as you put it were two-fold, but ultimately my fault.  The sins of a first time production lead trying to keep his head on straight and above water.  I've got a much better handle on things now.  If you ever need help (pixel art, music, web space) I would be more than willing to lend a hand as a peace offering, just e-mail me at <a href="mailto:danbushman@eg-games.com">danbushman@eg-games.com</a> and I will get back to you as soon as I can, and that's the truth.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, Dan, I think your description of why it sometimes takes a while for me to respond is dead on.  I literally get 30+ e-mails a day asking questions about the game, how to start your own team, applications and such.  It takes some time to sort through it all and respond, esp. since I am in grad school and have a full time job.  Have you responded to my last e-mail I wonder?
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, cheers</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by mrmacabreman on Wed Dec 10, 2003 7:59 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I was just being a dickhead. I've registered on your forums as I do think you have a good head on your shoulders about all of this. I'll probably loosely try to stay in contact with your group as I like your idea to more or less bring the indy developers together. God knows I have no doubt my engine is good, and that the story will be great and the game will be good, but I do think it's near impossible for me to find a good artist without some sort of good word... (as when you posted on pixelation you were able to say you had Stoven who is very well respected)... Anyways, sorry about 'thread crapping' more or less.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
