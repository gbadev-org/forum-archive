We?re looking for additional help to work on our game Western Lords. We are serious and we try to act as professionally as possible with our development. Western Lords is our first game and is planned for Game Boy Advance. Our agent discussed with two publishers and both were impressed with our pre-production progresses. They invited us to show them back the game when it will be 80% completed. In other word one of these publishers will sign a contact with our team as soon as the game is nearly over and have enough elements to start a publicity campaign. We have a lot to prove in the world of videogames but we believe in ourselves. If some of you are interested to join us, here are the vacancies:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">CHIEF PROGRAMMER</span>
<br/>
Must be self-motivated, creative and skilled with C, and C++ (and possibly have small notion in assembly). Must be capable to lead other sub-divided programmers (through internet such MSN, ICQ or Discussion Board). Will have to learn Game Boy Advance specs and memory addresses.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">BATTLE PROGRAMMER</span>
<br/>
Must be skilled with C and C++ and work on battle programs. The battle concept is already created, so programmers will simply have to execute the idea.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">WEBMASTER</span> (POST FILLED)
<br/>
Must have some advanced knowledge with html, php or other internet tools. We would love to make the production of our games more interactive for our followers and offers regulars gifts and teasers. You will have to post announcements on the news pages, updates screenshots etc. We're looking someone able to build a user board to make the updates more easy.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">WEBDESIGN ARTIST</span>
<br/>
Must be skilled with web design and have a good sense of consistency. 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2D ARTISTS</span>
<br/>
We are looking for some assistance to create enemies and animated sprites. Must be skilled with graphic applications and adapt to what is already done.
<br/>
<br/>
Post your resume and interests at <a href="mailto:info@blossomsoft.com">info@blossomsoft.com</a>

<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">IMPORTANT NOTICE:</span> Currently Blossom Soft is non-lucrative. Don?t misunderstand us because we are extremely serious with our development. We?re not a wannabe team who dream to make a surreal game and abandon 2 weeks later with discouragement. I?m 27 years old and I refused a full time job by way to work on our project because I believe in what we are doing. If you join us, you will have to take one risk: <span style="font-weight: bold">to make fun</span>. Then if you make enough fun, you will have to take another risk: <span style="font-weight: bold">to make money </span>;)</span>

<br/>
Thank you!

Elder Prince,

Nah, he's just very 'happy' to have some found treasure, that's all.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, he simply couldn't contain his 'excitement'.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, adventuring is 'hard' work.
<br/>
<br/>
ok ok that's enough, lemme stop there :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
