    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there. I had been playing Smash Bros (Melee and Brawl both) for the last few days, studying it, because I wanted to try my hand at writing a smash bros-clone, and then I found out about SmashGP, so I downloaded the source files, of which I promptly opened, and I discover that the spoken language of the author has carried over to their code. I can see what's going on, to a point, but the language barrier is throwing me for a loop. lack of commenting in the code doesn't help either, but I won't complain more than that.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I have some programming skills, I'd at least say I am competent with C. I also can do really lowpoly modeling and non-character texturing, though I might give it a shot, since the textures are restricted a bit on the DS, right?
<br/>
<br/>
I have some other features in mind, because after playing SmashGP, it seems to have been based on the original Smash Bros, and I wanna update it with some Melee and Brawl Features.(Teching, A button Smash Attacks, Dodging, Final Smash, etc) Also maybe throw some ad-hoc in there.
<br/>
<br/>
So what I need help with is mainly just figuring out this source code. I know what I need from it, but I don't know which is which. @_@
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: A sample of the code:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
<br/>
void assommeperso(int i, int duree) {
<br/>
<br/>
   perso[i].acti = -duree;
<br/>
<br/>
   perso[i].stat = 0;
<br/>
<br/>
   perso[i].stata = 0;
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   if(perso[i].objet) { //On lache l'objet
<br/>
<br/>
      objet[perso[i].objet].dx = perso[i].dx &gt;&gt; 1;
<br/>
<br/>
      objet[perso[i].objet].dy = perso[i].dy &gt;&gt; 1;
<br/>
<br/>
      objet[perso[i].objet].porte = false;
<br/>
<br/>
      objet[perso[i].objet].prop = i;
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      perso[i].objet = 0;
<br/>
<br/>
   }
<br/>
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Seems to be not that hard, but it still throws me for a loop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
