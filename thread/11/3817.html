    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
Since there will certainly be a new compo, I'm willing to enter it by doing a 3D racing game in the wipeout style.
<br/>
Therefore I'm looking for a 3D artist that can design textured models and levels with a good sense for doing low poly. I'm also hesitating about doing a level editor so maybe designing will be done through that one.
<br/>
If you think you are skilled, you can work "fast" and if you're very very motivated to achieve a promising project, please contact me(PM) and I'll define more the game.
<br/>
<br/>
For information, I've already done some 3D engines for the GBA(like Borderline Compo 2003 Demo Section) and have good knowledge of C and ASM.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Jeff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you really should considering making an editor. 
<br/>
btw, what is the fillrate of your engine?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Meyitzo, thanks for offering your help but I got it all covered.
<br/>
<br/>
Tomer, At this moment we don't have an editor. But I have created all kinds of road segments and environment blocks (buildings, tunnels etc.) that I can reuse which makes building a new level very easy and fast.
<br/>
<br/>
Fill rate ... uhhh ... Funkeejeffou knows that stuff :)
<br/>
<br/>
We're not gonna make the competition deadline though :(
<br/>
But we'll finish it nevertheless! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
