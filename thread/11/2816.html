    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I need beta-testers for my new game...there is a bug in my AI-engine, which only appears rarely - I need more info on this bug, to be able to find the source...
<br/>
<br/>
there is much to do in my project - it`s an early beta(no sound yet, some features to add, optimise the menu, etc...), but I`d like to find the bug in the AI-engine, before continuing on other tasks...
<br/>
<br/>
If you are willing to help, send me a PM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
