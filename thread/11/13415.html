    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I've like decided to make a Zelda adventure game for the DS. I have the 3D game engine mostly done(including input, camera, animation, collision detection etc) however I have very limited artistic skills. So I need some modelers to help out.  Oh, if you're a budding musician you too can help with sounds effects and BGM.

If you're interested you can drop me a line here or email me at c_darkmane@    yahoo. co.uk</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I don't have the art assets for a demo really. Although I suppose I could cobble something together.

Well, right now I convert 3DS files to my own custom format(putting them into a precompiled display list is high up on my todo list). As for polycount, probably around 500 polygons for a character, give or take a couple hundred.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Given the DS's limit of 2000 front-facing triangles per scene, that'd be 8 characters per scene without any landscape. Is this what you mean?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Well, no. The 2000 limit is for what's on screen at any one time, stuff just outside the screen doesn't count. So what it means is around 3 to 4 characters on screen at any one time with a landscape. Of course you could have a scene of 10 or 20 characters or more, but they would have to be carefully placed so that not too many are seen at once. And of course you could have just one giant boss of over 1000 polygons or many smaller characters at once(like say a squad of ninja chickens).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm kinda interested in helping out, but I need more info on what you need. Are we talking about characters with bones, or static walk frames, or what?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> a polygon limit.  It is a vertex limit.  With some creative coding, you can get more polygons from the DS - eg making the skybox from two quads and a quad strip.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cuyb10fzdz2" target="_blank">Strummer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">Drummer?</a>.

<br/>
Well, I think the official line is 120,000 polygons per second, which at 60fps works out to 2K per frame. This is a hard limit which I think is defined by the fact that there is specific polygon RAM that holds this amount. I think Gabebear posted about this in this forum.

<br/>
Yes, it's using skeletal animation with bones. I can extract the animation from 3DS, but I've also mostly written my own keyframe animation tool(which I may port to the DS).

<br/>
<br/>
Because Zelda's my favourite series. Besides, it makes it easy for everyone to understand and thus more chance of attracting interest, and it saves me having to write an entire novel to explain the concept.

<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's to be an entirely original game, not a remake. Really, the difference between Zelda game and something else is just changing the main character from an elf named Link to a dwarf named Bizzle. And vice versa, so a C&amp;D isn't really an issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it's been a while, but a fair bit of progress has been made. There is even a demo now, which you can grab at:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.4shared.com/file/21887545/e6918cc9/zdemo.html" target="_blank">http://www.4shared.com/file/21887545/e6918cc9/zdemo.html</a>

<br/>
<br/>
Just extract the zip file to the root of your card. Then go into the alpha folder and just run the zdemo.nds file. You may need to dldi patch it first though.
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, if anyones interested in working on this project just give me shout.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just finished an animation degree in uni and am looking for some stuff to increase my portfolio particularly with games.

Unfortunately the only 3d program I know well enough is blender although I am desperately trying to learn maya it will still be a couple of months before I know it well enough.
<br/>
<br/>
I am inexperienced when it comes to practical application of 3d work in games but I have done low-poly work before. If you could help me with the technical aspects and if blender is capable of exporting in format usable to you i'd love to help.

a cease and desist would be likely if you dont end up putting a TM under each name as the character plays ingame, and rights info at the beginning or end of the game.  To be honest, it isnt that hard to generate a base storyline, I've done it, Zelda series has done, everyone who made a game has, it can be simple and straightforward, or highly detailed and in depth<br/>_________________<br/>laos,
