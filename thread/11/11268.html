    <h4>#103925 - boundless - Mon Sep 25, 2006 1:58 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking for highly skilled, freelance artists to create 2D tile-based background graphics for a handheld game which might be released commercially. The artists should be able to produce graphics in a style somewhere between Metal Slug and Contra. Also, you must be able to work within a set timeframe and have good, friendly communication skills. 
<br/>
<br/>
More information will be offered to selected applicants who have signed a NDA (do not send requests for the NDA). 
<br/>
<br/>
Please email relevant examples of your work, your desired paid*, and (if possible) an estimate of your speed to:  <a href="mailto:boundlessjoe@yahoo.com">boundlessjoe@yahoo.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
* Artists will be paid by the job, but please give an approximate hourly rate.
<br/>
<br/>
In your examples, I?d like to see the ability to create 256 color backgrounds where each tile can use 256 colors, and I?d also like to see 256 color backgrounds made up of 16 color tiles (like Gameboy Advance graphics).
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I probably won?t have the time to get back to everyone who emails, so thank you in advance for your interest.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
