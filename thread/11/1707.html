    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been creating a custom map editor off and on for the past 7 months, and while it's getting to the point where it's almost complete ( on the funcitonality end ), it could stand to be cleaned up, performance tuned, and just otherwise maintained.
<br/>
<br/>
A (very) brief overview of the tool can be found here:  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.geocities.com/gba_dev/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/gba_dev/index.html</a>

Depending on the amount and quality of work completed, you may be entitled to some form of payment.  If you are interested in helping out, please contact me at <span style="font-weight: bold">gba_dev@yahoo.com</span>, and we can discuss any details, including payment potential, at that point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, if anyone is interested in doing some fairly extensive testing of the mapEd tool, that would be very much appreciated.  
<br/>
<br/>
The only payment that I'd offer for this help though is that you can use the tool for your own needs if you find it useful.  That and I guess I could put a special thanx credits on the opening splash screen if it's really important to someone...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
