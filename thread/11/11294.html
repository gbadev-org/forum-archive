You can always email.  "I saw your post for DS developers on gbadev.org and..."

Why would anyone forge a post like this?  Do you really think that everyone who posts here actually does homebrew development and that professional studios entirely ignore gbadev.org?

How could someone forge a post like this is probably a better question.  You can more or less tell that it's legit from reading it.  Google will tell you that <a class="postlink" href="http://jobs.ea.com/pljb/global_jsp/applicant/SearchAgentMgr/SearchProcess.jsp;jsessionid=6075105D15863E2633D9D46374147668?pljbHome=/ElectronicArts/Europe/applicant/index.jsp&amp;searchaction=Search&amp;keyword=&amp;jobType=&amp;jobTitle=&amp;jobLocationRegion=&amp;jobLocation=UK%20-%20Chertsey&amp;orderby=" target="_blank">EA has a studion in Chertsy</a>.  (Looks like they are still hiring.)  In theory a clever prankster could have used that tactic to forge the post, but it seems like a lot of work.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span>  With enough planning you cross the line, cease to be prankster and become a con man.  At that point you fool people.  That's what con men do.  =P

<br/>
I think that the post count of one adds to that the legitimacy of the post.  Why would an EA HR rep spend excessive amounts of time posting here?  Admittedly, he may be a project lead; in that case he may have had more than one post, but that is neither here nor there.

That's what I did, because if they hadn't, I would have mentioned it. The second response from Tobert lends more weight to his story, but I guess I would have posted a link to the job on their page (if it was advertised, I didn't check that) if I had been in his stead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Should I post his email address here? I'm hesitant, because he may not want it spreading around too much (since he didn't post it here in the first place).

<br/>
His email headers look genuine enough, and I can't imagine a prankster going to those lengths.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Either A) (very likely) he doesn't know how, or B) the link was overlooked (likely if A is not true and he was busy).

<br/>
No.  I'd contact him and let him know how posting his email address could be beneficial.  At that point he'll post it himself if it is a prioirity.

<br/>
I wouldn't worry about it.  Once you start forging email headers you are not really a prankster anymore.  (Under certain circumstances forging headers could even be considered criminal bahavior.)

Did you read the entire thread and did you look at the timestamps? Most people took it seriously and most likely it was a serious offer to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
Rockviech made a joke and I am the only person pointing out that *to me* he looked like a prankster initially. Don't let one cynical person discourage you, just in case this does indeed happen to you someday.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
