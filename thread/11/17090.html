    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know someone who is selling a port of my GBA emulator on Android, and you aren't him. You could be selling a different emulator, but I find it less likely (no offense). Chances are better that you want to repackage the emulator currently being sold with someone else's game in order to make money off of it, or possibly you are doing your own port of the emulator. Since it's GPL I can't stop you from doing this, but if this is of concern to anyone then I encourage them to first ask you for evidence that it's your emulator that you're selling and not someone else's.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You say you aren't selling my emulator, but you admit it's a port of another project; if it's a port of gpSP then you're selling my emulator. The only other open source GBA emulator is VBA, which is too slow for most Android phones, even Cortex-A8 or better ones. I have it on good confidence that what you're selling is gpSP.
<br/>
<br/>
You're free to sell it, but if it's under GPL then you'll have to release the source. Technically it might require someone buying it to push this, but I'm not afraid to pay your $1 asking price to get you to do this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I never said it was a port of an open source project. I used to work for a commercial firm which dropped the project and let me pick it up. I am not looking to start trouble with anyone, I just thought some developers may like to make a little bit of money off their GBA games. If nobody is interested thats fine with me. I am not trying to show disrespect for this forum or its users, I just was looking for further opportunities and maybe help some developers that didn't have the Android Know-How in the process.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you are interested in doing some freebie (you might see it as promotion of the emulator, I dunno...), I guess I could give you permission to bundle the Shit Faced Clowns demos, given that they are distributed for free. I'd have to run it by the other copyright holders first, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A commercial firm was happy to drop a project and then let you sell it and collect the profits for yourself? No offense, but that's a little far fetched. I'm going to be doing some additional research into your emulator, if you don't mind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

any of the dubious chineese MP5 producer. all of them include a NES emulator and some starts to support gba... now I always through that theses emulator were simply ripped from the open source comunity... seen the respect theses company pay to nintendo or to some game creator...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In fact, I've heard of commercial released western games using OSS, I think there was one on the PS2 (they left the debug strings in some of the binaries so it was easy to spot).  Others have been spotted by glitches that are emulator specific.  Are there any emulator specific glitches in gpSP?

zodttd and I have an agreement allowing him to close the source (I make half the profits from the iPhone sales.. it's a pretty embarrassingly large amount of money actually).. last I asked he wasn't selling any other emulators outright, just taking donations. Should I ask again?
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, it's not just iPlayer, it's also various PMPs, including the Dingoo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Didn't know the Dingoo used gpSP as well, that's new to me.  Though it does validate the theory that the SNES emulator included in the upcoming SCDS:Two will be the Dingoo one.  
<br/>
<br/>
As for ZodTTD, he charges for nes4iPhone ($5, since launch) and snes4iPhone ($6, only recently started charging), and takes a $2.50 donation for the ad-free version of n64iphone.  Looking through Cydia here, it looks like genesis4iphone, gameboy4iphone, mame4iphone, psx4iphone, quake4iphone, and temper4iphone remain free.  I'm not terribly annoyed about charging for any of them except perhaps snes4iphone, mostly because it <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> free and still doesn't have the Wiimote support that I find increasingly necessary in any emulator.  I can't justify spending $6 on an emulator that I know from experience to be almost impossible to play with purely touchscreen controls.  I mean heck, the N64 emulator is more playable simply because you have actual buttons to work with (though I'm hoping that "mmap" issue can be resolved, as it sounds like a significant source of slowdown in the iPhone port).
