<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lionheart (Martyn) i am apart of a newly formned company by the name of Dream-Gaming, we currently have a trading card game getting ready to send to a list of publishers in the hope that it may get published now we where thinking of stunning them even more by providing them with details of a GBA game we have planed to relase about the game. Now we do not have the money to pay for what we are looking for right away but if we get a publishing deal the coder will get paid for his work and this is guranteed as i am a very nice person to work with. What we are requiring is a coder to coder us a proto type of the GBA game we plan on making now this will only be a prototype at first inorder to really impress the publishers 
<br/>
<br/>
The game is a Card game/Roleplaying game 
<br/>
<br/>
if anyone is interested please e-mail me here <a href="mailto:lionheart_LH@hotmail.com">lionheart_LH@hotmail.com</a> or reply here 
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a few questions
<br/>
<br/>
1) is it possible to create  a day and night effect
<br/>
2) is it possible to add weather
<br/>
3) can the player be able to customize there character?
<br/>
4) can the GBA handle transport ie cars etc for xample if the player wished to drive a car
<br/>
5) can the GBA handle longe games in hours of gameplay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your answers :)

Yes, given enough time/budget, you can basically do anything you want to do.

I'm not sure what you mean.  Of course you can add a car mode to a game.  It's not safe to drive a real car and play gameboy at the same time.

I think the GBA has about a 10 hour battery life without a light.  Feel free to use google to find the exact battery life.

Even more with a card game. I doubt too much would be happening on the screen at most points of the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
