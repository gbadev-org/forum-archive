    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am seeking the aid of an artist to help with an entry for the upcoming compo.  
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I'm doing all the art myself, and it is not quite good enough.  I think the game would be much better with a facelift.  
<br/>
<br/>
A little about the game:
<br/>
<br/>
It is actually two games in one.  A basketball game and a football game.  They are simple arcade style games (We're not talking NBA Live and NFL2K5 here).  If you've played any sports games on the touchscreen at the bar, then you know the kind of game I mean.
<br/>
<br/>
The art needs are probably less than 10 sprites, 2 backgrounds, main menu screens.  We are probably talking three animated sprites (maybe 4 frames each) of 1 basketball player (shooting), 2 football players (Reciever - running &amp; catching and a quarterback -- throwing).
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am around 90% finished with the basketball game (lacking sound and good graphics).  The only thing I have finished with the football game is the concept.  But I feel I have allowed enough time to finish it.  If not, then I guess I'll just enter the basketball game into the compo (But that is NOT the goal.)
<br/>
<br/>
So if you are looking for a motivated partner to team up with, drop me an email at: expos1994(at)yahoo.com.  I'll send you a lot more info on the game.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I was going to post this at the pixelation forums, but you have to have 15 posts to start a new topic.  I just didn't feel qualified enough to criticize people's art 15 times, so I hope artists check these forums.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
