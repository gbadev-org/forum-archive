    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey team,
<br/>
<br/>
I need somebody with the following skills:
<br/>
<br/>
- GBA C programming
<br/>
- Basic sample editing in ModPlugTracker (ability to edit CD-quality sounds down to sample-quality, add them to S3M songs for compilation into the project. No composing required... basically just adding sound effects.)
<br/>
- Decent photoshop skills (ability to take existing, layered PSDs and make changes to them, export to 8-bit color, and run command line converters to GBA data formats.)
<br/>
- Ability to burn carts from a PC (I can provide the burning hardware and carts)
<br/>
- Ideal candidate would be willing and able to work directly with the client to assess needs and make changes. (Via email. I don't think face to face is necessary.)
<br/>
- If you're in Colorado, that's a huge bonus, but not necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
Work is basically taking an old GBA project of mine and making changes and updates as the client needs them. Probably a few hours of work to start, and from there an occasional change order as the client wants 'em. Could lead to a much larger contract.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll pay as much as $100 per hour for the right candidate, though I'll want to start on a fixed-bid basis to test drive you. 
<br/>
<br/>
PM me if you're interested and have the skills above.
<br/>
<br/>

I made a sample image in CS3 and deselected compatibility mode.  The image opened fine in whatever ancient version of GIMP for Windows I have installed.  The image used 5 or 6 layers, and one of them was set to ~33% alpha.  The only thing I noticed was that the layers were sized to the bounding boxes of the used pixels when I opened them in the GIMP.  Admittedly, there are probably ways to make files that will trip the GIMP.
<br/>
<br/>
If the risk of lost image quality / potential bugs in the GIMP's PSD code is a big deal, photoshop should be used.

As proof of my skills, I have a homebrew GBA game, for which I did all of the graphics and wrote a custom music player (in addition to the rest of its programming, excepting what it uses from libgba.)  It's not publicly available at this time, but I will happily send it to you on request.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Old versions of PSD yes. New versions of PSD just show "You need a new version of Photoshop" in a dozen languages in black text on a white background.

I tried a PSD with multiple layers.  One of them was semitransparent.  Otherwise, no.  Did they not work when you checked?

I managed to create a PSD that the GIMP can't open.  =)

<ul>tower.psd  - Original file that appears to work.
<br/>
psdfx-nc.psd - File does not work, compatibility mode deselected. 
<br/>
psdfx-yc.psd - Same file, does not work even with compatibilitiy mode.
<br/>
psdfx.png - PNG export of the image.  This is what the image is supposed to look like.</ul>Evidently a copy of photoshop may or may not be needed depending on exactly what is going on inside of the PSD.
