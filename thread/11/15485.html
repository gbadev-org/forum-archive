    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ya no more quake engine i got a better idea.Adding 3d models to the dsdoom engine for enemys only!
<br/>
<br/>
so simon j hall or silent code or anyone for that matter if you can edit the dsdoom just enough for it to support 3d enemy models.
<br/>
if you think its a to hard to code then thats ok i will scrap this idea also.
<br/>
and i will give "FULL CREDIT" to who ever helps me (or does it for me)
<br/>
and i all i want is 3d enemys thats it nothing more nothing less i even have the 3dmodels made
<br/>
<br/>
ps 
<br/>
i know punctuation and grammar is shit so dont say things like shooting off someones head thats just sick (even if it is sarcasm)

"entertaining" is the right word, simon. ;^D he could try to render the models into the sprite graphics (not talking about capturing into hw sprites, which the nds is capable of), that would require minimal changes to the engine.

The first step would probably involve making Doom use the 3D hardware for walls, floors, and sprites, just like several PC Doom source ports, Doom 64, and Duke Nukem 64.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

@ sniper (109): please read the WHOLE post before you do ANYTHING else.
<br/>
<br/>
what kind of joke is that?
<br/>
<br/>
the following is a serious question: is there a possibility that you are mentally retarded or have some malfunction? (note that i don't mean to disrespect anyone with that question. but it's a fact that some poor people *are* retarded.)
<br/>
<br/>
i expect the answer to follow implicitly with your next post(s).
<br/>
<br/>
back to what you wrote:
<br/>
why would you have a mokey that throws poo on me? how can that not be personal? what did i do to you?
<br/>
<br/>
do you realize that i have helped people on the forum on quite some occasions (i have even helped simon with some theory on quake, that's why he's mentioned me in the "thanks") and i'm spending about 90% of my forum time trying to help beginners. do you realize that what you do is highly disrespectful and contraproductive?
<br/>
<br/>
if you choose to refuse the help we offer, then please, i honestly encourage you to leave the forum! i can't and won't force you to do that. i have no personal grief against you or anybody else on this forum. in fact, i don't even care much about if you leave or not.
<br/>
<br/>
all we (if i may allow myself to say so) wanted is to help you to get into the community and find someone that would join your project. that includes advises on how to behave around this forum to be accepted and treated seriously.
<br/>
nothing helped so far. i think i am a little bit sorry for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i would even go so far and bet you are the coward that gave lot's of negative ratings to the doom3ds programmer on youtube, because he didn't want to program your stuff. if i had a youtube account, i'd ...
<br/>
i'll stop the flaming at this point. it's senseless. ("this is chubaka. now, dear jury, does that make sense? think about it! does that make sense? no! what does that have to do with this case? nothing! it doesn't make sense!")</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just because of that my first game should be at least somewhat good.
<br/>
Seriously though, you can look through pretty much any of silent's posts, he is always at least trying to help people out (me being one of those people). The fact that anyone would want a *chimpanzee* (not chimpan Z, that sounds like some anime show) to throw poop at him scares me. I am once again out of chips, and don't feel like making popcorn right now. Quite a predicament, I know. With this final statement I leave.

i think this was for me. although, i am just wondering why he would call me a stupid freak? i mean, he's the one that wanted to have a chimpanzee to throw poop at me...
<br/>
<br/>
i'm thankful that i'm more than ten years older than him. but even his age, i wasn't that... special.
<br/>
technically speaking, i am not stupid. the numbers are telling me it's quite the opposite, although i don't think of myself as an overly intelligent person.
<br/>
<br/>
but: where from does he know that i am a <a class="postlink" href="http://home.pages.at/rebirthband/jorge/c_im-pan-z.png" target="_blank">freak</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
after all, sniper, i wish you good luck. you know "the same people" are the *only* people willing to interact with you. all others simply *ingore* you for what you do (and how you do it.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"The dude" probably told you to join the forum and *learn* to program for the NDS (or in general)... or to find programmers that are interested in your projects, but sure not to ask people to do the dirty work for you.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference between searching peers for a project and asking people to do things for you. Again, if nobody finds your idea interesting enough, you have to move on, until you either know how to realize your ideas yourself or you come up with an idea that others will like and help you realize. But either way, there will always be a lot of work on your side and people need to see that you are willing to do most of the work yourself, if that's programming or art or anything else. Nobody will work for you, but with you and if people see that you ask for things, so that you can tell everyone it's "your" demo/mod/whatever, although you did virtually nothing for it, you're standing pritty much alone.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as NDS editing. You can modify the hardware, but I guess that's not what you want. "Creating" for the NDS would be a better term. If you're just editing/moding DS DooM, that's not NDS specific. There are aspects of the port, that *are* platform specific, but I rather doubt, that you touch any of it.
<br/>
<br/>
My advise, again, is: Look at some general programming tutorials, then take the NDS examples and work with those until you are familiar enough to realize your ideas by yourself.
<br/>
If you're not willing to take that years-long trip, get another hobby. That's my honest advise.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

You could offer to pay people.  =P
<br/>
Not only do people like money, it attaches a dollar amount to the dedication you have for your project.

Seeing as many projects have zero dedicated dollars, that can go a long way in spelling out how serious you are, even if it is just a token amount.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, imho, it's nothing but the truth. We've all gone, more or less, through the same cycle and most of us (including me) are still learning. I guess it's like "the more you know, the better you understand how little you really know."
<br/>
<br/>
The trick is, to overcome this and that is the hardest part, no matter what you do, if you're programming, writing books, painting, making music... You will allways find your boundaries, and to get better, you have to break through, even though you can be asured, that there are countless new ones out there. You need to keep going and eventually, new things will start becoming easier to understand, as you build up your knowledge and skills.
<br/>
<br/>
At some point you will look back and think to yourself, that you have accomplished very much, starting with very little. That's the ultimate reward, at least for me.

Anyone ought to be able to scrape up five dollars eventually.  Admittedly, my only source of income as a teen was birthdays checks every year as I did not have an allowance.  The point is that your commitment to the project needs to be evident.  There are some kids out there with nothing but commitment to offer their projects.  Some of them get help with their projects.

<br/>
I even separated the sprites and sounds from each other maps and textures in the cdoom aka (console_doom) and the rest of the stuff in the doom64
<br/>
so if you dont like the map's you can always find a better wad.cdoom64/ds
<br/>
was probobly the best coop wad on skulltag but i haven't tried multiplayer on dsdoom yet so here's a fun request.
<br/>
get a buddy over and try it out,and tell me what was good and what need's improvement

btw

when your playing the cdoom64.wad the bottom screen is skyblue instead of black because of the custom playpal and colormap.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/1987-bmw-750il/" target="_blank">1987 bmw 750il</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://top-car-images.com/2003-bmw-m3-csl/" target="_blank">2003 bmw m3 csl</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
