    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As my game <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tolberts.net/anguna/" target="_blank">Anguna</a> is nearing completion, I still don't have quite enough in the way of music for it.  
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a little bit of music that was composed for the game at one point, but was unfinished.  I'm looking for someone that could either finish and polish the existing music*, or would be interested in composing their own music for the game. (2-4 pieces).
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you are interested.
<br/>
<br/>
*I've got 2 decent pieces.  One is pretty much done, the other is a 7-second loop on a theme, which would need to be expanded to something like a 21 or 28 second loop based on the same theme, only with a little more variation.  If all I had was somebody that could expand that second piece, I'd be a happy man</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Specifically, I'm using kusma's pimpmobile for a music player, which supports .xm right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you have any budget for this? You can get a lot better response if you can pay something for a composer's time.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have a budget, you might try:

<br/>
<br/>
Skaven lets you use his music for free in your games, or at least he used to.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, no budget.  I know it would help, but I'm sortof going for the "hey, you're game is almost done, I'd love to have my music in a relatively polished, finished game" demographic :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll check out Skaven.  I was using some freely licensed music before, but the problem is that if the music isn't written for gba or something similar, you usually end up with huge samples that really bloat the rom.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm interested. I wrote the music for one of the games in the 2004Mbit compo. I'd like to hear what you already have so that I can write something that fits with it, and I'd like to know what kind of size you're shooting for.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It might be worth looking into Sound Ideas stock music.  It is not free and the samples are not tracked, but ~$200 for reusable stock music tracks isn't bad either.  If you go this route, be sure to read their liscense- especially the part about producing lots of copies.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I appreciate the idea, sgeos.  Unfortunately, the budget doesn't allow for it.  What I thought was one child on the way has turned out to be twins!

(I'm trying to scramble to finish the game before they come...I figure I'll never get ANYTHING done after that!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
