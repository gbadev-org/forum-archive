    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Greetings. My name is Daniel Bushman, and I am heading the production of a GBA RPG called "Lucitoth: The Uprising"
<br/>
Lucitoth is going well, as we have just picked up some vital members on the development team. Thuse far our team is:
<br/>
<br/>
Jason Fry and myself - Programmers
<br/>
Steve Oven - Pixel artist ( <a href="http://www.spritedomain.net" target="_blank">http://www.spritedomain.net</a>)
<br/>
Les Denis - Concept art (formerly employed at Marvel comics)
<br/>
Mike Reilly - Mathmatics - Game engineer
<br/>
Zack Parrish - Music
<br/>
<br/>
We will have a new site up and running shortly, but we are currently working on getting another programmer as well as someone to do the map design. We have a deadline of December 23rd from a publisher that wants a 1/2 hour playable demo. The work is all in C++ and you will be payed flat rate or royalties.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know.
