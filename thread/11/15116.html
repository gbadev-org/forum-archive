<br/>
The AGENIUS team consists of highly skilled and passionate designers, programmers and artists, and we are continuously looking for the best and the brightest technical and artistic talents around the globe to strengthen our core development team.
<br/>
<br/>
We take pride in our unique down-to-earth atmosphere cultivated by an enthusiastic, skilled and fun group of individuals. We invite you to apply to become a member of our team.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">ENVIRONMENT</span>
<br/>
Being comfortable at work is top priority at AGENIUS Interactive. Focusing on work environment is important in order to cultivate creative energy. We don't like to call our workplace the "office", or not even a "workplace". We like to call it our second home.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">ORGANIZATION</span>
<br/>
We believe the success of our projects is built, in part, upon the friendships that support the projects, and partly in how we organize the workplace.
<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the space we chose is very open, fostering a free exchange of ideas, discussions and brainstorming.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">OPEN FRIDAYS</span>
<br/>
Every Friday we set aside a few hours to empty our minds and refill with new creative inspiration. This can be a team session or workshop about drawing, painting, sculpting, animation, photography, video, design, acting or even music. Or it can be looking into a movie, comic, book, magazine, artwork or other cultural or social elements that we just find cool to share with each other.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">PERKS &amp; OUTINGS</span>
<br/>
Our staff invests a lot of passion and energy into our projects and we reward this by re-investing in our employees through perks in and out of the office.
<br/>
<br/>
Regular company trips help bond the team together, and it includes annual weekend trips, parties and social outings like movie nights, shows, poker nights, game tournaments etc. The idea is to foster an environment in which the employees can pursue a healthy and well-balanced lifestyle.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">SELF-DEVELOPMENT</span>
<br/>
"From new input comes new output". This is the core idea for innovative thinking at AGENIUS. We build our entire business on innovation and creativity, and individuals with an open and hungry mind will fit well with our group.
<br/>
<br/>
AGENIUS supports talented and loyal team members with education and courses.
