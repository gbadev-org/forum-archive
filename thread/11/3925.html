    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Vangarde's Tale has been in development in various forms since August 2001. It is an action/adventure game in the tradition of Zelda, but with an emphasis on story-telling and giving players influence over what outcomes they experience (multiple player characters, multiple endings, etc.).
<br/>
<br/>
You can get a small preview of the game at:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lightspirestudios.com" target="_blank">www.lightspirestudios.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
In anticipation of securing a publisher deal soon, we are looking to ramp up our staff.  
<br/>
<br/>
Any programmers out there interested in a paid game development job? Areas of development:
<br/>
AI, Combat, Dialogue, Effects, Background Engine, Interface, External Tools, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
This is your chance then to apply early and get a jump on the competition. Hiring will be subject to a publisher deal, but if it goes through then work will have to start immediately.
<br/>
<br/>
Pay varies and depends on experience and proven abilities (i.e. demo and source samples), but expect a professional level of pay ($2000-$5000+ month) plus benefits and relocation assistance for employees. We will probably require contractor work  to a much lesser extent as well (no relocation).
<br/>
<br/>
Send your resumes and demos to:

<br/>
I just heavily edited the initial post. Because we have some publisher interest at this point, we'd like to get a headstart on putting together our technical team in the event that a deal is closed soon.
<br/>
<br/>
If you look at our website, you will notice a page of screenshots. The quality is good, but we will be working hard to far surpass what we've already done to really make this game a number one contender on the GBA in its category. We are a small company and you will have the opportunity to contribute to the design of our games, work in a fun environment, and develop new skills.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Background info:</span>
<br/>
Lightspire Studios was founded officially in 2002 by Matthew Roberts and myself. We were friends in college at Syracuse University and graduated in 2000. Matt is the lead designer and has BA degrees in Medieval Renaissance, English and Texual Studies, and Magazine Journalism (Newhouse School of Journalism, SU). My BS degree is in Computer Science, I've worked as a contractor for a high-tech company writing scientific infrared analysis tools for 3 years (see RView at <a href="http://www.indigosystems.com/product/rtools.html" target="_blank">http://www.indigosystems.com/product/rtools.html</a> ), and I'm currently working on a MBA degree. I've also been a hobbyist game developer since 1992 and I've been known to dabble in graphics and video as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Brooks,
<br/>
<br/>
Where is lightspire studios located, or where will it be located if the deal goes through? I think this could affect which developers are interested.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We had a physical office location in Florida last year, but closed it until we can raise funding.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, we will likely be opening up in Texas where I'm currently located which is El Paso. El Paso is a full day's drive from LA going west and about 7 hours drive from Austin going east. It's located on the Mexican border and the New Mexico border, and about 2 million people live here (between Juarez, MX and El Paso). It is surrounded by mountains and has a dry desert climate. There is the University of Texas with over 18,000 students attending where I'm currently pursuing an MBA degree. The cost of living is very low here as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
The disclaimer here is that El Paso would likely be a temporary location until we finish the project and get established. We'd definitely take a more strategic look at the cost/benefits of locating elsewhere such as southern California, Austin, Florida, etc. So flexibility in this area is an important aspect.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, because we are a corporation we have the ability to issue stock options as additional incentives (not in lieu of salary mind you). A smaller studio has more job security risk, but if successful then the rewards are also higher. This is one way to quantify that risk, and something we certainly want to make a part of our company.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
