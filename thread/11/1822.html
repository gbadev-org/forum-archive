    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Welcome to AeroWolf, L.L.C.  We are a new internet supersite project that was recently started- and based around game/music development.  However, we still haev unfilled positions revolving around console/handheld development.  Pay is on a percentage base- with very few GBA developers, you can possibly get a full 2% of the company's profit (which can be a very nice sum.)  Job-dependant, not wages- We estimate the time a job should take and reward accordingly- no long 8 hour shifts, and the convenience of working from your living room.  Mind you, the company is still under development, but with a few people willing to work hard and fast to get a few GBA games <span style="font-weight: bold">completed</span> before GBA goes out of fashion, we can sell rights and get paychecks to all of you A.S.A.P.  Did you know a fully developed game can possibly sell for over <span style="font-weight: bold">2,000,000.000</span> dollars?  Figure what two percent of that is: about $200,000.000.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hhhmmmm.... no offense but my own computation gives me:
<br/>
<br/>
2,000,000.000 x 2% = 40,000.000</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A 2 with 9 zeroes makes it 2 billion dollars, right? Well, that's never gonna happen! Even if they'd take the retail price instead of the percentage the company gets from that, it is still a bs value.
<br/>
<br/>
A full priced (PS2/Xbox/GC) game sells at about 70 euro's. This is almost equal to 70 US dollars. So if you divide 2.000.000.000 by 70, you come to a figure of 28571428 -&gt; Little under 30 million copies.
<br/>
<br/>
Most games are selling very well when they sell *one* million copies.
<br/>
<br/>
...In other words; This is a bullshit post.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks you.<br/>_________________<br/>If everything fails, read the manual: If even that fails, post on forum!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
so the last three zeros are 1/1000s of dollars. So he speaks about millions of dollars, not billions.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Sweex, I agree with you that it seems suspicious, not to say bullshit ! :O)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey hey guys its no big deal, Jaybee here has a vision and high hopes, theres nothing wrong with that. Yeah 2% of 2mil would be 40k but thats still pretty good money for a startup company. Maybe he's gotta plan. It don't matter how unrealistic u guys think it is, u dont need to flame him bout it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello again; and I thank you for your interest in this.  Actually the whole figure concept was a typo along with yes, a mathematical error for which I apologize.  The actual figure is close to two million dollars.  (or 60%.) As for the company, its been started locally for about 1 year, develpoing concepts and we provided free college education to our members.  But then due to an accident, we were forced to unband.  So now I am trying to restart our work in the digital world where fewer accidents can actually stop development.  The website is drafted but I was hoping to raise my staff before actually uploading it.  If you have any more specific questions I would be glad to answer them.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to say that I despise the fact that flaming on the list was not enough but that I also received 36 flame emails with it; among a few (less than ten) positive ideas.  
<br/>
<br/>
And as for an email I got from GAMETITAN, I wish to inform you that AeroWolf, L.L.C. IS a registered company, unlike so many groups, and that I'm NOT asking for people to work for free, I'm just asking for the commitment to hang in there until you get paid (which wouldn't be too long, I have several backup ideas so everyone gets theirs even if a game fails.).  To me, its not about the money.  To be honest I don't recieve more than $100.00 a year for my work, because its about the accomplishments; so I give everyone else their share, and to me payment enough is just leveing off above zero, geting everyone paid and happy, and having a completed project.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, you can communicate with me onlist, or through email - <a href="mailto:aerowolf@cvinternet.net">aerowolf@cvinternet.net</a>  .  Whichever is more convenient for you.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time.<br/>_________________<br/>-Jaybee
