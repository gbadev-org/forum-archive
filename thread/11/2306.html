    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We are 2 programmers (both at our 3rd university year and with professional experience as video game programmers) and we are doing a 2d isometric "hack and slash" game (something like Diablo). We already have beginning the game, but we are using Diablo screenshots for our graphics. The salary is fair...something aroud 0$ (i say fair because that's what it gives us too). You may wonder : "What have i to win in this ?". We think that we are able to build a professional looking game (we will spend a lot of time on this) wich could be used as a demo to get a job in this industry...and since we both worked in video games company (www.hexacto.com and <a href="http://www.a2m.com" target="_blank">www.a2m.com</a>) we have some contacts.
