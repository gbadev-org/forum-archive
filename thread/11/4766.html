    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I do a little programming and have done a simple pokemon clone - I never finished it though...... but want to make a crash bandicoot clone. I can animate in lightwave but lack the creativity to make a bandicoot type character, I dunno and squirrel with sunglasses or something. If any of you 3d people want to help out an un-artistic programmer I would be very grateful. I can do world objects but just not very good at characters.....
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers.
<br/>
