<br/>
I am going to make a practise game. A gba version of the game Excite QTE 2 found in the arcades of the Dreamcast and Xbox game Shenmue (2x). This is primarily a programming excersize but will be released with full source code when finished and I do not have any money to pay.
<br/>
<br/>
The A button needs to be round and red.
<br/>
The B button needs to be blue and round.
<br/>
The X buttons beeds to represent the R button in shape and needs to be yellow.
<br/>
The Y button needs to represent the L button in shape and needs to be green.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus one Directional Arrow wich can be turned al 4 ways with sprite registers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
