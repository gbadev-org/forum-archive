    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">bedroom-coder is a virtual development studio, members of which collaborate together via the web.
<br/>
<br/>
Recently, bedroom-coder's first project, an ambitious* real-time tactics title for a variety of systems, which include the GBA as well as the Mac and PC, entered the initial stages of development - the project is now at the stage of development where an artist, preferably an artist skilled in low-colour low-resolution 2D, is needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, no further details of the project can be revealed here - if you're interested, further details will be sent by email - but rest assured that this isn't a project for which our enthusiasm will quickly wane, as the title has been in pre-production for several months now - detailed design docs, technical docs, tools, and tests have all been created.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, no money can be guaranteed at this time, due to the title not yet being signed with a publisher - we expect to start speaking with publishers during August, at the latest. If you're interested in helping with the project, money will be discussed by email.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in this project and want to collaborate with us, can remain committed and motivated to a project, and have examples or a portfolio of art to show us, please email us at <a href="mailto:recruitment@bedroom-coder.com">recruitment@bedroom-coder.com</a>.
<br/>

*Ambitious, but neither newbie nor naive - be assured that we're not trying to create 't3h n3w m4ss1v3ly mult1pl4y3r f1nal f4nt5y!!!1!1' as our first title.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
