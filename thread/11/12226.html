    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone who is interested in some GBA flashcart hacking? I'd like to program a custom menu system to switch between ROMs, but I don't know how to do bankswitching on the carts that I'm using, and I don't have the time to spend figuring it out myself.
<br/>
<br/>
I can do all of the menu programming... I just need someone to tell me how to activate the bank switching. ("Write XYZ to a certain location in SRAM", etc.), and what my tools would ultimately need to do to construct the final ROM ("append your binary ROMs at 64KB intervals", etc)
<br/>
<br/>
I know that the carts support bank switching, because the cart writing software that comes with them has a cheesy little menu program built in. (I.E., if you burn 6 ROMS at once, it presents a list to choose from at launch time.)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure who the manufacturer is, but I don't think these are "standard " carts. Pogoshell doesn't work, for example. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll mail a cart along with a writer cable and the Windows software. If you can do it, and provide me with a C Code example of it working, I'll pay you $100 US and you can keep the hardware. If you can't do it, I'll pay the shipping to send the stuff back to me.
<br/>
<br/>
PM me if you're seriously interested. I can only accept one applicant at a time, so be sure to tell me why you're the best candidate.
<br/>
<br/>
Thankee,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could have a look at the menu code. If you can supply software that already does the bank-switching then it shouldn't be too hard to reverse engineer the method used.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
