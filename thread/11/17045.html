    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">drunkencoders.com &amp; devkitpro.org are in need of a web designer/programmer with experience of Wordpress and php/mysql. We're in the middle of some major site revamping and attempting to help build a bigger community.
<br/>
<br/>
We have some fairly specific things in mind so we're not so much looking for ideas as help with implementation.
<br/>
<br/>
For more details PM me with some examples of your work or come talk to us in #dsdev on irc.blitzed.org.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if both forum has the same kind of database and use the same kind of forum software, then it shouldn't be that much of a problem (I think). joining 2 accounts togetter may give some difficulties.
<br/>
<br/>
it would be cool to see alot of websites joined togetter. it would give more of a community feeling. for instance, devkitPro.org, gbadev.org, dsdev.org, <a href="http://www.dev-scene.com," target="_blank">www.dev-scene.com,</a> drunkencoders.com, ndshb.com ect. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a more centralised homebrew archive would also be a good idea.

this is a joint effort between devkitPro.org and drunkencoders, drunkencoders is also in the process of absorbing dev-scene.com content at the request of that site's maintainer.  Our goal is your goal ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Most of our needs revolve around integrating the sites with a consistent shared user base as well as expanding wpmu to better handle our content needs  (game development resources for which we have a lot of specific ideas we would prefer to discus offline).
<br/>
<br/>
And Wordpress gurus out there?  A lot of work has been done but much remains.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
