<br/>
I am looking for a good and motivated NDS developer, preferably with official SDK experience (at least with a lot of libnds experience) for a 3 months contract. It will be about making a casual game for small kids. The work will be done in our small studio in Paris, France, as a command from an editor. It's a position available ASAP. The developer must be fluent with French.
<br/>
Competitive salary.
