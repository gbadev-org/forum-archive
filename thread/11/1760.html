    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Greetings,
<br/>
I have been working on concept for an RPG called "<span style="font-weight: bold">Lucitoth: The Uprising</span>" 
<br/>
for sometime now and recently began pulling together a dev team to
<br/>
switch it from it's current platform to the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently our staff consists of:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1 Programmer
<br/>
2 Sprite Artists
<br/>
1 Tile Artist
<br/>
1 Composer
<br/>
1 Concept artist (currently employed by Marvel Comics as well)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
We are looking to grab two/three more people for the dev team.  We
<br/>
would like to find one <span style="font-weight: bold">semi-experienced (at least) programmer, one
<br/>
background artist and possibly another tile artist.  </span>
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone on the staff is very easy to get along with and very hard
<br/>
working.  We are planning on being finished with at least a demo by the
<br/>
end of this year.  I have some contacts at various game publishing
<br/>
companies who would be interested in seeing something by then.
<br/>
<br/>
Payment would be in the form of royalties.  I am sorry that I cannot offer
<br/>
a flat rate, as this is our first title.  You will, however, be immediately
<br/>
granted 40 mb of space on our server (http://www.eg-games.com/yourfolder)
<br/>
for whatever you like.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested and would like to know more about this project,
<br/>
please contact me via AIM (mrmacabreman), or through e-mail
<br/>
(jobs@eg-games.com).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
