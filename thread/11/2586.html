    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im recently delving into the world of gba programming and would like to contact some like minded individuals in programming together.
<br/>
<br/>
My intended goal is to primarily learn much about programming for gba, and hopefully make some game oriented demos. from there, the sky is the limit. 
<br/>
<br/>
so if you are interested in working on a gba project, and are willing to invest time into one. please contact me.
