    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you can only find them in online stores. You might be able to find a video game store that is a one of a kind type of store with imported games.
<br/>
<br/>
Also when porting <span style="font-style: italic">Quake II</span> I think you might need a flash card instead of a cable that runs multiboot. You would need a lot more space than what multiboot offers. This is a hard project since rewriting the rendering engine and optimizing it could take a long time.

<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
