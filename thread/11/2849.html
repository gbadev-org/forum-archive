    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi chaps.  Looks like being a coder these days really pays off huh?
<br/>
You guys sure are in demand.
<br/>
<br/>
'NeverMet games' are looking for a couple of coders.  We're developing a commercial quality GBA driving sim that we fully intend to sell to a publisher.  At the moment, we're just a home dev team, but if we can finish this project and get it released, we'll be a recognised studio.
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't matter where you are or how much XP you've got.  But you DO need time and the want to work on the game.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not your usual racing game - it's something a bit different that we think will stand out from the crowd.
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, we have 2 artists, 2 coders a sound guy and myself - the designer and producer.  We've hit some problems with one of the coders having some serious problems meaning he won't be able to commit to spending time on the game.
<br/>
<br/>
We're desperate here - work is free, but royalties will be paid if the game gets completed and released.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How 'bout some info on what the game is like? Is it 3D, top-down, mode7? And how closeis it to being finished? 
<br/>
I have my own game to work on, so I doubt I'll actually join up, but I've always kind of wanted to do a 3D racer, and 3D is especially fun to play with on the GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The game is 2D top-down, they're still on the first milestone code-wise (a fair amount of the graphics have already been assembled).
<br/>
<br/>
It's a good project and a good group of people if anyone is interested, and it's definitely not the same as your average racer... I am the one having to excuse most of my time from it, on account of my grandmother being extremely (looking like terminally) ill and me having to spend a lot of my free time looking after her.
<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone's interested it's a great opportunity to get your feet wet in some community dev work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the kind words Dan.  I hope things are as well as can be for you...
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested, please email me and I'll send you the design concept.
<br/>
<br/>
As Dan said, it's basically a top down 2D driving game, but it's not your usual racer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, we've now got our two replacement coders, so things look much better again.  But we really need that third one to help them out.  There's still a lot to do and three coders would get the job done right!
<br/>
<br/>
LMK chaps!
