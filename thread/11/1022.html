    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This might be a silly question but are you talking Java platform for the Cell Phone, Symbion OS, microsofts phone or something else? There is a broad spectrum of platforms offered for Cell phones, and it seems to very from vendor to vendor much.
<br/>
<br/>
My assumption you are looking for Nokia phone experience (which I have none :) ).  However it might help others who see your programmer wanted advertisement to know a few more details like that.
