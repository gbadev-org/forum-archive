    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am in serious need of a pixel artist to create some sprites for me to finish up a 2d demo.  The game is actually for the PC, but i plan on porting the engine over to the GBA when i'm done with it.  What i need is some one who can do a run/walk sequence, jump sequence, attack sequence and death sequence for 3 characters and a shoot (3 directions) and death sequence for a 4th character.  I also need some environment sprites like tree branches, rocks, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
I have concept art and level art allready that i can show you in an early alpha of the demo to give a feel for what i need.  I will hopefully have a full alpha with place holder art by the next week (march 8), and a beta by  the next week(march 15).
<br/>
<br/>
There is no money involved, but your name will be put in the credits of the game so you will have a portfolio piece.  And the game can not be used for any commercial sales.  Let me know if your interested, i need these images no later than march 22.
<br/>
<br/>
I would prefer serious/experience artitst, but since i need that assets and can't draw myself I'm willing to work with anyone who can guarntee me something by the dates i need it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Could you tell me a bit more about your game?
<br/>
<br/>
SideScroller? Top-down? 3/4?
<br/>
<br/>
Genre? 
<br/>
<br/>
Story?
<br/>
<br/>
Who are the 3 characters? 
<br/>
<br/>
Are they making hand-to-hand attacks with weapons or bare hands or something else?
<br/>
<br/>
How many frames in the walk cycle/action cycles?
<br/>
<br/>
What size of sprites?
<br/>
<br/>
I may be interested in helping out... I have some animation tools I've been working on to do just this sort of thing. You can see a little bit of my artwork at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thingker.com" target="_blank">www.thingker.com</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ScottLininger.com" target="_blank">www.ScottLininger.com</a>... I don't have much pixel art up there, but that's why I'm interested (grow my portfolio.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
