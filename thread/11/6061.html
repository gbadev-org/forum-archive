    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering if anyone has a source for buying dev-ready DS hardware, meaning a DS with upgraded firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
There might be a few of us lazy types who would rather pay extra $$$ than spend time doing it ourselves. 
<br/>
<br/>
If someone is interested in doing this for me, PM me and we'll talk price. Thanks!
