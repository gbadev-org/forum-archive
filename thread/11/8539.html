    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking for a programmer for "Through Eternity: Tactics," a game my friend Nathan and I have been planning for a long time. I've been writing a lot of backstory and planning details for a while, and he's been choosing the best spriting style. 
<br/>
<br/>
While this was originally going to be for the computer, our programmer bailed on us, and we decided to try moving it the the GBA, because I've been into GBA development lately. I decided I'd try on this forum, since I thought there might be someone willing here.
<br/>
<br/>
This will be a 'fun' project, not a paid one, which might turn a lot of people off, but hopefully someone is interested.
<br/>

<a class="postlink" href="http://naveadair.mobius-x.com/bunches.png" target="_blank">This is the sprite style we like most at the moment. (Note: Nathan is working on a nice mock-up scene at the moment, I'll change this to that when he finishes it.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested? I'll be adding more over time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A "fun RPG project" won't get finished.  An RPG takes 60 to 300+ man months to complete.  Assuming no art, if you can complete the whole thing without changing your spec midway AND you already have your tools made, you should be able to complete it in 20 to 40 man months.
<br/>
<br/>
A "for fun" team won't stay interested for that long.

<br/>
<br/>
Then you get people like us who make the game engines, but nothing ever gets finished, because making the content is so boring.

<br/>
I think we need some sort of exchange program between gbadev and those rpgMaker sites :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For the GBA?  It's pretty even in my experience, with maybe a 3/2 artist/coder team.  For 3D AAA games it's Connnnnteeennntt.  But that's only because the modeller, 3D library, physics engine and sound engine have probably already been developed and you don't need to count their development cost.
<br/>
<br/>
I know for the games I worked on, the first game we did I spent a ton of time working on the level/sprite editor as well as the game code.  Then later on, they mostly only required the occasional feature or bug fix so the game code got correspondingly more attention.
<br/>
<br/>
The later games also got larger/better content as the artists started really hitting their stride with the custom tools and were able to churn things out crazy fast.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Art will typically require more man-hours, but it is also easier to parallelize.  To get art done faster, it's often possible to just "throw in" another artist, but doing the same for a team of coders can cause a lot of overhead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
