    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking to create a small team of developers to make a small game for GBA. If any of you are interested, please contact me. I have only started graphics, and my lack of programming experience is holding me back from going much further. I'm a one man team at the moment. I'd like to make this a serious endeavor and make it worth anyones while. The game could be based on anything really... RPG's mostly though... If anyone has any suggestions I'd be happy to discuss anything really.
<br/>
<br/>
NEEDED:
<br/>
<br/>
Programmers,
<br/>
<br/>
2D artists,
<br/>
<br/>
MUSIC composers.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe that is it. If you are interested contact me right away.
<br/>
thank-you for your time.

<br/>
My first impression of you is that you want to be a game designer on this project. But I, and many other people will be hesitant to help. For example, what will you offer to such a team? What are your strong points as a designer, and weaknesses? Why do people NEED you?
<br/>
<br/>
Like that link I just gave you, I hope this thread isn't meant to recruit people to make your dream game or such. As you can see in that thread, things turned very sour... :(<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would be doing all of the 2D graphics.. well.. unless I could get help... I've created some graphics... I have created a character set... I will send it to you if you want to see it... other then that.. we'd start from there with graphics.. if I had a programmer.. we could debate all of these things and I would create the graphics based on what he/she wants to see.. well.. not entirely.. but.. a shared vision. hahaha, I'm not some stupid idiot trying to come on here with a vision and demanding it be made.. I'm saying.. I want to make... but I cant program worth beans.. I'm trying to learn.. but I'd like some help along the way... umm.. some of my examples can be found in the character design page at:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I couldn't find any examples of 2D sprite work on your page. Sprites are siginficantly different from 3D design or concept artwork. Have you any examples of such work?
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I do not think you will find any programmers willing to collaborate on your project just on the merit of you providing the artwork. You will probably have much greater luck if you collaborate on at least a few other projects first.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you should put you skills to test first; for example beginners who have just leaped up a level need ideas, and artists - devise simple game ideas for them.
<br/>
<br/>
There are pages relating to game design theory ( <a href="http://www.costik.com/nowords.html" target="_blank">http://www.costik.com/nowords.html</a> ), this will help you. When you have your killer ideas; and you are sure you know how to manage a project then you should release your documents.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say that people will be interested, but for those who have no idea of what to create, then your level maps and animation frames may provide everything they need.
<br/>
<br/>
So continue creating maps and graphics; and original game concepts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for your advice, but I'd still rather start up a team.
<br/>
keep in mind that I have completed game boy colour games.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested but are unsure because you think that
<br/>
you and/or I will be unreliable, please contact me anyways.
<br/>
Tell me what you think or give me some advice, or maybe I
<br/>
can convice you to join the team... hahaha<br/>_________________<br/>-some 2D projects completely kick butt... while others just suck... whats yours look like?-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
