    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm an experienced artist/animator in need of a programmer for a Beat em up game Demo. The game is called "Little Bruce" and the main character is based off Bruce Lee. Basically the character finds out triads are pirating his movies and decides to take it to the streets. The draw of the game is Stat building and aquiring new moves from different (made up) schools of martial arts, like the "School of the Aerial Panda". It will also be humorous, with the ability to give enemies wedgies and indian burns for example. I will supply all the art and convert them to sprites according to (your) specifications. The Demo will be 1 level with 4 characters. E-mail me if interested and I'll give you more information! Heres a link to a quick animation I've done. The style will me similar but cleaner (cut and paste link): <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/122079" target="_blank">http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/122079</a>

LOL that's an anoying site :)
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from rediculous pop up counts making a 'cutscene' like that can take a fair bit of fore thought.  Hmmm quite a bit of work needs to go into something like that.  What's your target size 64mbit?
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a script even?
