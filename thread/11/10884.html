    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm currently making the game Naruto - Battle for life and death PC. I'm looking for people who have game maker 6. And who is good at making side scrooling games. I'm not saying thatt I don't know how to di this, but I want to get this project done faster with more people. Game maker 6 is very simple and no coding is requried. If you know how to use Game Maker 6 very well, and you want to help me, just pm me and I'll send you the file. Downside is that I only need two more people.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you can submit Naruto tiles and backgrounds to me, just pm me and send it in email.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tepples, I thought fan games are considered fan 'art'. The last time I checked there was a Pok?mon game (Pok?mon Online) that was considered fan art by Nintendo, and they let the project live as long as it doesn't make profit. 
<br/>
So I think this isn't piracy at all. (Unless you're ripping the art..)
<br/>
<br/>
Zelda DS is based on a commercial game also..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think Jump would turn a blind eye this.  Comic/anime companies tend to turn a blind eye to unoffical ... dirty versions of their comics.  Not that they are competition for the real comics.  At that, this doesn't seem like it would compete with anything Jump or whoever is working on.  (And even if it is, I'd bet a very large sum of money that nobody in a direct position to do anything about it is on this forum.)

Zelda Online, on the other hand, drew a cease-and-desist from Nintendo and had to reskin itself completely into Graal Online.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
