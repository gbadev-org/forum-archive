The application is a tool to help learn foreing vocabulary.  
<br/>
Basically the user can choose his own language and the one to learn, and the program should present words, one a at time, together with a simple picture (to help memorize).  The answer system can be very simple, the user simply selects correct or wrong by himself or It could even make use of handwriting and voice recognition in a latest state.
<br/>
The trick is to use a simple algorithm that keeps showing more frequently the words that the user does not remember and, instead, delays more and more the questions with words that are recognised.  
<br/>
I know that the systems works very well because I have used it my self with flascards.  I also have pictures for more than 200 words and could also provide the audio files containing those words in several languages.
<br/>
I made some draft of the interface design sometime ago thinking about a webpage, but I think the DS is a much better support.
<br/>
<br/>
I can not supply any drugs, alcohol should not be a problem, also I would pay for this and, if anyone wants to come to spain on vacation....

<br/>
I would prefer a Slot-1 application, also I want to keep open the possibility of handwriting and, in any case to make use of the touchscreen to control the program. But if you are familiar with the idea it should be a good starting point.
<br/>
<br/>
PhoenixSoft:
<br/>
When I say languages I mean, at least, 6 or 7: English, Spanish, Catalan, German, French, and also I would like to include Japanesse and Mandarin.
<br/>
In any case, once it's working, it should be easy to include a new language, we just need a translation of the words in written and spoken form. Keep in mind that we would not operate on a full dictionary basis: for a trial system 300 to 500 words would be good enough, and a full functional application could be very workable from 1000 words.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you are totally right, in fact some cases it's much better to work with small sentences than with simple words.  But we have to start somewhere...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
