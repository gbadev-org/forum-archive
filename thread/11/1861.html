    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A friend of mine asked me to help him find a GBA programmer, he's starting on a platform game similar to Megaman (he's a huge fan).  He's one of the best artists out there, I have art of his to back my statement up ;).  So if you're interested please contact me, you can get my contacts from my profile.

Thanks..
