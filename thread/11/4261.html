    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like to find a sprite/tile artist to help in the creation of an RPG game for the GBA.  I'm looking for someone capable of producing SNES quality sprite (ala Final Fantasy IV or VI)
<br/>
<br/>
I myself am horrible at this and would like to produce a real game instead of my Final Fantasy 2 Demos.  
<br/>
<br/>
Please respond, and check out the work in the FF Demo, I am serious about making this game!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! My name is Ryan, I am responding to the post that you sent. Do you still require a pixel artist? I don't have much experience but I work hard and I love working on videogames. Are you still interested?<br/>_________________<br/>3-D graphics in game design are like symbols to a drummer. They are just used to try and cover up how terrible you are.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
