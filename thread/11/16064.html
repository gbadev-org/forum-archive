    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there everybody. I am a newbie with GBA development so I have a question to ask for all of you homebrew developers out there. Are any of you willing to help me make a Portal remake for the GBA? It would be similar to Still Alive DS meaning it would be 2D platforming. I have no experience in coding but I can make all the maps, sprites, menus, etc.  I also have all the controls layed out. If you are willing to help just reply to this post. If you are willing to help I am willing to give an 100% effort in order to produce a quality game.
<br/>
     I am already aware of still Alive DS but I would prefer to have a GBA remake of Portal.  Once Again if you are willing to help just reply to this and any help or comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>***CHIC 'N' STU***</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well It's been awhile since you posted this but I think I might be able to help if you haven't already found someone yet.  I'm aware of what portal is and I've played flash portal as well.  I've never heard of the one of still alive ds though.  I'm still pretty new to homebrew myself but I think I could program this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
