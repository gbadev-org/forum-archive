    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking for work-at-home artists who can make great backgrounds, or can animate 2D animations, or can create and animate 3D models of low-high poly count.
<br/>
<br/>
2D:  Experience with Pro Motion is a plus.  Other programs may be acceptable.
<br/>
3D:  Experience with MilkShape3D is a plus.  3DS Max may be acceptable.
<br/>
<br/>
These are the tools my artists will be using.
<br/>
<br/>
Must have samples or a demo reel, either of which needs to be accesible over the internet.  Must be able to follow orders.  Must be able to accept payment in US dollars.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am more of a pixel artist then a 3d artist, but PM me and maybe we can talk more about the project, like what kind of project it is and payments and stuff. If I know more about the kind of project, then I can better judge if I am able of doing it. Hope you looked at my site, so you can have a look at what I can do.<br/>_________________<br/>-----------------------------------------

I specialize in 2d, 256 and lower color tilesets, backgrounds, and sprites.  If you think I have anything to offer this project, or would like to see more before deciding, feel free to contact me through any of the contacts provided in my profile.
