The world is in need of an interactive fiction interpreter for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
There is one interpreter available right now that I know of, papafuji's DSFrotz (Google it). It plays Inform games, but it's a buggy mess and quite incompatible. Try the game break-in.z5, if it behaves for you like it did for me it won't start at all. Some games require 77 characters per line or something or the words scroll off the edge of the screen, unable to be read. It's also a pain to use in general, there's something wrong with every input method available.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I think we all agree that the DS is a perfect handheld for this type of game. Words on top, nice big keyboard on the bottom. Right? So I'm offering on behalf of the IF-playing community a very small commission, for the completion of an Inform interpreter, of $50 US.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously there hasn't been enough demand for this YET, but I'm hopeful that on the biggest DS community an experienced coder will pick it up for this price to be a nice guy. I tried getting together all the tools for programming in ARM or whatever, but I'm a visual basic guy. I'm not gonna waste my time, I'll never be able to learn it.
<br/>
<br/>
DETAILS:
<br/>
- $50 will be sent via Paypal, so they'll probably take a chunk out of it if you don't have a premium account or whatever. I think this is fair since we already have an open-source interpreter (papafuji's) that really only needs to be cleaned up by someone who knows how. Others can add to the pot if they want to see this get done.
<br/>
- There should be DLDI compatibility with any cart that usually offers it, obviously, to get the .z# files on there.
<br/>
- Should be compatible with like 99% of existing Inform games, excluding badly coded ones or ones that use oddball features.
<br/>
- Can have JUST querty/azerty touch-keyboard as long as it's effective, I don't care about character recognition entry at all.
<br/>
- Must be open-source freeware so it can be put over on the official Inform site when it's done. <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/interpreters.html" target="_blank">http://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/interpreters.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you need more information just ask.
<br/>
<br/>
The IF community is a huge one and this would be a truly useful homebrew. I'm shocked that all the 40-year-olds who played Zork when it came out haven't gotten this right yet.

There are more details at <span style="font-weight: bold">[Same here - MOD]</span>, so please see that for the updates. Thanks for your time, I realize 50 bucks isn't a lot for a project (even if it's this small it may take a long time) but I hope that if you have the skill you'll do it for the huge IF community.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Ikz2 on Thu Feb 05, 2009 2:21 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Anyway, I guess if you have a serious inquiry into the project I can discuss it here, just leave a reply.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It does? So you're saying DSLinux has a port of Frotz prepackaged on it already, or it's out there somewhere and compatible for it?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how it works, really. Does DSLinux actually support normal linux programs or are there linux programs coded specifically for DSLinux?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Seems to be prepackaged.
<br/>
<br/>
DSLinux "actually" supports Linux programs, but they've got to be compiled for the correct ARM processor and respect the system limits etc. etc. So you won't be running x86 binaries on it, which I think is what you meant.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, you're right. It's just normal Frotz recompiled for the DS version of Linux. Awesome. Doesn't look like it's compatible with the brand-new z8 files but it's something to try in the meantime. Thanks for pointing that out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
