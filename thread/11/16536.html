    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am a single person working on a massive gameboy advance sidescroller/fighter. it's going to be similar to dragon ball games for the super nintendo and later sega saturn on the gba.
<br/>
That's in a nutshell what the project is about.
<br/>
<br/>
I have coded it in C using the ham/hel libraries and KATIE for the gameboy advance; but it shall be ported to the DS hopefully sometime after it's final release. When the game is released i also plan to release the source code as open to the public domain.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've worked hard for months on end to put my demo together. It is actually almost a full fighting engine, so it is close to being released as a playable alpha but there's some work needed to finish up a few things and give me insight on how to proceed. i am asking for an additional programmer who can contribute in a casual manner, or they might become the lead programmer altogether in the project, although i would still be the game designer and important programmer since the code is already 4300+ lines long and i'd have to do a bit of explaining of what the variables do and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
what we are looking at here is almost a finished first playable alpha release but there's a few t's to be crossed and i's to be dotted. there's a bunch of things that the videos do not show from the final version for example i am working on the special attack and i have the lifebar and ranged attacks done, i also have character portraits and some nifty FX. work that needs to be done includes adding a splash screen, polishing a thing or two with the jumping, reworking the special attack or providing a solution, and of course starting work or at least help out starting with the AI system
<br/>
<br/>
some videos on this homebrew GBA project i am working on here, the fans have started calling it seiya butouden, although i have a different working title, we'll see what sticks:

who am i? i am Mazdaplz. A 2d/3d artist, C programmer and bsp mapper.
<br/>
of course my programming could use some help. i am 22 years old and have been trying to get into the gaming business for the last ten years. i slowly taught myself most if not all my skills and i am constantly learning more like how to be a musician, for example.
<br/>
<br/>
i am sorry i have no money to offer, there's no money to be made with this title (since it's freeware and ultimately open source) but we could work on a parallel title with the same engine and brand new graphics and gameplay variations. or i could simply help you out with some 2d/3d art design for your game, but i couldn't be the lead artist of your game because i kinda have to be the lead artist and programmer on mine as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
this is a sample of my graphic design skills

this is a private commercial or short ad i made in record time, the director hired me 4 and a half days prior to the release date and pulled it off i could have worked more on many things but my boss didn't let me polish it, here it is:
