    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some of you might've learned about <a class="postlink" href="http://www.helmetedrodent.kickassgamers.com/Pika/openpoke" target="_blank">OpenPok?</a> from the "what are you working on" thread. Now, it has "open" in the name, but it's really kinda closed at the moment in that it's not yet done enough. I was planning to open it when at the battle system was done.
<br/>
<br/>
Problem is, I can't get the battle system right and have other things to do in the game. Who would like to join me on coding? There are three basic prerequisites, aside from common sense: 
<br/>
* Must have some knowledge of Pok?mon games, specifically the GBA versions
<br/>
* Must not even try to slip in Diamond/Pearl aspects
<br/>
<br/>
Current active team members: 
<br/>
* Darkdata on maps 
<br/>
* Sukasa on story 
<br/>
* Cearn on research (also did VWF and map engine)
<br/>
* Me on coding and graphics (also tweak DD's maps)
<br/>
Maybe with a second coder, we can get things done.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in (GB) advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
