<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently in a tough bind. The wifi compo is coming up and I don't have a sprite artist.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're willing to work quickly and work for free on this MMO (the first DS MMO ever), let me know at <a href="mailto:poffy@houston.rr.com">poffy@houston.rr.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I won't be responding during this coming week, however, send me an email with an example of your past work, and I'll contact you on Friday.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
