    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I am looking for an "Intro" ROM for my GBA Emulator EMUNITY.
<br/>
<br/>
See post:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=178531#178531" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=178531#178531</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This ROM would be a .gba Intro to the Emulator and be in all future EMUNITY releases. I would start with the Emunity Logo and Credits, and hopefully a EMUNITY tutorial on Controls and Graphic to 3D Model replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
If no one else is interested,
<br/>
perhaps you guys can point me to some 'close enough' source I can modify to get started. However, I'm really hoping someone will want to make a full EMUNITY ROM, and I can focus on the Unity3D side of things.
<br/>
<br/>
This GBA ROM will be Enhanced to have modern 3D PC Graphics.
<br/>
The Tutorial could be YOUR GAME with the EMUNITY TUTORIAL OPTION added.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I spent the last 4 monthes making the most advanced GBA Emulator in the world, and to my knowledge no one has even tried it yet besides 1 person on IRC. Please, If we can work together to make a demo ROM for it, it would really polish the EMU.

If you could make a quick parody of Anguna with a copy of the engine,
<br/>
that would be GREAT.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a short quest to do some interaction between the GBA and Unity3D such as how to use the keyboard shortcuts, layer moving / duplication, 3D model replacement.
<br/>
<br/>
And a EMUNITY title screen with Credits and Greets using the Emunity Logo.
<br/>
(The one that spins in the BG of the Emu when a game is not loaded)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting to work on the background replacement code again, so if we can chat this evening?
