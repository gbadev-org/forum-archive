    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello. I'm looking for a 2D artist to help me on my current game, Tetra Master DS. If you're unfamiliar with Tetra Master it is a card based mini-game from Final Fantasy 9 (and 11). The game is currently on version 0.4 and is fully playable. You can check it out here:

<br/>
 I am currently using the card art from Final Fantasy 9, but I would like to move away from using their assets (and eventually their name) so that the game can stand on its own.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for someone to create all new cards to replace the current ones. I would like all of the cards to have a consistent theme, preferably fantasy based. The cards are 40x48 pixels, but I would love to have double sized versions to use on the top screen. I'm also looking for a new logo for the menu screen, some battle effects, and other art to give the game a more professional, polished look. If you can only do one of these things, I'd still love your help.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, contact me by e-mail, add me to MSN or just reply to this post.<br/>_________________<br/>Massif - It means mountain.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I might be able to help, but I'm not entirely sure. thats quite a small size for something thats supposed to be a card... Now, if Idon't reply, that either means I'm working on it, or I was working on it but just couldn't do it and gave up, but do you have any ideas for what you could want?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

You could always make something bigger and reduce the resolution.  As a bonus, you can do a sloppy job on the big version and nobody will notice.

While that is true, there is a definite quality difference in art that was designed for small size and stuff that was designed for large size and scaled.  I never realized how much difference it made until I tried it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is where time / quality / skill trade offs come into play.  The graphics can always be refined later.
