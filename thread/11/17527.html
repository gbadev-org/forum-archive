    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A friend company based in Kingston, Surrey (UK) are after some programmers of varying skill. Training will be provided for any juniors who need support.
<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you that this is a great opportunity and there is huge corporate support behind this relatively new independent developer. Chief members of the company have been involved in many high profile games, this could be your ticket into the game industry, if you are not already in it.
<br/>
<br/>
They are producing a cross platform title using the Unity3d engine.
<br/>
<br/>
So please get back to me ASAP and let your programmer friends know as well.
<br/>
<br/>
My twitter is @KeldonAlleyne and my email address is [this-username]85@gmail.com
<br/>
<br/>
The company are interested in a programmer who can code in C# and Javascript, however given their acceptance of Juniors and training provided (and the simplicity of C# and Javascript), I would encourage any C++ programmer to quickly learn it over the next few days and apply.
<br/>
<br/>
Your GBA and DS homebrew experience is something that will really stick out on your CV in my opinion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
