    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Hans Olsen</span>, we are tired of your continued <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">abuse</span></span> of our forum. You have failed to comply to our previous requests to stop spamming the forum with fake user accounts and breaking other forum rules.
<br/>
<br/>
You <span style="font-weight: bold">are not</span> welcome here.
<br/>
<br/>
Your website <a href="http://www.wizardryengineering.com" target="_blank">http://www.wizardryengineering.com</a> doesn't really give your "company" a better image... Forgot to pay the hosting fee's or did you never even set up a website?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, don't bother sending PM's to this guy...he won't receive them.
