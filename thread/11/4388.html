    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a game development forum, not a game request forum. Please don't get the two mixed up. People will not make a game specifically for you to play.
<br/>
<br/>
If you like homebrew games there are plenty at pdroms; but don't go around asking people to make games for you.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this should be a disclaimer when people join, like the one they have at pdroms.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Jake the snake might be great with the reptiles.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be kind of neat to see them putting the sleeper hold on poachers and shaking people down for donations to the fund.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe Steve Irwin (aka The Crocodile Hunter) should be the comissioner of the WWF.  He loves animals, and he would also make a great tag team partner for Jake The Snake.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, The Million Dollar Man could be this guy who hates animals and he uses his millions to fund this group that poaches elephants and kills dolphins.
<br/>
<br/>
And then Ravishing Rick Rude could be this circus promoter that exploits stolen exotic animals and then starves and generally mistreats them.
<br/>
<br/>
So whoever decides to make this game for Deion, could you add my ideas too?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well the biggest problem is all those names are likely trademarked.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll get sued if you use existing trademarked names.  Trademarks are much more vigorously defended than copyrights.  This prevents a Chinese company from producing undiserable merchandise with Hulk Hogan's name on it for example, AND not paying for the use of the name.  Apart form the legalese situation there.. mmm this whole thread is a bit silly (like Camalot in Monty Python's holy grail).
<br/>
<br/>
To answer the original poster, you're asking someone to make a game for you? Have you any idea how much work goes into these games? (The comercial ones are just fun enough to play most times, I enjoy the RPG's since they at least make me think).  Try taking a year out of your life and do nothing but think about "World Wildlife Federation" (I have to admit it's a clever abuse of wwf) and a game related to it, programing artwork audio and all.  Consider 10 hour days and sometimes 6 day work weeks with no reward (or pay or food water or any of life's necessitys to live) other than someone thanking you for the game.  That's reality.  Ideas are common as dirt, implementors are few.
