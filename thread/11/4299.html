    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We are looking for a few coders and artists for some high profile projects we are working on now.  Preference for full time based in UK or Canada but freelance considered.  We want experienced people with proof of what you can do.  Artists must have a good portfolio of GBA work.  Apply to <a href="mailto:recruitment@dc-studios.com">recruitment@dc-studios.com</a>. Your experience need not be commercial but must be good.  People with hobby experience are fine to apply, providing you have enough of a portfolio to demonstrate ability and knowledge of the platform (oh and games development!).
