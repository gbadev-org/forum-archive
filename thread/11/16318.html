    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there! I'm a small press comic artist, and I think the DS has great potential for making a yummy new way to read comics ^^ 
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen there is already a 'comic reader' around, but it doesnt run along the lines of what I'm thinking about. I dont want something that just lets you read your normal comics on a DS, I'd like to have a comic specifically made for the DS! 
<br/>
One that relies on music and touch screen to help the story along. I'd like the idea of having one long 'page' that you take time scrolling through, like scrolling through the Beayux Tapestry! Maybe the top screen could have separate details or animations (I can animate too ^^) that come up at certain points to add to the comic. And I'd love especially to have music accompany the comic as it scrolls along. Since its on a DS maybe at certain points in comic the music can be programmed to change to fit the scene?
<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be up for doing this? I'm afraid making comics is only a hobby for me, so really anyone else who does this kind of thing for passion/hobby rather then real money would be happier! 
<br/>
Although I do sell comics through Sweatdrop.com, so if this project was completed you would get money each time the comic is bought ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be nice to not just program the comic itself, but make an application of some sort where an artist can upload their art/music and edit it themselves--- this is coming from the idea that I will probably want to make a lot more then one comic, and that other artists in my small press group may want to as well! ^^ (of course I guess again money wise you may make a little money through this!)
<br/>
<br/>
Please reply if you are interested! I've been wanting to do this for a while, there would be no hesitation in using your finished program right away, I am always drawing comics :P
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see my comics, although none here are suitable to what I was thinking of for the idea, please check out my website:

If anyone is interested in this project, I will start work on a DS-comic right away to show you ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Do you have a link to some of your stuff? People might be more interested if they could see what kind of work you do.

I thought the artwork was pretty good, and an interactive comic/story type product is something I'm very much a fan of. I once spoke with a French company doing something similar on the PSP, using the interactive nature of UMD-Video scripting, although the product name escapes me now.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd kind of put the Phoenix Wright games into this category as well, and they're fantastic!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
