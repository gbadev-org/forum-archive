    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Makers of "RTS4DS engine" / "Ulterior Warzone", an epic RTS for the NintendoDS, are looking for programmers to help finish the project. We are currently at a loose "99.9% complete" status, but due to real-life demands simply do not have the hands free to finish the few to-dos left on the list, ranging from ridiculously easy to extremely difficult.

Coders should be talented with C language and be comfortable working with incomplete source code, have the necessary free-time, able to work in a team and have all the necessary software and hardware to write, compile (using the devkitPro setup) and test. You will be provided with the source and adequate amount of content to playtest your builds. We cannot offer any payment for work done but, depending on the level of commitment and agreements made, can definitely make it worth while.
<br/>
<br/>
We will also require that you sign a legally binding Non-Disclosure Agreement and be of legal age to do so.

Some publishers are very interested in checking it out and that's in the sluggish process of happening, so we will not release it until after.

In this situation, all that we can possibly offer is a dependent percentage.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thank you everyone for any interest in our project, but the time has come...

The RTS4DS Engine is in <span style="font-weight: bold">urgent</span> need of extra programmers to help finish our RTS game (Ulterior Warzone) <span style="font-weight: bold">ASAP</span>, and we are willing to <span style="font-weight: bold">pay</span> for any help in dealing with the remaining tasks.  Payments will be <span style="font-weight: bold">per-task accomplished</span> and a negotiable sum relative to the difficulty and complexity of the task.  We'll begin with something easy and work our way through to the more complex stuff, understanding that time is needed to grasp the logic of the source code, we can only offer 1 agreed sum for any 1 task accomplished and <span style="font-weight: bold">we can not offer anything like an hourly rate</span>, so we think it's best to get results this way, to get something ridiculously easy out of the way quickly for a few dollars first, then work our way deeper for higher negotiable payments.
<br/>
<br/>
As stated in the first post, you need to be skilled in the "<span style="font-weight: bold">C</span> programming language" and understanding of "<span style="font-weight: bold">devkitPro</span>", have something like a Paypal account to receive payments, and be of <span style="font-weight: bold">real identity and legal age</span> to commit to NDAs and other agreements.  We have plenty of stuff to help you understand the game, including a full instruction manual and other design documents, dozens of screenshots and some videos.  When work begins, you'll get the devkitPro setup, full source code and some basic stand-in content to run the build.

The game is playable and most of the key features are in place.  Enough of the game exists to construct the singleplayer campaigns with, and most todos left concern polishing what is already there to make it as professional and enjoyable as possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
"Ulterior Warzone", the epic real-time strategy game using the monster "RTS4DS Engine", is still in development, although we are getting very close to the few final todos on the list, thanks to the help of a very talented programmer.  We predict a release in a few months from now and would like some hardcore gamers to help us playtest the game as we enter this final stretch of development.  No requirements, apart from having a DS and ability to run the game on the hardware (emulation can't handle it) and playtesters really should have an understanding of other real-time strategy games, as well as being able to articulate themselves sufficiently enough to communicate directly with the development team.  Playtesters will also get some documentation such as the instruction manual and feature-list, to better understand how the game should be played and what to expect.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in being a playtester, please contact us in the forum:-
