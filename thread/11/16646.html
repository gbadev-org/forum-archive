I found <a class="postlink" href="https://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/misc/BidRequests/ShowBidRequest.asp?lngBidRequestId=1166749" target="_blank">this job bid</a> on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.rentacoder.com" target="_blank">Rent A Coder</a>, which is a programmer for higher website.  I figured I would share it here, since I've received so much help here, &amp; I know that there are some folks on there that can make a DS sit up &amp; spit out nickels.
<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to anyone whom bids on this job.<br/>_________________<br/>-#2pencil</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this guy is a little bit stupid because they're are enough free video playback codecs for the nds (.dpg, .dsv, dsm and a few others) and you have the professional one for games. That guys is asking for reinventing the wheel. xD and he also want all rights -_-''.<br/>_________________<br/>Let the nds be with you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
