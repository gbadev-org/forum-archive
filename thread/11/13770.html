I have been reading through the drunkin coders GBA tutorials and have been reading tutorial 1, i have recognized now that i am a awful lone learner when it comes to coding. I am extremely confused if some one here has a microphone and is available to teach me about coding and how to make a simple game, i would love your help.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Read this <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dkauk.com/klogic/school.htm" target="_blank">assembly school</a> from cover to cover and it will teach you quite a bit and get you started in the idea of procedural programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Next I would actually suggest learning to code on the PC, download <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html" target="_blank">Dev cpp</a> and follow a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.html" target="_blank">programming tutorial</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
When you are comfortable with programming, then follow the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/design/features/makegames/" target="_blank">path to games development</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
-edit-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
holy crap that must have been the best tutorial i have ever read. 
<br/>
he put personal experience in it, and as he said 
<br/>
"didn't throw code in my face"
<br/>
like other people do and yeah now i need to try some programming myself.
<br/>
<br/>
-edit-
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having trouble with the other second site you gave me. 
<br/>
its harder to understand and i have the program just open and doing nothing.
<br/>
i feel like im stuck.<br/>_________________<br/>God  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/jrohtmltesting/loveshack.htm" target="_blank">Speed</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
