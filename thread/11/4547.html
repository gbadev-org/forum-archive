    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wrote a little program, but want to test it on a real GBA before I publish it on gbadev. I don't own a flasher/linker device, though, so I'm asking you to run it in an emulator and on the real thing and see if they differ. Thanks.

Nice job!

I think this was wrong: I set SOUNDCNT_L and -H before SOUNDCNT_X, and the gbatek says that no other sound registers can be written to before sound has been enabled in SOUNDCNT_X.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if that's all, though..

PS: If you run it several times, do the rocket pattern repeat, or are they sent at random?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
