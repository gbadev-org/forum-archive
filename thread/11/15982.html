    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently looking for a video capture card that will transfer video from a DS (one screen only) to a computer for editing and uploading onto the internet. I know such a thing exists, I just (apparently) need someone to point it out for me. 
<br/>
<br/>
For further information, if it is needed, I would require two of them that will work for displaying video of the game Legend of Zelda: four swords. one on an original nintendo DS and one on a DS lite. Any help would be appreciated GREATLY.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could do it in code if you don't want realtime video. Or if your program works in an emulator, you could always use fraps or something like that?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For "fraps or something like that", a lot of us would have to buy a new PC with PCI Express. AGP video cards just don't have a fast back channel. Besides, are we supposed to be talking about dumping and emulating commercial Game Cards?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
