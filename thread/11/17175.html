    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK. First off, I'm new to all this. Here's the deal.
<br/>
 I have a small Windows based game (less than a 1Mb in size) I want to remake it to run on a GBA. I have the source code and everything for the Windows version (and have permission from the author to use it). It's a simple grayscale game, looks much like something from a GB and only uses 2 buttons + D-pad (arrow keys). It's made for a small screen, but it does scroll. If anyone is familiar with the FLCL anime, this is the Firestarter game that is seen in the series (but was never produced). I have two different versions of it, but only the source code and permission for one of them. Like I said, I have no idea where to even begin, but I'm willing to learn if someone can point me in the right direction or if someone with more skill would be willing to help make this game a GBA reality, that would be great. I'm not sure if I have provided the needed information, so if there is anything else you need to know, just ask. I will also share the Windows version and source code with anyone who thinks they can help me. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
