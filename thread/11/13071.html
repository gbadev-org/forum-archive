    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello
<br/>
<br/>
We are a small company consisting of British Freelance Programmers/Artists who work through remote collobaration (RELISOFT's CODE CO-OP).
<br/>
<br/>
The hub of the company is now based in Spain and most of us work at home in the UK and visit Spain during critical periods of the project. Some of us spend
<br/>
more time in Spain than others.
<br/>
<br/>
We have succesfully published 20+ titles through large American publishers that include Hasbro and Mattel.
<br/>
We have full Nintendo development status on GBA/DS and Wii
<br/>
<br/>
Work is due to start on a large licenced product for our company in the next couple of weeks, and therefore we have work available for Freelance Programmers
<br/>
and Artists working on a DS/Wii project.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is interested in either role should be aware that they need to Spend 3-4 weeks at a time in Spain during the development of the project.
<br/>
Accommodation and Travel are obviously all paid for, and we work in one of the hottest parts of Spain (The Almeria/Costa Tropical) area. 
<br/>
The rest of the development time will be spent at home working via remote collobaration.
<br/>
<br/>
