<br/>
We are two students (Tobias Persson &amp; Michal Lysek) from Halmstad University in Sweden and we are working on a freeware GBA engine. It?s quite a lot of work actually and we?d welcome any help if someone would be willing to help us out that is.

That's all right... we are almost done with DMA sound as well, and you can expect a new update before monday. If any of you skilled programmers would decide to help us out, we'd be most greatful. Your name will ofcourse be added to all code that have been written by you. Please try the library out, and if you make any modifications or new additions we ask that you mail it to us so that we may include it to the library.<br/>_________________<br/>Lypson Game Engine - for the Gameboy Advance:

The Engine now supports Analog (channel 1-4) and Digital (DMA) sound. Soundmixing is yet not available.

We also have a small demo to show (even though a much better demo will be available in 1-2 weeks). This can be found on the download page of this url:
