    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok i may know nothing about making games yet, but i do know a heck of alot about online servers, and i might be able to make a wifi server!,just for us guys who have the homebrew equiptment, but i need a really good coder who understands n00b.
<br/>
<br/>
please post here if your intersted, online game will be a very small one like a puzzle challange or maybe a game the coder has already made.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also going to need some testers for it so post here if you interseted 
<br/>
<br/>
list of people</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">although I'm a n00b at coding i do know alot about online servers and i will doing the setup for an online server and part of the game client code that will hook us up to wifi i just need people to:
<br/>
<br/>
help code a game
<br/>
<br/>
help with wifi client code
<br/>
<br/>
testers to help test it out as i have not baught any homebrew equiptment yet
<br/>
<br/>
and then people to help make a tuturial on how to set your game up for wifi(if thats ok with the people that help me with this)
<br/>
<br/>
the project entails the cuase of hopefully everyone here in homebrew being able to make their games wifi compatiable and have fun challenging other homebrew people around the world
<br/>
<br/>
just think if it works you might even be able to play checkers or tetris with admin temple wouldn't that be cool.
<br/>
<br/>
the key person to all of this is our the coders they are what i need to complete this i can do all thge server work but they have to code the came and the client into ds form
<br/>
<br/>
yes testors your important too but the key is coders
<br/>
<br/>
also i forgot to mention if you would like to be part of this send me a pm and we can discuss this more thoroughly.

In general, it is a good idea to use complete words.

Please answer these questions:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What is there to setup on an online server?  Nothing really.. It's the coding involved in communicating to the DSs.  So, I think I can fall under the "Have a lot of online server experience" but I can't code a service to communicate with the DSs.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you need to write software (a service) that will run on the server and open a port for the DSs to communicate on.  Depending on how you design it, it may need to have a single "main" port open, and then a bunch of additional ports open so that when a DS connects, it connects on the "main" port, and then the server tells it to reconnect on one of the additional ports.  It would then need to manage who is connected on these additional ports, and what data needs to be sent to them.
<br/>
<br/>
The server side could do anything from just act as a lobby or proxy for DSs to find each other, or it could be a full game "server" with the actual game "world" running on the server.
<br/>
<br/>
So.. what are you hoping to do?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

OK, I want $105 billion to build the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering_Strait_bridge" target="_blank">Bering Strait bridge</a>.  Your answer does not provide much incentive aside from working on a project for interest's sake.  The problem is that there are a lot of interesting projects and not enough time to work on all of them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok i can host the online server but it is not neccessary for me to, the person who made the game should be able to set up a server easy folloing my instructions on how to.  
<br/>
<br/>
lynx has braught up a good point with servers its all on what you want so how the servers set up will depend entirely on the game.  Now if for some reason we do it the opposite were the game revolves around the server(which is what we will do this time as we just need to get it to work first)
<br/>
<br/>
this how the server will be set up:(very simple easy to use server)
<br/>
<br/>
ok i will host this server.....
<br/>
<br/>
the server will be run(made avialiable online) by hamachi(simple server hosting program)
<br/>
<br/>
i will make the client to work for the server(hopefully yo'll help me do this lynx) and get the port enterinng thing to be automatic
<br/>
<br/>
then we will have to get the client converted to work onto the ds(coders job)
<br/>
<br/>
and vwalla!
<br/>
<br/>
not really as easy as its sound but i tryied to make all the server set up n00b readable.
<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
ok now lynx i was wondering if you could help me with some of the server stuff(maybe host a second world?)

Let me get this straight your program will make use of an internet tcp/ip disguised as a local area connection through hamachi. Are you planing on porting hamachi to the ds or are you setting up a connection between a home pc and a ds, which then will communicate over the internet through hamachi to your server. 
<br/>
<br/>
To me this seems like a work arround which could be avoided i have not done much network programing so i would not be the best judge of this. 
<br/>
<br/>
You mention this is a breakthrough, could you specify how, since you are looking at this from a home brew aspect with programmers allowed to distribute this however they want you wont be losing intellectual property by giving us some more indication as to what is this breakthrough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

as for your question i will port hamachi to te ds through a client that that will transfer the code which will be hard, but shoot me hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
