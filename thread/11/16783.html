    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm makeing a homebrew 3d action game for the DS that is strongly influenced by Jet Grind Radio for the sega Dreamcast. I'm looking for a 3d artist to make character models and 3d terrain. If anyone is interested send me a PM!
<br/>
<br/>
If you aren't a modeller but would still like to be involved PM me anyway and we can see if theres something you can help out with.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a video of what I have so far, the need for a real 3d artist is pretty apparent, modelling is hard!

<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work, and good luck finding a 3d artist!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, pretty cool stuff. I might be able to help you out a little with some modeling. I'm sending you a PM with some samples and contact info. 
<br/>
I'm best with characters and stuff, but i like terrains/enviros just as much.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://defaultalias.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://defaultalias.wordpress.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
