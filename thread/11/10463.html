    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all. We are working on a little demo just for fun. I would like to know if someone can do their best to put "The Hamppster Dance" in s3m format? I would like it to sound as close to the original song as possible, so it will work with krawall. Of course, if all else fails I'll just make the entire song one huge sample and play it, but this way would be a lit smaller. Thanks to anyone who can help!

<br/>
<br/>
I believe that you can then open that in Impulse Tracker and save it as an s3m file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The song is called "Whistle Stop", and it was first performed by Roger Miller as the opening credits song from Disney's animated film <span style="font-style: italic">Robin Hood</span>. The song might be copyright Disney and unavailable for use in any video game not published by Buena Vista Games.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">These are both nice (and rather wierd) but not quite what I was looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
I want something a little closer to this:

<br/>
(I took this down from 44100 to 11025 just to save size. As such, it loses a lot of flare. However, you still get the point.)
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, it has much more of a dance beat to it and all. I would be happy with just the music part and the initial sample, although the singing part ('come on everybody...") would be a very nice section to do something just totally bizarre in the demo.
<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, if someone can find me just the samples of the words without the music behind them, that would be very nice.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I understand this. Thing is, I purchaced a copy. How else would I have been able to give you the sample of it? I just want to know if a good s3m format version of it exists. I don't actually intend to use the whole thing, just chunks of it. Trust me, I'm not trying to be a pirate. (unless it's a carribean one.)

But you didn't purchase a license to have additional copies made. Only the music publisher can grant such a license. Likewise, just because you own a copy of <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario Bros.</span> doesn't mean you can transcribe the maps into your own homebrew game. I too own a lawfully made copy of <a class="postlink" href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Hampster%20Dance%20Party:1921874315" target="_blank">this CD by Hampton the Hampster</a>, but that doesn't mean I can distribute <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/fuckRIAA/modplug/covers/hams2.s3m" target="_blank">my own S3M cover version</a> willy-nilly.

It can exist if you learn to use Modplug Tracker.

Using a "significant" chunk (as defined in case law) without authorization is just as much an infringement as using the whole thing.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know I know. 10% or 30 seconds, which ever comes first. I only actually intend to use a few samples of the music, and remix the beat for the rest of it. I may include the actual melody (if it can be called that) but it will be the same thing repeated over. All in all, the actual "borrowed" samplage will not exceed the legal copyrights limit.

(we had to do all of this for school projects. You know how school projects are.)
