    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We are 2 programmers (both at our 3rd university year and with professional experience as video game programmers) and we are doing a 2d isometric "hack and slash" game (something like Diablo). We have an artist for our isometric tiles, but we still need someone for the models (hero, monsters, weapons, special effects). We think that we are able to build a professional looking game (we will spend a lot of time on this) wich could be used as a demo to get a job in this industry...and since we both worked in video games company (www.hexacto.com and <a href="http://www.a2m.com" target="_blank">www.a2m.com</a>) we have some contacts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
