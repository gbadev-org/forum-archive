    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need a partner to help code
<br/>
a game that I have been asked to develope.
<br/>
<br/>
It is going to be either action/adventure
<br/>
or an RPG. I am effiecient in 2D and 3D graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
This architecture of this game has not yet been decided.
<br/>
the design is laid out before us, we must only throw 
<br/>
it together.
<br/>
<br/>
We will be working under the company called RiderDESIGN.
<br/>
We will be finding a publisher midway through production
<br/>
to support us. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's your experience? Is there a design document? Why are you so confident to find a publisher? If you're planning to commercially publish the game, have you got the money to buy devkits?
<br/>
Since you're going commercial: how much does the job pay? What are the qualifications that are needed?
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think you have no clue what you're asking.
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. There's lots of people that like 'designing' games and then find themselves some free programmers to make it for them, but unless you convince them in a proper way, that's never going to happen.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://www.lifeisdigital.net" target="_blank">project website</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://www.kenvanhoeylandt.net" target="_blank">personal website</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a Design document,
<br/>
I am confident in finding a publisher because I always
<br/>
have confidence in everything I do. I have no money 
<br/>
at this time to purchase dev kits but that has not stopped
<br/>
developers before. This job does not pay at this time
<br/>
but we will be discussing this at a later date.
<br/>
I can do the graphics that are called for. The
<br/>
qualifications I ask for would be for a programmer who
<br/>
wishes to make this game his own along with me.
<br/>
Therefore the programmer would decide which we 
<br/>
would go, adventure or rpg? 2D or 3D? I have the game
<br/>
planned as an RPG. I also have a web-site that I will be 
<br/>
working on, to see my work on themes check out:
