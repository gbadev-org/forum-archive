    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, 
<br/>
I am looking for programmers with experience on the DS [or PSP].  It doesn't necessarily have to be professional experience but you need to be able to program competently on the system.  This is a full-time paid position working on a AAA DS title at a Toronto based company.  If you have any interest please reply to this thread or email me personally at <a href="mailto:gamescout@live.ca">gamescout@live.ca</a> and I will fill you in with more information.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A few questions:
<br/>
<br/>
How soon do you need people?
<br/>
<br/>
What kind of competency is required? A person working with PA or libnds might not be able to work without it. Is that OK?
<br/>
<br/>
Do you work with official SDKs? (I assume so but who knows, eh?)
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I'm an experienced programmer getting into DS development. I doubt I'll be comfortable with the system in time to make your timeline, so I'm asking here rather than privately to give other people here a better idea.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We are actively seeking employees for ongoing projects.  We use official SDKs and are well equipped to handle multiple programmers.  Our expected level of competency would be based on your ability to meet the needs of the project.  Basically, you have to be able to bring something to the team.  If you have any experience with other Nintendo formats there is a good chance you will be able to program with the DS as it builds on existing Nintendo standards.  What projects or consoles have you worked on so far?  Please don't hesitate to ask more questions, I will continue to answer as soon as I am available to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
