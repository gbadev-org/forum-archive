<br/>
<br/>
Really, the way I see it, there's four things you get from devkitPro
<br/>
<br/>
1.  The compiler, linkscripts, that sort of "hard" stuff. (devkitArm, is it?)
<br/>
2.  Header files for all the zillions of registers
<br/>
3.  Some libraries for wrapping those zillions of registers in function calls
<br/>
4.  Some libraries for doing some of the "harder" stuff (sound, interrupts, etc).
<br/>
<br/>
#1 people will end up using from devkitPro, even if they build their own little libraries, because that's hard to do.
<br/>
<br/>
#2 and 3 seems the most likely candidate for people using their own libraries.  Because it's easy, and because, unfortunately, the constants have in the past been changing between versions of libnds.  It's understandable why people might roll their own when they have to change lots of their code for new devkitPro releases. 
<br/>
<br/>
#4 is quite valuable, but parts of it are quite likely to be overlooked if there's not plenty of supporting documentation/examples.  Since people are doing homebrew for fun, it's often more fun to roll your own library then to wade through someone else's library code to figure out how it works if there's not good documentation.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm not complaining, I'm quite happy with devkitPro (in all its parts), and the examples have (most of the time) been quite enough for me.  But I can definitely see how more tutorials and documentation would really help the cause.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry to take so long replying - I did have an ever growing post that just didn't seem to say precisely what I wanted to say &amp; I kind of gave up after a day or two of editing.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a link to the sourceforge project, it's the SF button on the pages. Most users tend to stick with binaries &amp; stable releases though so it's not really something that's a big issue in general.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I'm still not entirely convinced by OO on DS, you really seriously need to know what you're doing on a low resource system with C++ (yes I'm aware OO is a paradigm &amp; not a language - vuurrobin is referring to C++ though). It's also quite a bit more maintenance work and I really prefer not to force C++ on people. Lack of OO isn't the problem anyway, the problem is a lack of stable &amp; up to date tutorials &amp; documentation, as elhobbs has said.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the things holding back documentation and tutorials from my end is the lack of a cross platform installer &amp; code editor. I think both of these are needed to give us a good base to work from.
<br/>
<br/>
Some other things that would be rather useful are tools for resource manipulation - a decent cross platform map editor, sprite editor maybe even some sort of basic art program.
<br/>
<br/>
What I'd really like to do is increase the revenue from devkitPro to the point where I can afford to spend all my time improving the tools &amp; pay other people to spend a bit of time on docs, tutorials and useful tools.

Just my 2 cents: what about selling a complete toolchain that works out-of-the-box? 
<br/>
I'm thinking of an USB stick with the devkitARM already set up (plug'n'compile? :^P), and something like DSerial(2/Edge/GameIO/whatever) to connect the nds to pc in order to debug software.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://itaprogaming.free.fr/" target="_blank">My homepage</a>!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Along the lines of brainstorming, some other thoughts I had about making some money from devkitPro.  I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about how realistic these would be, instead I just thought, "what would I consider paying for?" 
<br/>
<br/>
-Selling nicely printed/bound documentation.  People probably don't necessarily NEED this, but some of us might use it as an excuse to donate.
<br/>
<br/>
-Selling some sort of "best homebrew made by devkitPro" collection card (or other format for other platforms besides nds).  Load it up with a lot of the "best" homebrew, all tested to make sure they work correctly with the card, etc, package it nicely with a label and stuff.  Sort of like the gba 2004mbit compo carts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
- one of each: nicely printed and bound library reference manual, gbatek type reference manual/cheat sheets, tutorial guide/walkthrough like patater's or something, and cearn's tonc manual
<br/>
- works out-of-the-box usb drive with full toolchain and some tools, library sources, all examples, maybe even tie in desmume for debugging too
<br/>
- a card like gauauu (and cyril_sy) is talking about with homebrew demos/games, but also include all the pre-built examples from toolchain, patater's tutorial demo, and the tonc demos. This card would also have to support argv, of course (as it would probably be the one to use when making homebrew developed from everything in the kit)
<br/>
- soft cloth map of Hyrule (or maybe wintermute's home town)
<br/>
- small figurine of Satoru Iwata
<br/>
<br/>
Wrap it all up in a nice box and put the devkitPro and/or drunkencoders logo on it.

Currently DSGM is hugely bad for the community, his installer meddles with official devkitPro environment variables and installs a library which devkitPro will not support due to the continual issues surrounding it.

Not really sure what you're getting at here either, what costs are variable? Starting from square one with a new console isn't really that bothersome, it'll be quite a while before the DS becomes obsolete anyway - actually I still get people popping up wanting help with GBA programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Other thing about emulators vs hardware is that you always have the risk of writing code that won't work on hardware if you only ever test in an emulator.

I don't think piracy is quite the bugbear people make it out to be, it certainly has an impact on sales but I've yet to see it turn into no sales at all. As for clones, I'd hope that the devkitPro brand would be strong enough to offset that, assuming we get the right hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the question here is really "what would you be prepared to pay for?" 
<br/>
<br/>
Some interesting ideas earlier in the thread - best homebrew card for instance although obviously that involves paying the authors some proportion of the profits. I certainly wouldn't be comfortable without some revenue share on something like that.

That's cool. Good to hear things are better for him (I'm assuming from the context). Oh, and I hope he doesn't mind my gbatek mirror :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">variable costs would be things like who is going to the time into making such products,who will distrubute, who will ship, etc etc,  today it might cost $10 to assemble, tomorrow $15  (I know its a bit extreme).  
<br/>
<br/>
for software,
<br/>
Perhaps a "ultimate" package could be offered for a few bucks that have tools not available in the standard package.
<br/>
<br/>
I for one would not pay for something I can already
<br/>
get for free legally,  so the dream team package idea is out for me,  so I will just have to keep donating to make the project live lol<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

I wrote this a few years ago as you probably remember: <a class="postlink" href="http://kameli.org/nds-abg_old/article.html" target="_blank">http://kameli.org/nds-abg_old/article.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I never made it public, kept it up-to-date or proceeded to write more like I intended, since you told me that I have no skill for writing tutorials and devkitPro would be better off without me even trying.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
