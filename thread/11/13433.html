<br/>
that is SO cool!
<br/>
<br/>
er... well, i won't be able to personally use it, but the fact that they are releasing that commercially means hopefully I can get a developer in the us to work with me on the moon books project, or even do something along the lines themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
now i'm back to my original conundrum, which is who to contact and how.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My suggestion would be to look at the websites, see if they have an e-mail, or mailing address you can send either a demo, or design document and some paperwork to. Then just spam it to as many publishers as possible, it's your best chance at maybe getting somekinda snag</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
