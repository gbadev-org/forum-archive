<br/>
<br/>
I've been looking for a pixel artist because I got a reply from a publisher about a week ago asking for some screenshots of this GBA game I'm planning on doing. I need someone to do the art... if the publisher likes it and picks it up you will get paid. I figured I'd ask here just incase... I'm not sure how often people check this. Thanks for looking at this either way.<br/>_________________<br/>" ...and our brave hero roasts the disabled man." - Crow, MST3K</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
