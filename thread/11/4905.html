<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a pixel artist to work on some backgrounds for a 2d sidescrolling shooter. Yup, it's for the PDRoms compo. I can do the sprites myself, but perhaps if there's anybody out there who likes drawing pretty raster backgrounds they might want to give it a shot?
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the game so far. The engine is done (as it's based off of one of my gbadev.org compo entries), I've just got to build the new enemies, interface, levels, bosses and things like that!

Obviously most of what's on the screen is a placeholder right now, but take my word for it when I tell you that a background artist will have the following at his disposal:
<br/>
<br/>
-About 900 8x8, 256colour tiles to play with.
<br/>
-3 scrolling background layers (non-rotating).
<br/>
-Pretty much whatever palette you want (I say pretty much because you're sharing with the GUI).
<br/>
<br/>
The levels will progress as you play them, so you might start off over the sea, then over a beach, then into a jungle etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The tool you will use to make the map is Mappy for Win32 V1.4. Obviously you can use whatever program you want to make the tiles.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd prefer somebody with experience with GBA, as I don't really have the time or inclination to teach somebody the ins and outs of the platform. So... anybody interested?
