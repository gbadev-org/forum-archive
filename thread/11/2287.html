<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a small semi-game/demo and I could do with a bit of help. This is a raytracing kind of thing and I'm taking care of that myself, but I would appriciate some help with the menus and sound effects and later maybe a bit of AI (help and/or advice with the raytracing stuff is not expected but will always be welcome :-). Beginners are welcome, although I'll be expecting you to have read most of the tutorials out there and broken through the "hello world" barrier. You should have realistic expectations, this isn't about creating a box-office smash, this is about having some fun working on a hopefully playable demo and learning a lot and getting some hands-on experience in GBA programming on the way. All those interested please drop me a line at <a href="mailto:ismolovski@stbpwr.com">ismolovski@stbpwr.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers.<br/>_________________<br/>Guns for show, knives for a pro</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
