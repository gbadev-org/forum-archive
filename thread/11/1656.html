<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on a tool that makes converting and linking data into ROMs a lot easier. I am almost finished and want to release it freely. Before I do so however, I would like some experienced programmers to give it a try to see if it's all working fine.
<br/>
<br/>
What it is: It consists of two parts. One is an archiving tool, very much like ARJ/ZIP, but without compression. It has one feature that is they key here though. You can give it an ini file containing descriptions of how to convert files, according to their extension. If done so, the tool runs any conversion application you specify and add the converted file into the archive!
<br/>
<br/>
So what you ultimately end up with is a data directory (can contain subdirs) containing all your source data, and two lines in ie. a makefile and all the (converted) data in that directory will be added to the archive.
<br/>
<br/>
The second part, as you might've guessed by now, is a C source that will let you access the contents of any archive linked into the elf. simply by specifying the same path+filename as that file exists in your data directory.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to (beta)test this code, then drop me a private message on this board.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!
<br/>
