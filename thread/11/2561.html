    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a good GBA coder to work on a very different vehicle &amp; street based GBA game.  It's not a racer - so don't think I'm trying to recreate any of the commercial racing games!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm an out of work games designer - got made redundant just before xmas - and figure as I'm sitting around watching daytime T.V. I may as well do something usefull to while away the hours.
<br/>
<br/>
I've already got the main concept in mind, but I need a coder to work with so I can figure out the limitations of the design as well as graphical slant etc.  Once we've worked out those things, I can quickly get to work on a full design doc.
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, this is a cash free project, but we can both use the game as a demo for our portfolio's etc.  I'm hoping that the whole project should take not much longer than two months.  If we can use some tools that require no 2d/bitmap art, then I can build the levels and vehicle/s myself using some sort of 3D util.  (Yes, I know the GBA doesn't naturally do 3D graphics - that's one of the things we need to figure out first)...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if anyone is interested, gimme a mail at the address below:

I live in North London, but am happy to work with anyone from anywhere on the globe - we can communicate easily via MSN etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time &amp; take care.
