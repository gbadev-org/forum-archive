    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok a friend of mine is making a book about graphics (using C)
<br/>
<br/>
all the basics concept from plotting a pixel, drawing a line, makin a square, backgrounds, sprites...and so on
<br/>
<br/>
so he has this weird sprite who runs but it looks really bad, so I offered him my help (way to go, Leinad, many would say :P)
<br/>
<br/>
I told him I have some friends who has animated sprites and here I am, asking :P
<br/>
<br/>
to the point
<br/>
<br/>
I need a 256-colors animated sprite (any size) must be in PSX format
<br/>
<br/>
I'll choose one and the one who wins will be recognized in my friend's book (your name)
<br/>
<br/>
hopefully you can help me (I know you can ;))
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance
<br/>
<br/>
btw as an example I need the different frames conforming the sprite
<br/>
<br/>
(IE: mario stand still, mario starts walkin, mario starts running, mario jumping..etc...you know what I'm talkin' about)
<br/>
<br/>
I'll put an example later but the file is in corel and I don't have corel :(
<br/>
<br/>
thanks again :P<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">256 colours? Why so many for just a sprite? And what colours would you want? How big is this sprite? How many frames? I think it would be a wiser idea to cut down the colours. Animating 256 different type of colours isn't very economical</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think you can do better, can't you? :D
<br/>
<br/>
btw...real sprite size is 24x16 :/ I don't know what happened with the size
<br/>
<br/>
and I mean a 256 colors palette :P<br/>_________________<br/>All human wisdom is summed up in these two words, - 'Wait and hope"

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am lacking such stamp making programs and do not want to install or deal with photo shop.
<br/>
<br/>
I need a program that can cancel out the white or black and create a clear background that is not photoshop and then I will use a gif to make the sprite look animated.
<br/>
<br/>
About PSX format where and what do I use to convert this to and from?
<br/>
<br/>
Can I use a hand drawn sprite?
<br/>
<br/>
Most later games towards 1996 used pre drawn and pre colored sprites simular to a cell animation. You would then scan it in and convert the sprite ( usaully ) in batch from 24-bit ( or 32, etc ) color to 256 bit without loss in color. 
<br/>
<br/>
I know the original photoshop can convert colors like this I am not sure about other programs.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you want a moving sprite?
<br/>
<br/>
About well known game sprites I know the fighting forums and Mugen websites have tons of these all over the place. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have a mugen characters come with sprite sheet with clear backgrounds mostly displayed in purple.
<br/>
<br/>
Also do you want it to be pixel art?<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would rather an original work...than a known sprite from a game
<br/>
<br/>
unless you can show me some page of sprites that don't violate copyright ;)
<br/>
<br/>
PSX is corel draw format I believe
<br/>
<br/>
yop, you can use hand draw
<br/>
<br/>
I just need the frames to make the animation (we'll take care of animating the sprite later)
