<br/>
We're an experienced San Francisco-based game developer who makes educational games for handheld devices. We have 7 games behind us and 2 in current development.
<br/>
<br/>
We're looking for a senior level DS programmer to help us tool up and plan, and then several other experienced programmers to port and create new 2D games for the DS. 
<br/>
We pay well, don't work weekends and are fun to work with.
<br/>
