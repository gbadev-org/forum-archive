<br/>
First, you can't EMULATE an n64 on the DS.  Period.  The 66MHz main CPU of the DS isn't fast enough to emulate a Genesis properly (yet), there's no way you're gonna emulate something like the n64 on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, if you wanted to PORT it, you'd need the assets (models, textures, maps, sounds, music, etc) and the source (programming code), and even if you had both, the source is written for n64's official SDK, and the DS homebrew SDK is much different, second, it would be awfully hard to port such a complex game even if you had all of the above, which you aren't going to, because it's all licensed and copyrighted to Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing you could TRY is post on Nintendo's forums that you'd like a Super Smash Bros for DS, with 3d models, like the n64 version.  Get thousands of people that agree with you to post, and Nintendo might consider thinking about it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I think he meant a remake, or just producing a similar game, rather than a direct port/emulation.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, no one with adequate skills is going to devote time to helping to produce a game, especially since you have nothing to show for your efforts.
<br/>
<br/>
My advice, go read up a whole bunch of things and attempt to produce a simpler game by yourself, then work on something similar to this by yourself (if by the this point you still want to carry on). Once you have something to show people will be more interested in joining you and take you project much more seriously.
<br/>
<br/>
As there are countless posts similar to this if you want to stand any chance of seeing this game as your own creation, you have to atleast contribute something to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
