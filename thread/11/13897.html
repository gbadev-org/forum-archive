    <h4>#137281 - xstation14 - Thu Aug 09, 2007 9:35 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello i'm new here. I'm looking for a team to port one of my favorite PC game mods. Well, it's actually a mod of a mod. The Garry's Mod mod NoXiousNet. It is a first person mod based on the old Westwood RPG, NoX. Here is some information about it: <a href="http://www.noxiousnet.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">http://www.noxiousnet.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page</a> . I'm looking for a team that is interested in re-making this mod from scratch into a DS Homebrew game. I will give the team and the makers of the original NoXiousNet all the credit. All I want to see happen is make my favorite mod portable and give DS gamers an opportunity to play a great game. If at all possible, I would like to make it Wi-Fi, touchscreen enabled, and able to be played with the MAX Media Launcher. This is a volunteer project, since i'm 16 and don't have any money. Unfortunately, the only language I know is HTML, but I will help in any way I can. If I can get enough people, I will make an official site. I know what I am asking looks rough, since I myself have almost no coding experience and there is no pay, but please think of the people that will like to see this happen, or when it does happen, will enjoy it.
<br/>
<br/>
What you'll need:
<br/>
<br/>
Garry's Mod and a game that runs on the source engine (since GM needs some files from a source game): <a href="http://www.steamgames.com/v/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=4000&amp;cc=US" target="_blank">http://www.steamgames.com/v/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=4000&amp;cc=US</a>
<br/>
<br/>
NoXiousNet server files (which are automatically downloaded when you join a server)
<br/>
<br/>
NoXiousNet server IPs: <a href="http://www.noxiousnet.com/page.php?4" target="_blank">http://www.noxiousnet.com/page.php?4</a>

And here is the official NoXiousNet website: <a href="http://www.noxiousnet.com" target="_blank">http://www.noxiousnet.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by xstation14 on Thu Aug 09, 2007 9:47 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

You can use The Games Factory from Clickteam if you want to make a prototype of your game that runs on a PC. It might be easier to get people interested in porting your project to the DS if they can see your vision in action.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Uugh, while The Games Factory was fun to fool around with, I have learned long ago that it is programmed poorly. Some things just don't work, and learning how to do some things the long way around and avoid the mystery bugs requires just as much intelligence, in my opinion, as it would be to learn some decent programming. Anyone who is capable of creating a decent game without bugs in The Games Factory shouldn't have wasted their time to learn how to make it, they are plenty smart enough to learn programming. <span style="font-size: 10px; line-height: normal">Granted, I've never tried the newer "Multimedia Fusion" from Clickteam, but I don't think 100$ is worth the possibility of more disappointment.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
On the subject though, I agree with other people, you won't get any help unless you program yourself, blah, blah.

I love Garrys Mod... Never heard of that mod, though I'm not a big fan of those "RPG" ones.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

So some people aren't strong with maths, well we can all use an abacus. We can all instruct someone to go to the shops and buy a list of shopping, then why not instruct a simple machine to do exactly what you say. Maybe the difficulty lies in instructing, since you need to know what you are instructing them for - it's all about understanding the learning process.

Hmm, I just see it as "find me a person you can can never learn and I will teach them" ... or admit that they're unteachable ^_^ I have met some people who are just unteachable unless they want to learn it, in fact I've met a classroom of them.

Have you identified their learning style and created a learning program that suits it? Tutorials [for example] are very weak in terms of covering the 4 main types of learners.
<br/>
<br/>
There were a lot of people in my college course who had serious troubles learning to program, but I had even more difficulty trying to figure out how the lecturer expected some people to understand the way he was teaching them. People tend to say, "this is a program; this is how it works; this is a loop; this is an if statement; this is a variable", and so on. It's very easy to not break it down into smaller activities where the learner can learn one useful thing at a time and apply that learning.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried a couple times to learn C. I've tried to learn off of online tutorials, but the couple I've tried just got frustrating, because I could type the code, but it didn't tell me what I was doing in detailed enough explanations. In the worst cases they said, "well touch on why that is later, in the chapter about pointers."
<br/>
<br/>
I've always thought I had a mind for programming, I like to sit and think about how you would program things, or just how or why some things are in general. I enjoy math, just not most of my teachers, and I taught myself BASIC in 7th/8th grade with nothing but a TI83+ manual. I also signed up for computer programming II (teaches Java) at my school last year, but they stuck me and two other people in the A+ certification class because not enough people signed up for computer programming I or II to merit making a class. Maybe I'll just wait another year till college to learn a harder language.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Oh, and Garry's Mod is not coded in lua. Garry's Mod is coded in C++, with help from the Source SDK, and since Garry's Mod 10, the actual <span style="font-style: italic">source</span> to the source engine. Your mod likely is coded in lua, but its coded specifically in Garry's Mod lua. Meaning Garry's Mod does all the hard work, while the lua scripts tell it what hard work to do.
<br/>
I'm guessing your best bet is to make it into a quake mod and run it in QuakeDS. But the quake engine might not be robust enough to suit the mods' needs, I don't know the details of the mod. Also, if this mod's playability relies <span style="font-style: italic">at all</span> on the accurate Source physics engine, you have an extremely slim sliver of a chance of getting it to wholly resemble the actual mod.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My original statement was a bit terse but it was meant to be in reference to the application of programming skill, not the ability to attain it.  I'm not saying people can't be taught to program, but to take that teaching and put it into application is another thing entirely.  You may have a love for gaming, or even love of designing games- but in order to program games you ultimately must have a love for programming.  In my experience, only someone with a particular logical/mathematical mindset is going to love programming enough to spend the time and effort it takes to go beyond "hello world" and actually program a complicated piece of software like a game.
<br/>
<br/>
You can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the learning part, C was the first language I ever learned.  I was taking a night school class on it at the time.  It ran about a month and a half and cost about $500 I believe.  But, ultimately I think it was worth every penny.  For me, books are invaluable as a reference after knowledge has been attained but as an actual learning tool they are severely lacking.  Nothing beats a good lecture/ workshop course for the learning part.  That's not to say I think learning from a book is impossible, only that it's not a very efficient way of learning.
