    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Me and some of my friends are creating a Gameboy Advance game, and I originally going to do all the coding myself, but I then realized how much work it would be. So I am here, asking if there are any C++ coders out there with some free time and would like to help me and my friends. Unfortunately, my msn doesn't work, but I am always on Yahoo! messenger, so just email me, or add me at ; <a href="mailto:xx_owa_xx@yahoo.com">xx_owa_xx@yahoo.com</a>. Your help would be much appreciated. Oh and I am using VisualHAM to code it.
