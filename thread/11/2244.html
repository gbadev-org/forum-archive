    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all.  I'm looking to start a production company that will make art/sounds/libs/tools/engines/etc... for the GBA.  This will strictly be for the fun of it.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently the team consists of a tool programmer, a designer/programmer, and a designer/concept artist.
<br/>
<br/>
There's no real specifics yet, just some tool ideas and a few game designs. We're basically looking for any and all people who would like to do some fun and exciting work on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we would like to see four teams: sound, programming, and art, and design.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a rough list of the type of people we need:
<br/>
<br/>
Music:
<br/>
Sound effects engineer
<br/>
Music engineer
<br/>
Music programmer
<br/>
<br/>
Programming:
<br/>
Physics programmer
<br/>
AI prgorammer
<br/>
MFC tool programmer
<br/>
Engine programmer
<br/>
Database programmer
<br/>
<br/>
Art:
<br/>
3d artist
<br/>
pixel artist
<br/>
<br/>
Design:
<br/>
Game concept writer
<br/>
Tool designer
<br/>
Script writer
<br/>
<br/>
I think we're looking to have about 10-12 people in our company, working on several projects at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who's at all interested, even if you have little/no experience... just post your email and i'll get back to you on this.  We should have a page going up within the next month.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all, hope to see some people eager to join us.
<br/>
