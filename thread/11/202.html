    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking for an experienced programmer who is willing to help out on a Castlevania style game that I'm working on.  An ideal candidate would be able to handle more of the low level graphics, sound, and asset management required for a game.  I would prefer to focus on gameplay programming and AI. The ability to collaborate and receive direction via e-mail is essential.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm willing to pay qualified people, though any applicants should understand that I am not with an established game company so I'm paying for any help out of my own pocket.  Because of that, the pay rate would be rather low, though it is open for negotiation and would largely depend on the qualifications of the applicant.  Applying solely for the money would probably leave you disappointed. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Demo material will be required, preferably something showcasing a side-scroller with multiple BG layers. Management of animating sprites would also be ideal.  Any executables must be able to run correctly on real GBA hardware.  Code sample also required.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME ANY MATERIALS RIGHT AWAY, rather, just provide a text description of your skills and what questions you may have about this project.  If I am interested in pursuing you as a candidate, I will request demo materials at that time.  If you have a website I can look at, feel free to provide a link.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just as a clarification, I <span style="font-style: italic">am</span> willing to pay a programmer for their help...and those payments will be payed out at a regular interval that we both agree to.  I'd consider this kind of position to be better suited to someone wanting to work part-time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
