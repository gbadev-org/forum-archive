    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The engine is up but the rest needs working and the existing programmer does not have time to do it all. If you like shooter games then you will like this one. You ship has 4 types of arsenals of 4 categories from guns, specials, shield and bombs. The weapons can be adjusted and changed during game play so you can adjust your wide shots smoothly to narrow, or switch guns to rapid rotate shot, or to the other to guns.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically it is intended to play like Gradius but with elements of MegaMan and CastleVania since you get weapons and you pass levels to boost up your stats.
<br/>
<br/>
The collision detection is set up but would like some to help do the sound effects and the AI. If anyone else wants to join up they are welcomed. Post replies here if you are interested.

<br/>
=========
<br/>
Also one example of each arsenal is this:
<br/>
-gun (can be charged up 2-10 times depending on your level)
<br/>
Spread adjust, 5 straight shots open up smoothly in an angle from 10 degree to 180 degrees
<br/>
<br/>
-specials
<br/>
Fire attacks which is like poison since when you hit them once they keep draining since they are on fire, 
<br/>
Its power up suck up enemy hit points near you to refill your hit points up a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
-Bombs
<br/>
Freeze all or slow down bigger enemies; if you can?t kill them quickly then you use this to give you an advantage.
<br/>
<br/>
-Shield
<br/>
Reflective shield when bullets or enemies hit you they bounce off to hit back at them (holding shield will throw attack harder back at them)
<br/>
Its power up is to suck up all enemy fire on screen to fire it back 2x where you want to, so 10 bullets that can hit 10 will be fired back at 200. 
<br/>
===========
<br/>
If anyone has a comment about it I would like to hear it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was wondering if the offer still stands and if it does I'd like to offer my help as a programmer. I have many years of programming in C/C++ and various assembly languages for various embedded systems. Although I don't have any major GBA titles under my belt, I have been envolved in a number of various projects and am currently working on my own demo, so one can say that I am well past my "hello world" stage on the GBA. Also, I have good knowledge of and hands-on experience in design and development of compilers (front-ends and back-ends) and am comfortable with many generic algorithms and optimization tricks. All this combined with strong OOP skills and the ability to draw on my experience as a programmer alows me to think that I can be a valuable contribution to your team. I am ready to provide you with further information and a detailed resume should this be required. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:ismolovski@stbpwr.com">ismolovski@stbpwr.com</a>. Thank you for considering my application.<br/>_________________<br/>Guns for show, knives for a pro</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
