    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
We're a (small) team that is beginning the project of a race game for the next compo. We're searching for a sound artist that could : 
<br/>
- compose his musics
<br/>
- do FX(explosions, engine roar...)
<br/>
- render good tracks with few sample
<br/>
- convert his samples without too much loss or noise(I know this cause it is awfull to convert 44Khz to 11Khz without any surprises), if MIDI isn't used.
<br/>
<br/>
Theorically, you are free to use any specific tool. Or none, cause sampling in code isn't too hard so I'll do the sampling corresponding to your desire(like a music is composed of 5 samples of x seconds, in the beginning use sample0 for 8 mesures, then use sample0 mixed to sample1 for 16 mesures, then...).
<br/>
<br/>
So if you are interested please PM me here, and I'll get into details about the game and everything you wanna know :-).
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Jeff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
