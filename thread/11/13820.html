    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone !
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for some talented level designer for my school project.
<br/>
As design and graphics have nothing to do with coding, I need someone who could spend some time on building tiles and maps.
<br/>
You just need to know the Starcraft universe and be able to use Paint :p
<br/>
<br/>
To see the current versions of my ROM, check :
<br/>
<a href="http://thommas.free.fr/scgba" target="_blank">http://thommas.free.fr/scgba</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Especially Version 0.4, where i coded map scrolling but as you can see, the tiles are ugly without transitions between them.
<br/>
<br/>
Comments &amp; suggestions are welcomed !!!
<br/>
<br/>
Thx =)

I'm sorry, i'm currently using a very bad pcx2sprite converter and the array of data for sprites takes 30 Mo ...

I'd like to find another way to import a pcx image and read it in my code, but for the moment, i code quick &amp; dirty as long as visualboy advance plays it as I want.<br/>_________________<br/>Be Quick ! Time is Mana...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't see how I could create a compressed file with my sprites using this tool. Even with this tool, I end up with a 18 Mo file ... -_-'<br/>_________________<br/>Be Quick ! Time is Mana...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The huge file size also makes it nearly impossible to run on real hardware as well.  The Supercard/M3/G6 won't run it, as they only have 32 MB of RAM to run GBA binaries from.  You would have to have a traditional NOR-based card that's 512 megabits (64 megabytes) in size or larger, and the bankswitching code for each specific flash cart would need to be added to the binary.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, the only homebrew program I know of that can be larger than 32 MB is the last official release of Pogoshell, which could use all 64 MB of space on an X-rom cart.  However, its sources are unusable/unavailable/something so it would be difficult to duplicate the behavior.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is for a single unit, I added 10 units and 12 effects ... that is to say,
<br/>
there are horizontaly aligned all units and effects in a single pcx.
<br/>
Then I use pcx2sprite.exe which creates a big array (about 50 Mo)<br/>_________________<br/>Be Quick ! Time is Mana...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You could also go to a 16 color sprite for this guy without losing hardly any color quality. Even if you wanted to keep your engine in 256 colors, the data structure that you use to store the tiles could be 16-color, with an attached lookup table to connect, say, color #6 in your image palette to color #125 in your actual GBA palette.
<br/>
<br/>
The engine looks AWESOME so far. Good work.

<br/>
What format are your levels designed in? Do you have tools, or would an artist be "hand coding" against some internal standard?

<br/>
I won't do that. If the game is looking so nice that is because I kept the original sprite from Starcraft without decreasing quality or color.
<br/>
I don't care if my Rom is 51 Mo big as it works fine in Visualboy advance.
<br/>
Besides, I need to ask my gba dev teacher how to compress sprites in a ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
"What format are your levels designed in? Do you have tools, or would an artist be "hand coding" against some internal standard? "
<br/>
Tiles are in bmp, extracted directly from Starcraft Map Editor.
<br/>
Then I use &gt;&gt; GBA Graphics from Brunni (http://gbagraphics.palib.info/)
<br/>
It allows easily to create Maps !

I respectfully disagree. Knowing what compression can and cannot do will help you expect realistic results. For instance, run-length encoding is quick to decode and good for compressing graphics with horizontal lines or large flat areas, such as the transparent portion of a sprite cel.

<br/>
One solution is to convert and compress each sprite cel on the PC, then write a "data" file containing all the compressed sprite cels, along with an "index" file containing offsets to the start of each cel. Then build this data and index into your ROM, either with bin2s or with an appended file system such as GBFS. On the GBA, read the index, find the compressed data, decompress it, and copy it to VRAM.
