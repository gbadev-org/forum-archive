    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi I did up a mockup of a gameboy game I would like to try to make a demo with a programmer. The concept is this.
<br/>
<br/>
BATTLE OF THE BANDS 
<br/>
<br/>
Genre: Fighting 
<br/>
Platform: Game boy advance 
<br/>
Target demographic: Male/Female 10-35 (this should appeal to the older generation too) 
<br/>
High Concept: Street fighter 2 meets rock n roll 
<br/>
<br/>
You control musicians from famous bands such as Guns n roses, ACDC, Metallica, Ozzy, Kiss and many more. You are fighting for the title of most hardcore rock band. 
<br/>
<br/>
Select your character and work your way through the various bands home town stages example GnR - Los Angeles. Until you reach the all time greats such as ozzy ozbourn, mick jagger, bono, or steve tyler. 
<br/>
<br/>
The various bands would all have moves reflecting there personality. Special moves useable when your fanomeeter is filled will be moves based on the bands hit songs. Example - ACDC - thunderstruck or hells bells. The fanometer goes up the more you build combos and appeal to the fans in the audience. 
<br/>
<br/>
Play control is very reminiscent of street fighter 2. 
<br/>
<br/>
Art style is again much like street fighter 2 and many of the old fighting games of the 90s. 
<br/>
<br/>
Music is pure rock from the 80s and 90s. The stages for each band would have one of there hit songs playing excluding lyrics. 
<br/>
<br/>
this is what the graphics would look like. I would actually like to just focus on one level at the moment and have 2 ppl fighting as a demo. I pretty much already have the background done and I have the look of the fighters all I need is animations etc. and a programmer.

<br/>
Music would have to be midi and there are plenty of midi rock songs out there such as <a class="postlink" href="http://209.197.86.65/20041007/rock/gunsnroses/You_Could_Be_Mine.mid" target="_blank">http://209.197.86.65/20041007/rock/gunsnroses/You_Could_Be_Mine.mid</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cute idea. Violates about a billion copyrights, and it'll be a cold day in hell before you're ever able to sell it to anyone, but it still looks like fun. Good luck with it.
