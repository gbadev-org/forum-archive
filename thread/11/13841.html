    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
Someone (acrocosm) has offered to design new graphics for my GBA homebrew game, and they look great. Now all I need is to finish up a bit of the code, and then levels. Lots of levels would be great, but I'm not that good at level design.
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm looking for people who'd like to make levels for my game. It's fairly easy to do, I'll get you set up with the program &amp; instructions, and then it's basically just painting.
<br/>
<br/>
Here you can see an example level that I designed: <a class="postlink" href="http://davr.org/wizards/newmap.png" target="_blank">newmap.png</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I even have a post-processing tool, such that you don't even need to worry about placing borders and things, it's automatic. See this image for example: <a class="postlink" href="http://vyew.com/screens/m1119_39265u4c11447i2r7991t1196.png" target="_blank">autotiler example</a>
<br/>
The top image is what I drew in the map editor, the bottom was automatically generated. This is a somewhat old screenshot, it has a few more enhancements now.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not 100% ready for people to help yet, but you can get started playing around now, and within a week or so I should have everything set up.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, please reply here, and/or PM me your email address, and I'll contact you with the details when we're ready.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
