    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need someone who can help draw 16x16 ship sprites for the project I'm working on.  If anyone is interested, please email me, with 'PixShip sprites' in the subject line.
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the ships will 'upgrade' into another ship.  The most ships I'll have in a series is 5, and I want the usual number to be 2-3.  A few ships will not upgrade.  They will all be in one bitmap, so 256 colors with the default MSPaint palette is fine.  I think that I'll have 50-75 different ships (maybe more), plus 1 more that I already have done, for when all the others are collected.  The ships should all be double-pixeled (what I mean is that each pixel in the ship is 2x2).
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: I'm still a student without a job, so there's no way I can pay for the help, except with the ROMs that I release.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I also would like to get somebody to look over my code (it's in C, using HAMLib) and try to help me clean it up somewhat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Use dummy graphics until you find an artist.  Try looking for an artist on a pixel art forum, if such a place exists. =)  Artists are low supply, high demand here.  That means that they generally won't be available.
