<br/>
The PDRoms compo is starting up and I'm fixing to make an entry or two. Of course, entering a compo is always more fun if you have someone else to collaborate with. I can take care of the programming side of things, but I'm not the greatest artist (even in two colours), and I couldn't compose a chiptune to save my life. So if there's a talented artist or musician out there who is interested, feel free to PM or E-Mail me.
<br/>
You can read all about the Compo here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pdroms.de/pdrc2_5.php" target="_blank">http://www.pdroms.de/pdrc2_5.php</a>

Good luck to all the entries!<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers. Cluck, cluck, gibber, gibber, "my old man's a mushroom", et cetera.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sadly, that contest finished some time ago. However, a Compo right here at GBADev.org is currently in full swing, perhaps you'd be interested in entering that. I'll get in touch soon...<br/>_________________<br/>I'm just off to Hartleypool to buy some exploding trousers.
