    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have created a small puzzle game and want to enter the compo with it. But unfortunately I don't have the proper equipment to test it on real hardware. So is there anyone that can test my game on real hardware? Since this is a hobby project, I can't pay for the work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But I'm afraid it have to wait a little.... I just found out a strange bug in my game which made it run slower after playing a while for some unknown reason. It worked fine before so I'll just check what caused it. I don't think the game will fit in EWRAM, but I can remove some extra stuff so it can fit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Everytime I run VisualboyAdvance, after a while it starts to slow down, but then picks up again.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I wouldn't mind testing it on hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>-pb</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
