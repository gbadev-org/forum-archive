Nintendo outsources to Seattle to save money? At least, that's why I assume non-thai companies would open an office in Thailand.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm Italian but i live in Thailand since 5 years and the company is located in Thailand, i not see the problem , the company is officially registered and is an official Nintendo developer.
<br/>
<br/>
We have published already 1 GBA title.
<br/>
<br/>
Peoples work at here aren't all Italians.
<br/>
<br/>
7 Raven Studios Co.Ltd. is a company registered in Thailand not in Italy, i think people can live around the world and open a business where they like.<br/>_________________<br/>Batblaster / 7 Raven Studios Co. Ltd
