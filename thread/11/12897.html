<br/>
   As you know CreeboMe is only on beta 2 with much to be desired. The plain truth is that I have only worked on it once or twice since its release. The problem is being a one-man-team. I do not put as much time into developing as I want to compose a team of developers to help with CreeboMe's progression because the features I want to add I have no knowledge of. If you have questions post them here, but if you want to apply to join the team drop me an e-mail or a private message.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
