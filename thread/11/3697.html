The title says it all basically!  The source is available for those that are interested in checking it out at: <a class="postlink" href="http://members.fortunecity.com/infinityhq/projects/spcemu.html" target="_blank">http://members.fortunecity.com/infinityhq/projects/spcemu.html</a>.  For those that do not know, the SPC is the sound chip used in the SNES, a 2.048Mhz processor with an 8 channel DSP core and 64k of ram.  A good challenge to emulate!
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to put all the time I'd have liked in the past few months in on it, so I'm hoping somebody would enjoy working on it with me.  The CPU core is about 90% implemented and there is preliminary DSP support in there (one of the songs in zelda plays the correct starting samples!).  I can help get you up to speed on the SPC chip but you should know arm assembly inside and out as it needs every cycle the GBA can give :).
<br/>
<br/>
As an interesting technical aside, the CPU core is using dynamic recompilation, so I also have implemented a relatively painless method of generating ARM assembly in code.  The code might be interesting for that as well.
