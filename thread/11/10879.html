    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there, folks!
<br/>
<br/>
We need a few graphics geniuses for a project we're working on for the Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess you could describe the project as slightly similar to Worms, but with more emphasis on puzzle elements. The game is 2D, viewed side-on.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of distinct themes in the game ranging from labyrinthine haphazard nailed-together wooden mazes to cavernous dungeons. What we need for the project a large number (at least 20) reusable level 'parts' for each distinct theme. The choice of theme is up to you, although there are a few specific themes we would to include.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c287/mrdictionary/piecesexample.png" target="_blank">Here?s an example of some pieces.</a>
<br/>
(These are real pieces used in the current beta, fear my programmer art!)
<br/>
<br/>
(Edit - Somebody told me about <a class="postlink" href="http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/images/lemmings_ground1.gif" target="_blank">this set from Lemmings</a>. That's a better example.)
<br/>
<br/>
The pieces should preferably lie within a single 16-colour palette. However, feel free to use up to 16 distinct 16-colour palettes in your themes. If there are some features that you would like to include in your theme that require more than 16 colours, feel free to use up to 256 colours for those specific pieces. All of the pieces for a single theme should lie within the same 256-colour palette.
<br/>
<br/>
The pieces can be any size, and do not have to be square (use colour 0 for transparent areas). The characters within the game are 8 pixels tall. Use that as a guide, but feel free to design your theme as you wish. They can mount staircases and ramps that are less than 4 pixels tall.
<br/>
<br/>
All level pieces are static and there are no interactive elements such as doors, ropes or lifts, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Although this is a game for the Nintendo DS, do not feel constrained by the standard 8x8 tile design methods. This game is completely freeform and does not use the hardware tile drawing acceleration features of the Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to stress at this point: The game engine is complete. (It?s awesome, by the way! ^_^)
<br/>
<br/>
This is an independent project, and we cannot pay you for your work. It's not being sold, nobody's being paid. It's purely for fun!
<br/>
<br/>
All we can do is give you in-progress game roms so you can see your pieces in action on a real DS, and give you the tools to make your own levels and play them before the game is released proper. That, and buckets of kudos. That's all we got.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, or you?d like more information, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:puzzleproject@mrdictionary.net">puzzleproject@mrdictionary.net</a>, and I?ll give you more details. (Or alternatively, reply to this thread) If you haven?t received a reply within a few days, assume that I didn't receive it to due to Internet weirdness, and feel free to e-mail me again.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can send some samples of work you?ve done previously, and you own a homebrew-capable DS, that would be great. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
