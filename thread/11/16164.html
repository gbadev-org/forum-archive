    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is my idea of homebrew
<br/>
<br/>
Develop a homebrew that will be used to download Skins from a server to be downloaded and installed directly in the microSD /schell/skins/ folder
<br/>
<br/>
This homebrew will allow any DS user that have the Wifi set up to download and install from a skins database...skins previews before download and direct install
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in developping such project, please PM me
<br/>
<br/>
looking for NDS coders willing to make such homebrew
<br/>
<br/>
what I can provide :
<br/>
Skins database
<br/>
Web server to host the skins
