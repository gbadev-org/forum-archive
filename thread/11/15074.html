    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking for programmers with any game development experience or console experience to potentially fill a full-time paid position in Toronto, Ontario.  This is not a mod project or a "work and maybe you'll get paid if it works out" job, this is a full-time contract position working for a game developer on a new AAA intellectual property!  
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any experience, interest or questions, please feel free to respond to this thread or to email me directly at <a href="mailto:gamescout@live.ca">gamescout@live.ca</a>.  I can also help if you need to know experience is relevant and what to put on your resume.
