    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no we do not have a website yet as we have just basicly startedout
<br/>
<br/>
for more info im not sure really what you would liek to know
<br/>
<br/>
anyway here goes.
<br/>
<br/>
The Game is called The LastDream:Rivals, i have been working on the plot for around 5 - 6 years and i feel it has grown very well, we already have programmners working on a pc version but i would like to see a GBA version as well. I am planning on selling the games (hopefully) so the staff that worked on that project would get royalties.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the company it is Dream Gaming we are very new, i am aiming to try and get several projects out and see how it goes from there, we currently have 4 projects in mind one is a online game (in development) and 2 are PC RPGs and the other is this GBA Game
<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing from all of you again :)
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">aha ok :) I meant that rpgs usually need more artists.. one for the backdrops, one for the sprites and one for various things. I noticed that many people on this forum want to do an rpg. I love rpgs though and especially with the chibi style like Magical vacation and Sword of Mana, but I know it is also hard to do. I personally am only on the look-out for very small fun projects or paying things since I need the money. I am unemployed you know :( And that sucks major!<br/>_________________<br/>-----------------------------------------
