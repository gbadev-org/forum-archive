Software programming is not one of my fortes. Of course I will give credit where it is due.

A new-age War game. I need help with it if anyone wants to help. I dont have much time to work on anything currently.
<br/>
<br/>
We could combine the two games if you want.<br/>_________________<br/>Homebrewer! Programmer! Graphic designer!

It's going to be hard to recruit people without at least showing them the design doc.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless your idea is extremely compelling and well-thought out, you're not going to get any programmers to join you.  Everyone has their own pet projects, and not many people are going to drop everything to work on yours just because you say it is a good idea. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you want a team to work on your idea, then you're going to need to put a bunch of work into selling your idea.   A design doc is a good way to show people that you're not just another kid showing up spouting "I have a great game idea!  Who wants to write it!" and instead have thought through a game design and have a real plan.  
<br/>
<br/>
Although even with a great design doc, it's going to be hard unless you want to pay people.  Programming takes a lot of time and effort, which people don't tend to hand out willy-nilly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems that you have really thought this out, and i like the idea for a war game, but i think that it needs to be more new age. Everything seems like it is just the general war game idea. It will need to be improved so that it shows <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> game making talents. Otherwise, it is just any other game. And if you make some preliminary sketches with paint or something, that will entice peoploe to help. The more you get it started, the more people will be willing to help. I never got off the ground because i didnt have enough time to start. That is why i am studying C++ in any free time now, and I suggest that you do the same, if you are really interested. There are many Nintendo DS C++ turorials and also many other C++ tutorials online for free. It is not very fast paced, but it is rewarding. Not many programmers will have free time from their own projects, and even then they wont want to just take someone elses project unless it has a lot of thought and work is put into it to set it up. Good luck with this project.<br/>_________________<br/>Homebrewer! Programmer! Graphic designer!
