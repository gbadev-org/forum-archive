    <h4>#147188 - chatterbug89 - Sun Dec 16, 2007 2:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on a Christmas game for the Drunken Coders contest and thought that maybe some people would like to make some pixel ornaments.
<br/>
<br/>
In my game there are lots of ornaments on a very very very tall tree, so I need as many different ornaments as possible (within reason).  So, if anyone would be interested in making some 16px by 16px ornaments that would be great!  If I include your ornament in the game I'll include your name in the credits (or nick name).  As for what I'm looking for, it can be anything from your initials to whatever you can fit in such a small area, however it should be kind of like a ornament and take up the majority of the 16x16 area.
<br/>
<br/>
To submit an ornament you can just post here with a link to your ornament and what you would want in the credits or get in touch with me via PM.
<br/>
<br/>
Any contributions would be appreciated.  Also, please don't submit any copyrighted works or things I shouldn't be including in my game.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  I'm also looking for a deranged reindeer sprite, 32 by 32 pixels, 64 x 32 or 64 x 64.  If anyone wants to make one that would be great...otherwise I'll settle for my not so great pixel art.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  Two example ornaments I have made can be seen at <a href="http://www.cybernetresources.com/dec1.gif" target="_blank">www.cybernetresources.com/dec1.gif</a> and <a href="http://www.cybernetresources.com/dec2.gif" target="_blank">www.cybernetresources.com/dec2.gif</a>
<br/>
<br/>
TRANSPARENCY:  Please use the following for transparency in your ornament:
<br/>
R: 255
<br/>
G: 0
<br/>
B: 255</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

lol, well I'm not looking for anything specific anyways...though, I am trying to keep a sort of humorous atmosphere in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Howbout this, change "looks like an ornament" to "something that looks interesting". ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hope I'm not too late, but here are two little ones of my own. They are both 16 color PNGs, both with full Red/Blue as transparent. Good luck in the compo. Let us know how you end up!
