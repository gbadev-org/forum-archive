    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone programmed video poker for the gameboy?  It seems like it should be pretty easy...random number generator, simple graphics, possibly an option for triple play, 5-play.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone already has some basic source code, I would really appreciate the help.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

Gbadev.org is NOT a factory for coders who you can shove a 50 pence piece into them and out pops your required code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My apologies.  I was not looking for someone to solve all of my problems.  I am looking for someone with a shared interest in programming, portable game systems, and video poker.  I have experience programming on a PC and older systems, but not with the GBA yet.  I can probably deal pretty well with the logic, but may need some help with the GBA side of thing.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was being pretty clear from the subject that I am not looking to pay someone to do this for me.  I just wanted some help, so the "help wanted" section seemed a reasonable place to start.  If there is a "right" place, please let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you search the forums and the main site's ROMs for card games, you might find somebody who's posted source code for some solitaire games and the like. I do have a vague memory of a poker project or two... if you can at least track down the authors of these old ROMs, you could email them for some example code.
<br/>
<br/>
The best place to start is with the Tutorials. Check the sticky "FAQ" at the top of the beginners section.
