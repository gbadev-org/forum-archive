Please proofread your posts. Is this a request for help? Are you looking for programmers, or something?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that's a good way to go, especially for beginners. 
<br/>
And even just cloning old games is good practice, possibly even better than trying to make a simple original game, because all of the design work is done for you. All you have to do is the code. 
<br/>
Unless you're in my position of course, which is being good at code but lacking in map design skills. Now I'm doing a mini-game with my RPG engine so I can get some practice. 
<br/>
I'm not really sure wether it's better to try and learn design and code at the same time, or to do a clone and then another small project for design. I'd probably go with code first, since you can get into a death-cycle by coding, getting stuck, and redesigning.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as Dan said, there doesn't seem to be a help request in this, although it is a good point.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

<br/>
<br/>
This is a good way to build up credentials and to show that you did many games instead of 1 big game that can take a year or 2 or can even fail because it?s too big. I did a few games which are original and some are simple.
<br/>
<br/>
Small projects that take a month or less are kind of better in many ways for the programmer, artist, and designer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No it's not a copyright. It will be different in art, control, story, etc.  You can compair Mario to shibobi eventhough they are both platforms.
<br/>
And their will be new types of games.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also why wouldn't some want to make a small game compaired to a big one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There other small projects and I agree that small projects can and most likely should be done with one programmer. If there programmers that are beginners then 2 people would work better so that they learn from each other.

PS. This is a good chance to have a game to be enter in the new competition at <a href="http://www.gbax.com/GBAX2004.html" target="_blank">http://www.gbax.com/GBAX2004.html</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
In another contest I got a prize even though the game was made within less than a week on the last week even though the contest was a month long.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I supply the art work and design, and you can keep the prize in the contest if it gets.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
