<br/>
<br/>
I'm searching for a 3D artist capable of doing nice low poly objects, and also to create textures in less than 256 colors.
<br/>
The goal is to integrate those models to a 3D engine made in ASM(currently in developpment), and to present it to the compo in september.
<br/>
If you're motivated and ready to do some good work team, please let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
Have a good day</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
