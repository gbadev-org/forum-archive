Anyway the new pdroms compo has started:

<a href="http://www.pdroms.de/pdrc3-rules.php" target="_blank">http://www.pdroms.de/pdrc3-rules.php</a>
<br/>
?Create a 2D shooter of any kind, this could be a horizontal, vertical or 360? shooter. Be innovative, do not only create spaceshooters :-) By "2D shooter" we do not mean games like "Space Invaders", there should be at least some kind of action on the screen. No "real 3D" stuff!?

Yes I am looking for a programmer that wants to make a small addicting fun shooter game. The programmer should not waste time to be able to finish the game well before the deadline. Is that too much for others to understand?
<br/>
<br/>
Hey I made an original gp32 game, and making an original and fun shooter game would be even simpler.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It doesn't sound as if you have a very consistent idea of what it is you're looking for.

Well the second one is just a clarification in a way. Since many programmers take months to make a thing that takes days. I am sure some know people that procrastinate.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are entering alone in the compo, good luck.

Nah, I know I do that. Sometimes things do just take waaaaaay longer than they should. I guess that's just what happens when life gets in the way of hobbies ;).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Other programmer are fine working with me and work with me again. I work with a few people that won contests. So don't assume since you make a ass-u-me. 
<br/>
<br/>
I understand that life can make people not be on time becasue of life and that's ok. But when programmers would rather play games 90% of the time  and give a demo 6 months later that woud have taken 4 hours then that's not good. I have been requested by programmers to help them out on their pc games but they are not even organised to maintain the project. I had to take over a programmer's game and give it off to another programmer, since the original programmer that wanted help was too busy playing games than making games.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think programmers are incompotent, just hard to work with sometimes. Hey I should know, I use to help programmers in computer class.
<br/>
<br/>
take care

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think calling all programmers incompetent will get you many partners. Perhaps you should give us a break, or at least learn to slag somebody off AFTER they've signed on the dotted line. Not before!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don't think you can be looking for a decent programmer without showing any examples of your artwork and what you're capable of. The small animated .gif is fine, but it's not exactly going to make people want to take you on board. How do people know what standard you are capable of, or whether their programming is at a matching level?
<br/>
<br/>
If you just want some mindless programmer to implement your idea, perhaps you should give details of your design so that people know what they're signing up for?
<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts...

I didn?t say all programmers are incompetent. I am not insulting I am kidding around to get attention and as you see this got attention.
<br/>
I don?t expect programmer to say yes when a better presented post is up anyway. Look around and see the majority of them. Besides telling people a big of the game is like an artists showing off a ? made painting to be judged and that is not a good presentation since many will judge negatively. Some just want info since they would rather take the tips and say it is theirs.
<br/>
<br/>
An animation says more than a few pics, but what was wrong with the animation or design or the ship? 
<br/>
Hey I am sure many programmers like yourself have ideas but the point is to make your idea better. Even companies have many designers on hand to make the game be better.
<br/>
<br/>
PS. You can also try to find artists since you are looking for some at <a href="http://web1.t43.greatnet.de/" target="_blank">http://web1.t43.greatnet.de/</a>
<br/>
If you want some art tips here is a site ;)
<br/>
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~marktroup/vlinkdotvwalkerdotcom/vlink.html" target="_blank">http://home.earthlink.net/~marktroup/vlinkdotvwalkerdotcom/vlink.html</a>   Cool hu?
<br/>
Also you have to improve your game since shoot and dodge has been done to death and having one twist will not help in the compo. I am entering the compo with gp32 if the programmer has time to make one or 2 games, but I don?t want to get first place I want to take as many top spots as I can which many know I can easily take them. The thing is does a programmer want to share the top spots or do they want to play around and just enter where ever? Some people will remake some of their old games and have finished projects and all they need to do is add a few things so I do not see much competition as always.
