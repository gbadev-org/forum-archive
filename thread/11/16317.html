    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm looking for someone to create a DS app or apps for me that can teach a language spoken by only a few people. Maybe there are existing apps out there that already do this. Any help would be appreciated. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am not a programmer but the apps would be very similar to existing language learning apps on iPods 
<br/>
1) flashcards, or 
<br/>
2) select a phrase from an English list and hear the sound file in the target language etc). 
<br/>
<br/>
Must accommodate unicode fonts.  
<br/>
<br/>
I am a newcomer to this forum. Don't know the fair rate for such a job. I am located in Southern California.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The fact that you didn't mention the target language would make it hard for anyone to point out an app that might fit your needs.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
