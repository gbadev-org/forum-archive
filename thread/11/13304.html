    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im interested in making a soccer game quite like fifa on nds where you can manage the teams and also play in the field where each soccer characters stats are directly reflected in gameplay. you can play offline mode but you can also play other ppl online. to connect to online players, we'll have a website where ppl can play matches and sign up to comps.. 
<br/>
<br/>
anyone interested?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ggkfc on Tue May 29, 2007 12:14 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Each member of the team has name, age and stats (speed, handling, set pieces, scoring, defence, skill, stamina, condition, experience). Their stats will directly change how responsive/fast/skilful the member is on the field. Players can get injured in the field.
<br/>
If wifi/online play becomes too hard to integrate into the project, perhaps we will leave it to a hattrick style online play (ie no player control ? just send your latest team stats and the match will take place with a summary of the action send back)
<br/>
There will be a finance side of things with sponsorships, signings, etc..  that will be the easy part. Music and high quality sprites will be later developed after the core is completed.
<br/>
Controls- input- Soccer field management
<br/>
?	2 ways of input:
<br/>
o	Just pad- L &amp; R switch you set of controlled players 
<br/>
	defence midfieldoffenive
<br/>
	X to tab between players (AI usually auto assigns closest to the ball but if you manually change from closest it will not auto reassign for 3) seconds
<br/>
	A to pass
<br/>
	B to strip/special/trick/shoot
<br/>
	Up, down, left, right ? move player
<br/>
	Perhaps later implement combos which have to be learnt by the players to be used by holding x+y for 1 sec then 4 fast taps of keys to initiate.
<br/>
o	Maybe - stick and pad (needs more thought as no easy innovative idea other than using stick to control player movments and seeing as more ppl are right handed, that would mean left hand pad as controls and no R button)
<br/>
?	Can set each player b4 game and at half time and etc breaks to change their playing style, aggressive, defensive, conserve-energy, etc...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lol
<br/>
<br/>
atm im trying to figure how to make a hattrick clone ie how the stats of the player occur through % to make the result( including who scores and how) which is the hardest part. team mangement etc should be just data structures &amp; i/o  so should be fine. the logic behind is getting me stumped. atm im using  a model where the field is cut into 28 areas where scoring must come from links between areas until the last link to the goal.. 
<br/>
<br/>
once i get this down, the projects stage one (aka hattrick clone text-based) should be finished and we can continue on greater things like GAMEPLAY!!!
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all the people thatve put their hands up. will contact once this intial stage is complete</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
