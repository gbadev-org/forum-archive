    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi I am looking for some programmers to work with me on a GBA game demo, called Angels Eternity, the purpose of the demo will be to show to Electronic Arts and Activision, since the game composer has contacts with some producers at those companies. 
<br/>
The game is a simple platformer but compared to other platformers it features a new art style and weird world and the story will be more developped, you can find all the info on the game at <a href="http://www.angels-eternity.com" target="_blank">http://www.angels-eternity.com</a> and the game composers personal site is <a href="http://www.empireofmodernthought.com" target="_blank">http://www.empireofmodernthought.com</a> if you want to download his music. 
<br/>
Email me at <a href="mailto:luc@angels-eternity.com">luc@angels-eternity.com</a> if interested, thank you for reading.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
