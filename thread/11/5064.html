<br/>
You?re welcomed into our nice team!
<br/>
<br/>
A solid reputation doesn?t just build by itself. It needs an enthusiastic team working everyday on a game project. Luckily Blossom Soft is an independent group of people with that kind of aptitude. We have a pleasant ideology and we have a clear idea of what success really is; where there is passion and fun, victory is always in reach! 
<br/>
<br/>
We are developing our very first game; a promising RPG for the Game Boy Advance which we believe could launch us into the market world. So far we?ve been only into pre-production but the global atmosphere is already designed!
<br/>
<br/>
Our team is constituted of both intermediate people and professional people. We even have two people supporting us who are already working for huge brand names. We?re trying to balance people?s tasks according to their strength and personal schedule. But in any situation, we?re trying to work inside a peaceful ambiance. We believe that with a good organization and a serene mood it is possible to create the same kind of quality as produced by a big company such as Konami or even Nintendo!
<br/>
<br/>
If you think that your skill could help us to meet our achievement, don?t hesitate to contact us! You will enjoy working with us!
<br/>
<br/>
You can always visit the website for more information, or just to look at goodies that already came forth out of our game development
