    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For a new strategy/war game im trying to start, I'm going to(hopefully) have a 3d circular(out the turret barrel thing on a tank) picture of where you are pointed on the top. You will be able to shoot with the L button and move the turret with the d-pad. If someone could make me this type of tech demo that would be great.<br/>_________________<br/>Homebrewer! Programmer!
