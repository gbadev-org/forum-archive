<br/>
<br/>
I am seeking a developer or company with deep GBA knowledge, particularly in audio and high bandwidth pixel movement.  Candidate developer should have skills to rapidly develop a shell application that will integrate a 3rd party pixel engine, stereo audio, and overall control functions and asset management.  Preferred location is Silicon Valley/Bay Area, but others are acceptable.  Timeframe is immediate, and estimated duration is 2 to 4 months.
<br/>

A couple of questions, do you run or are part of a software company or are you just a home developer looking for someone to code your games design?   Sorry to ask but a lot of people talk about wanting coders to work on their games and when you start talking about contracts and payment they go  "oh, well, you'll get payed when it's sold"  if thats the case then I wouldn't be interested.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are legit ;) then I would probably be interested BUT I'm in the UK and would have to work freelance (from here) atm. I've already been in talks with an agency about working in the US but until I can track down ex employers I'm going to have problems covering my working years and therefore it's difficult to get a visa :(
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you could send some more info on the project to me  <a href="mailto:splam@emuhq.com">splam@emuhq.com</a>  that would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
