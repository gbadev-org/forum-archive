<br/>
<br/>
Like quite a few people I'm trying to get a game together for the competition on this forum. I have quite a bit of the game done but I need some help with the graphics. I have quite a few of them done but I need some help finishing them off. I'm not looking for an artist, just somebody who can put together some cool graphics. So don't be shy, any help would be appreciated, as I'm sure your graphics are better than mine!!
<br/>
<br/>
The game's working title is Moon Buggy, and it's based on a game I wrote when I was a kid for the ZX Spectrum. I currently have 35 frames of animation for the buggy (wheels moving, jumping and a pretty good crash scene) and some of the tiles for the map done, but I need a few more. I have some stuff for you to work from so I wouldn't expect it to take too long for someone to get right into it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested then, email me <a href="mailto:adrian.robson@carerecords.co.uk">adrian.robson@carerecords.co.uk</a> and I'll send you a copy of the game so far and the graphics I've already created. You can then make up your mind whether you are interested or not.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, anyone who helps out will get a mention in the game somewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to hearing from you...!!!!!!
