    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did an earlier post that I need some help with my RPG game called PokeQuest. I did some thinking, and I want to put it on the side and make a simplier game. Maybe if i have more experience, i can go back to it.
<br/>
<br/>
The new game I want to make is a side-scrolling GBA game. The story that I though up so far was that this one boy was playing a video game, but an evil wizard sucked him in the game. The look for the game is that it looks like one of the earlier super mario games.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to help me in any way, just give me a message.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That, or a boy was playing a video game and the ruler of videoland sucked the boy into the video game to fight the evil wizard. <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_N:_The_Game_Master" target="_blank">Captain N</a> anyone?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a little tip:  gameplay is propbably more important to think about at this point than the story.  Figure out the main game mechanics...that tells us and your players a whole lot more about your game (and whether your game will be interesting) than the story.  
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone had told me the story for Yars Revenge before I played it, I would have rolled my eyes and told them to go away.  But the game mechanic made it a favorite.  
<br/>
<br/>
Swordquest: Earthworld (also for Atari 2600) had an amazing story, but was probably the worst video game I have ever played.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Without sarcasm, I'd say that most of the things that can be done, have been done. I don't consider that a bad thing, though - sure it would be nice to be the inventor of the wheel, but designing and building a great car with four+ wheels is no mean feat either, even if cars have been around for quite a while.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that, I'd rather have a solid game that is a masterful mixture of old and well known elements, than something innovative that may be novel, but crap.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
