    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
As you might have read in the Homebrew Announcement thread, I'm working on a x86 emulator for DS, called DSx86. <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=16956" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=16956</a>
<br/>
<br/>
However, I don't currently have a proper icon for it, and I pretty much suck at creating icons anyways (as you can see in LineWarsDS), so I was wondering if there are any graphics artists here that would be interested and willing to create an icon for it? I can't pay you anything, but you will certainly get your name in the credits and quite possibly into the emulator itself as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
I would need the nds launch icon, and also a version to use as a favicon.ico on my DSx86 web pages at <a href="http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com" target="_blank">http://dsx86.patrickaalto.com</a> would be nice to have.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any specific ideas or requirements for the icon, but perhaps it could give an impression of a DOS program/prompt running in a DS? Or something along those lines?
<br/>
<br/>
You can contact me by email using my first name at my domain name (patrickaalto.com) if you prefer that over this public forum.
<br/>
<br/>
For your consideration, and thanks for reading!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I went and did a couple of quick nds launch icon mockups with my free time (which should have been used to study for finals). All are 32x32 pixels in dimensions.
<br/>
<br/>
This one is probably too much and the lettering in the screens are too small, but it was my first idea (that thing on the side is meant to be a floppy disk)

<br/>
<br/>
This next one is 3 different versions of a simple prompt look, minus the rainbow separators (I personally like the last one)

If you like them, then go ahead and use them, or alter them to your liking.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I like the idea of these (echos the DS logo; the colours for background and text are actually the official colours from the logo) but obviously my execution is awful. Might be worth looking at if someone with a flair for pixel art completely redid them.<br/>_________________<br/>I've got nothing to say, but it's OK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, you guys are fast!!
<br/>
<br/>
Both of these have pretty neat ideas, I like the DS:\&gt; prompt, and also the "dual screen" icon idea is very appealing!
<br/>
<br/>
I'll think about these, big thanks! I probably won't decide on which one to use quite yet, so that people that don't browse this forum many times a day have a chance to give their ideas as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!
