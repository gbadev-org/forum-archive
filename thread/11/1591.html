<br/>
<br/>
Studio Archcraft (<a class="postlink" href="http://studioarchcraft.com" target="_blank">http://studioarchcraft.com</a>) is currently looking 
<br/>
for an extra programmer who can work for at least 5 hours a day for the 
<br/>
next 2 ~ 3 months who works quickly and is able to work well 
<br/>
with a team over the internet. Knowledge of programming for the 
<br/>
GBA is a must, as well as knowledge of Mode7 programming. 
<br/>
<br/>
The game the programmer will be working on is called "Black Sigil" 
<br/>
and is a RPG for the GBA. The parts that the programmer will be 
<br/>
working on MUST be finished by October. 
<br/>
<br/>
They will be assigned: 
<br/>
- programming of the world map engine in Mode7. 
<br/>
- programming the menu/stat system engine. 
<br/>
<br/>
All graphics and designs are finished and no designing work will 
<br/>
be given to the programmer. 
<br/>
<br/>
Payments will be given in direct payment or royalties depending on 
<br/>
preference of the programmer. 
<br/>
<br/>
