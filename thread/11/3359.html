    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
My company is looking for an experienced lead or Senior game programmer. The job is to work with a new hardware (it's not GBA), but strong experience with this sort of console (or earlier, such as CGB or NES) is an absolute plus. We are looking for someone who could commit to a 5 to 6 months mission, on payroll or as a contractor (we're flexible), hopefully longer if we develop more games for this new console.
<br/>
<br/>
You would work in a creative and friendly environment, as we are a small company that pays well, with no tolerance for house politics and the such. You pretty much would be in charge for the project, and a production team would be built around you.
<br/>
<br/>
Applicants please pm me with a resume. I am sorry but I will only respond to applicants with 3 or more years of professional experience on published games, or if you are not seriously considering the job, as I cannot say too much since we are under strong confidentiality on this project. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>
