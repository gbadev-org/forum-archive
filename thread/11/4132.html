    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
 We are a team of 2 programmers and 2 artists working on a serious project. We would like to have a good looking web site for our team/project. Almost 4 of us would be able to do it (except for art for me and the other programmer), but we are working very hard on the project, using all of our free time. 
<br/>
<br/>
We have a royalty system in which the time spent on the web site would count as time spent on the game.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the perfect profile would be someone knowing HTML editing (programmation or editor) and good in web art as well. There is however a possibility for some art to be done by our artists.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would be willing to help out, but only if there is some sort of reward in it for me. It's not that I mind helping people, just that I have seen alot of people come through these forums claiming to need help on games etc which never eventuate. So if there is some sort of guarantee that this project wont dissolve after I spend time on it (time I should be using to look for actual work) and there is at least a little something in it for me besides the warm fuzzy feeling of helping people I don't know, cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, didn't mean to sound so mean. Check my tag line for my personal website, not much yet (only went up friday) but hopefully it shows that I know stuff (particularly if your hosting supports php).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

Version 2.0 now up - guaranteed at least 100% more pleasing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
