We have the resources and I have seen many programmers willing to help us. If all of us work together, our dream will be ALIVE!

So, if you have what it takes to program the engine for Super Smash Bros DS then step ahead. We are taking submissions. We are accepting numerous programmers that are willing to join the team and are willing to work together.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be part of the team, tell us what you are able to do, tell us (if any) about your previous nds projects, tell us who you are and finally tell us why you think you should take this position.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We're working on that element with out GBA version. The actual gameplay, besides all the cool special effects, is primarily a 2d fighter, with physics info to make it non-health based. Thus, it's very possible on both systems. Thing is, you have to tweak every character right to give them both benefits and weaknesses, and balance that all out to make the game fun and all.
<br/>
<br/>
We are using our own original images (sprites) for the game. Although these will be based on the original charachers (kirby will still be kirby) we are giving them the fairy-tale defense names. Nintendo can't say a thing (I think) because the artwork will be our own. So there.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the gameplay itself, that's going to take some time...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a Hello Kitty spoof here in Japan (Charmy Kitty IIRC).  She's clearly Hello Kitty, but she has a few differences.
<br/>
<br/>
Same:
<br/>
General Style
<br/>
Nose
<br/>
Face Shape
<br/>
<br/>
Different:
<br/>
Has furry cheeks
<br/>
Does not wear clothes
<br/>
Sits on all fours
<br/>
<br/>
Sanrio might have a case against them.  The name is similar, and the character is similar.  The character is different enough, but isn't fooling anybody.  Nor does it seem to be wildly popular, but I don't have access to the sales figures. =)
<br/>
<br/>
My point is that if you draw Link and call him "Happy Elf", you still have link.  If you palette shift him and give him a feather in his hat, you are probably OK.

Why does HAL want or need your tech demo to create a GBA version of Smash Brothers?  Assuming they did want the demo, they'd either hire you or more likely have you complete it with your own team.  Chances are slim.  If they wanted to make Smash Brothers GBA, it would have been made already.

By programmers do you mean you?  Professional game programmers are regular people with jobs programming at professional studios.  They usually don't "profit" from the release of a game.  They earn a normal salary.  If the game does well they may get a bonus.  Raises are given based on time with the company or demonstrated ability depending on the studio.

What will you do if they say "sorry, not interested"?  What will you do if they get upset that you made a game without a license (ie permission) and don't want to deal with you at all?  Generally, you want to secure a license instead of assuming you'll get one.

It sets a bad precedent.  If they let you take liberties with a franchise, somebody else might assume that they can also take liberties with similar franchise.  This is bad.  You might fly under the radar, but that doesn't mean that you actions are being condoned.

If you don't distribute you are probably way under the radar no matter what you are making.

Isn't that what tepples said?  If you use your own characters and worlds, you are safe.  If you use Nintendo's, you are at fault.  If you use almost Nintendo characters you live somewhere in the gray zone.

Uncles a Web Developer and apparently, if you are making a remake of a game, until you change the content(not necisarily gameplay) you can still be at fault, but odds are slim<br/>_________________<br/>Current Project-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sry for the dbl post, didnt see the other one...
<br/>
<br/>
for the ds, i doubt anyone will make the game so soon... however, for the gba, there are 2 groups making it right now as far as i can tell... 
<br/>
<br/>
1 group went right out to the gameplay, while i went for char selects... my char select screen is done and im now working on the gameplay... though i should really look into cooperating with the other team, i have had no chances to get in contact (maybe they forgot about this site) 
<br/>
<br/>
anywhos... they have a demo out apparently and went a bit away from what im doing, but oh well... looks like their stuff works and mines still being made... still not sure how i should do this though.... ima semi-newb, ive started a bunch of games but i fail to finish them because i get brain farts and cant find any1 capable of helping... if i get the gameplay as far as the other team got with their demo, i may be able to release a demo sooner er later... but im not going to copy their work (just seems boring) ima make mine similar, but its going to be my doing till they reply to me about cooperating... &gt;.&lt;<br/>_________________<br/>Current Project-
