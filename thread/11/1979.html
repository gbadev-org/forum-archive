    <h4>#10261 - Nessie - Sun Aug 31, 2003 11:32 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've assembled a small team of talented people to work on a game project that will be seeking commerical publication.  The progress on our demo is going well, though the primary artist has recently taken a leave of absence for about a month, possibly longer.  We therefore need another artist or two.
<br/>
<br/>
Current art needs fall into two general categories...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">BG Art</span>:  entails polishing existing background tiles and working on any new tiles needed to complete the look for our demo levels.  All BG art will be using 16 colour tiles.  The BG artist will be expected to either be able to work very closely with someone hired specifically as a level designer or better yet, be able to do double-duty on BG art and level design as the two disciplines are inter-dependant. 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Sprite Art</span>:  designing and drawing unique enemies and characters for our game, using a mix of both traditional pixel animation and Casltevania style characters comprised of multiple body parts animated via GBA sprite rotation, etc.  A tool is in the works to make it easy for the artist to generate these articulated characters.  Another important task is to refine our main character animations and generally make the character more unique and memorable.  Sprites will be drawn with 16 colours and will roughly be in the size range of 32x40 pixels, though some characters will be both smaller and larger.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ideal candidate would be equally able to work on excellent quality BG and Sprite art, though if you have an obvious talent for one or the other, that would be fine too.  
<br/>
<br/>
Art style is similar any of the more recent Castlevania games, especially Aria of Sorrow.  Here's a link to some screens from the game, though there are many other sites that have screens, I'm sure:  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/gba/adventure/castlevaniaariaofsorrow/screenindex.html" target="_blank">http://www.gamespot.com/gba/adventure/castlevaniaariaofsorrow/screenindex.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding compensation, we are currently only able to extend royalty offerings to any employee.  There are a few situations which might lead to these art positions becoming full-time paid positions, but for now, I can only extend royalty offerings upon publication of the game.  The exact amount will be negotiated prior to "hiring" and signing a work contract.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in either position, or better yet, can do both, please send me a current portfolio (preferably less than 250K--if we like your work and would like to see more, we'll contact you!) or send me Private Message or e-mail with a link to your website if that's relevant.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Nessie,
<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to work with someone with as much game-industry experience as you but I'm not an artist :(
<br/>
<br/>
You can find the type of sprite-artist that you require at :-

<br/>
<br/>
I've seen plenty of castlevania-type art there.
<br/>
<br/>
Ps.. Keep me in mind if you need any junior programmers (I'll work for free and I make a killer cup of tea!!)<br/>_________________<br/>---------------------------------------------------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, thanks.  I actually posted there first.  
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding pulling on a junior programmer, I'll maybe talk to the tech programmer today and see what he thinks.  To be honest, we'd probably want someone to help with maintaining our tools more than we'd need a game programmer, at least for now.  Less fun perhaps, but still extremely important work.  
<br/>
<br/>
So, if you could stand to help with something like mapEd or a new tool I've started, Anim8, that would be more helpful for us in the short term.   I currently just use MFC for mapEd since it's dead easy to do the user interface stuff, allowing me to focus more on the functionality beyond the actual UI.  
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
