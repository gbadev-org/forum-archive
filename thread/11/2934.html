    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I am one of the developers of <a class="postlink" href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">uCON64</a>. The latest new feature is support for the Flash 2 Advance linker. The transfer code is basically the code of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.emulinks.de/f2a/" target="_blank">f2a</a> with a few improvements. I don't own an F2A (yet), that's why I need some people to test the code.
<br/>
The parallel port code has been test a bit by David Voswinkel, the author of the parallel port code in f2a. The USB code has not been tested at all.
<br/>
I would like to know if the USB code works. Currently, the USB code should work only under GNU/Linux, but it shouldn't be too hard to add some code so that it works on other platforms as well (provided you know enough about USB programming -- I don't, yet).
<br/>
The parallel port code should work on most platforms that have a parallel port. That means DOS, Windows (95-XP), GNU/Linux (x86/MIPS), FreeBSD (x86) and BeOS (x86). It doesn't work on AmigaOS or any other big endian platform yet, because I haven't regarded endianess issues... yet ;-)
<br/>
Please note that the code is new, so the binaries available on the homepage don't have F2A support. I would like to have the code tested <span style="font-style: italic">before</span> new binaries are released. So, you have to download the current source code via CVS. If people are interested in testing the code, but cannot be bothered to set up CVS I will put a CVS snapshot on the homepage. Please let me know if this applies to you.
<br/>
Compiling the source code isn't that difficult, more so if you follow the <a class="postlink" href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/ucon64/faq.html#3" target="_blank">elaborate instructions</a> in the <a class="postlink" href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/ucon64/faq.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a>. uCON64 can be compiled with GCC (including DJGPP, MinGW and Cygwin) and Visual C++. Users of GNU/Linux who would like to test the parallel port code might be interested in the fact that uCON64 supports ppdev (new feauture) which makes it possible to communicate with the F2A without having to run uCON64 with root privileges. Use the configure option --enable-ppdev to enable the code. Please note that the USB code has to be executed as root. Don't forget to use the configure option --with-libusb, because the USB code is disabled by default.
<br/>
After you've compiled the source code you might want to read the <a class="postlink" href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/ucon64/faq.html#4" target="_blank">the answer to question 4</a> for some installation instructions. You might also want to read <a class="postlink" href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/ucon64/faq.html#51" target="_blank">the answer to question 51</a>. You need some <a class="postlink" href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ucon64/f2afilesv3.zip?download" target="_blank">additional files</a> before you can start testing the code. Follow the link or go to the homepage and search for f2afiles. If you've set up everything, uploading a GBA program to the parallel port version of the F2A is as simple as:
<br/>
ucon64 -xf2a someGBAprogram
<br/>
In order to upload something to the USB version of the F2A you have to use the switch -port, for example:
<br/>
ucon64 -xf2a someGBAprogram -port=usb0
<br/>
Currently the port number is ignored, so it does not matter if you use -port=usb0 or -port=usb9.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to hear from some of you. You can reply to this thread or contact me <a class="postlink" href="https://sourceforge.net/users/dbjh/" target="_blank">via SourceForge</a>.

<br/>
The code should work on big endian machines now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
