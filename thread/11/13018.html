    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Game name:</span>
<br/>
Voltz DS
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Who I need:</span>
<br/>
Pixel artist to work on a home brew DS game.
<br/>
I'm looking for someone who has done DS art before and knows the ropes.  The lucky artist would need to design art for a game already in development.  I'm willing to give a lot of free rein with the art style and content.  The game needs to be appropriate for all ages (no bare bouncing boobies, demon disemboweling, etc).  
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What art is needed:</span>
<br/>
I am very, very art challenged, so you would need to do everything.  That means menus, backgrounds, action animations, etc.  The art extent would be mainly up to you.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Art format:</span>
<br/>
Do you have tools you like to use?  Great.  Let me know what they are, the formats, etc and I'll see about working them in.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Game concept:</span>
<br/>
  The player is shown a board with energy storing nodes.  Random nodes are set with random charges, and the player must clear all charges from the board.  This is done by adding energy to nodes until they reach a critical charge.  When this happens, the node releases all the energy it contains onto the board.  Released energy travels until it hits a charged node or goes off the board.  
<br/>
  The player starts with a set amount of energy.  The energy is depleted every time the player charges a node.  Extra energy can be earned by causing chained node bursts. 
<br/>
  An example would be the player charging a node which bursts, and the released energy hits other nodes and causes them to burst.

<span style="font-weight: bold">About me:</span>
<br/>
I've done commercial game and hobby development.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
Commercial experience:</span>
<br/>
BREW game development. 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Non-Commercial experience:</span>
<br/>
PC games, (action and puzzle).
<br/>
Home brew CGB game.
<br/>
Java and BREW games.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Added info:</span>
<br/>
I'm making this game because I want to get into commercial DS development.  I know someone from a previous job who does DS work and is willing to introduce me to developers.  The main reason I am doing this game is to get job.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Time frame:</span>
<br/>
I have the basic game up and running.  I'd like to get this done as soon as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Why should you work on this:</span>
<br/>
1. Your work could be seen by major commercial developers.
<br/>
2. It's always good to know people in the industry.
<br/>
3. You'll get a lot of free reign on design.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
