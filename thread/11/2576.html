    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all.
<br/>
<br/>
Trying to find an artist or two to work on what will hopefully be a commercial quality game.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a vehicle based, top down game, but unlike any of the driving games out there at te moment.  (It's not a racer)!
<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry - it's not an overambitious 'we're gona make millions' type of thing.  We just reckon we can make a commercial quality GBA game within a few months.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone's interested, let me know.  We're just talking about dawing some VERY simple vehicles, streets, buildings, signs etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Mail me at:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">um, the first post specifically asked for coders. This is specifically asking for artists (as it looks as though the projects got 2 coders now - hopefully).
<br/>
<br/>
But thanks anyway.
