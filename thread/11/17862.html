    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i made a pretty advanced 2d fighting engine a few years ago, but i haven't been able to open the project since late 2009 when i switched to windows 7.
<br/>
the ham tools aren't compatible with win7 and thus i cannot compile. i have tried developing on a virtual machine with no luck either.. but i have all the code and i kept all the ham tools with their installer.
<br/>
<br/>
i have decided to enlist the help of another programmer who operates windows vista or XP, who would compile and contribute with code, help advance the realization of the game design document.
<br/>
we would share the credit for the engine and you could do with it whatever you feel like afterward if you decide to help me develop it, we could use it to make a new game or our separate games.
<br/>
<br/>
the game is already kind of designed though so there's not much room for being creative with gameplay mechanics and such!
<br/>
<br/>
i'll leave you with a bit from my demo:

<br/>
<br/>
i can also link the rom demo if you wish to play it. (i don't do so right now because i sent it over to kron and maybe they will publish it soon, i am not sure)
<br/>
note: the actual rom is more advanced than these archive vids. it supports mapped projectiles and actually runs a lot faster
<br/>
<br/>
mind you i am not asking you to program the game for me! i know what code needs to be written. i would still be a programmer on this all the way and handle the graphic assets, but i find myself in a position where i need someone to lend me a hand.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: ROM LINK -

(load it onto a pocketpc or cellphone emulator if you can, it runs blazing fast on those)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah the second computer choice would be viable, the problem is that i work on design (3d renders and web) and i already got 2 computers in my room with win7, 2gb video, 6gb ram. even if i bought another one there's no room for it here. and there is a vista machine but it's of a relative and heavily used in school projects as well as work, so i really couldn't have time to dev on it.
<br/>
<br/>
now, 
<br/>
installing older windows as a boot partition?. im already running ubuntu and windows 7 parallel. wouldn't that result in any problems? i think i would rather not. i have enough stuff installed as it is, and the ram goes way low when working with 20 layers in adobe applications
<br/>
<br/>
besides i gave back the borrowed OS i used to try the virtual machine thing, i'd have to buy it as well or get it back..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
edit: 
<br/>
god!! maybe i could even work this around somehow but the ham tools have kicked the bucket ever since! their website is nowhere to be found.. (http://www.ngine.de/) the only website for it is the visualham compiler which only runs in older machines (http://www.console-dev.de/page_visualham/) i heard there is a way to make ham work with 2005 visual studio but the instructions on how to do this are on a dead link and nowhere on the internet either!.
<br/>
(http://www.console-dev.de/category/tools/) - last post on that page.
<br/>
<br/>
 it's such a shame cause it was a great devkit and visualham would load up and compile with ease and quick, standard installation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if nobody is interested i guess instead of installing windows xp i would rather just port the code over to another platform, i'm not really looking to code in anything but C or C#. but im sad cause i was very excited for pushing the limits of this little handheld to see how far i got and how many problems i solved with it's limited resources.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">a bit, not really ham but the Hel library for ham, my scrolling and multiframe windows are done with calls to hel, as well as the palette switching, but that's more like an extra. i think they can be rewritten though it's not too long.
<br/>
<br/>
but can you program with C in devkitarm? i thought it was just for arm assembly language, im not really trying to go through the trouble of learning a new language to port my code over. in any case it would be a more natural progression i feel to rework it for XNA which is very similar to hel language and format wise</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A Mac Mini is not very big.  Presumably you could run XP on an (older) Intel Mac Mini.

You can work with C, C++ and ASM.  It would not surprise me if you can use other languages as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
