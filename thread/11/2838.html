    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello i have came up with an idea but i need help because i have no knowlage of programming or the gba
<br/>
<br/>
my idea is to have two gba's linked together using a link cable,one with a flash cart in it and the outher with a game cart in it (with a legal game or demo) and the idea is that the game in gameboy A will be copyed to the flash cart on gameboy B
<br/>
<br/>
The way i think this may work is that if gameboy B (the target gameboy) sends a multiboot program to gameboy A (the sorce gameboy) which tells it to send the contents of its cart to gameboy B and gameboy B puts it onto the flashcart.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not want to use this idea for any ilegal stuff!
<br/>
<br/>
thanx for reading</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's an absolute load of crap. Why would you want to do this, other than for illegal copying? If you want to legitimately backup your games you would do so by yourself. If you want to copy across GBAs then obviously you are just looking for an easy way to share games.
<br/>

Go shove it up your a$$.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Should it be done just because it can be done? No way.

<br/>
If you want to play a game, get a job so you can pay for one, loser.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">loser?,what the fuck is rong with u ive told u that i want it for a means of easly distributing legal games you fucking prick
<br/>
<br/>
anyways why are u so against piracy,is piracy the reason u havent gone commercial? lol
<br/>
<br/>
if there wasnt any piracy the game companys wouldnt develop new,better consoles in a feble attempt to stop piracy
<br/>
<br/>
so if there wasnt no piracy ud still be using an atari (not that i have anything against atari,i still play on myne!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for new, better consoles being developed, it has more to do with competition in the market, a lot less to do with piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to the matter at hand:
<br/>
If you have a way to easily transfer legal games between gba, it's going to get used far more for transferring illegal games.

<br/>
It's obvious you're talking about Nintendo GamePak-to-Flash transfer here, which is illegal. Otherwise you would have said both units have a flash cart. There aren't any legal-to-distribute games on a Nintendo GamePak.
<br/>
<br/>
No one here is going to help you develop an easier way to pirate GBA games, no matter what your intentions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I was just hoping to make a premature end of this thread before it got any uglier.
