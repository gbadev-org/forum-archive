The RTS4DS Engine probably can produce the most advanced, fully-featured and powerful RTS games on the NintendoDS.  The engine has received some major updates lately and we're needing more playtesters to help us into the final stretch of development.  We have builds and content for you ready to download.  If you're interested, please register and let us know here:-
