    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey kids,
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to release a sequel to my puzzle game, Clem the Retarded Elf. The new programming is done, the new graphics are done, the new level editor is done, and now all I need are some levels. I'm just too busy to do them myself.
<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone wants to help me out, I'm looking to pull together 100 levels for the game, and I'd prefer to work with just one person (though I might consider splitting the $$$ across a small team.) I'll pay a flat fee of $300 for the work. You'll get your name plastered all over the new version. Could be a nice portfolio piece for you up-and-comers.
<br/>
<br/>
You can download the original game at my GBA website, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.scottlininger.com/gba" target="_blank">http://www.scottlininger.com/gba</a>. You can also play with the original level editor (it's a flash movie) on the same page, to get an idea of how much work it is to do a level. (It's pretty easy, I think.)
<br/>
<br/>
Before you contact me, PLEASE play all of the levels in the original to get an idea of the kinds of gameplay that I had in the original. I'd like the puzzles to be at least as challenging. The sequel features just one new gameplay element, but it's a big one that will require some pretty clever level design. (I'll tell you more when you're hired.)
<br/>
<br/>
So if you check it out and decide your interested, PM me with a little bit about yourself and an example Clem level that you built with the online editor. First comers will get preference... I'd like to get started ASAP.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
<br/>
