    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm posting a new topic, because I've changed the angle and this may grab more attention. We have right now, a composer and a writer, and I who will be doing all of the 2D pixel art. The story is about 2 heros coming to a town that is covered in black fog. You choose from the Fighter or the Wizard and enter the world. The game is called LightBringers. You work your way through 4 dungeons and bring light back to the main city. After that? you go to the main boss and kill him... the game is small due to the competition rules, otherwise we would have a much bigger game on the go. If you are interested just give me a shout. Our motto right now for the game is KISS(keep it simple stupid).
