    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I came across the mention of psp owners able to use a port of windows 95 on their psp. Is it possible for this to be done on the nintendo ds. Maybe someone can develope a port of this for the ds.The first problem I can think of is the legality of porting this to the ds. Maybe people can only use this legaly if they own a windows 95 computer.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the site for information on running windows 95 on the psp
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.hacker.co.il/psp/bochs/" target="_blank">http://www.hacker.co.il/psp/bochs/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
the website listed above also makes mention that it is a port of this
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://bochs.sourceforge.net/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
that is used to run windows 95 on the psp. Maybe it can be used similar to lazyones port of mini vmac for the ds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PSP: 333 MHz. DS: 20% of that.
<br/>
<br/>
PSP: 32 MB of RAM. DS: 12% of that without a SLOT-2 RAM card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats to bad. It may be cool to create a simple windows 95 themed homebrew loader that can be loaded by default on your ds and then just used as a file browser with a windows 95 theme. I wouldn't mind making some graphics for this program if somebody wants to program it. Just make sure that it is supported by the R4 :)
<br/>
<br/>
Just thought of something. If somebody is going to program this, lets make it a vista theme not just a windows 95 theme. Something with icons and a start menu.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well if you don't have a floating point co-pro on the 486 I'd pit the 66meg Arm9 against it.
