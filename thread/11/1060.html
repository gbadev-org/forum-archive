    <h4>#5085 - Rez - Sun Apr 20, 2003 8:29 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First I will introduce myself. 
<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kris Hall, I've been lurking around for the last week or so and I've seen some really great talent here. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am the founder and producer for an independant game development team, Riot Software. 
<br/>
<br/>
Riot was founded in 1996 and we've been involved in several high profile projects over the past years. 
<br/>
<br/>
I myself have been involved in the development of such AAA titles like Half-Life, Diablo and Dungeon Siege. I was also a former Asst. Producer at 2015, Inc. working on medal of Honor Allied Assault and heading off their internal Valuware team, Trainwreck Studios. 
<br/>
<br/>
We have a very strong and talented team, but we are looking to broaden our art team for our current project, "Jack". 
<br/>
<br/>
"Jack" is a visually unique and addictive story-based platform title for the GBA. Currently, "Jack" is in its pre-production phase. We are working on a very hefty design document along with all art in conceptual form, including storyboards for the intro sequence. 
<br/>
<br/>
As it is now, we have a very strong art team, however we are looking for pixel artists who are familiar with working in a limited palette environment. 
<br/>
<br/>
Riot is currently in the market for 3-4 artists, the skills required are (but not limited to): 
<br/>
<br/>
-Working with 16-256 color palette 
<br/>
<br/>
-Creating sprites within the 32x32 to 1024x1024 (scaled down of course) size limit for the GBA. This includes characters and tiles. 
<br/>
<br/>
-Animating character specific sprites (this includes some tiles) 
<br/>
<br/>
-Have a strong knowledge of the GBA and its development limitations* 
<br/>
<br/>
-Have a strong work ethic and personal will to see things through. 
<br/>
<br/>
-Works well with other team members, and understands their role specific to the team and project. 
<br/>
<br/>
-Is NOT required to be located within the WA state area (though it is a plus) 
<br/>
<br/>
The positions available are non-paying and contractual, with the option for full employment once the product gains a publishing contract. 
<br/>
<br/>
We will be working closely with Nocturnal Entertainment, as we will be utilizing their Catapult engine technology for this product. 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Once "jack" moves into its full production phase, milestones will be made to reach a goal of having a 4 level, playable, working demo within 6 months. 
<br/>
<br/>
This demo will be sent as a proposal to a few key Publishers that Riot has developed relations with. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please submit work examples to <a href="mailto:krish@riotsoftware.com">krish@riotsoftware.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
-Your work examples are yours and yours only, we only require that you send artwork examples to guage your talents and fit for the product 
<br/>
<br/>
-We are looking for a specific style. Something in the realm of cartoon style monsters, tiles and characters. (examples: Invader Zim) 
<br/>
<br/>
-If you are brought on to work on the project, it is required that you sign a Non-Dislosure/Non-Compete agreement. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions about Riot or our project, feel free to post or email me. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time, and I look forward to seeing some of your work. 
<br/>
