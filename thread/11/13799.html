    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We are starting a prototype for a very exciting DS app/title.  We have coders who are familiar with C++, but they have only just begun working on the DS homebrew kits.
<br/>
<br/>
We would like to bring a DS Consultant onto the project.  Someone who has experience making a DS application and one that can talk code with our coders.
<br/>
<br/>
If the project takes off, you will be compensated.
<br/>
<br/>
Please email me at <a href="mailto:truedoogie@gmail.com">truedoogie@gmail.com</a> or respond to this post.
<br/>
<br/>
For more information on this exciting project, contact me as well.  It has massive potential and is unlike anything on the DS currently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
