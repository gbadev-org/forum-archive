It's an Exercise assistant. You select what you do from a variety of exercises, and an animation at the top (which I will take care of. I'm an animator (xnctoon.co.nr)) shows you how to do the exercise properly. After the exercise is finished, you can write in what weight, and how many reps you did on the bottom screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've seen Flash that was more crudely drawn. But this is a mock-up; I'd imagine that a final product would include more polished drawings of the start, middle, and end positions of each movement.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You should realize that having an idea isn't enough to convince people to work for/with you. You need to put some effort out like making the art and sounds already, and even better: writing a design document. Just google 'Design Document' and you'll find why that little Word file is so important to any team-based project.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is good- much better than an idea alone.  Still, if your idea isn't very "interesting" you may be stuck with a bunch of sound effects.  Generally speaking, the closer you are to finished- or at least the more you have to show- the easier it will be to find help.

<br/>
You need a <span style="font-weight: bold">convincing</span> design document.  I doubt a plain old design document would cut it.
<br/>
<br/>
Money will not fail to generate interest.  Even if you post something as vague as- "I want help making something, I'll pay $100.  Contact me for details."  I'm fairly sure that someone will email you.  They may not be interested if the details are silly, but someone will ask.  With a solid (publicly posted) concept and a little money you will probably be able to find someone reliable.  (People are flakey and weird.)
<br/>
<br/>
It may sound harsh, but most people are busy working on (or dreaming about) their own stuff.

Thank you?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll whip up a preliminary sample animation in a bit. So, for my "design document", I'll have a semi functional one in Flash, just for the sake of the menus (FYI, I know next to no ActionScript), but it'll prolly go like this.
<br/>
<br/>
I.Intro Screen
<br/>
II. Main Menu
<br/>
...A. Start Session
<br/>
......1. Load Session (from IIB) (After selection, go to III)
<br/>
......2. Whatever's Open (After selection, go to III)
<br/>
...B. Session Setup
<br/>
......1. Calendar (to select the day)
<br/>
.........a. Exercise Selection
<br/>
............i. Input planned number of sets (including warmup)
<br/>
...C. Options
<br/>
......1. I doubt there's gonna be much in here. MAYBE an option to put your own music in?
<br/>
...D. Progress
<br/>
......1. Calendar (for date)
<br/>
.........a. Exercises performed, showing sets, reps and weights in an Excel Format, or something like
<br/>
III. Session Proper
<br/>
...A. If you make it up as you go along, then you'll be able to set your first exercise. If you loaded it from IIB, then the first exercise on the list would start. 
<br/>
...B. Exercises themselves- Once it starts
<br/>
......1. Write down weight on the touch screen (regardless if you chose  IIA1 or IIA2)
<br/>
......2. Countdown- 3...2...1...
<br/>
......3. Animation Plays on the top screen of the motion, on the bottom screen, it shows what exercise you're doing, How many sets of it you've done, how many sets total this session.
<br/>
......4. When you're finished, hit the red button in the reps box, and
<br/>
write down the number of reps
<br/>
......5. When session is done, it'll save it.
<br/>
IV. Exercises- Just gonna cover a few broad ones:
<br/>
...A. Back
<br/>
......1. Pullup
<br/>
......2. Bent-Over Row
<br/>
...B. Chest
<br/>
......1. Pushup
<br/>
......2. Bench Press
<br/>
......3. Dip
<br/>
...C. Legs
<br/>
......1. Squat
<br/>
......2. Deadlift
<br/>
