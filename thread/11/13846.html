    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We have recently been approached about developing a Nintendo DS version of a commercial edutainment title that is available for Windows. As a result, we are exploring the possibility of contracting out the lead programming to an experienced Nintendo DS developer (or team).
<br/>
<br/>
This opportunity is a <span style="font-weight: bold">paid contract </span>that <span style="font-weight: bold">can be undertaken remotely</span>, with the developer working in conjunction with our team to coordinate production of all graphics and sound collateral. The implementation will follow a project plan and should be reasonably straightforward for a developer with experience in graphics, sound and image processing on the Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
If this sounds of interest to you, please PM me to make arrangements to discuss this further.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
