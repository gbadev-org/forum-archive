    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="color: red"></span>I am a massive portal fan.
<br/>
<span style="color: #444444"></span>I have had a GameBoy Advance for about one year now, and have been wishing for portal on it for ages, so when I saw this site, I thought it would be perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
I instantly started planning a portal game and found this picture : <a href="http://senior-x.deviantart.com/art/Portal-meets-the-GameBoy-325847901," target="_blank">http://senior-x.deviantart.com/art/Portal-meets-the-GameBoy-325847901,</a> but realised I had to have experience in coding which I had never done before. This why I posted this thread in hope that someone could get inspiration and make this game.
<br/>
<br/>
I may be able to do texturing (I may not have enough time, and am not a very good artist), but I really don't think I can do anything else that would help.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the layout for the controls.
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
 Left button: pick up object or push button.                   Right button: crouch.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                 Up: move North.                                         A: shoot blue portal.    
<br/>
<br/>
Left: move West.       Right: move East.
<br/>
<br/>
               Down: move South.                               B: shoot orange portal.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            Select: selects things in sub-menu.    Start: opens sub-menu.
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
The controls for the menu are scrolling (up and down), A (select) and B (back)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this thread, and I hope this gets made.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But just so you know, it's REALLY unlikely that anyone would run with your idea -- most GBA developers have their own projects they are working on, so unless you had something really significant to offer (ie a complete set of graphics and sound assets that you made for the game), people have no incentive to stop working on their own project and work on yours.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make it happen, learn to code :) I'm not saying that to sound rude, but as an encouragement: learning to code is fun. 
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Where can I find this one? I searched his username and the topic name, but I couldn't find it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">He posted an .ELF version on my board, it's only one OBJDUMP away from being a .GBA file.  But because of idiots who add every single rom file they find to some GoodSet or something then torrent it, I'm not posting a .GBA version.

Spoiler: It's just an engine test, one level with no goal, and it's slow.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd say you'd be better off looking at the DS rather than the GBA.  There's already the homebrew game "StillAliveDS" for your 2D-like experience, and recently a user has started making a 3D version that's coming across quite well.  Search Youtube for "Portal DS" to get an idea of what that one's like.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
