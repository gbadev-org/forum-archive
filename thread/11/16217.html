    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">I am seeking a very talented pixel artist to work on my next mobile space shooter game... The artist should be a very talented guy with good 2D animation skills.
<br/>
<br/>
The game will use a very improoved version of the same engine used on my first mobile game "Comic Blast" : <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samurai-games.net/comicblast.htm" target="_blank">http://www.samurai-games.net/comicblast.htm</a> which will help to make an amazing game in short developement time.
<br/>
<br/>
Animated cartoonish style is what I'm looking for, something like this:

<br/>
<br/>
Generaly, the pixel artist will be responsible for creating about 10-20 animated sprites, 5 animated bosses and designing level maps -such cities and landscapes- (we won't use tiled maps system, since it's big performances consuming, we will rather use another system that I will describe later) Some other gfx are needed such explosions, powerups, items, splash screen, and text...
<br/>
<br/>
I am not telling it's gonna be a peace of cake, the work is very hard and it will take some time, but then we will gonna end up with a state-of-art game which we will be very proud of , and which will attract attention of big-publishers (meaning: big revenue) . a medium game quality will only get published by small distributors and the revenue won't worth the effort...
<br/>
<br/>
Also, we will need to support a wide range of handset's with diferent screen sizes, to enhance our chances for big revenue.... So all gfx should be resized and reworked 4 times, screen sizes range are : 128x128- 176x220- 240x320 and 416*340.
<br/>
<br/>
Againg, it's not going to be an easy work, but it will be a very good experience for both parties and hopfully will bring good money.
<br/>
<br/>
I will not be able to provide direct pay at the moment, what I can offer is about 20% of the revenue the game might generate, as well as gfx credits.
<br/>

That wouldn't happen to be the NeoGeo-style "everything is a sprite" system, would it?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
