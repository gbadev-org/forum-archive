    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
My employer, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.powerheadgames.com/" target="_blank">Powerhead Games</a>, is looking for DS programmers. We are a game development company located in New York City (Manhattan, to be specific) and have shipped over half a dozen titles for Nintendo handhelds in the past six years. We are looking for DS programmers who can work on a paid contract basis in our office for a term of at least several months, starting immediately.
<br/>
<br/>
All of our work is done with the official Nintendo SDK and development hardware, but we've found in the past that individuals with homebrew development experience are usually adept at translating that to working with the official development tools. So, if you're in the NYC area, have done any homebrew NDS coding, and want to turn that into a professional game development job, now's your chance!
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, please send me a private message (PM) through the forum software.
<br/>
<br/>
