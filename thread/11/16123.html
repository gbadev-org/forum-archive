What I would like is a replacement that's not as easily confused with the original Pok?mon logo, though some semblance is basically okay. Perhaps something like the Japanese version?
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, it should be in vector format and I can pay up to ?15 on Paypal for the work. Any takers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
