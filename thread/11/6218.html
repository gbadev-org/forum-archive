    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I need a good artist and a composer for a Nintendo DS game I'm planning to make. The game is supposed to enter the NeoFlash coding competition (yes, I know they're evil, but if I can win free stuff, I'm happy :D). I want to make a real game with spiffy menu's and good gameplay, not the half game half techdemos that are out today (with the exception of omalone).

Small sounds, like little sounds when you move around in the menu, shoots, explosions and all the things you can think of.

At the risk fo sounding rude...I think that might be in part because of what your asking from them. It's quite a workload with nothing to look forward to in return except to get <span style="text-decoration: underline">you</span> a prize.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I realize that...
<br/>
I just don't think an artist will have much use of a NeoFlash kit.
<br/>
<br/>
But, the first prize is a PSP, and if we win I could probably sell it and we'd share the money. The problem is, I know myself. If a dev ready 1.50 firmware PSP would suddenly appear in the mailbox, I don't know if I could sell it... So I don't want to promise anything. And we might not even win.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you can't do it by yourself and need someone to share the load with you then you should be prepared to split the reward with them.
<br/>
<br/>
None of this "might get some cash" BS. Show some respect for the people you want help from already. It might be more forthcoming if you do.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you only do graphics for cash, this isn't the right thread to be anyways.
<br/>
And what difference does it make for the artist if the program happens to
<br/>
be in a competition, opposed to it not being in a competition?
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, people want their share of the cake, and I'm ready to do some
<br/>
programming for people if they want a small game to show their graphics
<br/>
or something (I've already agreed to do a game for the musicien if he wants to).
<br/>
<br/>
SInce I can't promise anything, I won't. All I can say is that if we win, you <span style="font-weight: bold">will</span>
<br/>
get some money. I can't say how much, depends on how much money I get
<br/>
for selling the PSP.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I'm also quite curious about how "might get some cash" would indicate the lack
<br/>
of respect for other people? Would you mind explaining that?<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is it the right thread for people who are chumps that want to give you something for nothing?
<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you should have to pay outright for anyone's services. But the fact that you're looking for someone to do work for you that you plan to enter a contest and aren't prepared to agree to share the reward with if you win is downright selfish.

Gee, maybe it has something to do with this:

<br/>
So if your project wins, everything basically comes down to how generous of a mood you happen to fancy yourself to be in? I'm sure glad my salary with the company I work for wasn't negotiated under those terms.
