<br/>
<br/>
I am currently working on a futuristic 3d GBA racing game. I am doing all the 2d/3d graphics and funkeejeffou does his coding magic.
<br/>
We hope to have it done for the competition. If not shortly after and then we don't have that pesky 512kb limit :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One thing, do you realize that coding 3d on the gba is quite hard? I'm not even sure you could do a game like you plan to do with all the gba's limitations. Maybe in mode 7 but it would not look as good as your video.
<br/>
I'm coding 3d in mode 4 these days and there is no way I could render that kind of 3d game unless at 1 or 2 frames a second, maybe less. And 3d in mode 5 is very blocky and doesn't look very good...
<br/>
<br/>
Wait for the DS. ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
My 2 cents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, you should do it in mode2 or mode1 and make use of scaling layers for double buffer instead... yes I know it will not get high resolution, but that's another advantage as thier will not be big buffer to clear and render... and you will only need to update the tiles specificly rendered too... so if you only have scarse world you will not even need to clear and update all of the buffer!<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
512kb is not much for 3d game. 
<br/>
<br/>
for your 3d racing idea: you will have to write a 3d editor specific
<br/>
for your purposes, and one, that will support  imports of 3ds files.
<br/>
you can't just make a 3ds level and throw it to a developer and
<br/>
tell him to make a game out of it, cause he will first need an editor.
<br/>
<br/>
Another problem is that your rough design might not be good enough,
<br/>
since the developer will have to choose what 3d technology he will
<br/>
use.
<br/>
<br/>
for your kind of "freedom" designed model, a bsp technology and
<br/>
an octree will suffice, or splitting the world into chunks with local
<br/>
bsp trees, and to define a variable of distance, and ofcourse frustum
<br/>
culling.
<br/>
<br/>
at the buttom line, this designs won't work goos for realtime on GBA.
<br/>
I might just suggest you'll forget it, or try a different console.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, tomer!!!!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
