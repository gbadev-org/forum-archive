    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure if you're serious about this and can come up with or already have a good plan, you can find some like-minded people to help you out.  I'll warn that the GBA market is very tough to break into, but it has been done before by indie developers from this board, and even if you don't finish or find a publisher, the experience you gain should be worth the effort.
<br/>
<br/>
However, and please don't take this the wrong way -- just some constructive criticism -- with your random capitalization and poor use of grammar, your image seems unprofessional.  Perhaps English isn't your native language?  If that's the case I'd recommend to recruit someone who is, who can better represent you to companies and in cases like this.
<br/>
<br/>
But either way, what skills do you have (programming, design, art, etc.), and what skills are you looking for from prospective team members?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I Have good grammar,I was in a hurry to type it.
<br/>
Anyway,what im looking for is 2 Programmers(with really good experience),1-2 Designers,and 1-2 Composers. Im gonna be doing the art on the game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do have a really good plan for the game. I have seriously thought this game through alot.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a description of the game.
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
You play as a young man named "Brandon" from a town called,"Greenville".
<br/>
 He is around the age of 17 when he finds out the world 
<br/>
is coming to an end because of a unknown group of creatures.
<br/>
The name of the creature is "Cybug".
<br/>
When he hears the news,he decides he wants to train and try to save the world.
<br/>
But Along the way,he has to battle creatures beyond his wildest dreams,but he has to hurry,because he only has 60 days.
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
This is what the game will be about.
<br/>
<br/>
For all the people who are interested,please come up with some ideas but along with the same story line.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I thought abilyk was suggesting something more akin to a business plan?
<br/>
<br/>
You've got a company name (very important that) a story (what's a game without a story?) a name for the hero (critical - unless I suppose your game is based on a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western, in which case, not so critical).
<br/>
<br/>
Is this the first game you've been involved with?
<br/>
There's a very good post, somewhere on these boards, which has some excellent guidelines on starting out writing games (with advice to over-enthusiatic dot-com-start-up-wannabes). 
<br/>
Also, consider your games company as a whole - are you going to be a one-hit wonder? What happens if you do managed to sell to a BIG company? Where is the rest of the company revenue going to come from?
<br/>
<br/>
If you just want to write a GBA game, get some people together and have a really good time writing your own game - forget about the company/selling/making money side of things for now - you'll probably get a better response by posting "I'm wanting to write a game and need help with x,y,z" rather than "I'm going to create a company and make money and you too can have some of it once we sell our game."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was talking to a relative about the amount of resources needed to start a game company.  He warned me about formalizing too soon.  He also projected that costs would be primarily driven by art.  (Perhaps for artists wishing to start a game company, costs would primarily be driven the programming required?)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Argh!  You say you have good grammer, but then screw up comma spacing.  I'm guessing you are looking for people to PM you, but you didn't ask for such and left no website for people to get ahold of you.  Don't blame mistakes on fast typing - if I was going to work for you and read your post, I'd guess you weren't serious.  Your post is your advertisement to the world and its grammer and presentation are the only thing with which we have to judge you.  If you are serious, take time to make a serious post or use the edit feature.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
