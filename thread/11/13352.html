If you are intrested in being the leade programmer for my game then please leave a message. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have no money to offer in fact I am indept almost over $1000. Enough about my problems. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am also requesting we Gbadev work together to promote gbadev and thus give gba dev self promotion. I feel creating a streaming youtube program that allows you view Youtube in big screen would be the capital idea. If somebody here is starting such project please tell me. This will promote all of us here if we can get this up and running.

In a unrelated post Keldon mention the Acclaim MMO game thing. My game will be classified as MMRPGO or just networked and allows people to play together without the need for a server.<br/>_________________<br/>Graphics Design Major currently enrolled in  CUNY  for a start in art world.
