    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I'm currently developing a shoot'em up game on the gba with a fast voxel renderer in ARM assembly.
<br/>
(it's not for the actual compo)
<br/>
There's already the major part of the code who is done , and I got a workable demo.
<br/>
I'm looking for graphist(s) who can help me!
<br/>
Bcs I'm sure with graphists we can make something really really nice, never seen before on GBA in this kind of game.
<br/>
Now it's a futuristic shoot'em up, but of course if a graphist have his own design, it will be welcome !
<br/>
I'm totally open on it, I just want to finish (like commercial game) a shoot'em up including my voxel space.
<br/>
<br/>
You may have a look at the video of the game on this link:
<br/>

<br/>
I'm working on it , and soon I think it will be a lot better.
<br/>
<br/>
u can also look at others projects I'm working on:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What type of shooter game are you trying to do? And how original will it be? Also how much art, and what kid of art?
<br/>
You can also try <a href="http://web1.t43.greatnet.de/" target="_blank">http://web1.t43.greatnet.de/</a> for other pixel artists.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also maybe you should try a voxel forum since not many do that kind of art.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello,
<br/>
I want to make a horizontal side scrolling shoot'em up (like rtype).
<br/>
anyway sometimes the camera can go forward,or backward, not only from left to right.
<br/>
the originality can come by the use of this kinds of views in a horizontal shoot'em up, even if I choose this kind of game, it's not particulary to be original.
<br/>
I'm looking for animated spaceships,buildings, and other sprites for futuristic enemies and bosses.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have answer to all ur questions.
