    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on a DS app for the last couple of days and I need some help.  I'm not a programmer and the code I do have completed has come from tutorials and demos.  I'm not looking for someone to code the program for me, I just need someone to keep pointing me in the right direction and fixing the stuff that I do code.  Most of my problems come from putting stuff into memory.  I can do a couple of things, but just not at the same time.  I have to comment out stuff to get other stuff to work.  I do have a working .nds file, and I can run it on my NDSLite, with a SCLite, but it is a little buggy.
<br/>
<br/>
I have devkitpro r20 installed and am working mainly with libnds.  I'm using the included Programmers Notepad.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things involved in my project:
<br/>
2D, text, no sprites - (I have the graphics completed and working, just need help with fixing them)
<br/>
Bookstyle - (Not a book reader, but just rotated screens, as in Brain Age)
<br/>
Left/Right Hand switching - (Goes along with the bookstyle)
<br/>
Arm7 sounds - (PSG sent to speakers or headphones)
<br/>
Brightness Control - (This is already implemented Using Lick's Lovelite demo code)
<br/>
Displaying a clock
<br/>
File Browser - (Getting a directory listing and then loading data from files)
<br/>
DLDI, of course - (I'm not sure how to go about setting this up to use with my program)
<br/>
Exit to menu - (using Lick's rebootlib)
<br/>
Touchscreen input - (I've got some of this working with the brightness control)
<br/>
Handling the hinge - (Sleep when closed, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
I think there are code demos and examples for all of these things that I want to accomplish, I just have to bring them all together.  I'm looking for someone with some experience (no sense in the blind leading the blind).  If you think you are the person, then maybe I could send you my .nds file and some information and we can go from there.  I'd like some discretion with my code because for some reason I have a fear of someone stealing my idea and making it their own.  This is a pretty simple app and would be easy to do.  That is why I'm not giving more details at this time.  If you have any questions or think that I should give more information (screenshots, design docs, .nds file, etc.), let me know.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, Ok, I get the picture.  I guess I'm going to have to tell you more about my project before it interests you.  I've been working hard on it and instead of giving up on it and abandoning it, I'll tell you all about it and hopefully it will spark someone's interest.

My app is called BrainSync and is used for brain synchronization.  I thought the DS would be a good platform for something like this after hearing about it on makezine.com (<a class="postlink" href="http://makezine.com/10/brainwave/" target="_blank">http://makezine.com/10/brainwave/</a>).  It seems pretty simple to make the DS screen flash at a certain rate while playing some sound.  You can also read about it on Wikipedia (<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_machine" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_machine</a>)

Here is a mockup of what I'm going for:

Here is a screenshot of it running in No$gba.  I've got the brightness control and the rebootlib working (thanks Lick).  I know I probably should have started programming what the actual program is for, but this is my first program and coding examples were already available for the things that I've implemented.
