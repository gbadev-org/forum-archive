    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've noticed something happening a lot on this forum, and especially in the Help Wanted section, and it is this: people wanting not help, but for someone to do their dirty work for them.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm lazy.  I'm unmotivated.  I'd try to get away with murder if I could, but I know the rules.  I'm getting a little sick of seeing good, kind people honestly wanting to help other, only to be harassed by idiots who can't bother to think for themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I'm the only one who gets really bothered by this kind of behavior, but if there's more people then maybe one of the moderators should put a sticky post in the form of a "Read First" to try and reduce this garbage from cluttering an otherwise fine forum.
<br/>
<br/>
Please people, don't expect someone else to do your work.  That's for managers and rich people, and they pay for it.  The help here is free, and should be treated with respect.  Think twice about what you want, and if you honestly think it's a resonable request, then ask once.  Thank you, that is all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In fact if you are capable of everything in that sense I think some programmers need you. However this may not be the right place to ask for it.
<br/>
<br/>
People with designing skills usually offer their skills of design because most programmers will not follows someone elses dream if the dreamer can not program.

You game is not finished because it still needs to be programmed. But I do think that people like you need some more attention because there are too many programmers who are uncreative. By narrowing our creative base to programmers and programmers with creativity we are narrowing the creativity of games.

But the reality of it is that you will not get anyone coding your idea. You <span style="font-weight: bold">must</span> have <span style="font-weight: bold">everything</span> before a programmer will think of your idea.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I were you, I'd read C for Dummies first.
<br/>
<br/>
I have C++ for Dummies, and C for Dummies Vols. I and II.  
<br/>
<br/>
C++ for Dummies assumes you know C already.   
<br/>
<br/>
C for Dummies is a good book.  (Don't let the ..For Dummies thing fool you.) It explains things in terms the average person will understand.  It dedicates about 100 pages to explaining pointers in simple terms.  If you don't know how to use pointers after that, I don't know what to tell you.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also I don't think learning programming is for everyone.  I think people without an aptitude for programming are going to have a heck of a time learning how to create GBA game.
<br/>
<br/>
Lionheart, I'd suggest starting with some simple console programs.  Which I think is what they use in the C++ for dummies books.  Or pickup C For Dummies I and II if you are finding topics like Polymorphism and Encapsulation confusing.  If you have one of those Outlet malls near you, go check out the Book Liquidators store.  They usually have a copy of them both for $5.00 each. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, does your game have a website? Do you already have a team?  I may be interested in helping you.  My current project is going to be finished in less than a month.  How much art do you have?  Art is good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
This is true of older editions. However, the newer editions of <span style="font-style: italic">C++ For Dummies</span> and a few other introductory books on C++ seem to suggest against learning C first, as some readers have reported problems unlearning bad habits that C tends to encourage.

I want to help people create games for the Game Boy Advance system. Would my energy be well spent developing something similar to Clickteam's The Games Factory, except targeting the GBA?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
