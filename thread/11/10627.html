<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for an outsourced team that would be interested in a few work-for-hire projects on the Nintendo DS (and perhaps the Game Boy Advance). Would you, or anyone you know, be interested?
<br/>
If so, please contact me asap. You can work from anywhere in the world. We are based in California.
<br/>
<br/>
Please contact:
<br/>
