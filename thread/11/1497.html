    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently in the process of organizing a commercial Game Boy Advance company, whose name is as of yet undetermined, but it's likely it will be known as either
<br/>
H.M. Delta Games, or New Earth Studios.  It will be created in the
<br/>
hopes of having our games professionally published, beginning immediately.
<br/>
While I myself am experienced in video game design and 
<br/>
graphical
<br/>
artistry, I will need one or two programmers, and possibly one music and sound 
<br/>
composer.  I won't be able to pay for any work done immediately, so I won't ask
<br/>
to begin any professional work until a publishing deal is worked out unless otherwise volunteered for rehearsal purposes; however, I
<br/>
would require software, be it public freeware (Most preferrably) or 
<br/>
specifically-designed software, to display to potential publishers as a demonstration of the company's abilities.  Anyone who's interested can contact me at 
<br/>
hapoppo-at-hapoppo.com; be sure to enclose any samples of your work to your E-mail,
<br/>
or simply direct me to a site housing your work.
<br/>
<br/>
If you would be so kind as to post that, that would be terriffic.  If there's 
<br/>
any
<br/>
reason you can't, then in any case, thank you for taking the time to read this.

<br/>
<br/>
I would love to help you, but I am unsure whenever I could join in, right now (because of my age :P, I'm only 15).
<br/>
Right now I have covered most of the GBA when it comes to 2D graphics, like platform games and RPG's. However, there is still much to learn about sound, linking and strategic AI. I plan to cover linking and good AI in my next competition entry, Klan Wars 2.
<br/>
<br/>
If you get something up running, I would like to give you some help ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, thanks for your interest...  your engine, while simple, was well-polished and showed me you know what you're doing, and that you're capable of getting far.  Unfortunately, concerning age, that probably would be a problem - I'm not quite sure about the labor laws of where you're from, but in Ohio, in which the company will be registered, the minimum age for a citizen to be legally employed is 16, and you'll need a work permit (I think you'd need one native to Ohio, but I'm not entirely 100% on labor laws.)  If, say, you'll be turning 16 soon, and I can get a more clarified definition of the laws concerning work permits, one way we could do it is showcase some of your work to a publisher, and see if we can't have a specific project start date shortly after your birthday; but as for the time being I believe the only ways around the labor law would inconveniece one or both of us.  But, in any case, with the progress you've made at only 15 years of age you definitely show potential, so if you won't be able to join the company any time soon but think you would still be interested in joining I can also put aside your name as a possible candidate for future job openings.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I live in Denmark, and I do not have any plans about living in another country before I turn 18 or 19. However, who said that physical contact is needed?
<br/>
Of course, it would be twice as great to meet each other every day when we were going to work with the project, but as a coder, it's not really necesary. If you were going to start a company soon, I could simply do the code for free, and then maybe recieve some of the moneys when I reached the legal job-age!
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm working on a game for the GBADev.org competition this september, and currently, it seems that it will be a okay game, that possibly could be placed within the 10 best (yeah, I'm optimistic too!). When the game is done, you will see what I am able to do, so we can find out whenever I am good enough for your company.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lord Graga,
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your reply.  You've definitely illustrated a devotion that I think is convincing enough for me to set aside the time to find a way around the matter of age.  I know "unofficial" work that technically is not considered company property is acceptible, and I'm sure there are plenty of other temporary titles that can be legally given to business associates under the age of 16.  I definitely will want to double-check some methods to make sure everything is run legally, but my understanding is there should be a way around the issue of age.
<br/>
<br/>
Concerning the issue of location, I guess there was a miscommunication between us when I mentioned that you would be employed by the state of Ohio.  If need be, and if we find we can work efficiently online, then I wouldn't expect a relocation unless there's an urgent need to do so.  Actually, what I was referring to was that even though you'd still be considered a citizen of Denmark, according to law your employment status would be an employee of a company based in the state of Ohio, USA, and would be subject to that particular state's labor laws.  I may be wrong, I'll likely have to do some research on the subject of employment, but this is my basic understanding of the way it works.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, good luck with the September competition... as you've stated, it will be an important determining factor on whether or not you'd be considered for the company, but with the determination and devotion you've displayed so far I'm sure you'll do well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thank you, I'll do my best :D

If I don't answer the posts the next few days (or weeks) it might be because of that I am in Brighton, England, to speak some english :)
<br/>
I plan to plug into a cybercaf? every second day, so I might be able to answer it anyways, but if I don't, it's because I haven't got acces to a computer with a internet connection :P
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cya later, good luck :)

I'm a 16 year old musician with 2 years of music composing experience. I have numerous samples of my music, and I as I prep for college, I'd love to build this amount of music to a very high number. I am a very serious composer, and can surely compose music for the style you seek. Since the GBA's sound abilities are limited, I'm pretty sure you are looking for orchestral music, and that type of music is my forte.

Let me know, and I've sent an email to you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
