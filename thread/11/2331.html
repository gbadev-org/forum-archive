    <h4>#12402 - Matto154 - Tue Nov 11, 2003 4:00 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently seeking a pixel artist to help along the development of our RPG project, "Land of Relics", for the Gameboy Advance. The work required is pretty general, sprites, backgrounds, etc. Pretty much whatever you feel like working on. The project was started a little over a year ago, by me and my friend. In that time, we have come quite a long way. Our group currently consists of:
<br/>
<br/>
1 programmer
<br/>
1 writer
<br/>
1 artist
<br/>
1 music composer
<br/>
1 sound engineer
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently acting as lead artist, and have tried desperately to handle all the artwork involved. I have set the general sprite style and tileset style. However, there is just so much work that needs to be done, including game design, which I have taken upon myself to work on. I am currently working on promotional art as well, so that we can get the website launched for the game. In the meantime, our programmer is waiting patiently for more pixel art to be sent his way so he can work on the engine a bit more.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the story goes, the writer is very knowing in the ways of writing and drama. The script is still a little sketchy at this point, but it is coming along nicely. It mainly revolves around themes of frailty among human kind. It is roughly 40 pages right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Our musician is heavily inspired by Final Fantasy, and has composed a LOT of music over the years. You can find his work at <a href="http://www.gamemusic.ca." target="_blank">http://www.gamemusic.ca.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Our programmer is a recent graduate of NYU, with a bachelors degree in programming. He completed a Gameboy Advance demo for his college thesis. He currently works on the Harvard University school of law website for work, and takes on several other projects on the side. Well, you know him, Codered, he posts here every so often.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, you may be wondering what kind of benefits you will recieve. Honestly, I'm going to say this right now; there is no salary on this project. Yes, you will recieve royalties if we have this published, but it is a long way from being done. If we all work hard, it is certainly possible. But in the meantime, we are desperately saving money to pay for our websites, and to eventually register the company. Not to mention all the costs of licensing and all that. But yes, if you perform well, and you truly contribute to the project, you will be paid in the end; no doubt about that. And let it be known right now, I am not looking for someone to work FOR me, I'm looking for someone to work WITH me.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone feels they are experienced enough to undertake this position, please contact me at <a href="mailto:matt@divinus.net">matt@divinus.net</a> for more details. Attaching sample work on your email is a plus.
<br/>
<br/>
Our "company" website is located at <a href="http://www.divinus.net." target="_blank">http://www.divinus.net.</a> The official "Land of Relics" website is <a href="http://www.landofrelics.com." target="_blank">http://www.landofrelics.com.</a> No, we're not a registered business or anything yet, we're actually saving up money to do that, god knows Nintendo would never grant a license to someone who doesn't even have a registered business. But yes, I do know all the risks involved and all that, I've spent over a year researching the game development business and all that.

A small mockup to show the general artistic style of the game, which you've all probably seen by now.
<br/>
<br/>
And if it gives any incentive, this is what I am working on right now. It is not pixel art, I know, but I figured it serves the purpose of showing a little more of this project. I'm working on some promotional art and character designs to help along the game development. If there is anyone interested in working on the actual game while I do this, please email me. As long as you can match the style in the previous mockup, all is good. I can definetly use the help. Anyways,here is a WIP of what I'm working on right now. It is one of the characters in the game, Devarus, basically torn between good and evil. As you can see, he is a pretty cold character, with 6 wings. Again, not even close to done, but I figured I'd display it as a demonstration of what I'm actually doing right now. Just take note that this is resized from 18x24 inches at 72 dots per inch. It is also reduced to 256 colors so quality may be a little lower than the actual image. I wouldn't want to post a 40MB image here.

Anyways, thank you for your time, it is really appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would be greatly interested in getting in on that. I have experience in web layout designing, which is very similar to designing gameboy graphics. I also have been doing a little bit of work on my own rpg demo.. but the programming has given me some troubles, unlike the graphics. 
<br/>
<br/>
Sadly I do not have much reference of my work, especially in GBA designing. I have experience in Adobe Photoshop 5.5 to 7, JASC Paintshop Pro 7 to 8, and Microsoft Paint... as well as many other irrelivent programs. I put a page up with what I did manage to do of graphics before stopping to work on the programming first: <a href="http://eniforums.com/resume/" target="_blank">http://eniforums.com/resume/</a> (not much, but something).
<br/>
<br/>
Well, hope you find who you need to get the job done.
