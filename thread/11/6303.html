    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all.
<br/>
I'm currently leading the DoomDS project over at <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com/doomds/" target="_blank">http://dual-soft.com/doomds/</a> and we are after some programming assistance. Will from dual-soft will be starting work on a tech demo soon, so any help would be greatly appreciated in speeding up the development.
<br/>
<br/>
We are getting through the art quite quickly and are needing to do some testing on the DS to help finalise polygon counts and texture details.
<br/>
<br/>
With the help of this community I hope we can not only create a great FPS game, but also a great engine for future community projects.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am sure you have been informed of this allready but there is about a 2048 poly per frame limit (regardless of frames per second).  I would work on the background engine first and get that down to a resonable poly count (is doom zero overdraw?)..you should then know how many polies you have left over for your models.  
<br/>
<br/>
The project looks very well thought out and if i had the time it would be a lot of fun.  Good luck with it and if you need your models loaded on ds i can probably do that much (what format are they in as doom used sprites for models ?).<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We have been informed about the poly limitions but at the moment are thinking of ways around it such as adding some nice fog effects to the larger, more open levels, of course culling will be implimented and if need be, some different LODs will be implmented. We are keeping the model below 400 tris for normal units and 500 for the larger/boss units.

But i would like to see it done in a way that gives the impression of a rotting corpse. Having the models skin slowly darken while the effect takes place should do nicely, without being visualy demanding.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course having the bodies dissapear gives little use to the Arch Vile. For situations in a level where there is an Arch Vile, perhaps a 'slow rot' tag could be applied to all enemies in that room to allow more time for the Arch Vile to do hes work.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure players would try and lure an Arch Vile into another area to try and ressurect lots of monsters, hopefully the rotting feature will stop any potential 'overdraw of monsters' problems.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the polygon limits, i'm pretty confident that even with such a limit, we can deliver a great game. I'm doing alot of level design with the limitations taken into consideration. With some clever texture use its surprising what can be made to look good.
<br/>
<br/>
The polygon levels COULD go alot lower, a LOD system could be implimented, possibly even sprite replacement for distant models could be used, this can be unnoticeable if done right. There are alot of ways around this limit.

The next update on the DoomDS page will have alot more Media.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Providing we use as many optimizing techniques as possible, such as back face culling and design levels sensibly, there is a good chance we will see quite a few enemies on screen at once.
<br/>
<br/>
Level design wont get too intricate. Some areas may creep into quake levels of detail, but generally it will keep pretty faithful to the original games.
<br/>
<br/>
With the right use of graphical effects such as colored lighting, shaders, particles, volumetric fog, flares etc, DoomDS levels will look nice without needing alot of detail.
<br/>
<br/>
Model format is is not decided on. Formats such as md2 may not be ideal for use on the DS, I guess we will have to see what works best and go with it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lets play "do the math!"
<br/>
Assuming: 400 polys per baddie.
<br/>
<br/>
5 baddies is 2,000. Name a Doom scene that has more than 5 baddies. I'm sure that took long :P
<br/>
<br/>
Now, figure about 20 to 80 polys for a normal scene, up to 100 in some more complex areas. We can be generous and say 10 polys per ammo box, and assume weapon pickups will run around 40 polys...
<br/>
<br/>
So in a regular scene, you will probably only get 4 baddies on the screen before you hit the limit. Oops!
<br/>
<br/>
Now, lets calculate in LOD levels.
<br/>
<br/>
Assume LOD cuts polycounts by 1/4 (Also factors in for backface removal, if not done automagically)
<br/>
* 100 polys per baddie, on nightmare with a room of 10 baddies (1000)
<br/>
* 80 for the world
<br/>
* 40 in ammo boxes (4)
<br/>
* 30 for that shotgun pickup
<br/>
* 40 for your on-hand weapon
<br/>
* 10 for projectiles in-air
<br/>
<br/>
1200 polys on the screen so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, pick off two at a distance, and move closer to the rest for shotty death, now at 1/2 regular polys
<br/>
1000 - 200
<br/>
800 * 2 + 200
<br/>
1800 polys + 200 in corpses
<br/>
2000 polys
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, make the mistake of walking up next to a baddie and you just hit the poly ceiling.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh-- lets not forget baddies RESPAWN on nightmare. :D<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

:). Not everything may be the same as the original Doom games, we have to work with what we are given. We are trying to make a project that we want to do, and are looking for people to help, not post math we have already thought of to try and discourge us. It seems like you are trying to grill are efforts, and for what? If you don't want to help us, thats cool, but you don't have to make a post like you just did, it does nothing for our efforts of looking for new teammates.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
We've done the math too, and its not as bad as you think.
<br/>
<br/>
LOD is not just for distance. Its to do with whats on screen as well, c'mon Will, you should've know that. If you have a scene that is over the poly limit, each model would be taken to a lower level for everything to be under the limit. It would be just plain stupid for it to be based only on distance.
<br/>
<br/>
We may also use sprites for long distance stuff, it  works well. 
<br/>
<br/>
20 - 80 poly's for a normal scene and upto 100?  This isnt Wolfenstien.
<br/>
<br/>
Nightmare mode is obviously a feature that is not really pratical for the DS.  DoomDS is going to be a Doom game, but of course when working with limitations, there will be some changes.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Defect on Mon Jul 25, 2005 5:10 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Playing a Doom port with freelook highlights the weakness of sprites. If DoomDS did not have freelook, then perhaps sprites would'nt look too bad.

<br/>
<br/>
Weapons may end up being sprites, it all depends how things look. Lighting always looks better on 3D weapons, but the effect may be barely noticable on the DS screen. This is among alot of issues that testing will help us decide on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wouldn't strongly argue against adding freelook, but I don't think "the hardware can do it" is a good reason.  It mostly comes down to how true you want to be to the original.

Better then not trying at all :P. But seriously, in order to research how things are going to be implemented we need a coder of sorts. We both know teh basics of the DS's capabilites, but not the full extent I'm sure. We have both been running numbers through our head and I think with some luck and enginuity we can get around 10 or more monsters on the screen at once, which should be plunty. We have and are continuing to think of ways to get as many monsters on the screen as possible (LOD, Fog effects, sprite replacement, and more) but please don't make the mistake of thinking your the only one who has given any thought to the hardware's capabilites. We are working on <span style="font-style: italic">preliminary</span> art at the moment, which will change as needed.

<br/>
<br/>
Even though freelook was never in Doom, it never seems to feel different when playing a port that supports it. Its quite natural and I dont think it adds so much that it no longer feels like Doom. I agree completely with Tepples, that if jumping was added it would feel like Quake.
<br/>
<br/>
Jumping sections in games really shit me, I remeber becoming furious when i first played Turok on the N64, that was a terrible game.
<br/>
<br/>
Its inevitable that for Doom to be brought onto the DS with full 3D models, that the monster counts will be less then the original games.
<br/>
There will no doubt be sections of levels that are low detail enough that we can cram alot of baddies in there without a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Hit points and energy levels for the monsters will be tweaked untill the balance between numbers and strength is just right.
<br/>
<br/>
Every art asset being made has limits placed on it. There are polygon levels for monsters and limits on texture sizes. Maps are being heavily tested to be sure that r_speeds are low.

id is the type that supports and encourages ports and mods of the original Doom. There's smart enough to look at legal ports and mods as compliments rather than something offensive.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont know if this is pertentent to this channel but i did a port of a doom style 3D engine.  It has a bit better graphics than doom engine imo but its poly count seems a little high.  It is set up for MD2 model loading (although it is not currently functioning) or sprites, or a mix.  It also looks and performs rather well.

Sorry no emulators run it as far as i know else i would  have posted a screen shot or two.  The engine does have an editor (which is in the yeti.zip although you may need to build it).  If anyone wants to make a level I can stick it in and see how it performs.  I am not sure if my poly counter is off but the engine may be a bit too poly heavy for the DSs low vertex threshold when combined with 3D enimies.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did wintermute, but these files are still DS files are they not? This is a port to the DS so it wont run on a GBA emu.
<br/>
<br/>
I've looked around and cant find any of the original GBA Yeti3D roms. All sites link to the official page which is no longer online.  Bugger.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to have a crack at making a level for it dovoto.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Google should find you lots of copies of the gba version...just keep in mind only the earlier version was open source so finding the original might be a challenge....but as luck would have it, were you to open up the source distrabution i provided above you would find within the gba version that bares compiling.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what tools you will need to build the gba version though..I would recomend you build the PC version and perhaps alter it to allow easy swapping in and out of maps.  You might also be able to find a better version of the editor online.  It is a shame that yeti is gone (i imagine they sold their technology) but we still have this little bit to play with.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have no way of compiling the GBA version. The only compiling i do is of the level design variety.
<br/>
<br/>
With these recent developments of a Heretic port and the Yeti3D port, things are looking good for DS FPS.
<br/>
<br/>
Posted movie clip on DoomDS page of test level, let me know what you think.
