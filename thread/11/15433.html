    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so i've just gotten my supercard, and I'm playing around with kaosds and the like, just apps that will send midi cc's to my computer.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking to make something similar.
<br/>
<br/>
Except, rather than make the whole area active on both axes, I want to have say, 12 vertical faders which showed a display of where they've been left.
<br/>
<br/>
An extra, would be to send out some midi notes using the buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone think they can help me?
<br/>
I'm relatively new to this type of thing, i only have experience in programming with puredata(max/msp essentially) and processing.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>_________________<br/>just a new guy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
