    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for help on my compo entry, Swish-It.  The suggestion from the judges was that it might be better with some music.  I was aware of this and tried to create a little song, but I didn't get anything worthwile completed by the deadline.  I am a little 'musically challenged'.  
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add a song and increase my chance of getting onto the cartridge, and I was wondering if someone would like to create a little tune for the game.  A simple looping song would be great 10-15 seconds long.  It needs to be a .s3m Mod (I'm using Krawall).  Preferably as small as possible (I don't want to increase the ROM size much). Probably something like 5-10 little samples would be great.  
<br/>
<br/>
For your efforts you will be given credit in the game.  And based on the initial results of the compo, the game stands a good chance to make it onto the cartridge.  So you could have some of your music published.
<br/>
(There is no monetary compensation.)
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to get fancy, you can also make a little tune for the title screen.  It should probably be similar to the in-game song.  Maybe a little different beat using the same samples.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a little about the game:
<br/>
It's pretty simple.  Take a look at the screen shot on the compo page.  Your little man shoots a basketball at a moving hoop.  The song would be playing in the background.  Maybe just a little background beat.  I was kinda thinking a simple rap beat.  But heck, even a NES "doot-doot-doot" song might go nicely.  Whatever your strength is, I guess.  (Like I said, only needs to loop every 10-15 seconds)
<br/>
<br/>
I am going to be leaving the state tomorrow (by car) to go to Florida for a bowl game (Go Hawkeyes). If you whip up a little song, email it to me at: expos1994(at)yahoo.com.  When I return (~Jan 3rd), I will add your song into the game, and get it resubmitted to the compo.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for any help you can provide.
<br/>

I highly recommend that you check out the following URL:

<br/>
Skaven's music is pretty awesome, and he allows people to use his songs for free in homebrew projects. Chances are there's something in there that would work for your game.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, the big problem with these would be size. I don't know how big your ROM is, but even if it pushes you a little over the 4MBit mark, the rules say that winners *might* be allowed more space. It would be better than nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! Your game looks very cool.
<br/>
