why do you want an answer only from a person under 18???
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a FIFO is a very simple data structure (first in first out). a normal printer queue does the same. there are many ready to go solutions for it. or you write a simple ringbuffer (one read pointer, one write pointer).
<br/>
<br/>
better for CPU communication is a real queue with priority rules. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see your problem. Do you have problems to implement FIFO? Or do you have problems to understand why FIFO (or similar) is nessecary? Or do you want to understand how to communicate between CPU's?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
