    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Exile Games (http://www.eg-games.com), is working on a demo for a side scrolling platformer game for the GBA.  Most positions are filled, but we are still looking for several staff members:
<br/>
<br/>
1 - Dedicated tools programmer
<br/>
2 - Map designer
<br/>
3 - 2d Sprite artist
<br/>
<br/>
We would like to find someone from the NY area, as that is where we are based, but depending on the situation we may settle on work via internet.  We have weekly staff meetings in NYC, so that is obviously preferred.  If you are interested in one of these positions, please post here or write to <a href="mailto:jobs@eg-games.com">jobs@eg-games.com</a> to get an information packet regarding the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your interest

<br/>
<br/>
If this is a paying gig, you can get the admins to post it to the News forum, and on the main website.  If it isn't for pay, would you be open to some type of code for art exchange?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In short, no this is not a paying gig.  Obviously upon publishment you would receive royalties, something which possibly 5% of you care about and/or believe (I'm sure with good reason).  The possibility of art for code is not something I could answer at this time, but would have to first ask you what type of art (sprite or concept) and then would have to ask the corresponding staff member..
<br/>
<br/>
What I am asking here is two fold.  First, if you live in the NYC area, I would request that you merely come to a staff meeting and judge from there.  If you are not from the NYC area, I would like you to respond to this post or write an e-mail to <a href="mailto:jobs@eg-games.com">jobs@eg-games.com</a>, at which point you will receive more information regarding the game.  The fact of the matter is this: I would say a majority of the members here are hobbyists, but would not mind working with an entire team striving to develop a game.  If you would like to be a part of a team that has resources and a well developed talent pool, please contact me and you will not be disappointed.
<br/>
<br/>
I really do appreciate your interest, hope to hear back from you soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Greetings everyone once again.  I am bumping this topic because some of you have replied via e-mail and have been responded to.
<br/>
<br/>
Exile Games is still looking for a few talented individuals to work on their independent GBA project entitled "Riastrad" - a 2D side scrolling platformer, with it's fair share of twists.  Our pre-production process is almost complete, and this means that the real tangible work is all that's left ahead.  Our core team is established, but there are a few positions that we would like filled if possible.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Assistant Tools Programmer</span>
<br/>
You will be working with our head tools programmer, Thomas Costigliola, on the development of in-house game tools in Java.  For example, he is currently working on the map editor.  Times are very flexible, as most of the job allocation will be taken care of via an online tasking system that we developed.  You log into your account, check for any tasks assigned to you by Tom, and once you complete the task, you click the "upload and complete task" button, upload the files (if needed) and an e-mail is sent to Tom informing him of the task completion.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2D Sprite Artist</span>
<br/>
You will be working with Les Denis, Chiashia Ly and Camilo Arturo on developing sprites/backgrounds/animations/tiles or menus depending on your strenghts.  Tiles are 8x8 16 colors.  Sprite sizes vary.  You will be using the same task allocation/completion system as described in the tools programmer section.  The art in Riastrad is based around a celtic theme.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Level Designer</span>
<br/>
You will originally work with Tom on the actual development, layout and functions of the in-house map editor.  Guiding him along and giving him suggestions as to what you would like it to do.  After the map editor is completed, you will work with the artists and programmers to develop the levels of the game.  A very rewarding job I must say.  Prior level design experience is suggested, but is not required, provided that you can somehow show us your skill level.
<br/>
<br/>
Development begins later this week, so please contact <a href="mailto:jobs@eg-games.com">jobs@eg-games.com</a> or post at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.eg-games.com/forums/?" target="_blank">http://www.eg-games.com/forums/?</a> in response to the job listings as soon as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
For further information, I may be contacted via any of the IM services listed below.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you once again!
