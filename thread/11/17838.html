    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Guys,
<br/>
<br/>
i dont know if this is the right place to ask but is there somebody out there who is still doing GameBoy Mono (DMG) homebrew?
<br/>
I have a plan for a small Game or better Demo but ist must be on DMG.
<br/>
The Goal is a Gameboy Game like Contra Spirits based upon a famous IP.
<br/>
<br/>
Since this is just a general question if there is somebody still doing DMG i wont go into more details for now but i can provide more infos if needed :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>

<br/>
The goal is to show something like "this is how it would have looked like back then in the 1990 years"
<br/>
Besides that you can not sell gameboy games anyway so there is no real room for profit.<br/>_________________<br/>FLAME ON!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
