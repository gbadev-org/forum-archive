    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering about this and, well I need a Nintendo wifi connection driver writen. I'm using Aircruiser G-desktop Adapter. It's a GN-WPO1GS Gigabyte wifi card. It supports SoftAP. And it supports both 802.11 b/g. The only problem is that when in use for finding an access point is that I get to the end of it, and it can't find the IP address. Even though I allready have a router. Anyways, my desktop can be used for a laptop also. So if I find a wireless connection by a store or something, but it doesnt support Nintendo Wifi connection, I could use the writen driver for Nintendo Wifi connection through my Desktop Adapter/Laptop Adapter. If anyone is good at writing wifi drivers. Please help me. This is also like using wifime. After the driver is complete I'm going to modifying it so that I can use the ds download play with my card. This project is like combining both Nintendo Wifi Connection and wifime.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
