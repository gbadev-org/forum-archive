If you think you could develop this, please PM me with a rough price quote. Thanks!

You are probably looking at dropping things like most transpareny, rotation, scaling, etc.  The DS is not fast enough to make up for lack of an FPU.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you could drop an FPU in a GBA cart and require the add on.  I doubt the homebrew scene will tackle that one though.

Can it deal with the native SWF format, or are you looking at some sort of preprocessor?
<br/>
<br/>
IIRC there is some sort of flash for embedded systems.  I'm sure it assumes things about your system.  "Your system has a display", at the very least.  I don't know much about it.  It might be configurable.

And you can't use the 3D engine because you'll run out of polygons in the first few layers.

<br/>
Antialiasing and per pixel alpha could probably be scrapped.  Doing without masking would probably really hurt, although I suppose you could do without.  That puts a fair amount of restrictions on the developer.  I'm assuming that if bezier shapes could be simplified, they'd have been simplied already.

<br/>
An integer version of ActionScript seems possible to me, unless the goal is to run standard, unmodified SWFs.  Then again, non-standard SWFs would sort of defeat the purpose of using flash in the first place.  Only sort of.  The dev environment is nice and that is important.

I did once a demo of a flash player without antialias. People said it looked too ugly, and since with antialias you'll get 5 fps, why bother?
<br/>
Doing without masking *does* hurt. You'll see random surfaces covering stuff you're supposed to be seeing, sometimes the whole screen in black or covering important characters. Doesn't work.
<br/>
Bezier curves can be straightened in lots of small straight lines, that's not much of an issue, the thing is that for each bezier you'll get about 10 straights (depending on size and transformation), and that steals CPU power. It's worse with edge lines, which by spec must always have round edges - meaning that you have to render each line as an individual shape. And no, you can't skip that, for some SWF's (like that popular stick-man matrix-fighting series) it's a must.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
