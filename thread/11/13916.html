    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I have <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy" target="_blank">Cerebral Palsy</a>, therefore (among other things,) I am unable to talk. My communication device has been broken, for years. I rarely go out, so I have seen no point in getting it fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
So, with that in mind, I am looking for any and all text-to-speech/voice synth applications. I have DSSpeech, but would like something better, because DSSpeech is old. DSSpeech is all I could find, but I need something new.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to suggest the name "DSSTFU" if I can. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!
<br/>

1) The voice synth could probably be a bit better. Right now, it's really robot-like.
<br/>
2) It is slow. It takes a few seconds for it to process and say lengthy things such as whole sentences.
<br/>
3) The keyboard is REALLY glitchy.
<br/>
4) It's been stuck at v1.5 for god knows how long</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

3: ok fair enough, but why start a new project when you can fix an old one

The <a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrobits.net/atari/sam.shtml" target="_blank">SAM (Software Automatic Mouth) software for old 8-bit computers</a> sounded artificial yet intelligible. It was probably the first commercial speech synth to have variable voice pitch. Unfortunately, it is proprietary software.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I've looked everywhere for the source files for DSSpeech and cannot find them, the original coder seems to have abandoned the project and jumped off the dev ship. Do you where the source files for it is?

Ok yeah the length of time when a homebrew is released isnt really important, just the quality, but if youd read his previous points, 1-3, he clearly has issues with it, so in that aspect its not really "already good", or maybe it is, but not as good as it could be. For instance you cannot even see what ur typing out with it on alot flashcarts with DSSpeech. The time for processing speech might possible be improved upon, I dont know and neither am I coder, but perhaps the original creator of DSSPeech didnt have time to optimize the code or whatever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The biggest optimisations are strategic, but really it's not going to happen. The help wanted forum is not for "can you make this and that", it's for "I am programming this, can you give me a hand with that".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not the forum administrator, but I'm inclined to disagree.
<br/>
<br/>
Just because next to none of the "can someone code this?" requests get done, or considered, and most of them are annoying, I'll agree, doesn't mean people shouldn't request.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I remember someone asking if it was possible to port Descent, and it actually got done, and not by the person who requested it.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

I think it 's a good idea to demand a binary for ARM processors ?
<br/>
maybe source ^^

because a lot of programs of text to speech use it ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://arialia.dev-fr.org/" target="_blank">My Dev  blog </a>   - -  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.playeradvance.org/forum/showthread.php?t=4813" target="_blank">Tutorial  on libfat in french</a> -- <a class="postlink" href="http://www.playeradvance.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5519" target="_blank">DSPhoto</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on porting alsa to DSLinux at the moment and it should be entirely feasible to port an existing TTS engine over.  From a quick glance at the Festival website it looks like you don't have to use the MBROLA engine either, there's a variety you can use:

Festival use the voice database MBrola not the engine ^^

Great !

i'm interested to this because i developp a game for childreen who don't know read ( 3-5 years old ) so text to speech seems a good way for make international game ;)
