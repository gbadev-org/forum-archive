    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SeaBorne Muse (currently a party of 1 coder/musician/artist, in that order) is looking for interested musicians, artists, and coders (in that order) to collaborate on a flagship GBA title.

<br/>
Currently, I am e-mailing individuals/groups to inquire on the situation, however, feel free to send an e-mail to me if you're interested.  If so, please be prepared to furnish an exaple or two of your work (a song, picture, or demo GBA app of some sort).
