    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I hope to accomplish: Make a remake of the original Legend of Zelda
<br/>
<br/>
Presentation: I want it to be top-down perspective with 2D graphics. Basically the graphics would just look a lot nicer with new sprites and such.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not a coder. Plain and simple. I do not have the patience, and I wouldn't be able to put up with it. What I would be doing is organizing all the files, leading the writing of in game text, and making sure progress is being made. As of this moment, I only have a conceptual artist. He will be making me a few posters for this project soon and I'll post them up here for you to gawk at. In case you were wondering, I am completely and utterly serious. After my team has grown, we can have meetings to discuss the involvement of the touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you take this project upon yourselves, and I hope that my dream can become a reality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll sum up what everyone else is going to say:
<br/>
<ul>A) We are all busy, why work with you and not on my own project?
<br/>
B) You say you are serious, but so does everyone else?  Can you prove you are serious?
<br/>
C) Is money involved?  Even small amounts of money ($100 here and there) prove that you are serious.</ul>Basically, you'll need a solid design doc, a really convincing pitch or monetary compensation to recruit help.  I'll let you figure out which (combination) you want to work with.

Back to work, back to work.  I've already spent far too much time on this forum today. =)

THE FLIPCODE "TEAM WANTED" FORM, VERSION 1.0
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HELLO my name is __________________. I am looking for new members to fill out my team.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm designing a revolutionary new
<br/>
[ ] MMORPG
<br/>
[ ] FPS
<br/>
[ ] RPG
<br/>
that will change the world forever!
<br/>
[ ] It's first-person!
<br/>
[ ] It will have technology *and* magic!
<br/>
[ ] It will have an amazing story, as soon as I come up with one!
<br/>
[ ] When you kill other players, their body will explode in novel new ways, which I call a "Frag"!
<br/>
[ ] It will have revolutionary graphics and sound, a claim I make with no basis in fact or reality!
<br/>
[ ] I know what all the other game developers are doing wrong! Oh, how I pity/loathe them.
<br/>
[ ] It will feature fun *non-violent* gameplay! That's what really sells!
<br/>
<br/>
My game
<br/>
[ ] is already 60% completed! We have the art done!
<br/>
[ ] is already 90% completed! We have the art and music done!
<br/>
[ ] needs to be ready for E3 next year.
<br/>
Of course, before we ship we'll need to make a "tech demo". But we've already got some "concept art" on the website.
<br/>
<br/>
Members needed:
<br/>
[ ] I will of course need a large crew of PROFESSIONAL TOP-CALIBER programmers.
<br/>
[ ] I guess I need a programmer, even though they personally sicken me, and "mere implementation" is the easiest thing in the world.
<br/>
[ ] I don't need any programmers, I have a book that will teach me C++ in 21 days.
<br/>
<br/>
[ ] I will of course need a phalanx of PROFESSIONAL TOP-CALIBER artists.
<br/>
[ ] I guess I need an artist, even if I won't like anything they produce.
<br/>
[ ] I don't need any artists, my friends and I broke out the crayons last week and we're half done already.
<br/>
<br/>
[ ] I guess maybe I'll need modellers, musicians, sound designers, scripters, level designers, and other stuff too, I dunno.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'm the game designer and producer,
<br/>
[ ] and since ideas are the *hardest part* of games, I'm the most important member. You are lucky to have me and my genius.
<br/>
[ ] even though I've never shipped a game before.
<br/>
[ ] even though I'm only twelve years old.
<br/>
[ ] because *I* have a *college degree*!
<br/>
[ ] but the team will be totally democratic, an idea that obviously has never been tried before.
<br/>
[ ] and as such you shall all robotically carry out my capricious whims.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in joining my team,
<br/>
[ ] first you need to sign an NDA so you don't reveal my brilliant idea to all.
<br/>
[ ] first you need to sign a non-compete.
<br/>
[ ] hurry up! Positions are going fast, and I'm not going to spend forever on this!
<br/>
[ ] you must be willing to locate to __________________, which by some strange coincidence is where I live.
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone on the team will surely make millions of dollars from working on this game.
<br/>
Of course, I can't afford to pay anyone until we get a publisher,
<br/>
[ ] but that shouldn't stop me from getting top-quality talent, now should it!
<br/>
[ ] so if you're some sort of panty-waisted coward with unrealistic ideas about "salary" and "job security",
<br/>
forget it, I don't need your type! I only want daring people willing to take a little risk!
<br/>
[ ] but then my venture is so brilliant that we won't have any trouble getting a publisher right away.
<br/>
<br/>
Please email me at _______________________ with your resume and why you think you're good enough to join my team. Or if you're a publisher looking to publish a BRILLIANT new game and want to send us money.
<br/>
<br/>
p.s. If you dare to mock me, my ideas, or this posting in any way,
<br/>
[ ] what is wrong with you? Why are you so negative?
<br/>
[ ] I will make personal attacks on your character.
<br/>
[ ] I will swear violently at you, which actually will be pretty entertaining.
<br/>
[ ] I will start misspelling more and more words, and/or leaving out vital punctuation.
<br/>
[ ] I will start randomly CAPITALIZING some WORDS in my REPLIES.

You are hoping to win the lottery twice in a row, there. Your best shot at seeing <span style="font-style: italic">your</span> dream become a reality solely on the backs of others is to become independently wealthy and finance it with industry-competetive salaries.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the real question is whether it's a clone/remake, or whether it's a game obviously inspired by.
<br/>
<br/>
To say you're making a "clone of the original legend of zelda" would imply that enemies/items/level design is all the same, even if the art differs.  And that would be enough to get you into trouble, IMHO.
<br/>
<br/>
Now if it was "inspired by the original legend of zelda", like Dark Cloud, you'd probably have a lot more wiggle room.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
