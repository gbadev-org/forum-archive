    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have any free time and like to criticize people, then I need your help. I have finally finished my GBA library and would like to have it "checked over". I have 2 requests.
<br/>
<br/>
Programming experts: Or some thing like it, I need people who know the GBA inside and out and the fastest way to execute code on it. I am sure my code is sloppy but hey, i'm not perfect. You will try to find code that doesn't "look right" or is un-optimized.
<br/>
<br/>
Beta testers: I also need outside people to test my library and see if I have missed anything or if anything is wrong. There are plenty of mistakes lurking around, but I don't have time to find them all. I don't have a lot of examples ready so if you want to help in this area, you'll have to be patient for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to help, just e-mail me at <a href="mailto:dagamer34@yahoo.com">dagamer34@yahoo.com</a><br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm happy to help out with some debugging and optimizing.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to pass the buck back to you, but you know your library better than anyone so it's really up to you to tell me what parts need the work done. :) Besides which, while I don't mind lending a hand, I've already got plenty of other commitments and I've had to back pretty much 90% out of one project already on account of other stuff in my life that has come up, so the more direction you can give me the better. As it is I will only probably be able to help out on small segments of your library.
<br/>
<br/>
My strengths lie predominantly in tile modes, audio, interrupts and raster effects, algorithm optimization and math optimization, modular code design, and assembly.
<br/>
<br/>
You can send me an e-mail if you have stuff to send or if you'd like to take it outside of the thread.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know my sprite code will need some tweaking for certain. I will send you the examples tomorrow, latest wednesday.

<br/>
For one thing, I am still using that &amp;*^% switch statement in my DMA code which I KNOW is slow but the preprocessor doesn't like me for some reason...
<br/>
<br/>
Something like this off the top of my head:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

<br/>
    REG_DMA##ch##SRC
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I forget the rest, but it keeps complaining about how it doesn't expect the ## symbols. I know that is what is throwing it off. Not much to go on, but you get what I am trying to do, right?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, since the channel can be any variable expression (and not necessarily a fixed constant from 0-3) I don't think it's possible to code it directly into the constant expression.
<br/>
<br/>
You will have to use an arithmetic operator instead: something like (REG_DMA_BASE + (ch) * 12). This will then be optimized out to the correct address automatically if ch is a constant.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, send me stuff at your convenience and I'll take a look.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well Coding is perhaps a more appropriate forum for this.
<br/>
<br/>
As for checking code.. I suggest using PC Lint on your Code I don't know if you have a lot of money so I won't suggest DA-C by RistanCASE.  The later is a syntax and program correctness checker to be sure you are using your code right basically. The former checks for variable usage and variable vagueness. Also proper macro use and much more. 
<br/>
<br/>
Lint your code, it's not a mere suggestion.  You'll find the majority of your errors not to be in implementation but program correctness (at least for me:) ).
<br/>
<br/>
code reviews should be done by peers, that seems that you want a code review ;)

Second: Bloody hellfire, it <span style="font-style: italic">still</span> doesn't work? Then again, macros are known for their twitchiness. First, I'm pretty sure that space behind "DMA_COPY" shouldn't be there. Also, make sure there are no spaces behind the line separator ("\"). 
<br/>
Funny, I got this one working the first time I tried it.

True, "ch" must be an actual constant. That's one of the conditions of the macro. You can use a variable, of course, but the compiler will complain about it if you try. 
<br/>
Using the arithmatic operator is probably a safer solution. Had I known that the compiler takes care of arithmatic with constants at compile time when I wrote the DMA_CPY macro, I probably would have used that as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
