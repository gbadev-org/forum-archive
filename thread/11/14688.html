    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">We have an idea to create a simple interactive programme to be used for an internal communication conference next year - on the subject of 'engaging with technology'.
<br/>
<br/>
We'd be looking to put biographies, agendas, welcome address etc onto a NDS card and then give away the consoles to the delegates as a way of encouraging them to engage and learn how technology is being used by their customers.
<br/>
<br/>
I assume it's possible, just need someone, preferably in the UK to help us build it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
