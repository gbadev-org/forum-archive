    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am writing a LegoCad DS version. I am just learning C but over this past week I have learned more than I would have in half a semester. My computer is acting like it is falling apart, giving me random compile errors and random Dualis crashes. I need a C programmer who at the very least can walk me though this project. It isprogrammed in C and PAlib. Need some major help and posting though the forums is to slow to get answers back. If you are interested post back, I really need the help!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you figure out what the compile errors mean?  If you have tried and  truly have no clue what they mean, somebody here will be happy to help you.

How "big" is your project?
<br/>
<br/>
My general advice is learn C or C++ properly before you try to tackle the GBA or DS.  It's enough to one at a time, let alone both.
