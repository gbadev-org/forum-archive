    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would prefer the translator to be translating for their native(first) language for some of the new UI additions in my program: Phleon, a moonshell skin developer suite/previewer
<br/>
I have everything ready, all that needs to be done is German(tool tips and a few buttons I think), the same for dutch.
<br/>
All the other languages, except French have been done by real people, and the web translator did not do a good job
<br/>
so in total properties to be changed:
<br/>
<span style="color: green">German: 47 lines --Done thanks to silent_code</span>
<br/>
Dutch: 47 lines
<br/>
<br/>
Please remember I would like people doing it with it being their native(first) language, and that they still use the computer with it showing in their language.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you :)
<br/>
<br/>
ALSO the names of the people that do translate this will be in the credits of the program as well(like the previous translators and helpers).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you want i can perform the french translation. I hope i'll be able to translate that much line without errors... at least the traduction would be much better than any auto translated menu... if the original language is english or german...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If you feel that the original lines are rather badly written, it's because Kloplop is only 15 and has some things left to learn about his mother tongue.
<br/>
<br/>
That was not an attack.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i just told him the same, that some strings are a bit tricky formulated or in other words "too descriptive" and not really to the point (short and crisp!)
<br/>
i made my translations in the sense of what he has written and re-translated that into english, so he can see how others think about formulating the same thing. i guess now i'm being descriptive and not to the point. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
but i still don't know where to attach your post to... ;^p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
