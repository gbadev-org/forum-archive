    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I am in a hip hop group called the fresh breeze movement and I have an idea that I need some help with. Basically, I want to make the EP we just came out with into 8bit form (which I can do myself) but basically I want to get some flashcarts and some microSD cards and basically make a small, score oriented GBA game to play while you were to listen to my music. I think that it is a sweet idea and I am looking to get someone that is interested to help. You can listen to our music at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/freshbreezemovement," target="_blank">www.facebook.com/freshbreezemovement,</a> if anyone is interested you can reply to this with your email or a phone number or something so we can talk about it. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
