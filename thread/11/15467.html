It really depends on what the post actually said. If they were looking for advice on how to implement their game then I might offer some help. If it's just another random post with no real substance I'd probably ignore it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My general response is to give an analysis of what I think it would take to get the job done.  This generally involves pointing out team size and time.  It's also worth noting that if someone has a "sweet idea", they ought to have "sweet skills" to contribute or else the project isn't going anywhere.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I come from a RIDICULOUSLY elitist message board, where most of the members instantly blam posts like this. We have a rule stating that a poster needs atleast screenshots (not mockups) before being taken seriously for the express purpose of weeding out those that jump in and say things like "I GOT THIS GREAT IDEA. SOMEBODY MAKE THIS GAME FOR ME."

<br/>
However, there's always that once person that genuinely needs help, and is genuinely willing to contribute to the project. That's why I always give topics like the one this pretends to be a chance.

If I bother to read it, I usually say something.  99% of the time, there is never a response.  People with real business come back.

How true...and this is the funniest part to me.  Random guy posts his great idea.  We spend days discussing it, asking for design docs, giving advice (half of which is "forget it"), and the guy never shows up again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eh. It's easy to discourage someone without real resolve. You can't just think an idea is cool, you have to believe that it is enjoyable. If someone tells you it's impossible, you need to go off and think "it's your loss. this game could really be something if you gave it a chance." rather than "ILL SHOW YOU. ILL MAKE THIS GAME. AFTER MY NAP". You see the difference there?<br/>_________________<br/>Uh oh, it's an oreo!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
