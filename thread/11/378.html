    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry if this is sort of off-topic, but I think this is where I should post it. Anyway, I've been into programming and pixel art for about 1.5 years and have some game creation experience. I really would like to create a 2D RPG game for the gba, but have no clue how to go about it. If anyone could give me a tutorial, or perhaps some examples that would be great. Thank you in advance.:)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://saoghal.cywh.com/Jer1400/index.html" target="_blank">http://saoghal.cywh.com/Jer1400/index.html</a>
