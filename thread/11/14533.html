    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
I have started porting <a class="postlink" href="http://members.aol.com/chchillsch/fm/fm.htm" target="_blank">Paul Robson's</a> remake of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_manager#The_original_Football_Manager_series" target="_blank">the original Football manager</a> to the DS. This will be frst foray into DS homebrew after spending a bit of time with the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
As it says on the page, it shouldn't be too difficult to port the code. Obviously, changes will need to be made for the touch screen interface, else I may as well just use an emulator to run it.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else who was hopelessly addicted to ths game would like to assist in porting the code to speed things up, that would be nice.
<br/>
<br/>
I remain baffled by the lack of a football management game on DS to take advantage of the touch screen, though I cannot blame Zoo for not taking a punt after the rather poor Premier Manager they released on the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, there exsts a gp2x port of the game, which has been coded for a non keyboard interface. If I could aquire this code it would provide a better (ie. quicker to port!) foundation. However, I have been unable to find the source code, so if anyone happens to know the whereabouts of this, it would be handy!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On the contrary, it was originally done by 1 person, and game that simple is doable by 1 person on DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Except I'm pretty sure that the one person was motivated in part by money. Motivation of money works for a Pocket PC game but not a DS game because unlike with the DS, you don't need to form a corporation, lease an office, and release prior titles on another platform to be permitted to release a commercial Pocket PC title.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not a great deal, I have been rather busy this week trying to find myself a job as I am currently out of work.
<br/>
<br/>
As this is my first DS effort, I'm basically trying to work out how to get the best out of the touch screen for this game, and come up with a design document.
<br/>
<br/>
The most difficult aspects of this port are the conversion from keyboard to touch screen, and the graphics for the match highlights.
<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing from your comments you have not played the original before. Here are some match highlights screenshots from various versions:

Needless to say, my graphics will also be 2d.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
