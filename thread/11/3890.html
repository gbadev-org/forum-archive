<br/>
<br/>
I'm an experienced programmer who's relatively new to the GBA, and the question of whether or not I'm available to work on a new project depends a lot on how you define availability.  Between work + familly, I could probably sink about 8 hours per week into a GBA project.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just wrapping up my first GBA demo (gidlock) now.  Prerelease versions are being posted to my blog at 
<br/>
<a href="http://www.transphase.ca" target="_blank">http://www.transphase.ca</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I should have a final this week.  After that, I may be looking for new projects.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Warsong,
<br/>
<br/>
well, I don't generally do sports games.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that. . .
<br/>
<br/>
*INTERESTS*
<br/>
I've never done any work with audio.  That's something I could be interested in but have not actively pursued.
<br/>
<br/>
Not 3d. . . I don't feel like messing with 3d on the GBA.  I'd rather play to the gameboy's strengths.  not that 3d on the gba isn't cool, but it seems a little too much like a ship in a bottle -it's neat, but the hassle seems disproportionate to the payoff
<br/>
<br/>
I had considered doing a 1943 style game.  I could be in to that
<br/>
<br/>
- I want to do a diablo style hacking/combat game.  I think that would be entertaining.
<br/>
<br/>
- I would like to do a turn-based strategy game on a hex map.  I have a lot of ideas on this one, but they are still illformed and nebulous.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I'm currently starting up a mini-game.  more of a technology demo.  I want to see if I can push some lighting effects on a 2d overhead game.  So the tentative plan is to put together a game based on kids shooting roman candles at each other at dusk.  As I say, this still hasn't passed feasability testing, and it's more just messing around with an idea for an engine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*RELEVANT SKILLS*
<br/>
- C
<br/>
- C++
<br/>
- ARM (less so.  i've messed around with it and am getting quite comfortable)
<br/>
- I'm very good at working with other people's code - fixing it, modifying it, etc.  So I could also help on a game that has already been started
<br/>
<br/>
*DISCLAIMER*
<br/>
I should mention that my schedule is a bit unpredictable.  I can promise say 8 hours per week, but beyond that I have no idea. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I look forward to future collaborations.
<br/>
