i am going to the acm competition in sweden this year .. but they are also running a hockey a competition to create an ai hockey team
<br/>
<br/>
i already have ideas as to how to do this; but any direction given will be greatly useful to us as this news has only just been released
<br/>
<br/>
at the moment i propose we create a human player interface and implement basic team player ai so that they go to the necessary parts of the field etc. and also so that players may pass and shoot. then develop strategies and eventually a team which works on auto pilot
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: We came second place; beaten only by a bug in our own code. Other than that bug we trounced every team.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
