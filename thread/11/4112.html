<br/>
<br/>
I'm an artist and game designer and I'm looking for a programmer to team up with for the GBA competition. If you need an artist or a game designer please contact me at mickeyatmickeydotnet or reply to this thread.
<br/>
<br/>
You can visit my website [url]Cheese Comics[/url] to see some of my Flash games and cartoons. I'm currently quite busy working on a TV series based on a very famous computer game, but I'm not sure if I can talk about it yet without being VERY SUED. :) I should have some time on my hands from next week and I'd like to use it for a project like this one!
<br/>
<br/>
The games ideas I have in mind range between platformers to shooters.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
<br/>
<br/>
