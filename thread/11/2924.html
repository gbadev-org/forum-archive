    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, first post concerning what I hope to be my first game, so here goes.  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking to get a team together to make a GBA game, like everyone else I'm hoping this can go somewhere so I'm looking to start with a one or two level demo that'll show off the game system's finer points.  Unfortunately, this is a non-paying gig, but because of that, I'm aiming to have this demo finished before the end of the year instead of in a couple weeks/months.  
<br/>
<br/>
I've put together a website that I'm still working on.  Most likely I'm going to put the detailed documents on a need-to-know basis, but what's up right now you can check out.  <a href="http://www.electriculture.com" target="_blank">www.electriculture.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The game itself is a 2-d action adventure game along the lines of Ninja Gaiden, but refined for today's audiences.  
<br/>
<br/>
The team is non-existent right now, so all the jobs are open for those of you who're interested.  That includes artists (sprites, maps, etc.  Looking for three or four people), programmers (two or three people if possible), music programmers (I've got bands interested, but we don't know how to translate their songs into GBA format) and if someone with prior experience would want to, I'd like someone for a co-producer's spot.  I have no experience in the gaming industry and would like someone to show me the ropes.  I have a background in indie film (directing, producing and writing) and I am also currently writing and producing a comic book.
<br/>
<br/>
There's more that I'd get into, but if you're interested, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:info@electriculture.com">info@electriculture.com</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks to those who've read my post and gotten back to me.  I'm getting closer to assembling the team.  Right now I'm specifically looking for programmers who're able to write some tight tight code for a 2-d game.  If that's you or someone you know who's looking for a project to work on, please pass along this message.  
<br/>
As previously stated, this is a non-paying gig but the ideas we have are solid and I firmly believe that publishers will want to take a closer look at our game.

Interested parties can PM me here or e-mail <a href="mailto:info@electriculture.com">info@electriculture.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
