    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't mean to be disrespectful, but the website doesn't exactly give of an aura of seriousness.  A team of three guys under eighteen, designing a RPG doesn't sound like what is likely to ever get puplished, so it makes one wonder how the great $ can be waves around like that.
<br/>
Looking at the 'team'-page on your site makes one wonder. Only one is credited as a Programmer, while the other two are calles Design/Development/Artists, but apparently they won't design any sprites - seems like a case of slackers who makes a poor coder do all the work so they can hug all the fun parts.
<br/>
I'm sorry for being sceptical, if you could indeed prove some seriousness I may be interested - or if you wave the great $ a bit more. Of course, we all do it for the love of games, but maybe we won't love your game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Has it ever occured to you that some people have jobs? I am one of those 'priveleged' people...  I also am 17...  I also have been pre-accepted into the Phoenix Art Institute Game Art and Design Program based on my game design portfolio...  As for the 'slackers', what world have you been living in these past years. Teenagers are becoming more and more involved in the computing scene every DAY, The creater of YAPP, one of the most widely used, free PHP portals and messsage boards is 15 years old... I'm sorry, but youre post was extremely judgemental and offensive to me, at least in my eyes..  Have a nice day.... - CcSoccer881<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.rsstudios.net" target="_blank">www.rsstudios.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">He never said *you* were a slacker.  He said your Designer/Development/Artists were slackers.  I would agree considering that their job would be to produce and design art (sprites and such) but you are here looking for people to do *thier* job.  Maybe this isn't the story, but it seems like it the way it's presented.
<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that age has nothing to do with skill.  There are many bright young people today, I know since I'm one of them ;).  But then again, there are also a lot of slackers in the world too...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That does more or less seem like you will do most of the job and they are just slacking. Of course, I mean no offence to game designers and art directors and what-not. But in a team of three people, I'd prioritize coders and graphic artist.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are indeed serious - then good for you. It's just that I've seen far too many naive attempts to make a great epic RPG quest all end up in a few minutes of crappy gameplay -I've done too many of them myself - to get very excited whem a team of young people start up. No offence to young people of course - I am still one of them myself.
<br/>
And still, even if you have a jod it's not like you have a budget to pay very high salaries.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll admit you do have a point.  we all love it.
<br/>
As I also love designing sprites for RPGs, I may be interested in signing up for the job. For the money - I'll decide later if I'll love the game. 
<br/>
<br/>
If the jobs still not taken taken, have a look at my last project, "The tragical Historie of Rodion and Rosalind", at <a href="http://gbax2003.gbaemu.com/" target="_blank">http://gbax2003.gbaemu.com/</a>
<br/>
and contact me at <a href="mailto:dunderbertil@hotmail.com">dunderbertil@hotmail.com</a> if you like my sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll do the RPG, I'm not sure about the other games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Many bright have the choice of being slackers and getting by fairly easily, or actually trying, exceeding the expectations of other and actually producing nice stuff.  I was the former in my first couple of years in high school.
