    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys! I`m german and not so good in english grammar.
<br/>
I hope you can understand what i want! 
<br/>
<br/>
Firsta about my person:
<br/>
<br/>
I`m living in Germany and worked hard with a new gamingsystem called Phoenix - perhaps you heard some rumors about it. It was planed to start the NEXGEN - but to much is gone outside and other companies with more budget had started with the same technology. 
<br/>
<br/>
So far so good. Now i want to start a little Software-Company with a good friend. We have already done something for the never released Phoenixsystem. My friend is a exellent 3D-Designer. My part was the Boarddesign and programming the Biosfirmware and a DOS-Compatible OS for the System. We already started with a Game called "Bloodbath" - its mainly like Myst but not playing in a fantasy scenario. 
<br/>
<br/>
We want to start with GBA-Software because the Market is now a little bit expanding - i say only DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Ok now the Games that we want to do first:
<br/>
A Spacetaxi Remake 
<br/>
A Pseudo 3D-Beat em up like Tekken-Advance/ Mortal Kombat DA
<br/>
Bloodbath (Point&amp;Click)
<br/>
<br/>
What we need:
<br/>
Coders for 2D with expert abilities (parallaxscrolling should be your easiest move) 
<br/>
Coders for 3D
<br/>
Composers (Oh we have already contracts with a german Indy-Band)
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I wrote this in 2 min. If you have any questions ask. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you=expert goto 10
<br/>
<br/>
10 Print"oh if you want to join, you have to do a online casting"
<br/>
<br/>
In the casting phase we want some demos and infos about your person.
<br/>
People in germany are preferred but in the age of communication this is not importent.
<br/>
<br/>
We can do individual contracts.
<br/>
Payment: We give you all things you will need to work. After the first Project everbody will become a percentage of the Money we earn. After this you become every month you money.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Phoenix was the XBOX before the XBOX was. It means we wanted to use PC-architecture. Than comes Microsoft. After the release of the XBOX we designed a new model of Phoenix with more Power and low(but calculated) profit chances for us, because the productioncosts were to high. The end is that we stoped the project(no investors). In my opinion could the Phoenixsystem only take part as a Freakware like the GP32. 
<br/>
<br/>
The best thing what we have done for Phoenix was the Bios(firmware). It uses a Master-OS (QNx) and about this the system was/is able to emulate many other OS or Chipsets.

I am confused. Are you looking to build a team for the GBA or the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
If it's for the GBA, why do you need 3D people?
<br/>
<br/>
:)

<br/>
The Spacetaxi remake will be in 2D, but we have plans for some 3D Parts(cutscenes, and bonusgames)
<br/>
<br/>
The Beat em Up will be a licensed port of a well known game. The arenas will be in 3D / fighters will be sprites.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you cannot afford to pay actual programmer salaries instead of promises of royalties, I do not think you will get very far presenting this as a legitimate, professional venture. No one reading this forum thinks it is, and it comes across as being dishonest, frankly.
<br/>
<br/>
You will probably have more luck finding someone if you present it as an amateur venture with the intention and hope of eventually becoming professional. But don't treat this board as if you are "hiring" someone when you're really not. You need an expert more than any expert needs you.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry if it looks like this. We are realy nothing without your help! This is true. It is a amatuer venture because we can do nothing but grafics and sound. 
<br/>
I wrote "Payment: We give you all things you will need to work. After the first Project everbody will become a percentage of the Money we earn. After this you become every month you money."  
<br/>
<br/>
I hoped you understand it as "amateur venture" because we have no mone to pay you before we have any result.
<br/>
<br/>
Please remember im not perfect in english and this sentenses are not all this what i realy try to say.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok we are newbies in GBA development but not in x86 and 68k programming. Our last project is dead. Now we want to try together with you starting a new Team. All who want to help will be a full and equal teammember. 
<br/>
<br/>
Ok i think this is what i try to tell you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
