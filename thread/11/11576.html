    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working with some ex Apple education people in developing a title which will help kids 3-7 learn how to read.  We have some pretty exciting ideas about taking advantage of the DS platform.  We are relatively clueless about the developmental issues for the DS and really need some help understanding the challenges and costs of programming for the DS.  Ultimately, we will need to hire a DS developer.  Anyone willing to share your insights or consult to us?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
