<br/>
<br/>
First post - a contact of mine recommended this site...
<br/>
<br/>
We're a games industry recruiter (Aardvark Swift). I've got a couple of DS requirements at the moment and wondered if anyone was looking for permanent work? One of the roles is based in London and the other in Spain.
<br/>
<br/>
Specs are similar - both vacancies need someone with strong DS engine / tools / tech development experience (backed up with published titles).
<br/>
<br/>
I can send specs to anyone that is interested - either message me here or mail me at <a href="mailto:pete@aswift.com">pete@aswift.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you know anyone that could be suitable we also offer a cash referral scheme for information that leads to a placement being made - again I can give details on request.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks 
<br/>
<br/>
Pete</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
