    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To begin, I did read the stickied (stuck?) thread and I don't believe I fall into any of the examples posted. With that said, I admit now that I am not a programmer. I do not have any mock ups, code, or samples from an existing program either (save for some decent examples of PC/Mac applications). I do, however, have money (not a lot, but can't we all say that?), and I wonder if this request is "insignificant" to the point where I could afford to pay someone to create the program.  Now that I've thrown chum into the water, let me add that I am a student, part-time employed, completely open to the possibility that this is an outlandish request, and finally, I'm perfectly able to handle rejection.
<br/>
<br/>
What am I in search for? An effective <span style="font-weight: bold">flash card program</span>.  Now I've had some difficulty searching for such an app on boards like this, because the term "flash card" means something else as well, and quite a common term I found.  When I say flash card, I mean cue card, or those things you may or may not have used in your studious days to remember words, terms, etc. (on one side is a term, on the other a description) 
<br/>
<br/>
I should probably add that I hope to use such a program primarily for studying the French language, so on to some basic requirements:
<br/>
<br/>
1. a keyboard on the touch-screen portion or something allowing me to add cards by typing/writing words. 
<br/>
2. "foreign characters" I would need to be able to enter characters with accents and the like (e.g. ?, `? )
<br/>
3. The ability to initially see one side of a card without the other (thus the emphasis is placed on learning and remembering).
<br/>
4. Finally, the ability to "flip" the card when I want to know the answer.
<br/>
<br/>
From a few programs I found for Mac and PC, there were some nicer features like percentage evaluations showing you how often you were correct in remembering a card, and the ability to shuffle them. Another was the ability to create more than one stack.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be more than happy to link to those programs, but it'd be a waste of time to search for them now if no one expresses any interest, so I'll wait on that.  
<br/>
<br/>
Remembering that I must not conform to any of the examples in the sticky, I add that other than by paying a commission, I'd be happy to contribute in any way that I can by gathering information, etc, but I'll say no more.
<br/>
<br/>
$$ As far as payment is concerned, tell me what you think is reasonable (key word) and I'd be happy discuss the details, because I've never done this before and I'm no aware what the going-rate is . 
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the lengthiness, but I didn't want to write some off-the-top thread asking for a legion of followers with no information or tangibility.
<br/>
<br/>
Did I succeed?
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, thanks for reading.
<br/>
<br/>
PS One final thing: Although I believe I've conducted an exhaustive search for an existing application, should you happen to find one that is suitable for my needs, I would consider that to be a service as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
