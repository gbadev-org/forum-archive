    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its my understanding that the gamelink cable provides master/slave style communication for synchronizing gamestate between multiple GBAs, but is the communication truly one way, or is it possible for "slave" GBAs to act as coprocessors to the main GBA?
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, computing fractals is costly.  Would it be possible to gang up multiple GBAs via a link cable with the "master" sending out instructions for areas to be computed and the "slaves" sending back the results of the computations for aggregation and display on the master?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The "slave" GBAs are running at full speed with their full processor available, so they can do whatever rendering you require. In fact, they <span style="font-weight: bold">have to</span> render their own screens, because it's impossible to transfer enough data each frame for the master GBA to actually send the screen contents out to the other GBAs.
<br/>
<br/>
All that you're typically exchanging is the game state. It's usually safest to have the master GBA be the "authority" on the game state.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, it's possible for the GBAs to just share, say, their button states, and have each GBA figure out the game state as it changes, but the chance of getting out-of-sync is high.

There's also no (useful) rendering going on the slave GBAs in this scenario, either.
<br/>
<br/>
The point is to use the slave GBAs as essentially coprocessors for the master GBA and feed data back to the master that was computed on the slave.

How much bandwidth can you get out of a gamelink cable?  Is it comparable to RS-232 (if so, what baud rate?) or ethernet?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Despite the fact there is no game-style application in your case, the fact that the rendering can be done and the game state can be passed to and fro indicates that you can have other GBAs doing work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
