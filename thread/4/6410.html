    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does anyone have any thoughts as to how i would go about varifying if a save game has become corrupted or not used before.
<br/>
<br/>
In my game as it stnds when you load a game that has not been saved to, you get the nonsense that was in the sram previously.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas as to a robust way i could determine if a savegame has been previously used and is not corrupted?
<br/>
<br/>
I supposed i could check that everything was in acceptable ranges (those variables that should be enums for example) but if corruption had occoured within that range i would not know.
<br/>
<br/>
perhaps a checksum would solve the problem, is this how comercial games do their varification? Or perhaps this is overkill, is there a simple way to solve this problem that i have overlooked?
<br/>
<br/>
any thoughts welcome, thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A simple checksum should suffice. Your number one cause of data loss will be someone shutting off their GBA while writing, which a checksum should detect.
<br/>
<br/>
I would also store some kind of basic identifier key - maybe a few bytes in length - as well as a hardcoded version number so you can quickly and easily invalidate your save data whenever the format changes.
