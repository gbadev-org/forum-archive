    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get an 8 x 8 sprite positioned such that its leftmost side is off-screen and the rightmost side is on-screen (i.e., part of the sprite is left of the screen's left-hand side).  I tried doing so by setting the sprite's x-coordinate to 512 - 1 = 511, which I thought would work because of a vague blurb in the CowBite FAQ.  Unfortunately, rather than going off-screen, the sprite disappears.  I encounter the same problem when I try to make a sprite disappear off the top of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me how I can make the sprite appear partially on-screen?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: I used the BoyCottAdvance emulator if that makes any difference.  I didn't try any others.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
that should work, it's always worked for me (on Boycott Advance too)... if Irecall correctly its covered in the tutorials at: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mdh165.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/docstuts/docstuts.htm" target="_blank">http://www.mdh165.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/docstuts/docstuts.htm</a> which were what I started with (they're C based in PDF format)
<br/>
<br/>
I'd try making sure the sprite works as expected when fully on the screen, and make sure you don't overflow the x value to greater than 511 or y&gt;255 as that might cause problems.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Silly me.  I calculated the x-coordinate by:
<br/>
<br/>
     newx = x % 512;
<br/>
<br/>
which, to my surprise, returns -1 for x == -1 rather than 511 as I had expected.  Changing the code to newx = x + 512 fixed the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I learn something new about C every day!

Thanks for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
