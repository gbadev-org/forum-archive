    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I overheard in the efnet IRC channel that it isnt know amongst amateur developers how to link with games. But some flashlinkers use the port and I dont think they got the info from Nintendo for it. So can noone figure out how? I know there some proffesional programmers here, they could carefully leak it to a amateur devver who then acts like he found it out himself (really those Nintendo Ninjas are not as scary as Nintendo says they are). Sorry if this is a whiny rant but I really like to make multiplay games with several GBA's.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Here is a way to do it, but i haven't figured out how to use it:

<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~tjh8300/CowBite/CowBiteSpec.htm#Serial" target="_blank">http://www.cs.rit.edu/~tjh8300/CowBite/CowBiteSpec.htm#Serial</a> Communication Registers

note that you can not press that link and succeed, you must copy whole the line and paste it into you browser adress.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The GBATek reference document has a good amount of information about multiplayer communication as well. It can be very useful although it is a reference and not a tutorial. Here's a link to the document: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm</a>

Among other modes it supports standard async. comm. (normal serial port).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
