Seriously, you don't have as many lanaguage options on gba as you will do on other platforms.  While there has been a Basic for GBA made before (google for "dragonBasic"), you almost definitely won't be able to use Blitz Basic.  
<br/>
<br/>
Either stick with windows, or bite the bullet and learn some more languages.  It will be worth it in the long run to learn more than Blitz Basic, also.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not wasted, then; the knowledge you've learned from that experience <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> benefit you down the road in GBA programming.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, you're still going to have to start over at ground zero learning C or C++.
