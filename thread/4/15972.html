    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,I realise Devkitpro is probably a better choice of software,but I can't be doing with it.
<br/>
<br/>
I recently downloaded HAM,and I really don't have a clue what Im doing.
<br/>
<br/>
All I want to do is make a gba app that randomises quotes,but I dunno where to start.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Although HAM is easier, one disadvantage of using it is that you won't get as much help from people here...most of the people on this forum don't have experience using it.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't help you with HAM, but as far as getting started doing what you want to do:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Do you know how to write programs in C?  That's the first step, which should be learned on a PC, not on a GBA.
<br/>
2.  If you know how, then "where to start" is to break down the problem -- first read and learn how to display text on the gba screen.  I can't help you much if you're using HAM, but there's probably functions for it in the HAM library.  Then learn how to do pseudo-random numbers.  From there, it's easy to put them together.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
