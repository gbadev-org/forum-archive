Hello everybody! ^^
<br/>
I've bought a NDS, so my old GBA is now a bit obsolete. I thought I'd make some personal utilities for it, since I'm from a country/family where I can choose between games and a PDA, but not have both. After a bit of searching, I found Cearn's amazing TONC, recalled what I forgot about C and decided to port SQLite to the GBA, which pretty much involved making some kind of text input and a filesystem.
<br/>
I got an idea for a text input system when I used my old non-T9 cellphone, and I think it works quite well. I haven't tested on HW though, I still have to save a bit more money for a flash cart.
<br/>
For the FS I used GBFS, plus a wrapper around malloc()s for temporary tables.
<br/>
A friend suggested that I post it here, so here I go: <a class="postlink" href="http://tmp.krypton.cz/ECK/sqlitest-en.gba" target="_blank">http://tmp.krypton.cz/ECK/sqlitest-en.gba</a>. Keep in mind you can only create temporary tables if you care to take a look. Also, please ignore the language in the splash screen, press A and it's translated to English after that.
<br/>
This is probably the last version before I start adding a personal database and some front-end for that. 
<br/>
My code is messy since I didn't have a ton of experience with the GBA so I fooled around until it seemed to work (and had fun doing that), so if you want to use the idea you'd probably be better off writing it again. If someone wants the code, though, I can find somewhere to host it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey this key input engine is quite cool and really well done. 13 is a bit of a sort character limit but apart from that it's cool. Can't get the FS to work thought but the text input is ace<br/>_________________<br/>John Noon</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
