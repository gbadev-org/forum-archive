From <a href="http://www.thepernproject" target="_blank">www.thepernproject</a> :</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Bit 10-11 is the priority. As with backgrounds sprites can be assigned a priority of 0-3. Higher numbered sprites are drawn first meaning that a sprite of priority 0 will be drawn over the top of a sprite with priority of 3. Also a sprite priority is always higher than that of the corresponding background priority meaning that if both a sprite and a background have the same priority then the sprite will be drawn on top. One more thing: for sprites with the same priority then sprites with the lowest OAM number are drawn on top.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
