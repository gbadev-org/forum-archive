Now I'm using 
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">consoleDemoInit()
<br/>
videoSetMode(MODE_FB0)
<br/>
vramSetBankA(VRAM_A_LCD)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
how can I manage to write to the upper lcd?
<br/>
How can I clear() the screen?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i haven't set my nds dev environment up, but i can think of a way to make it possible. it really depends on how the console functions are implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
if you could setup banks for the main and sub screen and the console (via the initialization function) in a way that you would effectively have the first line on the second screen being the line after the last of the main screen.
<br/>
<br/>
as said before, i can't help you here, as i neither have tested this, nor can i test it atm.
<br/>
<br/>
good luck and happy coding.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't want the first line of the second screen to be the last of the first screen.

<br/>
I want to write some text on the first and some other, indipendent, text on thhe second.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's easier, or not?
<br/>
<br/>
I just want a thing like:
<br/>
print (first_screen, "text1")
<br/>
print (second_screen, "text2")
<br/>
clear (first_screen)
<br/>
clear (second_screen)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you would have to take the sources and modify them, so you could have something like printMain("...") and printSub("...").
<br/>
<br/>
with the setup i described earlier you could just make wrapper functions. the sub screen function would set an offset, so that you could write indipendently to the screens, but without the need to initialize two consoles (like with the source modification i mentioned). you would simply initialize one console (with continuous memory mapping). then there's the console text formating that puts the cursor to a specific character position, this is where the offset comes into play.
<br/>
<br/>
hope it's explained clearly enough. :^D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
