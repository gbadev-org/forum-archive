    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA limit without bank switching is 32 Mbyte.
<br/>
That is 256 Mbit.
<br/>
Cartridges are sold in Mbits because it sounds more.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah you can freely access all of the 256mbit (32MB) but if you access the next byte after that it'll roll around to the first byte on the cartridge. To access the next byte on say a 512mbit (64MB) cart, you have to send the correct signals to bankswitch it to wherever you want. sorta like
<br/>
<br/>
0x8000000 = 0 on flash cart.
<br/>
0x9FFFFFF = 32MB later on flash cart
<br/>
0xA00000 = 0 on flash cart (with waitstate 2?)
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
0x8000000 = 0 on flash cart
<br/>
after bank switching
<br/>
0x8000000 = 32mbit later
<br/>
after bankswitching
<br/>
0x8000000 = 64mbit later
<br/>
after bankswitching
<br/>
0x8000000 = 71mbit later
<br/>
<br/>
bankswitching changes what the gba sees to a different area of memory on the flash card. sorta like those old orange 3d things you had when you were a kid, where you insert the round paper disk and see some 3d image. ROM carts can't change what you see, so you're stuck on one image, but a flash cart can bankswitch, like flipping the lever and going to the next image :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can have have more than 256Mb on a flash cart however the GBA only sees 256Mb at a time, so no, you can't have a ROM file larger than that.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah let's say one of those movie encoders for gba was made with this in mind. it could check where the data is being decoded from, and if it's at the end of the 32MB the gba sees, it'd bankswitch the cart to the next 32MB, and read from the beginning of rom and keep on going. it's easilly possible (well supporting several carts would suck a tiny bit) but it just hasn't been implemented yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
