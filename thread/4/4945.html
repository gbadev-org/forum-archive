Could someone please have a look and let me know:

<br/>
Since I've introduced coloured doors (an little extra something not found in Head over Heels on which it is based - no, really, it is) I can't decide whether or not they get in the way....
<br/>
<br/>
Should I make them translucent?
<br/>
Comments welcome. ps. still looking for an artist if anyone's interested!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also put the rom up so you can play the game and decide whether the doors and things make a difference to the gameplay - you can see from the screenies that the doors do obscure some of the room, I just wondered if anyone playing the game found them to be a problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With the doors closed they do get a bit obtrusive. But I don't think transparent doors are needed. Perhaps concentrate level design so that they are blocking "non dangerous" situations only. Also, 4 doors per room is usually a rarity in iso games.
<br/>
<br/>
One non related thing to watch is the controls, when up against something, you can't jump (or it seems that way). Getting into the (bottom) right door is more difficult than it should be, I feel.

Coming along well though :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
