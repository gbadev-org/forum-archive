    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering if DMA is fast enough for me to do sprite animation with.  What I mean is, would it be more efficient to load in each frame of animation with DMA every frame, or just load in all the frames to memory and alter attribute 2 every frame.  I've been doing the latter so far, and I'm just wondering if it would be better to DMA each frame in to save space.  Would it be fast enough, even if there were many animated sprites on screen at once?<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
