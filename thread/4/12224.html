    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I just thought I'd share a telephone interview I had for an Investment Bank in London, it was quite an odd interview, but i Guess the question was created to get the most out of my knowledge......it turns out I didnt get the job, but heres the question and my answer:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Question:
<br/>
"How would you go about programming Monopoly"
<br/>
<br/>
Answer:
<br/>
I'd have a abstract 'square' base class, that holds, ID, Name{optional} etc, then 3 derived classes 'land type' - we can build on this and has a house collection, a 'pickup' class for chance etc and a derived class for 'other' like start or in jail.
<br/>
<br/>
Id then have a level class that contain 'square' objects, a player object can move to squares etc...
<br/>
<br/>
...then we started to talk about transacting moves to the database etc....
<br/>
<br/>
I did fail to mention 3 teir architecture....I hope that wasnt my downfall...
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First you need to know the requirements; are there going to be extra features? Customizable cards? The prospect of AI players? How much time do we have to develop this version of the game? Developing with a team or as an individual?
<br/>
<br/>
I would then begin to investigate the entities of the situation; what bodies exist in the world of monopoly. We need to make decisions on the design patterns made use of somewhere along the line and ensuring thread safety. But wait a second, interesting that an investment bank asked about a monopoly game. They may have wanted to see you apply the <a class="postlink" href="http://databases.about.com/od/specificproducts/a/acid.htm" target="_blank">ACID</a> properties in the context of a game!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Remember that the first thing you need to do is ask yourself how an answer could relate to them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm. Was it a programmer who was doing the interview? And even if it was, was this your first interview?
<br/>
<br/>
I've asked questions like that when interviewing programmers, and I was often looking for a more "human" response about identifying the dev team, understanding the audience, etc., etc. It's possible they were more interested in the kind of response you would give rather than the actual response.
<br/>
<br/>
But that's just my conjecture. :)

Tip from a recruiter I'm working with: You're supposed to send a thank-you card the next morning, and you're supposed to call back one week after the interview. This reminds the interviewer of your name, putting your resume at the top of the pile twice.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well said.  The more you can get people to remember you (in a good way), the better.   I've never actually sent a thank-you card for an interview, but all of the jobs I've gotten, I've taken initiative to follow up with the hiring manager instead of waiting for them....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
