    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My suggestion is don't try it. I'm currently doing this and it's the hardest thing I've ever done. First off you need to have a team made up of programmers, artists, musicians (or contract them), designer, and a business manager. Now you can combine different abilities like designer/business manager is the same person but avoid it if you can. Then the entire team needs to be local and meet everyday at an office space. Everyone on the team needs to have a college degree or working towards one and able to support themselves for at least one year without any income.
<br/>
Once you have that then you can begin to make a game. And more than likely you'll still fail, however there is a small chance to succeed if you've got what it takes (most people don't).
<br/>
<br/>
Contact: Every single publisher that publishes GBA titles.
<br/>
<br/>
Costs: Enough to support yourself and your team for one year. Plus buy equipment and office space if needed. Probably looking around $40,000+ at the cheapest.
<br/>
<br/>
Requirements: Too many to list! But most notible are: 12-16 hours a day (60-80 hours a week) to dedicate to the game. College degree. Entire team that is located in the same area.<br/>_________________<br/>Robert

Of course, the more you sell, the better your net profit per game is, since a large part of it is the cost of developping your game (which don't increase on a cartridge basis).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That sounds very gloom. My conclusion is the professional game programers are overworked and underpayed (if payed at all). I am wondering why that kind of sacrifice is needed if you consider that you will make much more money as a regular programmer and you can always developt games in your spare time if you wish so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This industry is becoming the next Hollywood. As you know most actors never make it, yet they still get paid. The same goes for the games industry, you may not make a lot but you still get paid. And most programmers are overworked and under paid so it doesn't matter if you make Zelda or Photoshop. However there is always the hope and dream of being the next Id or Bungie, and the only way there is to start at the bottom and work your way up. Both developers made many games before they hit it big. If you develop games in your spare time then you're only doing it for fun, not profit, and usually you don't complete the game because you get tired of doing it.

According to Game Developer Mag a game programmer makes $56k or more which is the standard for any programmer.<br/>_________________<br/>Robert

Yes and no. We're currently working on a title that we hope will be published, in fact we've talked to a few publishers that are interested in it. We're completing the game to beta stage which will be used by the publishers to decide whether our game is marketable. We talked with one publisher today (4/22/03) who is "eagerly awaiting" our beta. So hopefully in about one month we should be a commercial developer.<br/>_________________<br/>Robert

Not really sure that I agree NovusAmor.  I've only been in the video games industry for a little over four years, and I don't have a degree of any sort.

Mmost of the people I work with have degrees (actually...I think I'm the odd one out as far as my fellow programmers go) infact one guy I used to work with has a PhD in Theoretical Astro Physics!

Yeah, I guess I am a bit of a rarity.  I managed to get an interview through an agency, with nothing more than my resume.  I was very candid about my lack of experience and qualifications, but my list of skills was pretty extensive (C/C++, various assembler, matrix and vector math, experienced at writting software renderers etc.) and made it clear that for the most part I was self-taught.
<br/>
<br/>
I did go to college, since I couldn't afford to go to University in Edinburgh on the basis that the course I was one was no different from the Comp. Sci courses offered at the large Universities, which was a complete falacy.
<br/>
<br/>
So I dropped out and got a job to pay the bills, while I learned what I needed to know in my spare time.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....the company who interviewed asked me back for a two-day interview (this was standard practice), where I was given a ask to perform.  My task was to write a version of Frogger using Direct X.  A pretty tight task, given that I had never toched windows coding before, let alone DirectX.  But I managed it and five days later, I was starting out writting 3ds Max Plugins, and then the Level Editor for the first game that I worked on at that company.
<br/>
<br/>
Gradually I moved on to actually working on game code, and even a bit of game design. I was the lead programmer on the PC conversion for  a game where I designed the sub-games, wrote the level editor and worked on the Dreamcast conversion.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just demonstrated the I had talent, was the kind of person who could learn whatever they didn't know, and whatever other requirements there happen to be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Another thing:

i came back from <a href="http://www.warioworld.com" target="_blank">www.warioworld.com</a> and i see i must spend 10,000 - 20,000 $ for licensee... Why these two prices? What indicate the first and what the second?

With the licensee what can i have? Software? Hardware?
<br/>
For the distribution of the Cartridges in the stores how i must do? How much i must spend? Who can do it?
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise are there others way to make GBA game and selling with smaller investment?

so many of the questions that you have asked, have been answered quite a few times, but you just don;t seem to be listening.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay...first off, it' the job of the publisher to deal replication of cartridges, marketing, distribution etc.  The developer only develops the games.  The publisher will actually pay Nintendo to manufacture a certain number of copies, which it then has to sell to the stores.
<br/>
<br/>
Let the publisher deal with that....you worry about developing the game, and finding a publisher.
<br/>
<br/>
As a licensee, I'm not sure what you'd have.  At a guess it's nothing more than a membership payment.  You would have to pay for the dev-kits yourself.  
<br/>
<br/>

What they will do however, is help with the testing of the game, getting it past the Nintendo TRC (technical requirements checklist) and everything else.  The publisher will be the actual licensee not you, which is fine since it's the licensee who deals with all the submmission bull sh*t that you have go through with console manufacutrers.

Just use something like DevKit adv to build the actual .bin file that will be used for the ROM image on the cart.  I say quit worrying about this sort of thing right now Link, and get to writting some code!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Link, please, you don't even have mediocre programming skills, and you constantly refuse to read FAQ's, manuals and tutorials, even when people tell you exactly what document to read.
<br/>
There is no chance you can develope a game without first learning C programming and computer systems. You also need a major change of attitude.
<br/>
I'd say you might be able to learn what you need in about two years, but I have no idea how long the required attitude change would take.
<br/>

If you try to contact a publisher now, they will ignore you completely, and most likely put your E-mail in their spam filter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Link,
<br/>
<br/>
If anywhere, you would find out at an Official site. Official means its been qaulified to represent the company, or is the actual company site. I gave the link, so obviously it is possible to know the publishers by the Nintendo official site. Also, I thought we were on the world wide web, "world" I havent or seen anyone say "we use this site over here" before when they can speak both langauges, and even then you could only say I use this site.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with with everyone else, you seem impatient to have the game done. You cannot be impatient even if you do know coding, and you dont seem to know much from your posts. Download, and read some tutorials and dont go rushing into ask answers for errors. You may think it will be worse out that way, but in the end it will be better becuase you will at least have a game and not an unfinished ( slow, unadvanced, ect ) game. I have downloaded: 70 tutorials, and 40 source codes for gameboy advance. I also am going to go buy C/++ Programming for Dummies, as well as Game Programming. And if the new book coming out Gamboy Advance Programming is real and good I would buy that one too. There are 20 nice tutorial/sources at <a href="http://www.thepernproject.com" target="_blank">www.thepernproject.com</a> and many source codes/tutorials here at <a href="http://www.gbadev.org" target="_blank">www.gbadev.org</a> obviously.

Link,
<br/>
<br/>
I have read all you posts. I cannot say that any of them used the correct grammar for my mind to comprehend, but got the idea through. I made sure I reread your post before I posted for that fact that you may not mean what you say. But it does seem like you have an attitude problem, maybe a reason behind it, a lot haven't been very understanding to you. I just got here. The exclamation mark at the end of your sentence <span style="font-style: italic">"Futhermore I don't think it is possible know the publishers by Nintendo official site!"</span> and the sentence itself seems to be a little arrogant and to imply that I am ignorant. You asked for the publishers with licenses, I went to the <span style="font-weight: bold">official</span> website. I pasted for you the people that do publish for Nintendo the maker of gameboy advance, and gave you the site that has the list with all their websites which have emails to there executives that handle homebrew games. The Italian site, yes, does have a very insufficient amount of links for that, but I gave you one so don't take that attitude with me. I also notice you around the forum calling everyone ignorant, maybe people would feel more tolerant of your grammar if it didn't include a little flame. I understand now how hard it can be for you to look for tutorials, since I think Nintendo is American based and where this system is most widely used, and of course English is the most used language. I just remembered going to some geocities site and finding 9 tutorials, 8 were Italian, and I got mad.. I understand. You will not hear anymore slurs from me, as long as you read my posts and understand that my attitude is only a reaction to yours and am trying to help you learn information, not use other peoples.

** Make sure you fully understand this post Link, I do not want to repeat myself or have you remark with one sentence saying I don't know what I am talking about and then ask another question to the community.
<br/>
<br/>
Also to some up the last 3 pages, incase it is hard to follow:
<br/>
<br/>
You don't get a license from making a game and getting it published by another company, it is basically license by association. 
<br/>
1. You develop a demo ( the first 1/3 of the game )
<br/>
2. Talk to a company with a license.
<br/>
3. Sign a lot of contracts.
<br/>
4. Add there logo to your game, saying they are licensed.
<br/>
5. They publish and produce the game, you get paid.
<br/>
Don't worry about buying a license from Nintendo until finishing your first game and getting enough staff where you can produce games in enough time to pay your staff. A license is about $10,000 - $20,000 plus development hardware and software expenses, you need to prove of course you have enough staff and experience to represent their company. There are two different licenses I think, one to develop hardware like games, accessories, etc. Another is to manufacture merchandise like toys, and dolls, etc. Website will all licensee companies of Nintendo, who will need to be contacted to publish your game: <a href="http://nintendo.com/consumer/licensees.jsp" target="_blank">http://nintendo.com/consumer/licensees.jsp</a>
<br/>
If you are making a game, you will need about 6-8 people that have degree's in programming/graphics designing or equivalent, or 12 that are normal programmers/graphic designers. The team needs to have a leader that is organized with a gameplan, as well as a very enthusiastic team that will work hard. The game will take about 1-2 years of development, and 6 months is roughly the amount to spend on the demo. Send a copy to one publisher, if it is turned down you still have about 40 other chances. A lot of projects don't get completed, but if it doesn't it is still good experience and reference for your skills.
<br/>
Also: Gameboy Advance development on hardware does not necessarily mean that it will come out better than a homebrew using gba dev.
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun developing Link, I know I will.

Now for the second part:
<br/>
To develope the Demo i can use the GNU compilers and tools in GBADEV.org and of the Net or however i must use official Nintendo kit?
<br/>
Because the Publishers should to accept my unofficial work?
<br/>
<br/>
The last: If i have a 6-8 people in my staff, when i start to receive mony for my Game how can pay 6-8 pople if my game is not a Zelda or Metroid Fusion?
<br/>
A paiment for 6-8 people who have worked in 1-2 years is very much!
<br/>
How much could do to earn my Company a 'middle' GBA game in this way (using a publisher)?

I have read that Nintendo's quality assurance department does not care which tools the developer uses to make a binary. All that matters is that the binary runs properly on Nintendo hardware.

If you have to pay employees before you sell product (as with any new business), try raising venture capital. To attract venture capital, try building a name for yourself on the Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms, none of which need a license from Nintendo. Then, once you've proven yourself on an "open" platform, contact publishers who might be interested in publishing a GBA port of your PC game.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Anyway, this is assuming you have people working for free or for the money when it sells. I dont know how much a game sells for to a publisher but I am assuming they will want at least 60% of the profit, and you will only get a few dollars profit because of the cartridge costs, they dont know how much it will make so they will offer a low amount most likely, if 2 million copies are sold then it would make 2 million dollars and minus the 60% you have $800 into 12 people is $66, 000 and that is what an average american person makes in 1-2 years. But even that seems like a small amount of money to be offering, does anyone know how much a commercial game makes or sells or how much a publisher offers for a game?

To prove to Nintendo that you can get a license, only Nintendo gives out licenses to publish Nintendo products.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you also must prove to the Publisher your game is very unique, appealing, and generally going to make a good profit. You need to 'prove' or show them your demo or game as being quility to be sold in order for them to give you a nice amount of money.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been working in the movie/television/ and right now in the game industry for the last 6 years. Was reading everybody comments and hope to shed some new perspective on the topic.
<br/>
<br/>
I have worked on 
<br/>
<br/>
Scorpion King GBA 
<br/>
as the Background designer
<br/>
(I think its on sale at AMAZON.COM for about 6 bucks LOL, so go buy it!!)
<br/>
<br/>
Godzilla Domination GBA
<br/>
as the Background and level designer
<br/>
<br/>
Rescue Heros Billy Blazes GBA(which is Goldmaster right now and soon to be coming out)
<br/>
Assistant Director, lead level designer
<br/>
<br/>
I have been busting my hump gaining as much knowledge as I can about the video game biz..You can were a lot of hats in this business and if you work for a smaller developer you will probably get pulled in every direction..
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the number of people that are on the GBA team, it all depends on how much work the game needs.
<br/>
<br/>
Lead Programmer
<br/>
Director
<br/>
Character Animator
<br/>
Background artist (graphic designer)
<br/>
effects animator
<br/>
level designer
<br/>
Music Engineer
<br/>
<br/>
That would be a good solid team. If anybody is added, they would probably be assisting those key people.
<br/>
<br/>
Now as far as how much money you your company gets from a GBA GAME, it all depends on the contract. You will usaully have to sell over a million units to get money back on the game, but it HAS TO BE IN THE CONTRACT, I see the statments like " a dollar from each game", not every game gets that kind of deal (but its sure nice to think about!). So usually the money you make on the game is made when making it, not after its in the shelves. 
<br/>
<br/>
And as far as the "Getting a degree" goes, you can have one or not. It doesn't matter. If you have one you still have to prove you can do the work, and if you don't have one, guess what, you still have to prove you can do the work. YOU ARE GOING TO BE LEARNING THE REST OF YOURLIFE IF YOU WANT TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS, so don't think your done when you get a degree. You will have to adapt and go back to take more classes forever, or have someone teach you the latest and greatist information, so enjoy learning.
<br/>
<br/>
And the thing about being licenced. Usually a publisher like "Capcom" will act like the "inbetween guy" and request a LICENSE for you dev house. Its usually the case that the publisher helps you get the foot in the door, or else Nintendo probably won't even know your alive. 
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it doesn't sound like I am ranting or anything, just thought you guys and gals would like to hear a different perspective from somebody working in the industry. If you ask somebody else that works in the industry they might tell you something totaly different. 
<br/>
<br/>
And as far as money goes for a ONE YEAR project
<br/>
(even though most games now are done in about 7-8 months)
<br/>
<br/>
40-100$ thousand per person for the year, based on level of importance, for a GBA project. I think I hit most of the subjects here! Hope it helps!

<br/>
Its'a ME!

Let me see if I can shed some light on this.
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter how much money you have if.
<br/>
  a) You are new to the field.
<br/>
  b) You  do not have a well design GDD (Game Design Doc) and TDD (technical design doc).  Nintendo will need to sign off on at least the GDD before they will give you the much sought after title of "Authorized Devloper".
<br/>
  c) You can prove you are able to develop a quality product.
<br/>
<br/>
New companies to the console market very rarely can demostrate they meet Nintendos guild lines.  Go to <a href="http://www.warioworld.com/apply/agb.html" target="_blank">http://www.warioworld.com/apply/agb.html</a> to see there requirements.   My last job was with a game developement house (recent went backrupt because of bad publishers, damn you Midway and 3DO).  Our operating cost where 80K a month.  This included the building, equipemnt, employees,etc.
<br/>
That is the reason publishers exist they have an established name they can go to Nintendo and vouch for you and get the console development kits. (Oddly enough the AGB dev kit is a hack N64).
<br/>
If you want to make a comercial game.  Write up a GDD &amp;TDD and try to get in the door at as many publisher as possible.  If it is good they will pay for everything, if it is not they will not have anything to do with you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is it safe in this field to apply to several publishers, and once rejected you can improve your work and try again, or is it something more like either you get it in the first time, or you won't at all?
