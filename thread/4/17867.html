into a 16-bit aligned address? I`m using it to quickly copy data from ROM to vram but unfortunately it messes up big time cause I think its forced into a 32-bit aligned address. Using ALIGN2 doesn`t work unfortunately. Using a loop gives me the correct output but that is very slow of course.
<br/>
For those who are curious I`m using a bunch of similar structs so I can quickly copy data in a LZSS uncompress function.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Any instance of that struct you create on the stack, globals, or heap will be aligned to a 32-bit boundary.
<br/>
<br/>
The only time you could get an unaligned version is if you are casting some other pointer that isn't aligned.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're having problems with video memory here, alignment isn't the problem.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yeah this is pretty much what I'm doing unfortunately. Rather the source and destination address could be HW aligned or W aligned and casting to the struct pointer forces it to be W aligned. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway to anyone in the same situation, being HW aligned means that you have to manually copy each element since the assembly version doesn't have a ldmiah or stmiah. Those operations don't exist so what I wanted to do was impossible. I should probably use the dma16bit copy in this situation I think. Thanks guys!<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
