well I got a 32x32 tileset and One single sprite that I move around..the problem is that the lil sprite sometimes(just a few moment and just sometimes) are drawed a little bit "jumpy" like when Im not using vsync.. I dont know why I aint got much code and Im just displaying 32z32 tiles that I dont update.. will the game run smoother on a real gba?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is commonly known that VBA (and probably other emus too) can show "jaggy" framrates even on fast PCs from time to time. I think it has something to do with different framerate of the screen and the VBA window thus creating mismatch behaviour every now and then.<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you using a 'proper' wait vbl function or just waiting for the line counter to reach a certain point?
<br/>
Because if your code misses a wait for line counter, then you could get a noticable jump.
<br/>
A good way of doing it is to either sync your game loop with a counter that is incremented every VBL interrupt, and call the game loop for how ever many vbl's you have missed.
<br/>
If your game runs in under a frame then you should only need to call it once anyways.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tested and working. :)  As Burre said the emulators will always show extra frames from time to time depending on your monitor refresh rate.  It's trying to display 60 frames at say 70hz so the emulator has to repeat some frames to make 60=70 ;)  Happens on all emulators not just GBA ones.  You can try setting your monitor to 60hz but even then it's not guarenteed to work as the gba probably isn't "exactly" the same refresh as your monitor.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
