    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to load my sprites using REG_DMA?'s, but my data is in separate .h files (file for each character).  I can load the first one to OAMData no problem, but to load the others - I can't figure out how to set the pointer to the other sprite's starting tile.  Is that possible with DMA, or do I have to copy them all into one .h file and transfer all at once?<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry, I'm just a Stoopid Noobie...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't have to put all the data in one file.  For the first sprite, you set the DMA dest. to OAMData.  Then for the second one, you would do something like (OAMData+sizeOfPreviousSprite).  Make sure you put the parantheses because I've found that it doesn't work without them.  Hope this helps.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
