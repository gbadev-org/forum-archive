    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, i'm new here but not in the ds development :).So this is my first problem: I'm using Dual 3D but i can't set the two cameras(one for each screen) to make the two screen like one big screen.How can i do that?
<br/>
Thanks :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Imagine that you had 1 screen that was long height-wise instead of 2. When making a camera for something like that, you'd want the center of the camera to hit the center of that screen. Now, split that single screen in half to make what we have now with the NDS. To accomplish it now, you'll need two camera that are split from the main one you had previously, which now would look straight at the hinge of the NDS unit. Rotate the top camera up some, and the bottom camera down some.

I hope I'm not spouting gibberish, because I've never done this myself before. I'm only theorizing.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try thinking about the 2 viewing frusta. You basically want to set one on top of the other so that they don't quite overlap. I'm due for sleep so this might be a bit off, but I think you'll have to offset the position of the second screen by a screen's worth, then angle it away by the viewing angle. You can probably work out the math on that fairly easily.
<br/>
<br/>
(Or, you can split down the middle and offset each camera by half, and angle away by half, to do it the way DiscoStew advises.)<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
