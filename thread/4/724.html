    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if there's a good'ol fashioned Monitor styled Win32/Dos application to disasm/debug GBA rom files?
<br/>
<br/>
Just like there was for SNES and GB,  you could load in the rom file and stepped trough it, change a few bytes and save it again.
