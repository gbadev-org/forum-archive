Is this the way of things, or am I doing something wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I try to get VBA Win32 version to listen on the default port then I launch GDB+Insight and the debugger will not load until I exit the VBA program.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try the SDL version that seems to work. Command line like this:
<br/>
<br/>
vba -Gtcp:55555 mme.gba
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure load up your gba file on the command line and compile your objects with -G for debug information.

I don't know why the standard windows VBA doesn't want to debug, prehaps something do to with windows 2k, which I am running. Still the SDL version works for me and it's very useful indeed debuging things with insight/GDB. There are ofcourse no 'windows menus' on the SDL version all the options are set though a textfile that is read in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
