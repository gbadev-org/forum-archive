When you're using Wait4VblankItr() and no$gba gives you a grey screen, no warning (i.e. no "bad header checksum real Gameboy would shut down"), says you have exactly one error, and low power is unsupported, but it all runs fine in VBA, what could you possibly have done wrong?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
Are you saying your NDS file runs fine in VBA?? Or did you accidentally post a question about GBA dev in an unrelated post in the wrong forum?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm 90% sure this is what happened. VBlankIntrWait() is the libgba name for what libnds calls swiWaitForVBlank(). I guess it was posted here because there is no recent topic about NO$GBA in [GBA] Coding.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by tepples on Wed Sep 17, 2008 7:14 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
