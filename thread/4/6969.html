    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there guys.  I started of making my own game using character sprites 64X64 256 colours.  Now though i need more space for sprite images.  What would be the best option - decrease the sprite and image size, change to 16 colours or is there any other way?  Please help.  Thank you</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, 64x64 is pretty large. Try making it 32x32 instead - and 16 colours vs 256 colours... it depends on how well you draw it. If you can get away with 16 colours, do it, as it wil use half the VRAM of 256 colours (think of it as 256 colours using 2 tiles for every tile the 16 colours equivalent is using).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont really want to shrink all the image files, so is there anything you can do to shrink sprites through programming? please say yes!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By "i need more space for sprite images", are you running out of VRAM, running out of EWRAM, or running out of ROM? Are you making sure that your sprite cels are declared const?
<br/>
<br/>
You can shrink sprite cel data by a factor of 2 with programming: convert each sprite sheet from 256 colors to 16 colors.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're running out of VRAM, you can also <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/managing-sprite-vram.txt" target="_blank">continuously swap cels from ROM or EWRAM to VRAM</a> so that you only have to have one 2 KB cel, not an entire animation, loaded for each sprite.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is the code im using:
<br/>
<br/>
memcpy( (u16 *)0x06015000, &amp;playerarmData, sizeof(playerarmData) );
<br/>
<br/>
How do you convert sprite sheet from 256 to 16???</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off, you use an image editor such as GIMP or Paint Shop Pro or Photoshop to convert your art from 256-color to RGB and then to 16-color. Then you use an image converter in 16-color mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
