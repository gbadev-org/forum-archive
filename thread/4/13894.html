    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's occured to me that it would be very handy to be able to use my DS as a 3d model and animation viewer so I can pimp my skills at potential employers when i haven't got my laptop (in starbucks etc). 
<br/>
<br/>
so... I'm wondering whether theres' any relatively easy to use free 3d engines available for DS that would be able to handle building a model/animation viewer without doing a great deal of work - preferably one that's capable of taking standard model &amp; texture formats
<br/>
<br/>
When I say "without doing a great deal of work" ...
<br/>
I've knocked up a small model viewer in the past for PC but only with the aid of pretty high level development tools - I'm not scared of C but I'm not capable of building a 3d engine from scratch by any stretch of the imagination.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How important is interactivity? I think you might get have better luck finding a decent video-playing tool for your DS. Then you could build your stuff in whatever tools you like and export to a "flat" video.

I'd want to be able to spin the scene around and zoom in/out for sure - otherwise i might as well just render jpegs. 
<br/>
<br/>
It'd also be nice to swap textures in and out, display in wireframe and turn edge smoothing on/off
<br/>
<br/>
I've got no objection to doing some work in order to get this but I want to do the absolute minimum possible :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can you render avis at 15 fps and 256x192 pixels? If so, then you might try converting them to dpg and playing them in MoonShell.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in answer to my own question...
<br/>
<br/>
there's no point, somebody appears to have already done it
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't tested yet on account of my r4 not turning up but just in case anybody else was looking for one here's the link.
