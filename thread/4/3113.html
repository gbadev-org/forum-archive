    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">recent updates include binutils 2.15.90, newlib 1.12.0 and finally, a win32 native build of Insight 5.2.1. I've also added the SDL version of Visualboy Advance to the downloads section. This is the one you need to work with Insight.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also a fairly complete set of headers included in libgba and a small example project including a relatively generic makefile in the example code section.

I've got a shorter url for the homepage too at <a href="http://www.devkit.tk" target="_blank">http://www.devkit.tk</a> if that doesn't work for you, the page is still accessible through <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/wintermute2002/" target="_blank">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/wintermute2002/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
