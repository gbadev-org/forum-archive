<br/>
For my project involving Catmull-Rom curves (many of you remember me asking things about curves before, but I am quite content with the switch to Catmull-Rom curves for this project), I am taking the tangent of the position curve as a starting point in getting the resulting orientation of the object on the curve moving forward. I am also supplying an up vector at the start of the entire curve data for correctness on these curves, as it will be used with the tangent to get the normal and binormal to create a rotation matrix. However, I only have it for the start, and I feel that I need to supply it for each control point on the curves, as I want more control of the object's rotation from one point to the next.
<br/>
<br/>
As I am only dealing with the up vector, would there be any real problems by linearly interpolating from one up vector to the next and re-normalizing it, or should I use a different method?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
