    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if modifying rotation/scaling data of a sprite during HBlank (after activating H-Blank Interval Free wich allows access to OAM during H-Blank) has any effect ? I'd like to do mode-7 effect with sprites...
<br/>
I tried with Visual Boy Advance and it does not seem to work, but I can't try on real hardware (I have no cable or flash card).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
