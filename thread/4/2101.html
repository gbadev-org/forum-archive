    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm currently working on a demo and I'm using Dovoto's Mode 7 tutorial.
<br/>
In the tutorial he sets the center of scaling/rotation this way in the HBlank IRQ:
<br/>
<br/>
center_y = (180 * zoom)&gt;&gt;2;  //set for the center of the screen in the x direction and slightlu
<br/>
center_x = (120 * zoom)&gt;&gt;2;  //bellow the screen for the Y (about were the observer would be standing)
<br/>
<br/>
This make the rotation center bellow the screen but I'd like to make it the center of the screen for example.
<br/>
I tried changing the 180 and 120 value but it doesn't seem to do any good.
<br/>
I would appreciate some help plz ^__^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
