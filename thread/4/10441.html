    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know what's happening, but today when I went to test some of my stuff out, no$gba runs a lot slower. My stuff used to run at ~100%, but now they are running at ~68%. What's worse is that I tested backups of my work, even to the first few things I made that I knew was running smoothly, and they are being affected too. Ive closed as many background programs as I could, but it didn't help.
<br/>
<br/>
So here I come to try out a demo someone else makes (Smash Bros. Advance, for instance). That is also running slower than it used to. So, I update the no$gba version, and not only does it still run stuff as slow, but now even Modes 1 and 2 are not showing the Affine Backgrounds.
<br/>
<br/>
VisualBoyAdvance still runs normally, so any guesses on the problem? None of my other applications on my computer are affected by the slow down.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by DiscoStew on Fri Aug 25, 2006 9:20 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Maybe, but I began having slow-down problems with a version that used to run my stuff just fine. Like I said before, I even tested out back-ups of some of my older demos that were running fine, but today, those same demos are crapfully slow. I even ripped one of the games I had lying around (an offical GBA game) to test with, and it was showing the same symptons. The newer version of no$gba was doing the same thing, only Affine BGs weren't showing up either.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not on my compy that has my GBA stuff, but I'll have to try again later. It could have been some fluke with my compy that one time.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Rename your NO$GBA.INI to NO$GBA.INI.OLD and try again. If that works then mail the file to Martin and tell him about the issue.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, found out the problem. Somehow, my on-board Sound got reactivated without me realizing it, and because I then had 2 soundboards active, it messed up No$GBA's audio, making it slow down the entire emulator. Same problem also affected other things like Quicktime and Project64, but other programs were not affected. It even began affecting multiple sound programs when No$GBA was running at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have 2 soundboards/soundcards in your machine, and things get weird like 1/2 speed of audio playback and program execution, check if both of your cards are active.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've just checked, and the newest version does fix TOD.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
