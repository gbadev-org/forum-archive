    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no way to get the source code for any commercial game without contacting the author, in this case, Konami. Since Konami is a company that makes profit from the Castlevania series (and still does today), it is safe to say they will never give you the source code. They are making <span style="font-style: italic">Castlevania DS,</span> a new game, not a remake.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you want, you can try to create the game from scratch. If you do so Konami will force you to stop or face a lawsuit. Castlevania is Konami?s intellectual property and it is copyrighted. You should try to create an original game instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
