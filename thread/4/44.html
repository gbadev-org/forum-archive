1) put the pixmap image in vram

Yes, you can.  I do not use bitmap modes, but I understand that depending on the mode, it uses some of the VRAM that is also used for sprites.  Because of this, you can only use half of the sprites- the second half.  That is sprite[64] to sprite[127] if I am correct.  Take this all with a grain of salt as I do not use bitmap modes.

Let's see... looking at the memory map and some info on VRAM:

<br/>
It looks like your sprite tile data needs to start from 0x6014000.  Yes, I think you need to set your character number to 512 or higher.
