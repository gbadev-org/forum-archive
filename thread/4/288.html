Try LZ77, and then try LZ77 followed by Huffman to see if the added step provides enough coding gain to justify the speed hit.  Huffman is useful when a few colors dominate your tileset
<br/>
<br/>
If you're deciding between LZ77 and RLE, LZ77 is in general the appropriate choice.  Using RLE is like using LZ77 and limiting the window size to one byte.
<br/>
<br/>
Caution: The GBA compatible LZ77 compressor floating around on the net has a bug such that compressed data will sometimes reference data before the start of the file.  I've fixed that bug in my version of the compressor; private-message me your e-mail address if you want it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
