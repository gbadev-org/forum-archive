I can handle displaying and moving multiple backgrounds, but I'm really after some tips on how best to create and store collision data (platforms etc). Anyone have any helpful tips and tricks to share?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm up to this point as well. Too bad it's here you usually go by yourself since no other topics have been found.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't find any tools for creating collision data, you have to write one yourself. I was close to find a tool but it was not finished.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I simply decided to use tile masks. One byte is one pixel. 0 is non-solid and 1 is solid. I could have made them bitwise too but I don't really care about size.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I will use an index of angles so that you can't run up a slope as fast as you run it down.
<br/>
<br/>
And the funniest thing will be to develop 4 collision routines I will use for my enemy system so I can collide with floor, ceiling, left and right walls. Of course this is just in my mind. it's another thing writing it and making it work. I have already done the masks though :P
<br/>
<br/>
And I rather go with tables than math since the low resolution and speed of the GBA is in count, and I want it to look good and run smooth.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using the collision tiles supplied with mapEd, 0x0000's is empty/walkable space.. every other number corresponds to one of the non-empty collision tiles in maped<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
