<br/>
I have been thinking of moving my projects to DevKitARM (right now I am using DevKitAdv), but I think I remember reading somewhere on the forums that DevKitARM doesn't support interrupts or some method of using interrupts. Is that true? I was hoping to take advantage of it (my main reason is for using ".incbin" to include files easily. I am using AAS as the main audio library, with interrupt support through "AAS_MultipleInterrupts".<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Devkit arm supports interupts.  You can either write your own, find a prewritten one, or use the one on devkit.tk.  If multiple interupts are required the one on devkit.tk will not work.  Also .incbin works just fine in devkitadv last I checked. Good luck with it.  I made the switch to devkitarm and I just cut and paste the irq handler from libgba on devkit or the one from Jeffs crt0 on devr.com.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, I'll give it a try once I install all the things needed to use DevKitARM. DevKitAdv just isn't getting updated anymore, so it would probably be a good idea to switch over.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The libgba that's also on the DevkitARM site is also great for interrupts. I've just tried it this afternoon, and assigning a function to an interrupt is as simple as doing this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">SetInterrupt(Int_Timer1, AAS_Timer1InterruptHandler);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This is after 3 additional lines to enable interrupts. That particular example is now how I set up Apex to use the timer 1 interrupt.<br/>_________________<br/>The Game is Nothing.
