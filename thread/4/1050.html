    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are games like zelda etc that dont change the map background until you have hit the end of the first map. They would probably do this by an:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
if (sprite pos &gt; screen width)
<br/>
{
<br/>
  load next map
<br/>
  move sprite to the starting position
<br/>
}
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
But there are also games like pokemon etc that have all of the maps loaded next to each other and there doesnt seem to be any changeover.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any opinions on how this would be done?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If you use the wrapping option with background if you get to the end of a map whether it is up, down, left or right. You will get to the other side, kinda like if you try to get to the ends of the earth.
<br/>
<br/>
But if you change the map when a player keeps nearing the end of a map and the program loads new tiles there to make the world seem continues the player will think that he is still walking into that direction.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Until you figure out the math for arrays, yes.  After you figure out the math for arrays, and get used to it it boils down to personal preference.
