Is this done by inverting the pallete or is it some sprite thing?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are approximately 1,000,000 ways to do it, depending on the kind of visual effect you want to achieve for hilighting and what the graphical constraints on your menu system are.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you be a bit more specific?

You could do it either way.  Although using an alternate "selected" image would probably look a lot better than inverting the palette.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or by drawing a colored bar in a layer under the menu text.
<br/>
<br/>
Or by assigning each item a separate palette index and setting the selected item's color different from the others.
<br/>
<br/>
Or by using two 16-color palettes and drawing selected items in one and unselected items in another.
<br/>
<br/>
Or by using code triggered on vcount to change either a particular palette color or the blending registers on scanlines that contain a selected item.
<br/>
<br/>
Or by using two layers, one with selected images and one with unselected images, and using a window to show and hide them.
<br/>
<br/>
Could you draw a mock-up of the precise effect you want?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, ultimately I would like to play a small wav drop as the
<br/>
selection is changed.  So I guess my only constraint is that the
<br/>
highlighting be fast to leave time for other processing.

<br/>
For those of you that have ever seen a Tivo, thats a good example of
<br/>
nice clean simple menu interface.  BTW, for those of you that dont,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For an interface like what I saw on the TiVo site, you'll probably want to put the text in one layer and the borders and highlights in a second layer.

<br/>
If you're already running a mixer, such as to play your game's background music, then adding another channel to play keypress sounds probably won't take too much more CPU time.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <h4>#23820 - MumblyJoe - Thu Jul 22, 2004 7:08 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Best way I have found is to draw a menu up in whatever graphical program you use, make each selection a different color, convert it to a .cpp/.h file using whatever tool you use, edit the palette so that all the colors you used for selections are all the same color, then you can fade in and out selections etc just by changing a single 16 bit integer.

I know this is a VERY old technique, but I actually came up with it myself before I had ever heard of it so I like to pretend I invented it :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
