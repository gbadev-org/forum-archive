My question right now is, how do I make a non-static game?
<br/>
<br/>
In a shooter, for instance, how do I make it so that each bullet my ship fires doesn't have to be a sprite defined by me with an x and y value which are variables I defined. In other words, I'm tired of making programs where you are a smiley face and the only thing you can bump into are the edges of the screen, and when you press A you lay a little black circle, and it's not even a game... I'd like to be able to say "create 4 enemies for me using the behavior I have provided here" "shoot a bullet every time the player hits the A button" and "Test collision between all bullets and enemies using the function I provided", instead of "Draw background. Box_x1=50 Box_x2=70 Box_y1=0 Box_y2=40, if(ship_x+spaceshipwidth=blah blah collision detection with a box that doesn't even move)"... Ever stumbled across this kind of problem?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm learning to program on my own and I have reached a limit with both ASM and C. I have ideas but they are limited by my ignorance of something that may be simple. It feels like being able to play guitar and only after months of frustration you learn the existence of chords and you can't really figure out what they are unless someone shows you.. (I have this problem for every other system I tried coding for. But now I've identified the problem and I may be able to go forward if someone can help me.)

Thanks for any help, directions to interesting commented sources or tutorials. I love you :P<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.kiwibonga.com" target="_blank">http://www.kiwibonga.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
