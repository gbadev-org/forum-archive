<br/>
<br/>
I've been pondering on the question for quite a while now, but the more I think about it, the more I realize it isnt't as trivial as I thought. I'd like to write a GBA app that turns it into a general, configurable GCN controller (due to the fact that the former has less buttons) using the link cable. I thought it would make for a sweet introductory link port project, but as I gathered the required documentation, it seems like I'll need a hand with this after all.
<br/>
<br/>
What comm mode should I use, UART? How do I answer the controller probe sequence, since the GCN sends 8 low bits followed by a high stop bit (9 bits in all)? Does the link cable have a circuit that takes care of that? Perhaps someone has already done that before? Is this possible at all?
<br/>
<br/>
Alright, that's enough questions for now. Thanks for any help!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Here's where I got the GCN controller protocol: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.int03.co.uk/crema/hardware/gamecube/gc-control.htm" target="_blank">http://www.int03.co.uk/crema/hardware/gamecube/gc-control.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awww, come on, I can't be the only one to have thought of that? There gotta be someone out there either as curious or as cheap as I am! Making a rom that lets you map your GBA buttons to GCN ones shouldn't be that difficult...

No one interested in joining forces for this project? &lt;:/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe the GBA hardware has some sort of "JOYBUS mode" that handles the ADB/N64/GCN style pulse-width modulation for you. Has this been cracked?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, yeah, I do remember reading about JOYBUS somewhere. Thanks a lot for the tip, I'll have look in that direction.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, for those interested in the GBA internals, the no$gba emulator documentation is THE way to go. There's an awesome lot of tasty info in there. But again, I suppose most of you already knew that. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Later!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
