    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, and thanks for reading my post!
<br/>
<br/>
I've been using Notepad to write my code, and I'm sure SOMEone's cringing right about now, understandably... understandibly... I can't spell, but I can tell why they're cringing.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't tell what freaking line I'm on without commenting every ten lines (which is a pain when I add a function), or scrolling from the top, counting as I go, so I can never tell where these errors DevKitAdvance is giving me are.  (Was that proper english just now?  Eh...)
<br/>
<br/>
Does SOMEone know of a text editor that shows what line you're on?  Even better, one that will color-code my code?  (I.E. Black for comments, green for variables, light blue for function names, that sort of thing?)  I would be greatful!  And you can smack me if I've overlooked something really simple, too.  Stupid people deserved to be smacked!  :-P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Vi is a good editor to learn how to use, since it is available on practically every modern platform out there.  If you want to easily move into the Vi world I suggest you try gVim.  It's Vi improved with a gui; and the price is right.

poslundc: vim is not vi, ya know =) vi is an antique, which vim is capable of pretending to be if you invoke it as 'vi'. vim has cscope-powered source browsing, make/gcc integration, a choice of four scripting languages (python, perl, tcl or ruby), and generally has more functionality than any other editor that's not emacs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The version of vi on the linux machine I use color codes things.  These days you can use the arrow keys in vi.  I'll admit that the hjkl deal works better if your keyboard uses the standard qwerty setup.
<br/>
<br/>
This may not be helping, but I hated vi when I first started to use it.  Almost all of my friends that have used it don't like it.  I strictly use vi and notepad to write my code.  I switch to vi when I need to jump to a given line.  Opening cygwin and cd-ing to the proper place is annoying enough that I start writing my code in notepad.

There is a config option as to whether invoking it as 'vi' causes it to run as vim, or in vi emulation - the default is to emulate vi, but most distribution's default config contains 'set nocompatible' which stops it from crippling itself whatever it's invoked as. =)
<br/>
I know they work with the arrow keys too, but I like hjkl, so stick with those. You can always remap them if you have a different keyboard layout. I use vim as an IDE, almost; it runs my compiler, it matches up error output to the line it occurs on, it does symbol-based source browsing, it highlights, it completes symbol names.. some of this by default, some with the help of obscure and poorly documented options, and some by scripting, but it all works. =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you have the ISBN for a good book on vi/vim?  Failing or in addition to that, do you have a link to an FAQ or a tutorial of sorts?

The search function can handle regexp and ofcourse replaces to. I'm not sure but i think that the tools you can setup yourself are slightly limited from those you can make in EditPlus.

I've definetly tried my share of editors (pico, vi, emacs, notepad, bbedit, codewarior, NEdit, jEdit, etc, etc, etc).  I finally settled on vim about 3 years ago.  It's cross platform (I actually started using it under Win2k), it's lightweight, it's fast, it's almost always available, it has color syntax highlighting, it runs without a GUI (great for when you have to telnet/ssh into a machine remotely), and more.  Currently, I use it on WinXP machines at work, MacOS X machines at home and at work, and Linux machines at home and work.  And it always just works right :)  I highly recommend it.

This doesn't mean it's *bad*, though - it's about equivalent to most other C/C++ IDEs at present. I've not found any significant things that, say, Visual Studio can do that Eclipse can't.
<br/>
<br/>
Eclipse's editors are supposed to understand the semantic content of the code you are editing. That's what makes it so powerful - it gives you code completion that actually works 100% perfectly, and allows refactoring and very clever browsing. It also allows you to identify most compile errors while you are still editing. No other IDE that I've used can do this. The C/C++ editor in Eclipse also can't really do this yet. It does support debugging via a GDB stub well, which makes it much more useful than most other IDEs (which can typically only debug native code).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have tried DevC++ a couple of times, but each time I have given up because I found the build process too restrictive.
<br/>
I want more control over the makefile!
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to modify the build other than just defining the all_before and all_after targets?
<br/>
how do you factor in arm/thumb interworking into the build?
<br/>
how do you do the same for asm files?
<br/>
Even just overriding the auto makefile system with a custom makefile would be a useable solution, but I havn't found a way to do that either...
<br/>
<br/>
If you can solve these issues for me I might just switch to DevC++ ;)
<br/>
If these things are not possible without clunky work-arounds then, IMO DevC++ isn't ready for gba development yet.
<br/>

*shrugs* I use that for my Windows code.  As I said earlier, I use other editors when I use a different compiler.
