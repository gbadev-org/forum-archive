    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm trying to sort out a way to upgrade my old EZFlash 3 to be like an EZFlash 4, but the only thing I can't figure out is how the GBACrusherCL program manages to compress the GBA ROMs into the EZTeam's so called "LZ7" format. I know that this implies LZ77 compression, and have found the command -l in the EZ3Manager with a hex editor (the -l flag on GBACrusherCL denotes LZ77) However, when I try to do this myself both with console version and the GUI version, it says there will not be enough room in the GBA RAM. Perhaps I'm reading into this too much and GBA Crusher is not actually how the EZ3 compresses ROMs? Anyway, any help with this matter would be much appreciated.

Hmm... right before posting, I noticed a .dll in the EZManager folder named zlib.dll, maybe this could be how it actually does it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
