    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good day ones again... (I feel like a bother to you guys now &gt;_&lt;)
<br/>
<br/>
Well you guys might still remember me because of my other newbie questions. but now I got some other kind of problem and asked around who I know that programmed for the gba before but they didnt have an diea either...
<br/>
<br/>
first things first. <a class="postlink" href="http://schoolshit.servehttp.com/gba/throw_to_grow.gba" target="_blank">here</a> is an image of the game I am working on.
<br/>
<br/>
Now on first run it might look normal... But as soon as you have shot one seed (you do this by clicking with A button on the seed. then Aim and press A again). and would turn on rapid A or just hit A a few times you notice that ones in awhile the screen will shake. the more seeds you shoot the more the screen will shake. I wondered if any of you had any idea what might be the cause of this weird problem. Thanks in advance and just PM or post here for more information ^^[/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">VBA says the game uses mode 2 (two rotation backgrounds). If you change the scroll values of a rotation background during draw time, you'll get shaking. If you are not using HDMA to the rot/scale registers, make sure to write to the scroll values only once per frame.
<br/>
<br/>
I also notice that the sprite clipping is a bit screwed up. A sprite in X=-32 through X=-1 should be drawn as X=480 through X=511.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks allot I just noticed the one that did the scrolling did it several times.
<br/>
<br/>
But that leaves me with another question. after a few seeds the shaking gets so bad the game just crashes entirely. I wonder will that be ficed the same way or might there be something else wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My guess, your program has a bunch of small bugs that add up and or one big one.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried aging you program?  Ie, you leave it one for a long time (overnight).  This will catch memory leaks or other things that accumulate during time without human intervention.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't try that yet. But it only happens after you shot a seed. and a plant grew out of it. but I will leave it on tonight to test. thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is one of the reasons why an order of progression is recommended. There is far too much to encounter for the first time on something this big. You appear to have good initiative which is helping you to achieve a lot in one go, but remember that less is more and worse is better!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I can't help it much to be exact this is a school assignment and they expect us to get a working demo. We worked with 5 people on it. We are already passed the deadline and got 3 weeks extra to clean the code and to optimise it. But now the teacher mailed. and expects us to hand it in before friday... I like to do this. But allot of messy code came from the rushing in the end and it didnt help that I was sick when adding everything togheter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
