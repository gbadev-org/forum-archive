<br/>
<br/>
I've read that you should only have a single cygwin1.dll on your system at any time. Just recently I installed devkits for the DC, gp32, and gc. I'm having several errors now when compiling project for the gp and gc that seem cyg related.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, when I try to run the gp32 as and gcc, I get a load of errors like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">C:\WINDOWS\DESKTOP\CONSOLEDEV\GP32\DEVKIT\LIB\GCC-LIB\ARM-AGB-ELF\3.0.2\CC1PLUS.EXE: *** You have multiple copies of cygwin1.dll on your system.
<br/>
Search for cygwin1.dll using the Windows Start-&gt;Find/Search facility
<br/>
and delete all but the most recent version.Â  This will probably be
<br/>
the one that resides in x:\cygwin\bin, where 'x' is the drive on which
<br/>
you have installed the cygwin distribution.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I have not installed the full cygwin distribution, I just have the .dll(s) that came with their respective devkits, and I'm a bit nervous about deleting and of them, as they are all different sizes and dates (I don't want to break anything)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when I try to compile gamecube code I get a number of errors like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">A dialog "The AS.EXE file is linked to missing export CYGWIN1.DLL:asprintf"
<br/>
<br/>
and "The CC1.EXE file is linked to missing export CYGWIN1.DLL:asprintf" </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, my command window gives a host of the idential error for each call to AS or CC1 
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">POWERP~8: installation problem, connot exec 'cygdrive/c/DEVKIT~2/BIN/../lib/gcc-lib/powerpc-eabi-elf/3.3/cc1.exe': Permission denied </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If I choose only one cygwin1.dll how do I know which one or where it should reside? Could someone advise me on the propper management of cygwin versions?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
