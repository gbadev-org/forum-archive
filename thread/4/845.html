I'm getting to grips with sprites and tiles but I am having trouble setting up looping tunes. I've seen lots of examples that have foreground while loops checking for timers to expire but I'm not sure how to run those checks in the background.

<br/>
Any examples / comments would be really helpful, cheers,
<br/>
