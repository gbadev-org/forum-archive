    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After a long time of research and some help from a friend who actually had the wireless adapter, I can say that Digimon racing Wireless multiplayer works in an emulator:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sweet.  I'm not suprised you got ours working and not pokemon as I pretty much wrote our own code to keep them in sync.  When I was doing this code, Nintendo didn't have a usable API yet for this type of game :)
<br/>
<br/>
Well done.  Can't wait to grab it and use it as we're doing another wireless game now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have to tell you, you did an outstanding job on the linking code. I accidentally ran one emulator at 100% and the other at 50% and they still didn't disconnect and worked!
<br/>
<br/>
btw, did you also write the cable connection code (all the dead beef etc.)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have one more question about the adapter (I hope it's the type you are allowed to answer): How many bytes can be transmitted at once? You use up to 80, is that the max, or can it go as high as 1020??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#44316 - Miked0801 - Tue May 31, 2005 7:55 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">:)  At what level do you mean?  The adaptor itself is still communicating through the serial port so at the lowest level it's still only doing 2 bytes at a time.  Where are you getting 80 from?  We have an API built on top of both the Serial and RFU that accumulates and does packet checking, but at the lowest levels, it's based on 2 bytes.  
<br/>
<br/>
(Again, the very lowest level of the RFU is hidden from developers so you probably know more about how it works there than I do.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">4 bytes, but that doesn't matter (uses 32 normal mode) :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I mean at the level where the Gameboy who chose Host race sends 80 bytes per command (I don't think you know the values, but it's command 0x25). It's 0x14 words</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
