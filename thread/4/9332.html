    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on an editor in Visual BASIC and i'd like to make an export function and have it export an BIO compatible RLE compressed file. I know that most of you will probably flame me for coding in VB but if anyone happens to have a BIOs compatatible UnRlComp function in VB could you please show it to me any help is appreciated it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off, do you know the basic concept behind run-length encoding? You need your program to take a byte array, recognize all runs of three-in-a-row pr more of one 8-bit symbol and "literal strings" (runs of no three-in-a-rows), and then output all such runs.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#biosdecompressionfunctions" target="_blank">GBATEK</a> says that the RLUncomp data stream starts with 1 byte of constant value 30 hex, then 3 bytes representing the length in bytes of uncompressed data (in little endian).
<br/>
<br/>
For a literal string of 1 to 128 bytes, write n - 1 followed by the bytes.
<br/>
For a run of 3 to 130 copies of a repeated byte, write n + 125 followed by the byte which shall be repeated.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
