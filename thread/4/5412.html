<br/>
EZ-FLASH team has released their source code and SDK to the net. what a amazing move of a hardmaker.
<br/>
The package has a document and full source code of EZ3 loader, I think we can write some apps with the great power of EZ-FLASH3.  because there has 16Mbytes RAM on EZ-FLASH3, the SDK show us the way to control the RAM. more things can do with such a big RAM, not 384Kbytes any more.
<br/>
<br/>
Sign up EZ-FLASH forum at <a href="http://www.ezflash.cn/english/vbb" target="_blank">http://www.ezflash.cn/english/vbb</a> and visit EZ3 development forum to get the SDK package.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
