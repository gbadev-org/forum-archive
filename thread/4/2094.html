<br/>
I had just downloaded the demo "political statement" of gbadevs demo list and watched a bit in vba. Oh yes! A great demo i thought. have to watch that on hardware. No sir'o. It locks up after the second scene has runned for about 1-2 seconds. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, have anyone tried this on hardware? Did it lockup too? If it didn't what kind of gba do you have?
<br/>
<br/>
Mine is a gba sp. I?m probebly just a a bit paranoid now, but it feels like this might be a problem with my gba ;). So please help me out here. Cause this is a realy great demo, that should be enjoyed on the real thing!
<br/>
<br/>
Also sorry if this is in the wrong section, I couldn't decide where to post it...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It worked fine for me, but I don't have an SP.  The sad thing is I think the music was synchronized for an emulator, so the video lags a bit on actual hardware.  Still a nice piece of work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
