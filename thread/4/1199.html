    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you realised that an RPG might be a bit too much for you, why not make a different genre? Or if you really want to make an RPG, keep it very limited: Not a huge world, just a couple of screens, no incredibly advanced point system, no trillion different fighting moves... Once you actually done you small RPG, you can then decide whether to expand it and add things to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't start with an RPG. At first i thought it would be easy because the gameplay itself is quite simple (you just walk around and hit people with a sword or something). But now i though about it, it's way too advanced for me because there is just too much you have to do for an RPG.
<br/>
<br/>
I will probably start making a simpler game when i get an idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think a small 'puzzle/card' game type is best to start. You get to learn a lot from it without being swamped by too much problems all at once.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yea, I'm making an RPG, and it is a lot more work than it seems. The engine programming itself isn't that hard, but making a map editor, and editors for all your character/monster data and stuff takes a while. Then after all that's done, the amount of maps and stuff you need for a full game is the real challenge. Unless you're planning to do a short story, or are more into the making of the game than the programming, an RPG is a bad idea.
<br/>
The engine part is really fun if you're a beginner though, since it's pretty straightforward and you learn a lot when you're not stuck on little things all the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
So i haven't started any rpg projects on the gba, while i am still
<br/>
working one in flash (a had little one written, with silly gfx) and
<br/>
now i am making a small one with a good story etc..
<br/>
