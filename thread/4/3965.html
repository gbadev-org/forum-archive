    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">everything about my demo works quite well, except that when you scroll along the map, the screen flickers and gets sort of sliced up. see for yourself: <a class="postlink" href="http://jacklu0.tripod.com/demo.zip" target="_blank">http://jacklu0.tripod.com/demo.zip</a>
<br/>
use the directional pad to scroll around the map
<br/>
It really isn't that bad except when you scroll vertically and horizontaly at the same time. is it just my crappy computer or is there something wrong with my code?
<br/>
thanks for your thoughts</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You wait until it's over? You are supposed to wait until it has started!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I think it's a problem with your dynamic map update code. It seems to be updating tiles on parts of the screen that can still be seen. That's the only reason I could determine anyway...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm sure the map update code doesn't write anything where you can see it. I've been messing around with my demo and I found that some of my code for updating various things in the demo is run every frame, which is much too often, so i removed it from my main loop. That helped, though there is still a lot of flickering. Could the problem be that my code that i execute each frame is too slow?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
