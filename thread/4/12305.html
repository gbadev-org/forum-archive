    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like some help with my background scrolling.
<br/>
Firts some information. We have map sizes the size of 256x256.
<br/>
We are trying to make the screen 6 times such a map
<br/>
<br/>
map-1 map-3 map-5
<br/>
map-0 map-2 map-4
<br/>
<br/>
so if I want to move from map-0 to area map-1 area map-2 or area map-3. I would need to slowly load those parts in. also when I want to move from those back to map-0.
<br/>
<br/>
Could you give me an example script how I could do that. I am using a rotating background (background nr.2) in mode 2. Thanks for your time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
