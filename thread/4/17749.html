What is the best method for recording keys which have been held down? I'm thinking that it would be using a timer to count "key down" and "key release", but I've got the dilemma of finding an equivalent &lt;ctime&gt; library for the gba</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can keep time by counting frames.  The GBA runs at 59.737 frames per second, but people usually refer to it as "60" frames per second.
<br/>
<br/>
To find out what the current frame number is, you need to do that yourself.  Create a Vblank interrupt handler, and increment a variable once per frame.  Something like this:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">volatile u32 frame_number;
<br/>
void MyVblankHandler()
<br/>
{
<br/>
...
<br/>
frame_number++;
<br/>
...
<br/>
}
<br/>
irqSet(IRQ_VBLANK, MyVblankHandler);
<br/>
irqEnable(IRQ_VBLANK);</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Then you look at frame_number to find out what frame number you're on.
<br/>
This is a 32-bit int value, so it can count up to 4.294 billion frames (828 days) before it overflows back to zero.
<br/>
<br/>
So to determine how long a key has been held down:
<br/>
* Need to know the start time of it first becoming pressed.
<br/>
* Need to know invalidate the start time if it has become released.
<br/>
* Need to know current time, and whether the key is currently pressed or not.
<br/>
Then you subtract "now" from "then", and you have the number of frames the key has been held down.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
