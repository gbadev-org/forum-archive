    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody.
<br/>
This is my first post, and of course, it is to require your help :-)
<br/>
<br/>
For the moment, I use the GCC compiler in version 3.2.2 to make my GBA projects. Until there all goes well. 
<br/>
Except that today I need to use the 'MusicPlayer2000' from the Nintendo SDK. This tool requires to link 2 libraries provided in the Nintendo SDK:
<br/>
"libagbsyscall.a" and "libagbsyscall_arm.alf". 
<br/>
But the GCC linker did not recognize the ALF format.
<br/>
<br/>
Is somebody already encountered this problem?
<br/>
Do you have a trick to solve this trouble?
<br/>
<br/>
In advance, thank you very much for your help !<br/>_________________<br/>--

If libagbsyscall is what I think it is, then try libgba from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkit.tk/" target="_blank">devkitARM</a> instead.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I apologize for the oversight. It's a legal issue, and I assumed everybody knew that it was self-evident, like the rule against trading commercial ROMs. I'm adding the relevant bits to the FAQ.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I guess I was a bit harsh about it. But still, it's hard to avoid "inadvertently post[ing] any intricacies of the kit's code" when you discuss the Nintendo SDK.

<br/>
One difference here is that making a ROM dump of a Game Pak that you purchased at retail is lawful in the United States, as 17 USC 117 provides a narrow exemption to copyright, but the only way one can gain lawful access to the Nintendo SDK is through a non-disclosure agreement. NDAs involve trade secret law, which does not enter the question in the case of reverse-engineering a ROM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I found a solution to circumvent the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to have caused all these problems.
<br/>
I would like to add that my ******** SDK is an official version: -)
<br/>
And that my question related rather to the support of file format by compilers independent of ********.  ARM SDT is not a ******** product.  It is (was) used to develop on several ARM-based platforms.  And the ALF format is created by ARM, not by ********.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, thanls for your help !<br/>_________________<br/>--

Assuming you mean that you are using it legaly..
<br/>
well, that means you must be an officially licenced developer right ? so you should be asking on the official website for officially licenced developers where you will get much better info than you will here right ?
