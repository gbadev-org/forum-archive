Gbatek isn't clear enough on this, it doesn't match the behavior under VBA and NO$.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Translation: Window 0 is in front of window 1, which is in front of object window, which is in front of window outside. For pixels that fall inside both window 0 and window 1, the GBA uses the window 0 settings.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, but I'm not getting that effect in VBA, I'm getting an OR effect instead.
