    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Nintendo pokemon/digimon adaptor is definately NOT using a standard API for its stuff.  The majeco one emulates the GBA serial adaptor and may be easier to work with.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to build your own link cable, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.reinerziegler.de/GBA/gba.htm#cart%20reader" target="_blank">follow this link</a> and find the download for a piece of software that lets you use your GBA as a PC joypad.  Alternatively, you could use a Flash2Advance USB linker cable.  If you go on this route, delete or rename the original gba_boot.bix file and rename gba_boot_f2a_lmt.bix to gba_boot.bix before launching the program.  Upon launching, you might hear a Windows sound that indicates that a USB device has been unplugged.  Wait until you hear the sound indicating that it's been plugged in before continuing.  
<br/>
<br/>
It will send a small multiboot program to the GBA that will send button presses to the PC over the link cable.  I have had success using this on my GBA with a F2A linker cable, used in combination with Joy2Key.  I must say, it is rather run controlling my mouse cursor with the GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
