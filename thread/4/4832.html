You can make one with line drawing and fixed point sine table. However there is no way to set the clock to the right time as far as I know. I would always begin the clock at mid-night. And drawing with lines would work best in mode 3. In mode 4 you need to write two pixels at once.
<br/>
<br/>
I would be able to do a clock pretty fast since I have a line drawing fuction and circle drawing function in mode 4. If I only had time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
An "alarm" might be tricky, as the GBA can't ring an alarm while it's turned off, and it eats a lot of battery power while it's turned on, even if you use battery-saving techniques such as VBlankIntrWait() and running all your code from EWRAM rather than from ROM.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Why?
<br/>
<br/>
The RTC interface is the same on all flashcarts with Pokemon compatible RTCs. I think that includes all RTC flashcarts except the EZ which for some weird reason use their own RTC and patch the Pokemon RTC library to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
How to read the RTC:

I am assuming that the clock in the cart is accessible, what he does right now is plug the GBA in, and on the menu for the rom games there is a little digital clock. He keeps that running all night.
<br/>
<br/>
I have it packed up, but I believe I have the "EZ" type flash device, so maybe it's a little harder than I thought... I just got internet back after our move, so I will look around a little today.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and any additionial thoughts or assistance will be appreciated.
