    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd say I'm astonished that there are people who expect others to provide them with all the answers, without showing any desire to learn independently... but I'm really not astonished.  Some people are just like that.
<br/>
<br/>
When I read questions that the poster could have answered for themselves by following one of the various tutorials, or looking it up in the usual docs, I assume that the poster will return again each time they encounter an issue of similar difficulty.  To prevent a flood of such questions, the usual response is a link to the answer.
<br/>
<br/>
Most people who answer questions here don't care to duplicate all the existing documentation, but we often assist with issues that have unclear or incomplete documentation, or help with problems that are beyond the scope of generic GBA docs.
<br/>
<br/>
If somebody provides you with a link to the document that provides the exact answer you were looking for, and you ignore it and repeat your question (and then proceed to complain about the person who helped you for free), that's really rude and ungrateful.  If you don't understand the docs, paste the part you don't understand and ask about it, but save the attitude.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

True, but screaming "You should not have asked for a fish! How dare you even think to ask!" as happens a lot on message boards, solves nothing and only aggrivates everyone.  And in all honesty, a lot of the messages that get flamed are "Teach me how to fish" posts rather than "Give me a fish" posts.
<br/>
<br/>
This has become somewhat of a pet peeve of mine lately: The whole "RTFM" mentality just has no place on a message board - in fact it largely defeats the purpose.  If a person can't ask a question on a message board without getting flamed for simply *asking* then why even have message boards?  Just for the "community"?  Community is certainly a big aspect, but if it were the only purpose they'd only have one forum: the "Lounge" or "Offtopic" forums.
<br/>
<br/>
The way I like to sum it up is: "Whoever said 'it never hurts to ask' has obviously never been on the internet."  There shouldn't be anything wrong with asking: even the biggest RTFM-zealots occasionally overlook a FAQ entry or prior discussion by mistake.  There's really no need to get nasty about it: If you know the answer, just say it.  Don't pretend you're "helping them to learn" by chastising them for asking instead of looking up.  If they'd rather be given fish than learn to fish, that's their choice and you're not doing anyone any favors by complaining about their choice.  And if you don't want someone wasting your time because they chose to be social and ask their question instead of going solo, THEN JUST DON'T RESPOND!  Your precious time and energy won't be wasted if you ignore their post - nobody's forcing you to respond!
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this tends to be particularly bad with newbies.  Newbies don't know when they're asking a stupid question, they don't know the right places to go to find the right info, they have major misconceptions about things because after all, they are newbies.  This is worst kind of person for us to flame: the person that just DOESN'T know better, and has no reason why they SHOULD know better.  Therefore, we should *inform* them instead of complaining that they don't know things that they really don't have any way of knowing.  Look at it this way: There probably isn't a single person on this board that wasn't the "how do I make doom?" kid at one time.  I know I've done my share of stupid things: like trying to compile a basic program by renaming the extention to exe, or believing I could create a 3D FPS by myself that supported true curved surfaces and destructable environments (long before Red Faction) even though I hadn't even completed a simple Asteroids or Space Invaders.  When you see these "uninformed newbie" posts, keep in mind you were once like them. (BTW, I'm not singling out the gbadev forums, in fact this tends to be the tamest of the boards I visit - one of the reasons I keep hanging around so much :) )
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I got into more of a rant than I meant to, so my point is just this: It's a game development message board, It's for helping each other out, Ask a question and - if somebody knows the answer - get an answer.  If you don't like answering questions, or if you feel everyone should just figure all their own problems out for themselves, then you really have no business being on a game development message board.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you're referring to me, in which case I think it's only fair to quote the space-consuming post I made in response to your query:

<br/>
<br/>
This links directly to the simplest, most direct answer to your question you could have possibly desired. I even indexed into the part of the document that specifically referred to your question for you.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of using the source I provided, you asked again, and had to have the answer spoonfed to you.
<br/>
<br/>
Now you are apparently upset that I tried to convince you to read what the link had to say for yourself, that it was a worthwhile document and could save you the trouble of not only this question but plenty of questions you will doubtlessly have in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Please clarify who is supposed to be astonished in this scenario.
<br/>
<br/>
Abscissa: I've not known anyone of repute on this board to flame anyone else for asking a newbie question. Often we point people to documents that contain their answers; this is not a rebuke. Those documents exist so that people can use them, refer to them and learn from them. At the same time, if newbies choose to ignore the assistance they are given, then they are the ones being destructive to the community.
<br/>
<br/>
I am grateful to the people on this board who have helped me to become a competent GBA programmer. The only thing more difficult for me to fathom than being dissatisfied with a good source for an answer to my question is getting upset at the people who try to provide me with it.

Right, I never said that it wasn't.  Like I said, I'm just speaking in the general sense. I think some of the posts in this thread were referring to something specific, but I wasn't.

Again, I agree.  But that was kind of my point, it's a technical forum so we should be able to ask questions and get answers otherwise it becomes nothing more than a disfunctional social forum.  When I mentioned people "choosing to be social instead of going solo" I was merely implying that asking someone a technical question is more social than googling everything.  Not that googling everything is bad, it's not, I was just trying to place some value in the act of asking.  ie Even if it's better to figure things out on your own, asking at least has the value of being somewhat social, so it's not all that bad to ask something once in a while.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Once someone has goten the hang of using technical specs such as the Cowbite and gbatrek (?) then they start to rely less on the 'problem-&gt;question-&gt;answer' scenrio for every problem and more on self ability. (Well, that is what happened to me during a project)
