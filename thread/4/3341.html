    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">$960! That is a lot of money. But I guess for a professional, it could be a great investment. Anyways, does it work with VBA for debugging? And can you write CPP programs? It only mentioned C. I might check it out if it can do what I need it to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't need a plugin for GBA development; just install the Eclipse CDT (the C dev toolkit) and tell it to use your ARM version of gcc/binutils.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eclipse is a universal toolplatform which means that you can develop nearly anything with it as long as there is a plugin. The Eclipse Platform just offers a general interface for plugins.
<br/>
CDT is a C/C++ Plugin for Eclipse and it works pretty well in the new version. The C/C++ Plugin use mainly Makefiles, so you can develop with any kind of compiler.
<br/>
There is also a way with CDT to debug within the Eclipse workbench by using VBA with GDB. There are already some topics about the debugging stuff in here.
<br/>
<br/>
If you wanna find out more about Eclipse just visit <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">http://www.eclipse.org</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to use Eclipse i suggest using the newses Milstone of the 3rd Version of Eclipse: Eclipse M8. The code completion works pretty well in this version even if there are still some problems.
