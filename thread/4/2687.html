    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you can find my game project on <a href="http://www.dernierage.com/gba/artworks/JEUX.gba" target="_blank">http://www.dernierage.com/gba/artworks/JEUX.gba</a> as you will see I need assistance from a graphic point of view and all your suggestions to improve the game 
<br/>
<br/>
to play game :
<br/>
Arrows for movements 
<br/>
A to speak  to the characters
<br/>
L and R to decrease the characters-control-timer  (to increase their velocity)
<br/>
<br/>
press A in front of the tree you will open the brown block in the south and you will have access to another map
<br/>
it's for moment the only part of adventure coded ( I know, I'm sorry but it's just a sample to test the program's capacities)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's a nice little engine you've got going there. Maps, collisions, animated sprites, scripted character behaviour, sprite z-ordering, text display, etc. Unless you've been using someone else's library, all of that stuff takes considerable time to develop.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not really a game yet, though, is it? Have you thought at all about what you want to <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> with it?
<br/>
<br/>
I see you have a bit of a story posted on your webpage. Maybe if you start thinking about what you want the actual gameplay to be like, it will be easier to figure out where to go next.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things to think about:
<br/>
<br/>
- Battle engine (this is a big one)
<br/>
- Music
<br/>
- Variable-width text (instead of the monospace text you're using)
<br/>
- A second map-layer (so you can have buildings, etc. that the sprites can walk behind)
<br/>
<br/>
You should probably start thinking about the battle engine. This is often the most complicated part of the game!
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks ,
<br/>
<br/>
all library are mine exept the DMA and timer initialisation stuff which come from The pern project .
<br/>
<br/>
I've already begin the battle engine. It will be a sort of real time tactic batlle engine but for the moment it's just a real time bug engine.
<br/>
<br/>
For music engine I have to work very hard because I don't understand anything so if you have some advice they will be well come.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand what you mine when you say "Variable-width text ".
<br/>
If it's about the free space in front of the text it's reserved to put the character picture but I haven't got time to draw one.
<br/>
<br/>
And the second map-layer is already here you can see it when you walk behind the tree (it's not a sprite)
<br/>
<br/>
And I see your pseudo 3d-engien it's very impressive but I don't understand what you mine by "It combines the Mode 7 technique with raycasting". Where do you use raycasting?
<br/>
I ask you this because I want to do the same world view to go between twon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think by variable text width he means the spacing between each letter.

<br/>
<br/>
I already code this but I take pokemon capital letters which are all the same size so you can't see it. But when someone will help me (please) for graphics it will be done. 
<br/>
<br/>
LOst? the tree doesn't enter the Z-ordering o_o!(it's on 2 bgs)

<br/>
Wow, you engine or code looks really good. Care to share it with me...
<br/>
Joking, but if you want to, you can. Anyway, I am not really one to critisze, it looks good.
<br/>
<br/>
Things that just didn't seem right:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Sprite against sprite collision seems a little off. Maybe you were going for the Golden Sun style collision, where it only check the bottom half? You only check if the bottom row of OAM tiles are colliding, I instead would check the bottom half.
<br/>
<br/>
That's all, thats how good it is. Maybe you can point me in the direction of where you got those sprites. Or if you made them yourself, can you tell me how?<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, but I have already looked at those. The thing is that I can draw a picture, scan it and color it and it comes out well when its a background picture (240x160) but the limitations on sprites makes it hard to do anything.
<br/>
<br/>
The sprites on that site tell you how to make a standard 16x16 sprite with about 1/4 of it pure black, kind of making it look bland. I was aiming for something of Golden Sun quality, but i failed horribly.
<br/>
<br/>
My code base still isn't finsihed yet, so I'll think about how to do it for a while.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

#define SpriteCollision(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4) ((x3)&lt;(x2))&amp;&amp;((x4)&gt;(x1))&amp;&amp;((y3)&lt;(y2))&amp;&amp;((y4)&gt;(y1))

here is sprite collision macro it's juste a test of collision between two square 
<br/>
<br/>
x1,y1 x2,y2 is the 8 height bottom rect  of the 1st sprite
<br/>
x3,y3 x4,y4 is the 8 height bottom rect  of the 2nd sprite

Compliments your works appear very very good and interesting, about music why you do not consider to use Krawall sound system or AMP ??? There are many good sound system available for GBA check...
