<br/>
<br/>
Here is the C source code : <a href="http://soft.vub.ac.be/~jceuppen/games/gameboyadvance/dwarrendelf-src.tgz" target="_blank">http://soft.vub.ac.be/~jceuppen/games/gameboyadvance/dwarrendelf-src.tgz</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good job with what you have so far.  A couple comments:
<br/>
<br/>
-For a full game of this sort, you'll really want to use one of tiled background modes with sprites instead of a bitmap mode.  The bitmap modes really aren't the best way to do what you're doing.  Render the background as tiles, and the main character and enemies as sprites.  Suddenly your flicker issues will go away.  It takes a little more work, planning, and understanding of the gba video hardware, but it's worth it.
<br/>
<br/>
-Don't crosspost all over the forums like this.  Once is enough.  Since it's a gba demo, the DS homebrew announcements really aren't the best place.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
