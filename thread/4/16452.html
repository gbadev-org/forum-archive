I know it would be difficult of course if it's possible, but I have some ambitions to make something more complex than a simple game or what not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Quality. I don't plan to sell anything. I just want something with that quality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes.  So far as I can tell, all of the higher end titles are including them these days.  I know people who believe that games will not sell without CG sequences.  The real answer to your question depends on exactly what you consider a commerical quality title.
<br/>
<br/>
Commercial level demos are doable.  Think 6 months to a year.  If you want to flesh it out into a full game, you either need to spend more time making levels or find people to do that work for you while you are working on other parts of the game.  The main difference between a properly made (extendable) demo and a full game is the amount of content.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well... there are a few nostalgic games I want to remake to the best of my ability as to not let the flame die out. SNES games like Lufia II I mean. I'd like to try and remake at least some extent of it for GBA or possibly NDS if I'm up for learning NDS's enhancements.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From a technical standpoint, there are no problems.  From a practical standpoint, you'll need to limit the scope of your game if you want to finish it, or find a lot of help.
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect animation sequences and quality mulit unit communications in games are beyond the scope of hobbyist developers.  Even if there are libraries to handle the details, these things take lots of time for different reasons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've read the tutorials and all.... I suppose homebrew is just above my capabilities and it would be wiser to make a PC game instead...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA programming has its advantages for those who know how to tame the beast though. I'll say that much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In a word, yes. In fact, I've read, but don't know if it's true or not, that a number of commerical developers use the ARM GCC to build thier stuff, which is what DevKitPro is. Furthermore, it's not like the hardware is undocumented, so from a technical perspective, the pros don't have anything up on homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
What they do have is more time, more money, more people, and (in many cases) more talent. That said, basically, the sky's the limit. In all likelyhood, you'll hit the limit of your technical prowess, artistic skills, and free time long before the toolchain becomes the bottleneck.
<br/>
<br/>
To sgeos, what makes you say you don't think you could pull off CG sequences with homebrew tools? Sure, the dev kit isn't the only thing you'd need, but it never is. Are you thinking of a specific technical limitation, or just talking out of your hat?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
