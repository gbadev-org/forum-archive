    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking about this idea a while ago: making a dll/library for windows/linux/whatever for rapid development of gba conversion software.
<br/>
<br/>
Just to be clear it would mean something like a dll with all the functions and structures most tools already use, like palette conversion, bitmap conversion, tile/sprite things etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I just imagined it would be useful to anyone to be able to use tons of pre-made functions for this and rapidly write thier own tools or tools to distribute, with the added obvious bonus that they could get new libraries to link in that solve any problems that are found (improving thier product and the library).
<br/>
<br/>
Only problem is my time is pretty crammed right now, but I can see it still happening perhaps with some help. What I would like is some info if people could give it to me, to help me make some starting decisions:
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a good idea at all?
<br/>
Is it too late for the gba to bother?
<br/>
Would you contribute?
<br/>
Do you like sourceforge?
<br/>
Is most tool dev done in C or C++ or Delphi etc...?
<br/>
Do you use Windows, Linux or Mac OS?
<br/>
<br/>
I imagine it bieng a C based lib hosted on sourceforge, if it's worth doing at all. I just imagine C because its pretty widely compatible, even though I use C++ myself mostly, I just dont think a collection of relatively simple functions needs the C++ approach.
<br/>
<br/>
Just my dream seeing as I have enough of my own tools that share virtually identical code, which I would like to share and improve and add on to with everyones help.
<br/>

It's not at all a bad one.

Not violently opposed to it.

In my case, usually one of C, Objective C, or PHP.

Mac OS. (There's the answer to your earlier question.)

I think most of us that already write our own tools on here probably are already very used to doing our own conversion... for me, that's often the "easy part". Others' mileage may vary, I suppose.
<br/>
<br/>
If making a DLL is complicated (I have no idea if it is or not) there are easy ways to write your code in a modular way and write archive files (.a) so that you can easily include them in other projects. That will at least be good for your own purposes.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A DLL basically includes a line before each function allowing it to be exported to another program, and a header.  The problem with creating a DLL is that the DLL has to be included with the program, and DLLs only run on windows.  Perhaps you could just create a C or C++ library--this would be easier and allow more people to use it.  That's what HAM is; a C++ library.

Sorry if I got anything wrong,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since your exported functions should not have any API functions; your source code will be the same on each platform. Then you can compile DLL's for windows, so assembler coders can easily use them; and leave the source as usual for the other platforms.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
