Anyone have any clues about what's going wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Building under windows is fraught with dificulty and is fairly pointless given that binaries are available so you don't have to and won't actually gain anything by doing so. The build scripts are mainly there for linux and OS X users.
<br/>
<br/>
The preferred method for devkitARM support requests is via the mailing list - while forum posts may get a reply eventually there's no particular guarantee that I'll see it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yea, I have the win binaries.  The only reason I was trying to get it compiling was because I want to see if I can get the D Frontend (http://home.earthlink.net/~dvdfrdmn/d/) working with it.
<br/>
<br/>
I did end up getting DevKitARM compiling under Cygwin ok just a few minutes ago, though (But not the D part).

<br/>
can you PM me with the build errors you were getting with mingw/msys and the adjustments you needed to make to get it built with Cygwin?
<br/>
<br/>
It might be interesting to compare the two environments. I've seen reports of some really bizarre differences - like code compiled with mingw being 2000% faster than the same code compiled with cygwin.
<br/>
<br/>
you can get a full build log by running the scripts like this :-

What exactly was that code doing? If it was doing I/O or multithread work, it might have been Cygwin's stricter POSIX conformity getting in the way.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

number crunching apparently

<br/>
I/O is terrible with cygwin dependent code - quite a few people who switched to devkitARM/devkitPPC from one of the cygwin based equivalents have been quite shocked.
<br/>
<br/>
Linux is faster still - my PIII450 based Debian box can build devkitARM from scratch in around 40 minutes yet the mingw/msys build takes a shade over 3 hours on an 850 Athlon :/
<br/>
<br/>
I dread to think how long it takes on Cygwin (or the 25MHz 68030 based system I built my first gcc toolchain on many years ago :P)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
