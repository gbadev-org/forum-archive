    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
I have a question on Yeti3D.
<br/>
The Yeti3D Editor only allows .y3d style maps to be imported.
<br/>
So can I convert a Quake II Style maps to y3d?
<br/>
<br/>
PS. Is there a forum that supports Yeti3d ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can convert it manually by placing two PCs side by side, loading the Quake II map into the Quake II editor on one PC, and using the Yeti3d editor to create a similar-looking map on the other PC.
<br/>
<br/>
From what I've read about the Yeti3d engine, the theory of its operation is too different from the theory of Quake II's operation for any automated conversion to make sense.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
