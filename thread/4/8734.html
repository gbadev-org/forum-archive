I can't think of a straightforward way to do it using VBA.

I doubt it.  If the free download can handle the equivalent of commercial ROMs- and I'm fairly sure it can't, then I don't have access to No$GBA and its memory breakpoints.

Not sure what you mean there, no$gba is as accurate if not more accurate than vba, the problem is of course that the debugging equipped version is not free..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you can't spend $15 on tools for your project, then that's no reason to slander the accuracy of an emulator, is it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
