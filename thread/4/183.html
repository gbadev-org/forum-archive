    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone here have code to compress and decompress data on the GBA?
<br/>
Im working on a project that has a tight deadline, and Im wondering if some
<br/>
one out there has a working codec that can run on a GBA. I need something
<br/>
comparable to LZ77, but with faster compression speed. When I say fast, I
<br/>
need it to be able to compress 6k of data in about a quarter of a second or 
<br/>
less. Decompressing doesnt need to be as fast. I need working code that will
<br/>
build with gcc to run in a GBA rom. Any help would be appreciated, perhaps 
<br/>
with some compensation if the code works out in my project.<br/>_________________<br/>Does the corpse have a familiar face?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

character code can be 0-255, color is 2 colors, upper 4 bits for a

Im trying seperating the character/color pairs to 2 buffers, one for chars,

the other for colors, Ill post results on that<br/>_________________<br/>Does the corpse have a familiar face?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All lossless compression is variable bit rate. Thus, you may not always succeed in compressing the file to fit in your save RAM/flash/EEPROM. Imagine the case of completely random colors.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
I can only gues what you are doing here and might be miles off?
<br/>
Ok you have maps on one GBA and these maps have been modified in some way, thus you need to send these new maps to another GBA using a MB cable?
<br/>
If this is the case - why not store a highly compressed original of the map,
<br/>
maybe using a format similar to zip (lzw?)
<br/>
The MB GBA can then decompress this map.
<br/>
Then send along the differences - which shouldnt be that much overhead.
<br/>
if you are pre computing maps, then why not just send across the seed to make the new map?
