    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is doing well and has a Happy New Year.  Its been a while since I've been here.
<br/>
<br/>
VBA 1.8.0-beta pops up a message box that says "Unsupported ARM mode 00" and my ROM resets.  It happens in different time frames and it comes only when I doing something.  no$gba says "the ROM image has crashed" and shuts down.  Any idea what this means?  The only reference to this I've found to this through Google is on a emulation website.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

I haven't loaded anything into IWRAM--just EWRAM.  My local variables in my functions don't take up that much space either.  When I get home I'll check how much I've uploaded into EWRAM.
<br/>
I'm still using the compiler provided by HAM, and I don't know if I have that command.  If not I'll get DevkitARM.

I don't use that toolchain myself, but other names to look for are arm-agb-elf-nm, arm-elf-nm, in fact anything ending in -nm.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
