<br/>
I am wondering if someone could give me a quick explanation of how pogoshell works. To be exact, I was wondering how it manages to run binary files. I did not think this was possible because the binary roms do not have (afaik) logical addresses, only physical. Therefore inserting another program into its address space would be tedious. Am I missing something?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pogoshell plugins run in ram.

Pogoshell runs roms by using the same bit of hardware on the flash advance that multirom menus do, to relocate the bottom of the romspace.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
