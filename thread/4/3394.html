<br/>
In my oppinion it wouldnt be good for nintendo if they do cause Nintendo always had a strict anti piracy and therefor they never ever will make public devkits. They will make it much easier for hackers to find ways to play games illegal. If you compare PS2 with Gamecube or GBA. PS2 has much more piracy cause there are much more people knowing how to copy PS2 games than people who knows the PSOLoad or have a Flash linker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This way they can easy find ways to make playing of illigal copies possible to the whole community. PS has this problem anywas so they don't have to worry about that. If some smart people didn't find out about PSO loading any type of code it still wouldn't be possible.

Sony does publish and develop titles for the PS2. Jak III and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal are some of their upcoming titles. Granted, they don't publish high-quality games in the same volume as Nintendo, they still do make games.
<br/>
<br/>
The one thing though is that the PS2 is the ONLY commercial U.S. system (GP32 doesn't count) ever to do something like that. The only reason I think that it even happened is because 1) code can only be boot from a Linux kit 2) code can only be booted from the HDD, not CDs/DVDs 3) some access to the system is restriced through use of a kernel.
<br/>
<br/>
Public release of devkits won't happen. And the homebrew development might not get up to the same levels of the GBA anyway. We'll just have to see.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

if you can run a DC / N64 emulator on your PC, then (assuming they will be coded good) you should be able to run a DS emulator

it's nothing new apart from built in voice recognition - which is available on open source already

I doubt it would be much different to the graphics hardware, although just speculation, and even if it is different would still bring forward the same problems. Therefore we should tackle this in the same way the N64's graphics is handled.

<span style="font-weight: bold">Dagamer</span>, you'd be surprised but the processor is actaully the easiest to emulate - the graphics is the one that causes problems.

Of course, even if it does have the same quality of graphics as the N64, it will still be a while before a usable emulator is released. I still remember that first release of VisualBoyAdvance.
