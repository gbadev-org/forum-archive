    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Logarithmic Number System is an alternative representation of real numbers (alternative to floating point representation).
<br/>
<br/>
In LNS arithmetic multiplication and division become addition and subtraction.  Squares and square roots become left and right shifts.  Addition and subtraction are slightly complicated and require look-up tables.
<br/>
<br/>
In my "Thrust" game there were a lot of multiply, divide and square-root ops, but back then I hadn't discovered LNS.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone here has played with LNS algorithms and, if so, what are your thoughts on its applicability to GBA games?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I have been using fixed point numbers for going on 20 years now - they're perfectly fine, but I am intrigued by essentially "free" divides and square roots provided by LNS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Round-off.  Logarithms tables by nature have a lot of round-off - much more so than fixed-point.  I've thought about this a bit as well and this way by conculsion from experiments.  The addition and subtraction part doesn't help either :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
