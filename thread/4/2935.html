works fine for me, just use "arm-agb-elf-" in front of all the tool names, for example: arm-agb-elf-gcc
<br/>
arm-agb-elf-objcopy
<br/>
<br/>
as for VisualBoy Advance, i didn't install it anywhere, i just downloaded the binary in .tar.gz and run it out of it's own directory (in ~/gba/VisualBoyAdvance/ on my machine), and i put the paths in its config file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I finally got the chance to sit down and create a RPM for VBA -- for those who are interested, I've posted the spec file at <a class="postlink" href="http://munsie.dhs.org/vba.spec" target="_blank">http://munsie.dhs.org/vba.spec</a>.  The easiest way to use this is to copy it into /usr/src/redhat/SPECS and copy the VisualBoyAdvance-src-1.7.1.tar.gz into /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES and do a rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/vba.spec -- once that's complete (assuming that everything builds good), you should have a VisualBoyAdvance-1.7.1-1.rpm in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS .  Install as usual.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to look into getting this RPM into a mainstream archive.  I certainly don't have the bandwidth to host a binary RPM.  I'll keep everyone updated.<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I just started on the gba programming world, so I downloaded the devkitadv release 4 for linux, the compiled one found at sourceforge. But I'm not sure how to use it or I have trouble with it. I placed the files in a dir and when I try to compile I call the arm-agb-gcc from that dir, cuz I haven't placed it in the path, but even with an empty main function it crashes. It tells me this:
<br/>
<br/>
In function `jump_intr':
<br/>
../devkitadv/bin/../lib/gcc-lib/arm-agb-elf/3.1/../../../../arm-agb-elf/lib/crt0
<br/>
.o(.iwram+0xc4): undefined reference to `IntrTable'
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and also it tells me this:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
../devkitadv/bin/../lib/gcc-lib/arm-agb-elf/3.1/../../../../arm-agb-elf/bin/ld: section .iwram [0800039c -&gt; 08000463] overlaps section .init [08000388 -&gt; 080003a3]
<br/>
<br/>
So I haven't been able to compile anything at all. Should I build devkitadv myself or how do I use it or what am I missing.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
yes, devkitARM is available for linux.
<br/>
<br/>
The available build scripts should work fine on most linux variants, they've even been tested with OS X.
<br/>
<br/>
I've just had a sourceforge project approved for devkitARM &amp; devkitPPC so if you have a bit of spare time to produce RPMs I'd be happy to add those to the releases once I clean everything up &amp; get sourceforged properly.

link your project with arm-elf-gcc (or arm-elf-g++ for C++) and use -specs=gba.specs for a standard cart image or -specs=gba_mb.specs for a multiboot image</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

what part of just got a Sourceforge project &amp; updated this morning sounds like a devkit that's dying? Since devkitARM is used for a lot more than GBA development it's unlikely that it will die any time soon.

The build scripts and patches are available on the site should you feel the need to build it yourself. On linux based systems it's generally a matter of following the prompts, for windows you will need to install the packages listed in the readme.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
