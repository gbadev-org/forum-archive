Maybe how to put the bitstream into SRAM? Just a guess.
<br/>
<br/>
Use the search function on this board to find topics about SRAM saving. And use a struct for the save data, and save the struct data with the sizeof (struct). And one this you should think of. SRAM can only handle 16 bits ber write (if I remember correctly) so it's always good to have the struct / 2 bytes == 1.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I correct thinking here professional people?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You don't have to be professional to check the specs before posting. I'm certainly not one.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, SRAM has an 8-bit port size and can only be accessed with 8-bit reads/writes.

First of all, I can't understand some of the specs because I'm not that good at English. Second you are like a god to me, so you beat me whatever I say anyway :P
<br/>
<br/>
And 8-bit writes are much better than 16-bit, so that makes it easier for us all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

2 functions I wrote to both load and save structs to SRAM with a small example of how to use them.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
