    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Question for y'all...I haven't spent a lot of time reading up on DS programming (since I don't have one yet).  So if you'll excuse my laziness, maybe I can get a quick answer without having to invest all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a gba game that I've been working on (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.tolberts.net/anguna/" target="_blank">Anguna</a>) for quite a while now.  There's been some interest in a DS version (which would be functionally pretty much the same) from people.
<br/>
<br/>
My question:  how hard is it to convert a GBA game to DS?  I assume almost all the work would come from the graphics system, since I assume it's totally different.  It is anywhere near a 1:1 conversion, or will I totally need to restructure things?  
<br/>
<br/>
The stuff I'm more worried than basic backgrounds/sprites are things like windows (I'm using a sprite based window to do a cool lantern darkness thing), and hblank dma as well.  I assume these don't translate directly to DS ways of doing things?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, are there good open libraries for playing mods (particularly xm's)?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for excusing my laziness!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They're reasonably abstracted, but there are bits and pieces where stuff gets intermingled (where it was significantly more work to get to abstract out a minor piece).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
