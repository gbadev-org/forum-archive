I followed the GBA Development with Eclipse IDE HOWTO link on these forums I followed the how to but when I got the point of compiling I got these errors.

What am I doing wrong?

<br/>
Also I got on the Handheld Development Environment (HDE) but I could not download the plugging. Is there any benefit to using these over the Eclipse IDE HOWTO way if so where can I download them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HDE provides you a build manifest for the managed build functionality of CDT. It does so by extending the GNU build manifest and add GBA/ARM specific settings like the -specs and the -mthumb, -marm and -mthumb-interwork flags. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is nice if you don't want to write the makefile on your own.
<br/>
<br/>
It also speeds up integrated debugging with gdb and vba. It extends the standart C/C++ debug launch and automatically launches VBA. With the launch shortcut your also able to debug with a single click.
<br/>
<br/>
Please take a look at <a class="postlink" href="http://hde.gamedev.at/content/view/5/6/" target="_blank">installation guide</a> you like to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
I just realized that I need to put up a download or Install section in the main menu to make things more clear.
<br/>
<br/>
I also hope that I get some time again to work on it and provide an NSIS installer that makes installation super easy.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
First I want to thank you guys for this great plug-in. Unfortunately I'm using Eclipse for second time and for the first with C/C++ and I spend 1 day trying to configure my project without big success. I even couldn't set include and lib folders. I tried to add my include folder in "Properties-&gt;C/C++ Include &amp; Symbols" - it doesn't work. I set the library folder in "Properties-&gt;C/C++ Project Paths-&gt;Libraries" - I don't know is it work or not. 
<br/>
I deside to skip this step just to see can I make the rest of the thinks to work. But againt everyting was against me - If i try to run or debug my project I receive message box that says "The file does not exist for the external tool named VisualBoyAdvance SDL" - I have no ideia what this message means. 
<br/>
Tommorow I will continue fighting with this plug-in. But if you guys have some free time it will be great if you explain with more details the last point of Project Creation from the help of the plug-in - "You can set up the ARM and GBA specific options at the "GBA Options" section.".
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know why the Include &amp; Library path's should not work. Are you seeing them passed to the command line? 
<br/>
I can take a look at it when I'm at home again.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding VBA. Formery the path to the VBA executable was stored in the launch configuration dialog but is now centralized and can be changed in the preference dialog. 
<br/>
By default it just calls visualboyadvance-sdl.exe. So you can either add the visualboy directory to the path environment variable or set the full path to VisualBoy in the preferences.
<br/>
<br/>
For the most features in HDE there is a guide in the Online Help. There is  a collection of great development links provided in the help as well. 
<br/>
There is a GBA Development section in the main help toc that contains all the help files i have written.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply. I will try to fix the VBA.
<br/>
<br/>
About the Include &amp; Library paths thay are not passed to the command line. I tried to change the make file but it's automaticaly generated so every time that I press build a new make file overwrite my changes. I tried to add the paths before creating starting "Create Make Target..." the result is the same.
<br/>
<br/>
I will post the solution here if I found such.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats the intention of the managed makefile project. It will generate your makefiles automatically so you don't have to change them. That way you can of course don't change them manually.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried the addition of Includes and Libraries and thats what I found out.
<br/>
<br/>
- Include directories are passed just fine
<br/>
- Library search path gets passed just fine
<br/>
- Libraries are not passed at all
<br/>
<br/>
I currently have no Idea why it is not passing the libraries. I'll investigate the issue.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I found the VBA-SDL config field pretty hard :). Now when I press Run the VBA starts I can see my test application, but one error occure. 
<br/>
<br/>
The message box title is "Lunching"
<br/>
The error is "Error starting process"
<br/>
I have 2 buttons OK and Details &gt;&gt;
<br/>
In details I can see 3 times "Exec error:Launching failed"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? 
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.1. I suppose to have 3 include folders 2 of them must come from the workspace. I don't see any of these folders in the console log.
<br/>
This is everything: arm-elf-g++ -O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -mthumb -mthumb-interwork -osrc/Main.o ../src/Main.cpp
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.2. I recieve the same error with Debug but I don't see any emulator.
<br/>
I tried a couple of times to reconfigurate everything from scrach but the result is the same. I have no more ideas... 
<br/>
<br/>
My Eclipse version is 3.1.2 Build id: M20060118-1600
<br/>
VBA version is VisualBoyAdvance-1.7.2-SDL-Win32
<br/>
devkitPro version is 1.2.5
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me if I need to change something. THank you
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At least I have a working include path. I was adding it on the wrong place. Actualy it's not looking wrong, ut maybe it is not for managed make files. 
<br/>
<br/>
If someone has the same problems - you need to add path to include folders from:
<br/>
Project-&gt;Properties-&gt;C/C++ Buil-&gt;Tool Settings-&gt;GCC C++ Compiler-&gt;Directories
<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the issues still remain.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After the launching error please switch to the debug perspective and check if VisualBoyAdvance-SDL is running. 
<br/>
If this is true it probably does not find arm-elf-gdb. I guess you installed Insight.
<br/>
<br/>
To check this open a command prompt and type arm-elf-gdb. If the command is not found it does not find the debugger.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 possible solutions to make eclipse find the debugger.
<br/>
The debugger is set up in the launch configuration under the debugger tab. If you used the launch shortcut the debugger command is set to "arm-elf-gdb". 
<br/>
You can either change that to contain the absolute path to your debugger or add the bin directory of Insight to your path environment variable.
<br/>
<br/>
I also checked why it does not add the libraries and have currently no idea why. It seems to ignore the -l options alltogether. I'll check that in detail this weekend.
