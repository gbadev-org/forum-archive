    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is some example code on my site, way at the bottom of the page:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.thingker.com/gba/" target="_blank">http://www.thingker.com/gba/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It starts with a multiboot, but that shouldn't be required for the transfer to work. There's a bunch of junk in there about moving whole structs of data between gameboys, but it all rests on top of some basic link cable code.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps! Good luck... link cable stuff is pretty rough at first.
