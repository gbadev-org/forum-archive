    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hello, I'm french so excuse me for my bad english...
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know if I can compile a Windows CE version for a GBA ?
<br/>
<br/>
I know that windows CE works with the ARM's processors, so it could be possible.
<br/>
<br/>
In order to put windows ce on a gba, the bsp (or oel) is necessary (the layer that communicate between the hard and win ce)
<br/>
And of course the drivers for the gba devices...
<br/>
<br/>
So are these elements exists ? and first is it possible to compile a win ce for gba ?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know the specs for Windows CE, but there's the following considerations:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Windows isn't open-source, so you'd have to reverse engineer the entire OS.
<br/>
<br/>
2. The GBA only has 32K of fast RAM, and 256K of very slow external RAM. That's not an awful lot with which to do stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
3. The GBA is a 16 MHz machine. Granted I'm a bit out of touch, but when last I checked most modern PocketPCs were at least 200 MHz.

Hello, I think the best way to not pass for a idiot is to know what we say about a subject.
<br/>
<br/>
Windows CE is open source for the main part
<br/>
The main reason is that if you want to put an OS on a device other than a PC, you must recompile all the OS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I order to share the answer with all people interested (it's english this sentense ?), I'll give my teacher's answer :
<br/>
- If the processor is a ARM, it's possible to put a windows CE on gba.
<br/>
BUT you need the oel interface (all the methods to access the clock, the registry and the processor) in a first time and the hardware drivers in second time. The problem is that a device like a gba is realy optimised, for example, the memory is built in the processor... so, it's very difficult to create the assembly files that can discuss betwin the OS and the hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's some very good advice. Thank you for it. Let me know if you can provide me with any other helpful strategies.

Well this is not the entire truth, as I said a post ago... it also requres a MMU...
<br/>
<br/>
The smallest ARM processor supportet by now is the ARM720T and that processor offers a build in MMU (read about it inn the last link provided).

If that's not powerful enough, it might be possible to make your own custom GBA flash card with 16 MB of ROM at 0x08000000 and 16 MB of RAM at 0x09000000 with a CPLD that controls several bankswitchable areas.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

 Dan's posts: 1664. Other dude's: 4.
<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn't someone tell this guy not to disrespect members of the board, even if they aren't as helpful/insightful as Dan apparently is?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything here, but I really get ticked off when I'm reading development forums and someone relatively new to the board insults one of the actively contributing, respected members. If it was a matter of misinformation being spread, or the guy was just plain wrong, corrections can be made as was done by tepples.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to the board and to GBA programming, but I don't think anyone, even 12 and 13 year old kids relatively new to the internet, are new to manners or just being plain polite. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not a seasoned member of the board here or a moderator, so I may be in the wrong, but I still think it'd be easier for me to find the information I'm looking for without people making degrading off-topic remarks, especially when the guy was still mostly correct (Points 2 and 3).
<br/>
<br/>
Guess that's not the best way to introduce myself to a forum, but it sparked an opinion in me.<br/>_________________<br/>.ahad</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
