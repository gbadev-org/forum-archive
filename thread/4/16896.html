    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
i am thinking about this scenario:
<br/>
<br/>
Two gbas are connected (via xboo?!) to different pcs and swap the link port data over a network to play games via a "virtual link cable".
<br/>
Would that be possible? I couldn't find anything about such a tool/possibility.
<br/>
Writing a tool that swaps the data is not a problem, but i don't know much about the communication of a gba so my problem is how to catch/send the data from/to the gba.
<br/>
I think i don't really have do something like an interpretation of that data, because i just want to forward it.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to get some answers - and if this is a lame question: sorry ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Greetz,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA games expect data to be read almost instantly.  Existing games surely won't work.  If you are making your own GBA game, you could design such a system with lag in mind, but very few people will be able to play it if it needs custom hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
