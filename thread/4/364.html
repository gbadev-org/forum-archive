    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi -
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to set up the "GBA Music Wave" (http://www.codewaves.com/gbaplay.html) engine in my project, and it's been doing some very odd things that I quite simply can't explain. Most notably is the fact that when I put in support for joypad input, the music stops playing entierly. How checking the value of a register can do that is beyond me, but apparently it can.
<br/>
<br/>
But, that's all beside the point. I'm thinking the problem has something to do with the compiler I'm using, which I believe may be doing some very odd things behind my back, and I can't say I trust it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is, has anybody else tried to install this engine into a project with any success? If so, which compiler (there seem to be several versions of GCC floating around out there) were you using at the time? Did you have to do anything special to get it to work?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if anybody can reccomend the "best" compiler for working with GBA, let me know, I had a fair degree of success with the one I'm using now when I started out, but as I've gone on, it seems to like me less and less.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I did some more investigating and it turns out it definately is the compiler I'm using (devkitadv) not agreeing with the engine. Is there some "standard" compiler that the majority of the GBA development community is using right now? 
<br/>
<br/>
Any help or links will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would say the "standard" is GCC.  Some folk use the ARM Development stuff but it costs more than gcc.  Which is to say it costs more than $0.00.<br/>_________________<br/>You probably suck.  I hope you're is not a game programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
