    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What kind of "ROM editor" do you mean?  A tile editor?  An audio editor?  By "Mac" do you mean Mac OS 8/9 or Mac OS X?
<br/>
<br/>
If you mean a tile editor, you can download <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/pc/#ted" target="_blank">Pin Eight NES Tools</a> which, despite the name, contains a tile editor that works with several target platforms' formats including GBA 4-bit and 8-bit.  It uses the Allegro library, which works on Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X.
<br/>
<br/>
If you mean an audio editor, it should be simple to write a program that converts a game's unsigned samples to and from AIFF.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

And it doesn't matter, OSX or 9, but if there is an OSX version, that would be great. Thanks.

[EDIT] Wait, never mind, I found one. I also tried that tile editor and it's a little hard to set it up. If you have any information on how to do it, please reply. Thanks [/EDIT]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
