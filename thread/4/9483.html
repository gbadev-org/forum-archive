Actually I just have a lot of questions, and most of them are a matter of opinion (and I am thankful that I have not unintentionally caused any flame wars)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, for a little while, I have been wondering why a graphical langauge like Postscript has not been applied to a graphical persuit, like games.
<br/>
<br/>
Then there is PS's cousin, PDF (which only runs slowly if your using Acrobat, try using xpdf instead). PDF could be loaded up as a nice interpretor for GBA and maybe even DS. Especially when PDF's specs allow for langauges other than PS to be used in the place of PS. Just instead of having the "print page" command physically producing another sheet, have the "print page" wait for the VRAM to become available, and put the contents there. A PDF interpretor could work as a miniOS (keep in mind I am not refering to anything more powerful than DOS 1.0 when I say miniOS)
<br/>
<br/>
Now before you go saying PS runs slow on your computer--that is part of the nature of my question BTW--keep in mind, it was being used on printers in the 1970s. Which my thoughts there are "if you have 64KiB of RAM available, total. how much would you give the printer?"
<br/>
<br/>
Now some people might notice a theme in my posts... this takes a tangent from what I am playing around with using Linux, and also playing around with using Mode 7... meaning, it is a seperate task for now. (Meaning I may have seem obsessed with Mode 7 and Linux before, but this has not much to do with that)
<br/>
<br/>
Now finally to the question:
<br/>
What version of what implement of a PDF client's source code would people suggest I use as a base.<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
