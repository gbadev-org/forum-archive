    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you just want to exclusively switch between using one or the other then you shouldn't need to do anything too tricky. If you want to mix 8ad's output using AAS then that won't be so straightforward. Tepples' suggestion should work if you've got enough space to decompress the entire 8ad sound in one go. (However, note that as well as converting to 8-bit signed format you'll also need to clip the output to -127 to 127 (rather than -128 to 127) for the sound to work properly with AAS.)
<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't got enough room to decompress the entire 8ad sound file and you still want AAS to mix 8ad's output then it might be possible to bodge something together by getting 8ad to output an appropriate chunk of data (freq/50 bytes, where freq is the frequency you're telling AAS to play 8ad's output at) in the right format and setting the 8ad channel back to beginning of 8ad's new output with an AAS_SFX_Play() command each time a Timer 1 interrupt occurs before calling AAS_Timer1InterruptHandler(). A possible problem is that Timer 1 interrupts need to be handled quickly so you might find you need to do AAS_Timer1InterruptHandler() first and then do all the other stuff afterwards to avoid clicks in the audio.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by jd on Fri May 28, 2004 7:16 pm; edited 5 times in total</span></div>

That would almost work, although you won't get correct rounding and, in the case of AAS, the sample data rather unusually needs to be clipped to -127 to 127. You'd need to do something like:

It's your choice, but mixing two different audio systems together is a fairly difficult thing to do when you're still learning the ropes. It might be best if you focussed on doing one or the other on its own first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's very doable. The example player included with the 8ad decoder decompresses in chunks of 304 samples (one buffer per vblank at 18157 Hz), but the codec's caller can specify any number of samples to decode to IWRAM or EWRAM. The GSM decoder always generates 160 samples per call; its player uses a ring buffer to turn it into 304-byte blocks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I understand what you mean, jd. The more you mix together, the lower the quality can be, which is why you decided to use both channels. Even in 4 chn mono, audio would sound better if the groups are split into 2 groups, each using a channel.
<br/>
<br/>
tepples, that was exactly what I was thinking before the whole mono idea I had. If I'm correct in my assumption, I can do the following. Since your 8ad decoder outputs to buffers, I can use jd's AAS's SFX_Play function to play the current buffer, and perhaps ever VBlank switch the play function to read from the other buffer. Of course I'd have to see this actually work with correct timing.
<br/>
<br/>
However, since 8ad decodes to 16-bit signed, I guess I would have to do a bit of tweeking of the decoder's code internally to convert it to 8-bit signed. Also, I guess I'd have to edit all sounds so that instead of being in the 8-bit range of -128 to 127, they will be ranged from -127 to 127. I guess in 16-bit signed terms the lowest value should be -32512. Hopefully this difference won't affect sound too much.
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, this is still theory, as I have only worked with 8ad and editing outside it's decoding code. I'm going to get right on this, and report back later if this works successfully.

The code above should do the conversion for 8ad's output. Regular sound effects should be converted via the Conv2AAS utility. This will do the clipping for you as well as other things like automatically removing any redundancy between your samples and the samples in any MODs you might be using.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This should have been obvious to me in the first place since the Direct Sound channels are 8-bit DAC. That just means less fiddling around for me. Actually, perhaps I don't need to change each 8ad sound/music file to be in limits for use in AAS, if I can make a simple change in the decoder.

jd, doesn't AAS use Timer0 and Timer1? Or is that just when using the stereo setting? Also, since I'm using DMA3 for my other stuff in my program, do I have to switch over to AAS_DoDMA3?

<br/>
<br/>
Yes. To get AAS to work you need to make a Timer 1 interrupt (which occurs roughly 50 times a second) result in a call to AAS_Timer1InterruptHandler() (or a call to AAS_FastTimer1InterruptHandler() - see below). However, this doesn't mean that you can't also have other things happen when a Timer 1 interrupt occurs (like creating the next batch of 8ad data, for example).

</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
If you're using AAS then you must use AAS_DoDMA3 or write out all the parameters for a DMA3 transfer yourself using a single stmia instruction (which is all AAS_DoDMA3 does). This is because the mixer uses DMA3 which would cause problems if your code was halfway through initialising a DMA3 transfer when the mixer was called.

<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
AAS is syncronised via Timers 0 and 1, it doesn't use VBlanks. (Timer 0 ticks at a rate determined by the mixing frequency and Timer 1 overflows roughly 50 times a second. This is slightly more efficient than syncronising to VBlank as it fits in better with MOD timing and allows the audio to be mixed in bigger batches.)
<br/>
<br/>
I should perhaps clarify a bit here. AAS can be used in one of two ways:
<br/>
<br/>
1) The easy way - see "AASExample". A Timer 1 interrupt must result in a call to AAS_Timer1InterruptHandler(). This routine gets the GBA to play a new batch of audio and mixes the next batch. Pros: Easy to use. Cons: Won't work if you have other CPU intensive interrupts.
<br/>
<br/>
2) The slightly harder way - see "AASExample2". A Timer 1 interrupt must result in a call to AAS_FastTimer1InterruptHandler(). Additionally, AAS_DoWork() must be called at least 50 times a second (although it is safe to call it more often than this) - this usually means putting it in VBlank. Also, the special "AAS_MultipleInterrupts" mode in the supplied crt0.s file must be used to give priority to Timer 1 interrupts. Pros: Works in all situations. Cons: Harder to set up, slightly less efficient.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Right. The 8ad decoder lives in playad.iwram.c; here's its proto:

OOPS! After having worked with the GSM decoder for so long, I had forgotten that the 8ad decoder writes directly to 8-bit.

As you can see, I'm using the MAK file create from the GBA AppWizard, only I have made my own modifications. I have never really got the concept of MAK files, so bare with me. I looked through the MAK that came with the AASExample, and tried to see if I could make some more changes like adding a folder into the linking phase of the MAK file. However, as from the LOG, I am having difficulty.
<br/>
<br/>
It can't seem to find the InterruptProcess function, which other than moving it into a different file, is exactly the same as the example shows. Also it can't seem to find any AAS functions, even though I added the folder it is located in. This is the only style of MAK files I've ever used, so almost every other MAK file is foreign to me. As I said before, I don't have a good concept with them.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure what the cause of this is, but it might possibly be C++ related. Tepples?
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I also noticed that you're not calling Conv2AAS in your makefile. This isn't mandatory but it is recommended so that you're always building with completely up-to-date files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is very late for me right now. However, I did manage to minimize the number of errors that were generate now.
<br/>
<br/>
Because the InterruptProcess function was in a CPP file, it required the extern "C" syntax, which you stated jd.
<br/>
<br/>
The _init and _fini errors were fixed just by changing the entry point "int main(void)" to "int AgbMain(void)". I figured that much since the error specifically addressed "agbmain", and not "main"
<br/>
<br/>
However, the actual problem with the "undefined reference to '???' error still exist. I have done this and that, but still the same exact problems still show. I checked through the forums about this, and a few things popped up like linking library files after the object files. It is too late for me to do anything other than sleep right now.

It looks to me as though the problem is definitely caused by not linking in AAS, although I don't understand how the makefile you supplied could create the output you sent.

Anyways, for the AAS library, I've tried linking it after my object files, and now those errors are gone. But now I'm getting an actual problem with the library. Here is the new LOG...

I not even using AAS_DoWork, but I guess that since I'm using AAS_Mod_Play, it probably gets called. Remember, my code resembles the AASExample, except the code stops with a while loop right after the AAS_ShowLogo function (so no SFX), so I'm only using 3 functions (AAS_SetConfig, AAS_ModPlay, and AAS_ShowLogo) along with the InterruptProcess function. Since I'm guessing this is a problem within the library itself, I can't do anything, but hopefilly you do, jd.
<br/>
If it does have something to do the an old version makefile, I'd like to know how to change it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just to clarify: makefiles and .MAK files are the same thing. The makefile/.MAK file you provided (which specified that AAS should be linked) didn't match the output you provided (which didn't link AAS). I don't know exactly why this was, but clearly something was amiss - although you seem to have fixed it now.

You should probably add "-mthumb-interwork" above. The "_call_via_rX" functions are normally defined in libgcc.a - is this being linked to your project?

I did try adding -mthumb-interwork into the linking flags, but another problem about "unrecognised emulation mode: thumb-interwork" occurred. So before asking about that problem, I search the forums and found this thread here: <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=2697" target="_blank">AAS_SetConfig = crash</a>, which you, jd, stated that ld was not an alias for gcc, and that linking with gcc instead of ld would fix it, and for me it did.

<br/>
Now, during the times when I was waiting for replies, I have been making functions that use 8ad, and I hope that after working with AAS a little more with SFX converted for AAS, I can try using 8ad along with AAS for the audio handling I need for my demo.

Ok, I suggest trying short 8ad files that you can decompress completely into RAM first, before moving on to the streaming code for larger sounds.

Sorry jd, but I skipped decompressing a short 8ad completely into RAM and went to buffers. I guess I had enough info to get me by. I even set it so that it runs off the same timer that AAS_Timer1InterruptHandler uses. Even though with 8ad I'm only getting 1/2 compression, it makes a big difference when dealing with a lot of audio.
<br/>
<br/>
I know it to be buggy at the moment, and very unorganized, so don't expect a demo with code. Maybe I will someday when I make a program that will organize all 8ad audio into a single file for easy linking. I plan to use this audio combination for the demo I making (which I will not speak of until I actually release the demo) which will also use my sprite handler and my background handler (whenever I get to that).

That's a good idea.

I've written that for you as well: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">GBFS</a>. Both the 8ad demo and the GSM demo use it.
