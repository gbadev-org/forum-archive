<br/>
<br/>
Most home devvers use a linkerset, a flashmemorycartidge and a cable from pc to either be connected on a device writes to the cart directly or something that plugs into the gba wich then writes to the cartidge.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Geez! You obviously still haven't read any of the tutorials people have given you. You just keep flooding the forum with questions ranging between dumb and stupid.
<br/>
Trust me, the answer to all your questions are in the newbie tutorials. Now for gods sake read them!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, sorry, perhaps I could have. And I was, the first two times.
<br/>
The third time I answered a thread started by Link I was less subtle.
<br/>
Guess I couldn't restrain myself this fourth time.
<br/>
<br/>
Link:
<br/>
No, there are no DirectX, OpenGL, or any other high level API's available since the GBA does not feature a operation system. (thankfully)
<br/>
You work directly with the hardware registers, It's all very well documented and explained in the newbie tutorials. Please read them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
