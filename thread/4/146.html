    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I searched the entire devrs/gba site as suggested for the source of crt0.s but it didn't turn up.  Tried manually looking through the site, couldn't find it.
<br/>
<br/>
I only need a version of crt0.o that has interupts turned on to link into my project. I have "graduated" to the point that I want to turn them own and have my own IntrTable[] setup.  All ready to go except I am using DevKitAdv and it has them turned off.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone point me to the source of Jeff F's crt0.s or to a version of crt0.o that already has interrupts enabled??
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First you must set (line 85):
<br/>
<br/>
.equ __InterruptSupport, 1
<br/>
<br/>
and then one of the following one:
<br/>
<br/>
.equ __FastInterrupts, 1
<br/>
.equ __SingleInterrupts, 1
<br/>
.equ __MultipleInterrupts, 1
<br/>
<br/>
Because you wrote something about IntrTable[] only SingleInterrupts or MultipleInterrupts fill your needs.
<br/>
<br/>
If that is done you only need to feed IntrTable[] with the correct pointers and turning the specific interrupt on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I finally found the source code crt0.s on the gbadev/gba site under the C/misc section ( strange place for ASM code, but that is where it is!).
<br/>
<br/>
It is entitled "crtls v1.28" just in case any other newbies need to find this source code.
<br/>
<br/>
Next step, assemble according to I.C.E instructions and override link into the GCC. 
<br/>
Thanks again to all.<br/>_________________<br/>MysticX is The Defender</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
