    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't get DevKitAdvance to work, when I give a command eg.:
<br/>
<br/>
gcc -o ww.elf sys.c eng1.c eng2.c -lm
<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting this error:
<br/>
<br/>
"Linkstub failed (c/DEVKIT~1/BIN/GCC -&gt; arm-agb-elf-gcc) = c/e/gba/ww/c/DEVKIT~1/BIN/arm-agb-elf-gcc: No such file or directory
<br/>
Thought that link path (arm-agb-elf-gcc) was a relative path.
<br/>
Thought that argv[0] (c/DEVKIT~1/BIN/GCC) was a relative path."
<br/>
<br/>
I have installed the compiler to C:\DEVKITADV as recommended. I have added C:\DEVKITADV and C:\DEVKITADV\BIN to my path...
<br/>
<br/>
I have looked at the FAQs, they do not seem to mention this problem. And it doesn't seem that any documentation is included with the compiler for some reason. Aaarggh...please help, I have my Arcadia emulator almost finished but can't compile it!! :-( Many thanks...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I downloaded it...
<br/>
<br/>
According to the gbadev.org FAQ there should be a file "C:\devkitPro\devkitARM\bin\arm-elf-gcc.exe", but there is not :-( I found a file "arm-eabi-gcc.exe", so have been trying to use that instead... there's no docs with this one either :-(
<br/>
<br/>
I have set up paths. When I do:
<br/>
<br/>
arm-eabi-gcc -Wall -mthumb -mthumb-interwork -specs=gba_mb.specs gui.c cpu.c uvi.c -o ga.elf
<br/>
<br/>
I get the error
<br/>
<br/>
ARM-E~10.EXE: _spawnv: No such file or directory
<br/>
<br/>
Any clues what's going on? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That'll happen if you don't have msys installed, it seems. You can either install msys from the devkitpro site, or you can try going into the bin (the one with the arm-*-.exe's in it) directory and renaming the ld.exe to ld.old, and the ld.real.exe to ld.exe.
<br/>
<br/>
If it's the same as what happened to me (no msys) then that'll fix it all right up. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I had to search this forum for a while before I found this, however... :/

Edit - If you're still having troubled with devkitpro r19, try <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9758" target="_blank">this thread</a>. (Before anyone says, I searched and fixed the error before this thread existed ?_?)<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum.
