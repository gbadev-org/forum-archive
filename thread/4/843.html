    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I recently acquired an evaluation of the official ARM SDK. I can get my programs to compile, but they dont seem to work on the emulators. Can anyone give me any advice on how to compile programs with this properly? 
<br/>
Thank you</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The way I do it is by having one small start/boot assembler source, containing the rom registration data (are you sure this is correctly included in your compiled file?) and the "main jump" (necessary inits etc), regardless if it is a asm/c/c++ program i'm doing. When compiling/assembling I'm also using the "scatter" feature in order for me to decide exactly where each .o file goes in the rom (for instance, the rom reg data must reside at file offset 0x0 etc).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm assuming you've converted the compiled file format from ELF -&gt; BIN before trying to execute it?
<br/>
<br/>
In short, you can't make working gba files, simply by using default settings in the arm environment. You need to make a couple of changes for it to work. The question is just what changes you've have/havent' made...
<br/>
<br/>
(What I'm referring to here is the ARM SDT 2.50+ suite, perhaps you're using another version?)
