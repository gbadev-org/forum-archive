    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using Windowing and shrinking the dimensions of the Window, but I am having to use timer delays.  Someone once told me I could update the REG_WIN0H/REG_WIN0V during the Hblank period.  Could someone show me a snippet of how this would work??

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can manage the WINDOW register on hblank , open the HBLANk andler and on the beginning of Hblank interrupt tke the Vcount value after change the Window value at the specific Vcount value, with this on each line you want you can manage your window... I'm sorry but at the moment i cant write an example but if nobody do i will try to make later, i'm on beach now...
