    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How does it work??
<br/>
I dont understand when I read at the GBAtek.
<br/>
<br/>
But I think I want to use it to synchronize, because in Normal Mode the SI/SO bit doesnt seems to work with a normal 4 player link cable.
<br/>
<br/>
But maybe you have a better solution
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
