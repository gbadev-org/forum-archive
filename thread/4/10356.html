    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering, what benefit does using a tilebackground for sprites (instead of OAM) have? I am clueless about this, since many professional games seem to do it that way.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A tile background would be useful for a very large sprite, greater than 128x128 in size.  You can use HDMA and rotation/zooming for graphical effects on the layer.  It also frees up space in the sprite section of VRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess the GBA/DS is a real creative platform, since both ways would work. It's only a matter of what features you need for each layer.

I would use sprites for something like Street Fighter, and stitch the sprites together to form my large character. Remember that if you use background planes you only have four that can move independently of one-another, and if you use two for your two main players that only leaves two for backdrops, HUDs, whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, you could make the background method work as well. There is no one answer here.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you put the GUI in sprites, you would still have 4 backgrounds at your disposal. Two used for the characters and 2 for the real 'background'. Well, in any case, I agree that the GBA is so versatile that yes, even stitching the sprites would work!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
