    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I know GBA Cartridges are all "structured" differently, however I am wondering, does anyone know anywhere that I could find any resources that let me "open" a gba cartridge and dump what I can, like sprites or whatever, to save time instead of using VBA, or does this involve me having to Emulate the rom and dump it. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Basically:
<br/>
<br/>
1: C# Language.
<br/>
2: Open ROM.
<br/>
3: Dump Images &amp; Sounds.
<br/>
4: Convert To Correct Formats. (If Possible)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I'd like:
<br/>
<br/>
1: Links to resources that make sense
<br/>
2: Premade tutorials on this topic
<br/>
3: Anything that can make this easy to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're just trying to extract images and sounds, it's going to be difficult without actually running the game, because, as you said, the assets aren't in a standard location (or might not necessarily even really be the exact same format, they could use different methodologies to write graphical data to vram).
<br/>
<br/>
If this is about legally dumping a cart, you could probably use the linker -&gt; parallel port cable, and write a GBA program that lets you dump out the ROM data to your computer and save it. But that won't get you much beyond what's on rom file, other than legality.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this forum is mostly about writing new code, we don't generally provide a lot of help/support with hacking commercial roms, which gets into the gray areas of legality that we try to avoid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
