at global scope and compile this with devkitadvance.
<br/>
I am using make.bat, instead of makefile stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn't that make my rom image mutlitboot?
<br/>
The compiler doesn't say anything about it.
<br/>
<br/>
But when i send it with xboo over the cable to my gba,
<br/>
it says that the header is incorrect, probably missing.
<br/>
Since i've only tested my code on emu's so far and i assumend
<br/>
that MULTIBOOT would make it multiboot, but didn't.
<br/>
Probably i've an older version of devkitadvance.
<br/>
I believe it was  version 3 when i started and never changed that.
<br/>
<br/>
So can anyone tell me how to do this?<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Devkit Advance's header does not contain a Nintendo logo.  You'll need a "gbafix" program such as the ones available at gbadev.org's tools section.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
