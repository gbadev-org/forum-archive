    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm currently using MappyVM because it has some really great debugging features (i can view sprites, backgrounds, palettes, step through the game, and most importantly use Mappy's console feature (printfs are my favorite for debugging)!) Anyways, I can't seem to figure out how to get the source code thing working. Supposedly you can step through code but whenever I bring up that window, it's just blank. Anyone know how to use this feature? Just curious. Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>- RegularKid</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Use the -g option with your compiles.
<br/>
When you link also make an ELF file, and load this into Mappy, rather than selecting your normal .GBA ROM.
<br/>
Then click on any file to see the source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
You must also have all your source code files from your project in the same directory as the .elf file as well because actual source code is not included in .elf files.
