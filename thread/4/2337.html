    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm going to start writing my sprintf function pretty soon... but rather than reinvent the wheel entirely, I thought I'd see if anyone had any tips for writing this, or even perhaps knew the location of an original source I could look at.
<br/>
<br/>
My biggest concern, unsurprisingly, is base-conversion for printing decimal numbers. Don't know if anyone has any suggestions for doing this, hopefully without having to divide. :P

<br/>
2) You could look at the source for newlib (or libc, or dietlibc) to see one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think I will write my own routine, since I only need to support two format specifiers for my game (%d and %s), and I can write a more efficient routine in Thumb assembler. (Among other things, it will use SWI for division and modulus in the base-conversion rather than the gcc operators used by newlib!)

I think this a case where you should NOT use SWI :)
<br/>
<br/>
base conversion uses divisions by small constants. These can be turned into a handfull of shift and subtract instructions - so divide by 10 is just a few cycles !
<br/>
If you don't know how, you could writeyour code in c, let gcc do the divide by const optimizations, and grab the compiler generated asm(assuming that you have optimisations switched on)
<br/>
Also, you shouldn't need a modulus at all !
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
heres some code that can generate instructions for specific constants:
<br/>
search on google for
<br/>
"_OPTIMIZING INTEGER DIVISION BY A CONSTANT DIVISOR_
<br/>
by Robert Grappel"
<br/>
and look at the cached page i you don't have a ddj acount
<br/>
<br/>
here is some good info on binary to decimal conversion
