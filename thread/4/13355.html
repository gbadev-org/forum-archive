    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Everything with my project was going good until my build process needed some modifications. So I moved some source files in some folders and I modified my Makefile. Actually it was a big change in the makefile. But in the compilation command I don't see anything special. The thing is that I include cmath in my project which include math.h. There are two math.h files one in the arm-eabi folder and one in the libnds. And cmath always includes the one from libnds. I tried adding the arm-eabi to the include folders also tried different include order but aways cmath includes the wrong file.

Any ideas why this is happening and how can I prevent it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
