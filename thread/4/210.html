    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guys,
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know how to switch from mode 4 to mode 0, then back to mode 4 or any other bitmap modes &amp; back again to mode 0 safely?
<br/>
<br/>
every time i try it, the screen goes white. :S
<br/>
<br/>
Any code would be greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks.

You do realise that when you're in mode 4 (or 3,5) that you're probably using all of the vram (especially if using both buffers) so when you swap to mode 0 you've got to copy in a map and tile data?
<br/>
<br/>
Actually swapping modes won't break anything, just make sure you're pointing at the gfx properly (map and tiles) and you should be fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
 As long, as you wish to switch modes after the screen is rendered, you can do it anytime, there's no limitation.<br/>_________________<br/>--  Ped - ped at 7gods dot sk
