    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I am using Sgade and am currently having problems displaying a simple image on the screen. I am using GBASDK install with Mac OS X.
<br/>
<br/>
Because there is no "SoConverter" app compiled for OS X. I used SealFins Image-to-GBA program, it turns the target image into a .h with a const u16 as the images data. Would this be appropriate for use with Sgade? 
<br/>
<br/>
When I attempt to display the converted image which is 240*160, i get the on screen error.  "Assertion Failed: SoImageGetWidth == SO_SCREEN_WIDTH"
<br/>
<br/>
Could anyone help with my problems? 
<br/>
thank you in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The mailing list will probably be a lot of help in the future too.

I think you can sign up from the SGADE website, but this is the email address of the yahoo group: <a href="mailto:sgade@yahoogroups.com">sgade@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's great if you want a free (beer and speech) and easy way to make GBA games. All the same, the SGADE group is probably a better place to ask this.
<br/>
<br/>
Umm... Some code would be nice too. A u16 data array is appropriate for use with the SGADE, if you initialize a SoImage with it. Most everything in the SGADE is an 'object' (really a structure, it's written in C), and the functions expect those structures. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.suddenpresence.com/sgade/documentation/" target="_blank">The online SGADE docs</a> describe the SoImage module along with the others.
<br/>
<br/>
The SGADE comes with an example of using images in mode 4: /sample/source/SampleEffectWelcome.c in the base directory after you unzip it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The SGADE 1.02 Development Release (C) - 00:44 PST - July 6th 2003 
<br/>
<br/>
Notable new features this release: Routines to copy linear bitmaps to sprites &amp; tile sets, initial implementation of SoBkgFont module. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also in this release (from Dev B): Routine to retrieve elapsed milliseconds, incorporation of SoDebugPrintf, minor bug fixes in SoImage, SoTimer.
<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: This is not a stable/final release. The new features may be incomplete or may not yet be fully tested. Some new features may be just plain broken. Still, it is a good preview of what to expect in the next stable release.
<br/>
<br/>
Should compile right out of the box. Once you've downloaded it, read the SoRevision.txt file included in the package for full details on updated contents.

yes i like sgade.I couldnt include code because my code would probably end up confusing you more. I am just asking how you would go about,essentally im asking for some minor source. I go through the SGADE online docs about once a day. oh,and im using SoConverter from a PC then transferring the files to my mac instead of what i afforementioned. 
<br/>
<br/>
The tutorial on suddenpresence,boulderbombers advance i am aware of. I have also gone through the "worldwise" source. Neither of these codes use actually implict image work ,just sprite animation bitmaps.
<br/>
<br/>
Wizard-great to hear,hopefully the next stable beta release will be written into the next GBASDK update for mac.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, I mean the sample that comes with the library. It's in the /sample/ directory. SampleEffectWelcome.c displays a "The SGADE - Press start to continue" image.

If you want the library now, all you need to do is download it, unzip it, copy libSocrates.a to /usr/local/gbasdk/lib/, and copy all the header files to /usr/local/gbasdk/include/sgade/.
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><span style="font-style: italic">cp</span> &lt;PATH_TO_SGADE_UNZIPPED_LOCATION&gt;<span style="font-style: italic">/lib/libSocrates.a /usr/local/gbasdk/lib/</span>

<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
If libSocrates.a isn't there, you'll need to cd to &lt;PATH_TO_SGADE_UNZIPPED_LOCATION&gt;/build/ and run make.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
