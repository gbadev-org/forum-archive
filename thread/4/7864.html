However no one used 8x16 fonts or mapped in memory treating them like sprite...<br/>_________________<br/>xXx</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using 8x16 fonts is easy: draw all the top halves on one row of tiles and then draw all the bottom halves on the next row of tiles. I seem to remember that my GSM Player does this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Actually it's an awful book. The information and tutorials found at <a href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/index.htm" target="_blank">http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/index.htm</a> will give you a much better grounding in GBA programming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on a text page for tonc, covering simple (well, <span style="font-style: italic">I</span> think they're simple :P) and flexible text systems for pretty much all modes. I should be done after I add the accompanying text for the last two demos. I'll see if I can add a work in progress version in a few days.

<br/>
You are expected to understand the basics of GBA programming, though; it won't be a beginner section.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, 8x16 font systems are actually not that difficult to create, it's just a little more book-keeping, but it's difficult to give concrete advise on it because there are so many ways of doing it that depends very much on howmuch room you have left in VRAM, tilemaps vs bitmaps vs sprites, etc, etc. Like tepples said, learn 8x8 first, then change it for your own specific purposes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Edit: I have checked out the site. I just wanted to thank you again. It looks like it will be amazing. I can't wait to play with the "mode 7" stuff :). Also, Cearn if it your site? If it is exellent work, and if it isn't.... well.... it's still exellent work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know the basic (hardware, some code of arm7, simple demo in arm code)...
