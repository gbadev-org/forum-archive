<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how many of you who know how to code might be aware of the Dingoo A320, a handheld emulation machine out of China ( <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.20217" target="_blank">http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.20217</a> ).  Unlike countless others before, it really emulates many platforms well, best among them, the GBA!  While GBA homebrew might not quite be as "happening" as it was, this platform might give you all an excuse for getting back into coding for the GBA.  The Dingoo has a growing fanbase, clamouring for homebrew, but the SDK for it is not that easy to find around the 'net.  Many of the emulators written for the GBA work well on it.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers
