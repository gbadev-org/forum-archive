Are they ever going to work on that? Flashing a ROM for testing takes time.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">VBA does not emulate the speed of the GBA very well, NoCash is way better.
<br/>
Running NES Metroid on PocketNES shows 47 FPS (in PocketNES) in VBA, running it on NoCash or real hardware shows somewhere around 57-60 FPS instead.
<br/>
So NoCash is a good alternative to real HW if you want to test the speed.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you running a PAL NES game? An in-game frame rate counter (i.e. PocketNES's not VBA's) <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> register 50 FPS for a PAL game.
<br/>
<br/>
How fast is your PC? On a PC with a fast enough x86 CPU, VBA should run PocketNES at full speed. The CPU and PPU cores take time to emulate, and ARM-in-IWRAM cores such as that of PocketNES are especially CPU intensive to emulate. Perhaps No$GBA's CPU core is slightly more optimized.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you running any distributed computing projects' client such as MD5CRK, SETI@home, or distributed.net? Pause it. Some DC clients don't know how to get 100 percent out of the way.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried running PocketNES in VBA with a frameskip of 2 rather than 0? Running the PPU core at only every third frame should speed things up a bit. And perhaps No$GBA's PPU core uses a few cheats; given that it doesn't seem to emulate mosaic, it just might. Try turning on VBA's Options &gt; Video &gt; Disable SFX.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you running VBA at 1x magnification? Bigger magnifications often bring the slowdowns of filters and "DDraw Emulation", which people turn on because they prefer the blocky look of nearest-neighbor resampling that DirectDraw software scaling uses to the blurry look of linear interpolation that some video cards use for DirectDraw overlays.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm talking about how fast PocketNEs emulates a NES not how fast NoCashGBA/VBA/HW emulates a GBA.
<br/>
My computer running VBA is able to emulate a GBA running PocketNES just fine (eg 100% speed), but it doesn't give enough ARM cycles to the "GBA" so the FPS meter in PocketNES shows 47FPS instead of 59FPS (PocketNES can't really emulate Metroid (NTSC version) at full speed on hardware(GBA)).<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
