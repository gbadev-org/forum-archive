<br/>
Anyway, I had the idea to make a program that sends a multiboot over to another GBA. This multiboot then reads the SRAM from a cart already in the GBA (in my case it's Tactics Ogre). The multiboot should then send the save to the first GBA, which saves it to the flash card's SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that once the multiboot is loaded, the GBA with the flash card seems to ignore the transmitted data! The functions I've been using are slightly modified send and recieve functions from <a class="postlink" href="http://downtou.cjb.net/" target="_blank">http://downtou.cjb.net/</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I did this so I could trade saves with other people away from my home, in case you wanted to know.

<br/>
Please, any info is appreciated!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
