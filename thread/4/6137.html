    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've noticed that the screen gets a little bit "fussy" when scrolling? White turns into light gray and so on (when the white parts of a tile is over a gray part), but only when scrolling. Is this because the emulator can't redraw the screen fast enough, or is it because poor source code? :) Or is it my eyes playing games with me, since everything looks normal when taking a screenshot(when scrolling)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">LCD pixels can't turn on and off as fast as CRT pixels. You'll get a bit of LCD motion blur when you play on real GBA or GBA SP hardware, a Game Boy Player connected to an LCD TV, or an LCD PC monitor.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
