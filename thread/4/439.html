    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone. I'm new to GBA development but not completly new to game
<br/>
programming (Did more then 15 Flash games)
<br/>
<br/>
I've read through some GBA tuts this weekend and have now some questions.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically I wanna do a game in an isometric (Pixel Art) game (Like the main
<br/>
"city" in MegaMan BN2). Question now is how I should handle the different z
<br/>
depths. Say the ground is allways on the same level and there are streets
<br/>
surrounding buildings. If you walk behind a building, the character will be
<br/>
partially or full behind the building.
<br/>
<br/>
How is this done? The ground level is not the problem, that can be done with tiles, I think it is no problem in an isometric world, too. But the
<br/>
buildings? Are they done with sprites like the characters, just on different
<br/>
Z levels? Of course the building can be much bigger then the character
<br/>
sprites, is this a problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there somewhere a demo source? That would be cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Thx in (GB) advance, Fredi
