    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm having some troubles with all the conversions tools and background modes of the GBA. Thus, I'm pretty confused. I'm currently using visualham and gfx2gba and trying to animate a character walking in 4 directions. However I have a set a 16x24 sprites in .gif. Can anyone give me a hint on how to actually use sprites into my project and be able to animate it as I want to ? (Right now I simply want the character to move in the 4 directions (3 sprites per directions) ) on a black blackground. Any help on this subject would be greatly apreciated. 
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well first off, if you haven't already, checkout a reference/tutorial guide on GBA programming. There are many good one's available. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.thepernproject.com" target="_blank">www.thepernproject.com</a> for one. It explains how to create sprites, convert them, load them into VRAM and then how to use them. I found it very informative when I had just started doing this.
<br/>
<br/>
You can't convert .gif files using gba2gfx (atleast not with the version I have) so first convert that file to a 256 color bitmap. You can do that easilly with photoshop. I would suggest using a 2D sprite layout as a opposed to a 1D layout because I find that much easier to work with. PERN can explain this in detail if you don't already know what it means.[/url]<br/>_________________<br/>"head straight for your goal by any means

Here's a topic that talks about line drawing using Bresenham's algorithm, includes some code too:
