    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't had the chance to try out all the languages yet so I wouldn't know. What I do know is that an Object in the strict computing sence is a phisical device with methods and atributes.
<br/>
<br/>
So in a game it is an area of code(methods)(usually a function or procedure) with user defined atributes(ie diffined variable x , y etc) and a graphic (phisical device).
<br/>
<br/>
So in answer to your question which is the best for object orientated well any of them as they all allow methods(functions,procedures) atributes(variables) and the graphics of an object.
<br/>
<br/>
I have some Questions for you.
<br/>
Have you ever learnt this advanced computing and have you downloaded a language yet.
<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't done this advanced computing yet then I'd surggets Dragon basic for ease of use. If you have go for Dev Kit Advance but relly they are just as good as each other when it comes to objects<br/>_________________<br/>Rolling a six is unlikely but how do you know if you have never picked up the dice.
