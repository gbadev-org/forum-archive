    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello there^^
<br/>
I?m somewhat new to gba programming and i wanted to know if it would be possible to write some code that lets you use the gba as a pc Gamecontroller
<br/>
(i.e. for visualboy advance) using the XBOO cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Thx in advance...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I know docs for 1 and 2, but they are all for assembler. If you are going to work in assembler check out the <a class="postlink" href="http://win32assembly.online.fr/" target="_blank">iczelion</a> tutorials and <a class="postlink" href="http://betov.free.fr" target="_blank">rosasm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

playing my games is not the reason that i want to do this but i want to learn something while coding and have fun to while making this....
<br/>
<br/>
cout someone maybe just give me some example code for sending i.e. the WM_KEYDOWN message from an console application to the app that is in front of the desktop? 
<br/>
I think that would realy help me to beginn my project^^
<br/>
<br/>
Or is this task somewhat more complicated than I?m imaging??</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah... try and first make a multiplayer gba game&lt;even if its just displaying a synchronized number on both screens&gt; just to get the hang of the GBA protocol. To hook the gba up to the PC, unless I'm terribly overlooking something, you will have to have a cord to hook the GBA to the computer via a USB/GBA link and create a program on the computer that correctly communicates with the GBA. Then just make a 1-way link where the GBA sends the KEYS&lt;assuming this is what you call it&gt; register over the link, and have the computer program virtually press those keys. Sorry I can't supply code, but I myself am also learning how to do the linking. However I can verify that all I have said is tru.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a bomb technitian. If you see me running, try to keep up ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
