I doubt there is a new comms mode for it :-)

<br/>
I have been looking for it everywhere and I found nothing

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I'm probably the only person this side of the Pacific that has any knowledge of the thing at all as I wrote the Digimon Racing RFU connection code.  It, in theory, it allows faster transmission speed of data than serial, but I didn't see that.

Not picking on you or anything man, as you are one of the better coders I have seen on these boards, but I have to admit that digimon racing was something me and friends tried after getting our wireless adapters and we had a real pain getting it to work for very long at all. Having said that, you should release the code :P (Just kidding, I wouldn't if I was you).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>
<br/>
Version 2.0 now up - guaranteed at least 100% more pleasing!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you don't happen to have a gba, a flash cart and a wireless adapter and some good will to test my experimental roms?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh really on the connection code?  We did hours and hours of testing here to get that @#$$ thing stable.  The only times we had problems were when playing next to running microwave ovens (true story) or zapping each other through tube lights.  It even worked through some farily thick drywall in office.  Range about 10M with slowdown and perfect at around 3 to 4M.  What kind of issues did you have?  As this code base is still being used in current games, I'd love to here about them!

Miked0801, you're the person who knows most about it - is it possible to ever understand how it works from just looking at the sent and received data?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
