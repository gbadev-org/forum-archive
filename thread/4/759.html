    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">today when i was trying to display my animated sprite along with bg2....something strange happens....
<br/>
<br/>
that was a 128(basic tiles) x4 frames sprite....and the map was 256 color and 512x512...
<br/>
<br/>
when i load sprite data into mem FIRST and map data SECOND....the sprite then behaves abnormally ... the OAM of that sprite will automatically turns to OAM 512 PRIO 1 ... every 3 key-stroke.
<br/>
Normally the sprite should change its char_no# in the order of 0 -&gt; 128 -&gt; 256 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 0 ....but it now is 0 -&gt; 128 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 512 -&gt;0(w/ PRIO 1)
<br/>
<br/>
and the most annoying thing is that No.512 char has never been used so thats a blank character....
<br/>
<br/>
well ,then i tried not to load map data ....and everything goes back to normal.But the annoying No.512 (1 PRIO) char appears again when i loaded map data again....
<br/>
<br/>
finally .i tried to load map data FIRST and sprite data SECOND ,phew...... settled....
<br/>
<br/>
but that's so strange that i cant work out what has happened...can sb plz gimme a hand ????
<br/>
<br/>
btw the character base block is at 0 and screen base block is at 28 (from  turtorial =)
<br/>
<br/>
thx .
