    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I've read, the most popular tool used for sprite animation is framage. However, I'm a little unsure on how it is being used. Typically, sprites are converted from pcx to a .h file using a program. However, framage only takes jpg, bmp, or png files. So do people typically create their sprite frames in one of these formats, use framage to combine them all into a single file, convert to pcx and then create a .h based on that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't worked with PCX since 1998. Since then, among pixel-perfect image formats, I've worked mostly with BMP (Windows uncompressed format that's a doddle to parse), PNG (free compressed image format that takes a bit more code), and XCF (GIMP's native format, used for intermediate images).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which file format you start with is essentially irrelevant.  The most important factor is having complete control over your palette colors.  This is extremely important when working in 4 &amp; 8-bit modes.  I have an effinity for the good ol' based DOS  Deluxe Paint 2e.  I have yet to see an application that offers the flexibilty and control at the pixel/palette level of DP2e.

If someone would like to recommend a newer app to me, I'd me more than happy to check it out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With GIMP, a user can create a palette, and then when converting an image from RGB to indexed, the user can set it to use the colors in that palette in that order. What other level of control do you want?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
