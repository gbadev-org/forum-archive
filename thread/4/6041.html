    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a game for 4 players using 4 GBA's and a 4 player cable.
<br/>
<br/>
Everything works fine until i rearrange the cables whilst playing the game.
<br/>
<br/>
After i've done this, the multiplayer comms will never find any connected machines until the cables are returned to their original order. (The machines are basically keeping their master, slave id's).
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried to force a communications circuit reset by changing comms mode after i have detected the interrupted game communications (when you whip the cables out) - but i doesn't appear to help (or is maybe getting optimised away by my compiler). 
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know how to force a communications circuit reset - or is my theory that this is what i need to do actually incorrect ?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers
<br/>

UPDATE: found my bug! theory is correct - but i'd stupidly used START_BUTTON instead of SIO_START when writing to REG_SIOCNT... too many late nights!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Changing cable connections while a game is running huh.  That will play havok with multiplayer code on most systems.  The machine number is handled by how far it is from the master in the chain.  Changing this will cause chaos :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
