Basically, a couple of the tutorials and posts I've seen have stated that once you get used to coding for the GBA, you won't want to use graphics in array format, instead creating binary data and including it in the rom.
<br/>
<br/>
My question basically is, what's the best way to go about this? Do I simply tack the data on to the end of the rom image? Have binary files I compile into the code?
<br/>
<br/>
The basic idea I'm working on here is I'm going to create a level editor (I'm working on a 2d platform game as a university assignment), which will provide the ability to export level data and graphics into a format I simply can use in a final rom, and ideally readd into a game without having to recompile (effectively like having files I guess, so I guess what I'm asking is a way to create a readable filesystem on a GBA).
<br/>
<br/>
As I've said, if the question has already been answered, feel free to post a link, but any insight into this would be appreciated.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Several choices:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Use GBFS to include binary files.
<br/>
2) Use bin2s to generate an asm file.
<br/>
3) Use the GAS .incbin asm opcode to include raw binaries (search the forums for it)
<br/>
<br/>
I personally use way #3. Post here if you need help with these ways, I know I didn't really explain them enough.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the replies so far guys, I'll have to look into those methods to work out which one I should use.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, just thought of this now, and it's probably just a graphical frontend to one of these methods, but would it be possible to create a gba image, and then be able to create an editor that will view the 'contents' of the image a la windows explorer? (With the ability to move data in and out freely).
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, anyway, it's late, so I don't know if that made much sense, but in any case, I'll look into those other methods. Feel free to keep posting suggestions however!<br/>_________________<br/>The Game is Nothing.
