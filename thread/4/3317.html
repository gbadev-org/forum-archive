    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I assume you mean creating files on the GBA. Well there are probably some ways to do it. Remember you can program a file system yourself. There is a windows port to the GBA if I remember. Maybe look at that. I'm not sure what you want to do. You can obviously use the SRAM (Save RAM) to save things to and turn off the GBA. 
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps, if you could be more clear I'll try to give a better answer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If it's the case, then you might be missing a point, this is GBA dev. Still, there is one way, and it is to create a save which is actually dumped on the Pc by the emulator.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out.

I'm not sure what's the maximum amount the emulator will allow you to Read/Write though, but the Gba allow a maximum of 64k.

This file is created as soon as you 'save data', taking the name of your rom + .sav for it's filename.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out. (Hoare's Law of Large Programs)
