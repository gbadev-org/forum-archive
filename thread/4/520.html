MULTIBOOT

(picked up somewhere on the forum as i remember)
<br/>
<br/>
I am not quite sure if it works, since i don't have a mbv cable,
<br/>
but with visualboyadvane i can see the ROM code at 0x8000000
<br/>
is duplicated in 0x2000000 RAM. So i think that works fine for me.
<br/>
<br/>
But now the though part (it is for me) how to get the right header for my homemade ROM file(s) ?
<br/>
If I use the gba bios file in visualboyadvance, my game will simply not start.
<br/>
I would realy like my game to be complety GBA compatible, I am not planning to take out the bios in my GBA (it just doesn't seem to be right).
<br/>
Is there a tool available which patches the ROM file?
<br/>
<br/>
bye
