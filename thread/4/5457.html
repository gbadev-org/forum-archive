You could try out <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=4578&amp;highlight=fxe" target="_blank">FXE3</a> if you want something better than the LZ77 compression that the BIOS supports.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

png is a open format. Plenty of open cource compressors and decompressors around.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've found that FXE3, APack, and Pucrunch are about neck-and-neck when compressed files compared side by side.  Usually APack wins, but sometimes Pucrunch wins, and sometimes FXE3 wins.  Usually the order (from worst to best) is FXE3, Pucrunch, Apack.
<br/>
<br/>
Apack decompresses extremely fast, since any uncompressed data doesn't need to be shifted around.  But it looks like it has some strings attached for the compressor.
<br/>
<br/>
LZMA blows all of those out of the water, and PAQ seems to be unbeatable in terms of compressed file size, even though it is extremely slow.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The same site has both compressor and decompressor - just on different areas of the site.  You need to dig for it a touch.  I'd send you ours, but I've modified signifigantly to make it decompress at a reasonable speed - roughly twice as slow as the built in LZ decompressor as opposed to x10 slower.
