Well well well! What do we have here?
<br/>
Do I smell piracy,
<br/>
or is it just me?
<br/>
<br/>
We would kinda like an explenation.....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, you better start of by learning how to program QBASIC, then learn C for GBA, and when you know how the GBA works, learn ASM.
<br/>
Then write the intro in a hex editor.
<br/>
Viola.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually the problem is not to code the intro ... but to insert it in a way that the game still works, just after the intro :\\
<br/>
<br/>
And of course i own all the originals games (that's even kinda true h?h?) ;-P ... But u're right when u think that the intro i'm willing to do won't be used by innocent guys if that's what u want to know ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and i'm not the coder, just graphician ^^ 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, if u can't help because it's linked in a way with piracy, i can understand =)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you ever written a computer virus?  A non-resident virus inserts itself into a program by modifying the program's first jump to jump to the virus, which then jumps to the program proper after it has infected a few other files on the system.

<br/>
All GBA programs begin with a branch to _start().  Put this branch at the end of your intro and then replace the original branch with a branch to the intro.  Then stick the intro after the first several KB of the ROM.  But make sure to call RegisterRamReset() in the BIOS before you branch back to the main program.
<br/>
<br/>
If I were writing an intro, I would start a multiboot minigame (see the 4K competition for inspiration) and then require the user to press start to start the actual game.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
