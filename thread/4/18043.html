    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I've been lurking on these forums for a while and have been pretty busy with school. So I thought I'd take a minute to make a thread and pose a question. Thankfully this site is open source and so are the games hosted here. Personally I have a hard time with learning things straight out of the book. I'm better with taking an existing product tearing it down and rebuilding it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've done this with old computers since I was 9 and HTML, PHP, CSS, and BB since I was 12. I'm interested in making an RPG for the GBA of course, and want to know, what would be the best game for me to tear down to anylize for learning. I can't quite get myself to focus with the TONC manual and on top of that have schooling that needs to be attended to. 
<br/>
<br/>
So a short game would be nice but if it's long and full of features and source code I'll take it. Also I'm solo at the moment so if anyone would like to help me out I'm still learning and have no graphical skillS(suck at pixel art). So maybe some software tips or recommendations would be awesome. Right now I have devkitADV and devkitARM I am primarly using ADV cause I haven't tried ARM out much.<br/>_________________<br/>____________________________

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd be happy to hand you the source code for <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tolberts.net/anguna" target="_blank">Anguna</a> and let you bombard me with questions, if that would be helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
The source code is a giant mess (it was a learning project!) and in some places, it's significantly more complicated than it needed to be (because of my poor design choices). But hey, that's life.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's awesome dude yeah I'd be more then happy to use a learning project. That would be perfect as a matter of fact. It's crazy that there are still people out there who continue to work on this stuff and learn it xD.<br/>_________________<br/>____________________________
