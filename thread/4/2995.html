    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
I have a question which has continued to bug me for a while.
<br/>
It regards having more than one sprite with their own speed settings, I want the different sprites to move at different speeds.
<br/>
The first thing that springs to mind is to add more pixels to the current position, for example moving right:
<br/>
sprite_Avelocity =1 which will add 2 pixels to the current x coord of sprite_A.
<br/>
sprite_Bvelocity =5 which will add 5 pixels to the current x coord of sprite_B.
<br/>
<br/>
This creates a couple of other problems, not only does the movment appear jerky but it totally messes up the collision detection which should only test one pixel at a time and  by skipping 5 pixels then the sprite can, in effect, walk through solid objects.
<br/>
<br/>
My sprites are updated and tested every loop of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a method which I can use so that the collision detection will work, make the sprites move smoothly and at different speeds?
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks
<br/>
