    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that there are many webpages that cover 3D topics.  However, it would be great to see a joint effort here to develope a simple program for all to see that draws a single object with texturing and lighting having rotation controlled by the keys.  This way we could all share ideas for the best code on the AGB platform.  So how about it?<br/>_________________<br/>mov  r0,#Thought

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking more of doing the 3D calcualtions from sctarch.  There are so many people who would be interested in see it all done.  Then it can all be compiled into a tutorial when finished..  It need not be cutting edge or real accurate.  Doing math with shifts or just using a lookup table of sine values.  I have only done some 3D on a calcualtor so it would be great to see how it unfolds on a gameboy.  Further, I propose that we not use matrix because this can hide whats going, but instead sticking with simple bytes loaded from the cart to memory to have the straight foware math opperations performed on on them the writen back to the cart (flash ;)...

However I would really enjoy haveing a tutorial for 3D graphics on GBA, as most tutorials about 3D assumes more or less you are codeing for a PC, which have more then enough power to handle everything, not like GBA which has very limited amount of CPU power...
<br/>
Also one could add special tricks one uses in when codeing for GBA as we have a hardware system...<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

Areta is an organization of coders codeing mostly open source project, but there is alot of sections like GBA dev, Language learning communities, RPG communities, etc...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you can find a lot of old (386/486 era) PC tutorials that explains you do draw 3D stuff with very limited power. For example : <a class="postlink" href="http://peroxide.dk/tuts.shtml" target="_blank">http://peroxide.dk/tuts.shtml</a> (Pascal and C++ tuts)

<br/>
But that is true, you can use GBA hardware capabilities to do better and faster :o)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually I was just thinking about learning 3d programming, I did vector maths at uni and hated it, I'm hoping its mostly simple stuff you're talking about (please, _please_).
<br/>
Anyway maybe it would be easier using a 3d graphics library, rather than building it from scratch as that can include a lot of theory.<br/>_________________<br/>microkernel advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
