    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've heard of some kind of header that must be included if code is going to run on hardware as a multiboot program. Can someone tell me what this is? I've so far only tested my programs on emulators and they work fine. My MBV2 cable arrives tomorrow though. So is there anything I will need to change or add to get my code to run on hardware?
<br/>
If it is a header (with the multiboot setup stuff or whatever) can someone provide a link or cut+paste it?
<br/>
<br/>
As you may be able to tell, I'm really looking forward to running my code on hardware.
