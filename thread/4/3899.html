    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The ideas are not the same.  As you learn more about the GBA, you'll realize that it's far more limited than a general-purpose platform like DirectX.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, it's entirely possible to implement the same engine on GBA and PC.  Since the GBA is the limiting factor, you should design the interface to suit the GBA's hardware, rather than trying to make the GBA emulate a more flexible system.  I tried it, and it worked pretty well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DirectX is too abstract for the GBA. It constantly passes interfaces back and forth between functions, which a waste of time on an embedded platform. Besides, the GBA is quite easy to program. Take 4 weeks with the system and you will pretty much grasp enough to port a simple 2D game.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
