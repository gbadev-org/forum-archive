It's full screen 240x160 texturing. There's even a
<br/>
limited functionality demo you can download.
<br/>
<br/>
It uses an OpenGL-ES like 3D graphics library
<br/>
of my own devising.
<br/>
<br/>
Would like to know if people are interested in
<br/>
OpenGL-ES functionality for the GBA, and in
<br/>
particular what approach to hidden surface
<br/>
removal - would developers want a full Z-buffer
<br/>
with an 80k hit, or some other system (S-buffer,
<br/>
convex only objects, painters algorithm, etc 
<br/>
etc?)
<br/>
<br/>
Feedback welcome on this thread.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very nice demo.  I know I would be interested in a OpenGL-like library for the gba.  Looks like its coming along really nicely.  I hope you release that library to the public soon (along with some nice documentation :)<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind".

I think that a lot of peoples would like to see such a nice 3d library for GBA, it is cool ;)
<br/>
Maybe you should turn the walking/turning speed a little up in the demo...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I like untextured polygons on the gba,
<br/>
in fact i want to use them for creating an
<br/>
f-zero like game/demo, it probably needs a z-buffer.
<br/>
<br/>
It's too bad i like raycasting less, but still good work!<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
