    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been searching the web for a simple and understandable tutorial that explains the jargon or a self explanatory software for creating GBA games. I would much appreciate it if i were given some suggestions as to where to look.

Thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hope you haven't given up on a reply.  Unfortunately, the GBA has pretty much been abandoned (buena suerte for finding much on the GBC!), as just about everybody has gone to the DS.  Which means (as you found) that almost all of the "getting started" tutorials, etc., are all gone!  Many downloads, examples, ideas, etc., are also gone.  Fortunately, I have copies of much of the GBA development software, and will gladly provide it for download as needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a getting-started tutorial, which looks pretty good: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm" target="_blank">http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I enjoy GBA devving.  For one, the link port is a pretty attractive feature, making interfacing to electronics very easy.  Actually, it's fun!  Hardware RS-232, 4-bit I/O, shift-clock...it's all there.  Admittedly, as you might guess from my username, I prefer to program in ASM.  If you've done a lot of ASM programming, it's certainly something to look into, as then you have 100% control of the GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
The main development tool for the GBA (and DS) is DevKitPro (<a class="postlink" href="http://devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">http://devkitpro.org/</a>.)  Download the automated installer here <a class="postlink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/Automated%20Installer/</a>.  DevKitPro is still being updated, and it's what I use.  DevKitPro comes with Programmers Notepad and quite a few examples for each platform.  (I prefer PSPad for code editing <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pspad.com/en/" target="_blank">http://www.pspad.com/en/</a>: it's much better, but you have to set it up.) Personally, when getting started on a new platform, I look for example code and full documentation, and then start tinkering and tweaking with those.  Emulators make it really easy to test revisions.
<br/>
<br/>
Another programming environment you might find easy to use (depending on your programming background) is DragonBasic.  Yes, BASIC for the GBA.  (I have versions 1.3 to 1.4.5.)  It also has some examples.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and by the way, I've written a BASIC and ASM IDE for the GBA, called "bASMic".  I wrote it for the purpose of making hardware interfacing easier: edit and run code right there on the GBA.  If you're looking to make serious projects, however, it's not what you're looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  I'll check this forum more often.  It is quite enjoyable to help get another wannabe GBA developer off the ground!<br/>_________________<br/>"Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things."

Don't worry, all of the other tutorials generally sucked compared to Tonc that you linked to. It was always the best resource for learning GBA programming. The community may have dried up and moved on, but there's still a ton of information out there, and a few of us that still check these forums semi-regularly, that can help with specific questions. Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Glad to be of assistance.  If you have more questions, please be patient for replies.  As gauauu said, "...a few of us still check these forums semi-regularly."  Nobody likes to wait...but each of us have our own schedules, and may be busy with something else.

Currently, I'm working on a JPEG decoder in 100% ASM...finally fixed a really pesky bug, and have a few little math errors to fix before it's finished.  Goes fast, too...and I have yet to optimize it!<br/>_________________<br/>"Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things."
