<br/>
You have to write a midi decoder, a wave synthesis note generator, and a mixer. The decoder produces 'note on', 'note off' events, and these turn on the notes which are generated by the generator which sends them to the mixer.
<br/>
<br/>
The general opinion of others around here is not to waste your time on midi (at least for games)...
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to hear my effort at playing midis, it's available on my web-site as a plug-in for pogoshell, in a V0.8 version with not-very-optimised samples.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another option if you just want something quickly is to convert the midi to a mod file and use one of the "free" mod players to play that.
<br/>
<br/>
Modtracker or ptmid convert midis to mods with varying rates of success.

Neimod works pretty well for playback and is probably the easiest modplayer to add to a gcc project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except for the fact that when Catapult used it Nmod (as it is called) isnt avaible anymore for public use. (officially anyways, I still got the files from when they appeared on gbadev.org the first time, all three of em ;))<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believe I have the solution to all your trouble!  Look!
<br/>
1) Create or find a sample set of the instruments you use in your MIDI music.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Write a tool that reads your MIDI files and outputs a binary or whatever format you want (you're in charge!) which will be used by the GBA software during music playback.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Write software for the GBA which takes the data output by your tool in 2) and plays it back on the GBA using the samples you choose.  You can decide (!) if you want to use the old school GB-type music registers in your music playback.
<br/>
<br/>
You can alternately reverse the order of 2) and 3) above, that is, you could write the GBA player code before the MIDI tool, if that's how your brain works.
<br/>
<br/>
Do that and your problem is solved!
<br/>
