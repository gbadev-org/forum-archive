<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get my feet wet, so to speak, with GBA devleopment. I've had a bit of C/C++ experience and I'm just beginning to learn the GBA specific stuff. I've got devkitPro/devkitARM with libgba set up on my Linux system, and I tried compiling the GBA examples. All of them work on my NDS w/ GBAMP, *except* for ansi_console.gba and the "hello world" template.gba. Though, they all work in VirtualBoyAdvance. I've done some researching and haven't been able to find a solution to this.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any idea what's going wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
In VisualBoyAdvance, do they work if renamed to end in .mb? The GBAMP can only run multiboot programs, which load entirely into RAM.[1] In general, if a GBA program works as .mb in VBA, it'll work on a GBAMP.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Er, yeah, I meant Visual Boy Advance... and nope, they don't work with a .mb extension. I get the same problem in VBA as I get on my NDS, a blank white screen. How would I fix that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
