    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I have two sprites and the one with higher OAM priority partially or completely obscures the other, will the obscured pixels consume rendering cycles for that sprite?
<br/>
<br/>
Quoth gbatek:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Caution:
<br/>
 The maximum number of OBJs per line is also affected by undisplayed (offscreen) OBJs which are having higher priority than displayed OBJs.
<br/>
 To avoid this, move displayed OBJs to the begin of OAM memory (ie. OBJ0 has highest priority, OBJ127 lowest).</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
... which would seem to imply that OBJs that aren't actually displayed still consume rendering cycles. Still, it's unclear whether this is the case or not for obscured sprites.
