    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there.
<br/>
I have seen that 1024 tiles are available for tile data in mode0..2.
<br/>
so is it possible to do an infinite scrolling ?
<br/>
A screen need (240*160)/64 tiles = 600
<br/>
 + border tiles (32+21).
<br/>
So is it possible for the GBA to refresh +/- 53 tiles data with maybe DMA transfert and a cache system to reuse the tiles in the[0..652] boudary (if the tiles to transfert are in Rom)?
<br/>
And there is also the need to keep correspondance between the tile map hardware and a tile map that indexes in a bigger image in Rom.
<br/>
there will then rest 1024-653 static tiles for the 1,2or 3 backgrounds
<br/>
<br/>
Does someone has already do this and can tell me is it is possible to do ?
<br/>
thanks, Michel</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Use one 256x256 Map. Keep two spare columns Left/Right and two spare lines (top/bottom). Scroll your map as you move, and load dynamicly the column/line, 1 at a time in the Map and the tiles. For the tiles you could just have 1 tile per map entry :
<br/>
<br/>
Map width : 240 + 8(left) + 8(Right) = 32columns
<br/>
Map height : 160 + 8(Top) + 8(Bottom) = 22lines
<br/>
Total tile per map : 32*22 = <span style="font-weight: bold">704tiles</span>
<br/>
=&gt;1.5 Layer in 256colors (minus the map entries)
<br/>
=&gt;2.9 layers in 16colors (minus the map entries)
<br/>
<br/>
Or keep track of the loaded tiles and reuse/free them as you go. Which would be much more efficient.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
