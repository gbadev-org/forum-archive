    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a good way to find particular variables values in VBA's Memory Viewer?
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a couple coordinates in a couple structs that I'd like to keep an eye on.
<br/>
<br/>
What addresses should I start looking for standard variables at?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I doubt it's the best way, but if you're not using EWRAM for anything then you can just store a pointer to your variable at the beginning of EWRAM (0x02000000). Code would probably look something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
*(unsigned int *)(0x02000000) = (unsigned int)(&amp;myVar);
<br/>
<br/>
You can repeat the process at 0x02000004, 0x02000008, etc. for other variables as well if you want.
<br/>
<br/>
Then just look in VBA's memory viewer at the start of EWRAM, at the number(s) listed there will be the addresses of the variables you want to check up on.
<br/>
<br/>
(Your variables should be in the 0x0300XXXX range, by the way.)

<br/>
<br/>
Poslundc's way is perfect.
<br/>
seems i'm decremementing a variable all the way around to FFFFFFFF, so know I know much better where to look to debug.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
