    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would suggest using a tool as it'll save you a lot of hassle but as you've said you don't want to, try making an array and editing the values by hand.

I don't know how i can see you this image so i descrive it for you like i can:
<br/>
<br/>
it is a .map file and it is all so:
<br/>
<br/>
00000060  06 1E 1E 00 00 00 00  00 00 24 24 26  ..........................
<br/>
00000070  00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 24 00  ..........................
<br/>
00000080  00 00 1E 00 00 1B 00  00 00 24 00 26  ..........................
<br/>
<br/>
What is? With What compiler i can make it? It is a file map of windows game, but it is the same for GBA game? Can you explain me the meaning?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First thing--you're very probably not going to be able to directly stick those numbers into your game. What Windows game is this? The .map extension seems familiar; is it from Mappy or something? (I'm not very familiar with that particular tool)
<br/>
   You'll need to figure out how the map data is stored, and then you'll need to write a converter tool or convert it by hand. The hex listing you have doesn't really mean anything, and from the looks of it is not compatible with a text mode BG. If you know how many tiles wide this map is, and have a longer hex listing, you might be able to see the trend of map data.
<br/>
   If you want to 'join' the array I suggest you use a bin2o program and then index into like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">value = maparray[y * mapwidth + x];</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
to test for if it is a wall or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a guess... but isn't the .map file you're looking at some compiler output? Most compilers can output a .map file which will contain some readable information about the exe/elf. If this is the case, it has nothing to do with a graphical representation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, what is a good map editor for GBA (can you give me the link)?
<br/>
<br/>
Can you give me a exemple .map file (of gba) so i can understand? Is it possible to open with a textpad?
<br/>
<br/>
However every .map file are only separate array. Is it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
