    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My LUT for rotating my background, when rotated at 0 or 90 degrees, has to use the value 0x7fff instead of 0x8000 because of the nature of 8-bit-fractional signed numbers; this gives a seemingly insignificant but misaligning artifact when rotated at these angles (one row is repeated). Is there any other way of specifying the DA/B/C/D values so that they have the full positive 0x80 out of 0x80 range for these angles?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Read the GBATEK doc and you'll see that all angles of rotation are possible.

I belive some values like theese will result in 90degrees of rotation counterclockwise:
<br/>
PA=0
<br/>
PB=1
<br/>
PC=-1
<br/>
PD=0

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I looked through there, stuff I already knew, but my problem is that I can't fully specify the number 1; I only get within 0.99996... which is really not a very big difference, but it still bugs me because one of the lines gets repeated and offsets the sprite positions for the rest of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
PA=0 
<br/>
PB=1 &lt;-- how do I do this? closest I get is 0x7fff before I reach negative numbers
<br/>
PC=-1 &lt;-- this is 0x8000
<br/>
PD=0
<br/>
<br/>
I know, I shouldn't be worrying about something that insignificant for now but it keeps sticking in my mind :(<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

afair, the hardware uses fixed point with 7bits for the whole part and 8bits for the fractional part!
<br/>
<br/>
so    1 is 0x0100 
<br/>
and -1 is 0xff00
<br/>
<br/>
cheers
