<br/>
<br/>
I would like to ask you about speed of updating BG Memory on the fly.
<br/>
<br/>
So how long does it take to initialize new tiles from memory? I don't mean by this making screen from tiles, but making new tiles from my arrays.
<br/>
<br/>
Can I change a whole BG Mem "from frame to frame", like VBL Interrupt?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm mainly using HAM, so would you consider a HAM functions speed (according to "normal" programming).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't help you with the times, but a map isn't that big,
<br/>
it's just an array of 1024 (or bigger if u use 512x512) entries that can be done on the fly, but you shouldn't overwrite the thing currently displayed
<br/>
on the screen, makes weird artifacts i thought so.
<br/>
<br/>
But instead just load it into memory a little before you need it,
<br/>
say if you need the next piece of a map, load it while the player
<br/>
is getting near the end of the first map, preloading stuff i mean.
<br/>
<br/>
Or just load it into the not currently displayed memory and then
<br/>
switch between the screen memory.
<br/>
<br/>
bye
