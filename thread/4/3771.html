    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't actually used it, but you can find source code under Sources -&gt; Computer -&gt; Sends Tools -&gt; GBA Flinker 1.72. you're in luck cause it'll only work with visoly cards, other cards have different protocols. the cartlib.c has all the code to erase, write etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I already have tried it, but could't.
<br/>
Continuously, I'm now trying to use cartlib.c for F2A cart by modifying the code.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have more info, please help me.

Cheers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
