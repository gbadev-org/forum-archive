    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Martin Korth came up with a method for finding out what was in the BIOS using a bug in one of the midi commands to read from the restricted area.  I'm not sure of the specifics though.  Basically, you set it up in a loop and have it dump the memory somewhere where you can read it.  BTW, you won't be impressed with what you see if you do get to look at it ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The SWI-routine is at $140, and it uses the byte in the SWI-opcode to look up an adress in a table at $1C8

An interesting thing is that it doesnt check if the byte is outside the table, so you can find a few SWI-numbers that jumps to ROM or RAM, which means you could use SWI to jump to your own code if you needed to (maybe for breakpoints).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Perhaps, but don't use SWIs to RAM in production code. Nintendo reserves the right to change the layout of the BIOS and add more functions in future Game Boy platforms.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
