    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
  So far, I've been working on my own little project with nothing but the tutorials on the web, and some ideas here. It's been going well so far. I have this little issue which I haven't found a solution for. I have a splash screen. When it comes up, just like in other games, it says "Press Start" but the "A" button will start the game also. Common practice in games. The thing is, when the "A" button is pressed, the splash screen goes away, the playfield is drawn, and the GBA acts as if the user pressed "A" and fires a missle. So it looks like the input carried over from the time the key was pressed to when the playfield was drawn. The thing is, I haven't found too much info on how to CLEAR key inputs. I did add a "WaitForVBlank()" to be sure that everything's timed right. So why would this keypress carry over like that? Thanks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can't really clear key inputs per se. It's up to you to keep track of how long a key has been pressed down for and whether it's been released, is a new press, etc. This usually means maintaining some kind of state information; read up on <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_state_machine" target="_blank">deterministic finite state machines</a>.

Pfft. You'd think I'd know that since I deal with that in MFC and OS X all the time using mouse clicks (detecting "button up"). I was thinking along the lines that the registers handled keypresses differently. Thanks.
