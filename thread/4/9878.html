    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello it may be a question easy to answer but I have no Idea about Compilers or how they work. 
<br/>
I know that the use of include files slows down the Compiling process (I don't care I run a pretty fast processor)
<br/>
But does the use also slows down the Binary file? Someone told me that but I'm a little bit sceptic. It would be very nice to get an answer on that Question and maybe someone could even give me a link so I can Understand Compilers an Linkers and Stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I would use the Include files for copying data to V-ram because I have to switch the Tiles very often and I also mix up the palettes so I have much and big functions</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In practice, #including data <span style="font-style: italic">may</span> be slower because of other things like alignment problems. Data that's put on word boundaries (addresses divisible by 4) allow for faster copies. #including isn't directly responsible for mis-alignments, but it does make it more likely than having separate files for data.

Everything you never wanted to know about data and build steps. Well alright maybe not, but it might help you get an idea of what goes on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
