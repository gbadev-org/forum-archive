This is part of a makefile. What is the boot type and what is gba_mb all about?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's something like that, yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
Games can have two places in memory to reside in, ROM (0x0800:0000) or EWRAM (0x0200:0000). ROM is on the game cart itself and is the standard place for games. Multiboot is when you have one cart and multiple GBAs. In that case, the game-code  is loaded into EWRAM. Well part of it, as EWRAM is a lot smaller than ROM. 
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of a cart, you can also use the PC to supply a GBA with code, via an XBoo cable, for example. You can make these for a couple of bucks, which is a lot cheaper than a flash cart. Of course, you do have a lot less room to work with, but for small demos or tests.
<br/>
<br/>
With devkitARM, you can switch between the two by using the <span style="font-style: italic">-specs</span> thing. I use use variable MB as a switch between the two, rather than changing the specs manually. The extension <span style="font-style: italic">.mb.gba</span> vs <span style="font-style: italic">.gba</span> is more a convention than anything else, but it is a useful way to keep the two apart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
