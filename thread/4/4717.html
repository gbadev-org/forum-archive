    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm new here and new in programming, but want to try it on the gba (but first I have to learn C a bit more ;-) )
<br/>
<br/>
But now I come to my question: Is it possible, to develop some kind of a mod for Pokemon Colosseum?
<br/>
I mean, that someone creates a gba game, that simulates Pokemon R/S/FR/LG and in this game you can choose any Pokemon from #1 to #386 and decide the attacks and something like that. And then you save and can fight with the Pokemon in Colosseum.
<br/>
<br/>
Why should something like that exist?
<br/>
Because in Pokemon Stadium you could choose your Pokemon for multiplayer and/or single player and fight with them. It would be great if that's possible on Pokemon Colosseum, too.
<br/>
<br/>
Thx, Ilomoga</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It might be possible to choose the pokemon and attacks, but not in the way said. If you own a copy of any of the GBA games, you could cheat in that game to get the pokemon / attacks you want, either using a gameshark or uploading/downloading the FLASH save to PC and using VBA with cheats.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that's true (so I do it at the moment), but because my Action Replay is a bit damaged I have to press the Pokemon cartridge into it during playing. But I haven't done the thing with the save cheating.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to do that with Flash2Advance Writer 3.1 with the 128K savers (I've got a F2A 256 Pro with USB)?
<br/>
<br/>
But in both cases you need the PC if you want new Pokemon. That's why I asked if there exists a software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No such software exists.  It could be made, but I think it would be cheaper just to buy a new game shark.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure how the saves are stored on the F2A but if they are simply raw save files when you transfer them to the PC, it should be possible to use them in VBA. To do so, load up the correct game in VBA (ie pokemon), go file | import | battery file, then select the correct save. When you are done, simply export the save and transfer it back to the F2A.
<br/>
The software to select pokemon is too hard to make, as it would require knowledge of the exact way the GCN reads the data from the GBA so that a decent emulation of the protocol can be performed on the GBA. Then a graphical interface would have to be made, then data for all the pokemon would have to be included. If this is starting to sound time consuming, that's because it is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
