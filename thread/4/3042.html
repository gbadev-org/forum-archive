    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to use one 256 color palette for all my sprites, but I don't know how to make a palette that will make all my sprites' colors display how I want. The program that I use to convert bmp images to an array (gfx2bga by Darren) can also make a palette for your sprites. I use that feature and when display my sprites, the colors are messed up for some of the sprites but OK for others. I tried to make a palette by putting all my sprites in an image, converting that image and taking the palette from the .h file, but they still appear not how I want them. Does anybody know how I can solve this problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that there is another graphics tool called gfx2gba FrontEnd that will convert sprites to use the same palette. A pretty nifty tool that should handle just about anything you throw at it.

If you are going to use it for sprites, make sure you check "Disable map output".<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
