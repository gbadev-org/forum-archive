    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, it seems like many games just have a small-ish tilemap in hardware, then they dynamically write new tilemap data into the map area as the player moves around.  Since the data is written into off-screen areas, the player should never realise what's happening...it will just seem like they are in a very large area.  It's all about illusions. :)

As you may have guessed, this method is not as easy as just using a static tile map.  If you are just getting started, I might recommend going the easier route for now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
