    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone ever done a PRO/CON comparison of SGADE versus HAM? I am a newbie and I am trying to decide which to use.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact that the SGADE is free is definately something, but it seems that HAM has more support.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Could anyone shed some light on this? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well HAM isn't free, but $29 is cheap enough imho. Don't know the difference, but if the price is the only thing keeping you off HAM. Then go for HAM. It is only HAMlib that costs, so you can still use only HAM or try HAMlib out until you have decided, then register. Well worth the money.<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SGADE has basic 3d support.. and has a series of mode 4 abstraction classes (it appears)..
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have had severe problems getting HAM to work under Windows XP SP1, whereas SGADE/DevKit Advance, etc.. all work fine. The only way I got it running was using a virtual pc running WINDOWS (ANYTHING ELSE) and compile there, then run it on my actual pc (in vba).
<br/>
<br/>
When I found SGADE I wondered if that was a better bet... but there seems to be a lot more support for HAM.. although no-one can help me with my install probs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
