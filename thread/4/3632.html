    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Patching a rom of a cart you own is not illegal if you dumped and patched the rom yourself (first sale rights). Distributing a translation patch in IPS format is *probably* not illegal (unless the company claim copyright on the text itself; translation of text is normally considered fair use, though) because the IPS only contains the new bytes, not the old ones.
<br/>
<br/>
How to do it:
<br/>
1) Buy the game
<br/>
2) Dump it and run it under a debugger to find the code that displays text boxes (or whatever is the equivalent in the game)
<br/>
3) Hack on the code so that it will display ASCII chars instead of kana/kanji (if it's a CJK game, otherwise you don't need to)
<br/>
4) Replace the strings that the code displays; this may require reorganising data to fit it in if the translation is longer (very likely for CJK games) which will probably mean adjusting some kind of string index table to point to new addresses.
<br/>
5) Make a patch with some format that does not contain the original bytes (i.e. IPS)
<br/>
6) Ask a lawyer for a opinion on whether distributing the translated text is legal.
<br/>
7) If you can't assure yourself that it is, then you can still patch your own copy and play it yourself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
