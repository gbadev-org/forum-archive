    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually I have read up till the end of chapter 4 and he has stated several times that ham will compile any gcc code without using the hamlib. And that he will show you how to do both. Chapter four I think has four code excercises. Two use hamlib and two don't. It seems all the excercises that did use hamlib were only because they required a text engine (since it's hard to implement from the beginning of a book).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't pre-order the book because I was afraid it was going to be based purely on ham and I've had bad luck in the past with other peoples wrappers getting in the way of my programs performance and needs.
<br/>
<br/>
In the first few chapters he helps you set up visual ham as an IDE. He then shows a few hamlib shortcuts for the time being and promises to show you how to do it by hand for projects that you want fine hardware control over.
<br/>
<br/>
Very few books (if any) in my pc programming library say this is how you do this in directx but if you wanted to do it on your own please look at the next example where I show you how to do this by hand or even using some other great tool written by a community expert.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end I may be wrong about this and he may turn purely ham on me. But don't turn the book away thinking its not going to teach you anything unless its based on ham. 
<br/>
<br/>
Give him your support for trying to go against the system and help our community with a formal reference. I much rather have a book infront of me than have to scour forums for hours to try and glean the answer I need off of someone elses posts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have read both Chapter 5 and 6(amazing how he puts them in .pdf format so fast) and there is some hamlib in there. However, in Chapter 6 (tiled mode) he goes to teach you how to load a tile set and map without hamlib.
<br/>
<br/>
I think he mixes both hamlib and straight coding together to make it easier for a newbie to learn the gba. Works really well, too.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#13538 - RaBBi - Tue Dec 16, 2003 10:11 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes he didn't let Ham manage the memory, so you know exactly where you load everything, in CBB and SBB for example.
<br/>
<br/>
As a Ham user, I think I'll do that way in the futur to have more control.
<br/>
<br/>
But I found examples too easy (that's a good point anyway, it means I progress ! lol) and he jumps over "bad" optimization of tiles number with gfx2gba.
<br/>
<br/>
And I think that's an important point to focus.
<br/>
In his example, after use gfx2gba for map/tiles, instead of having 64 tiles (he use 4 big tiles of 32x32 pixels one), the command line soft returns 906 optimized tiles !!
<br/>
<br/>
I think there"s a problem with this soft...I used it and now I understand why my tiles data was often too big...
<br/>
Anyone know this problem and how to solve?<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The files are on his site (I think) but there is a fee for them which is used to maintain the site.
