    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need a program that will write directly to the flash cart
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Flash 2 Advance Ultra 256mb
<br/>
It comes with a "power writer" program
<br/>
<br/>
but it writes its own little OS in there
<br/>
<br/>
I tried an older program but it said it didnt recognize my cart
<br/>
anyone with a F2A ultra 256 know a good program to write directly to the cart?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>_________________<br/>---------

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most of the flash card programs that write their own OS can be told through a preferences form that you'll be writing only one ROM. You may want to look into this. Or has another F2AU cart owner already looked into this and found that the F2AU software doesn't support making a single-ROM cart?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">with the f2a you can't tell it not to install the boot loader, but you CAN specify what rom to use as a bootloader. Set your rom to the boot loader in the config screen and ignore the warning that you're only installing a loader and no files. It'll work just fine.<br/>_________________<br/>"Only two things are infinite: the universe, and human stupidity.
