    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, im currently working on a game engine and was starting to put some sound in.  Ive used the tutorial here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1823.asp" target="_blank">http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1823.asp</a> to do sound.  I modified the code so as it could run while everything else is happening (characters running jumping etc.)  The problem is that the sound sample i am using to test the code, starts running one loop in.  So the sample goes for 8 seconds and for the first 8 seconds of the game, its silent, then it kicks in and loops normally.  Has anyone had a problem like this before?

thanks in advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you using a timer ot count the 8 seconds?  If so, you probably forgot that once you start a timer, it only interrupts after the 8 seconds have gone bye.  I think you can fix this by either doing an IF |= TMx, or by executing the copy function at the start of the sound loop.

Yes, I've done this too. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ended up just initialising my sound counter to the end of the sample so it ticks over to a new sample straight away, but thanks for the help, cleared up some stuff ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
