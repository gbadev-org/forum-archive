<br/>
<br/>
i'm using devkitadv (r4) for fairly some time now and never had any major trouble with it, until now:
<br/>
<br/>
i'm working on a large project and recently, gcc came up with the error msg "internal compiler error in arm_reorg, at config/arm/arm.c".
<br/>
<br/>
since it seems to be a bug in the dev-env and not in my code, i tried to d/l and install R5, with which i'm able to compile all the c-sources.
<br/>
But when it comes to linking, ld.exe (obviously) is looking for some libs to include. However it's unable to find the lib 'gcc' (using the flag -lgcc)
<br/>
<br/>
am i missing a file in the release?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any help
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't normally use the standard library on GBA, but I know you can manually specify the path to libgcc.a for a temporary fix. There seem to be quite a lot of copies of it though, all slightly different sizes, but they're in devkitadv\lib\gcc-lib\arm-agb-elf\3.2.2 and some subfolders from there.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">okay, i've found the error....
<br/>
the path in my makefile was incorrect....some folder is named after the version of gcc (which of course changed in R5).
<br/>
<br/>
now i only need to get everything to work with the crt0.s and lnkscript of the devkit.....

<br/>
thanks,
