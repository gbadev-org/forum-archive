For instance, I may want to prove that the red targeting icon appears on an enemy iff the player's 'target' data member points to that enemy.  Those are the more difficult proofs, and it becomes very important to arrange code specifically to allow such things to be proven easily, e.g. by funneling all assignments to the 'target' variable through one method, and hiding the variable from all other code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have not yet in my career encountered a situation where I've been required to "prove a theorem" using sentential calculus. (I would not discount the possibility that it may be required of me some day. Perhaps if I ever work on something that isn't a game but is safety-critical. Or if I need to do automated proving for something like an AI system or optimizing compiler.)
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I use rules of inference every day in the code I write, although I don't usually bother to write things out with any formality (perhaps my code would have fewer errors if I did). I also do informal proofs on rare occasions (usually picking out a single method of proof) to test that my reasoning is sound.

Speaking as someone who interviews programmers fairly often, one of the things that tires me greatly is the frequency with which I see programmers who went to a trade-based college (ie. Video Game Highschool), did a bunch of projects and doesn't have the slightest bit of formal training to allow them to extrapolate beyond any code they've already been asked to write.
<br/>
<br/>
As such, lately I've taken to asking for a simple demonstration of applying DeMorgan's Theorem in most interviews (although whether or not they know the theorem by name is moot; it just lets us speed through the question if they do). This was intended as a lowball, warm-up question until it became apparent just how few candidates could do it, even with coaching.
<br/>
<br/>
(I am of the opinion that <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> programmer worth their salt should be able to apply DeMorgan's Theorem in their head, whether or not you know how to do a formal proof or know any latin symbols.)
<br/>
<br/>
When you say "I don't understand how to put crap into symbols or writing" it smacks of the same kind of impatience, laziness and sense of entitlement that I see all too often in these second-rate candidates. You may spend a career in video games without ever having to do a formal proof. But if that's your attitude to doing things that are closely related to your field but don't involve specifically hammering out the code (and the interviewer in me wonders, how does he take to writing documentation, or doing thorough testing for errors in his code?), then I hope it isn't at my company.

If you haven't been using DeMorgan's Theorem in years, then you either haven't been writing very much code, or haven't been putting much thought into it when you do. Either way, I'm a lot less likely to give you the thumbs up for hiring.
<br/>
<br/>
(Alternately, I suppose I could say that you have not been both writing much code and putting much thought into it.)
<br/>
<br/>
The question isn't whether or not they know DeMorgan's Theorem outright; as I said, that's just the fasttrack to the end of the question. The question is to perform a simple boolean transformation. And I'm not one to normally make generalizations, but whether it's through memory, technique, intuition or experience (and any of those four should be sufficient solve it), <span style="font-style: italic">any competent programmer</span> should be able to do it.

I guess that's the difference between engineers and computer science people then. If I am faced with changing AND into an equivalent OR expression, I am most likely already knee deep in some minute optimisation. For initial high level programming to solve a specific problem DeMorgan's Theorem certainly isn't needed (said the engineer).
<br/>
<br/>
But I see your point: If it's day to day stuff that comes with the formal training, then people being interviewed for a job should know it. I agree with you there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

doh.
<br/>
<br/>
For "initial high level programming" you should at least be able to tell if a solution to a problem is even computeable. Transformation of problems (and thus deMorgan) is certainly needed for this in the most cases.
<br/>
<br/>
It is a common technique to check wether a problem is not solveable in acceptable time by checking if this problem is aquivalent to a NP-hard problem like the SAT-Problem. To do so DeMorgan is nearly essential.
<br/>
<br/>
This allready applies to the design phase. I hope you dont blindly start to code for profesional (job) purposes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This engineer (and yes, I am very much an engineer, accredited so) says that if you never refactor a conditional pattern as it evolves then you probably aren't thinking about the readability and maintainability of your conditions. Which is something I've observed quite a lot in more amateur code, actually: complicated conditional expressions that nobody can hope to follow because the author couldn't be bothered (or didn't know how) to simplify as they went.

In the case of formulae, a simple formula is easier to handle, but the first version is usually easier to understand, so I have to disagree on that point at least. I agree that the readability and maintainability of code certainly is very important, though. Imho, making people comment their code is more important to achieving that end, than thinking about how to simplify the odd section of code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
i also know many students doing very similar programs and they ask why they have to learn all this hardware stuff like c-programming, assembler programming and logic gates.

You did, however, imply that comments are more effective than refactoring, and that simply isn't the case.
<br/>
<br/>
We aren't splitting hairs over what is and what isn't the right way (or the "engineering" way) to code here. I've got a stack of textbooks that can already disagree with each other plenty in that regard. It simply boils down to that whether you're taught it in school or not, effective, conscientious programming requires frequent logic transformations, be they in your head or in the code.
<br/>
<br/>
If I see a programmer that's written a lot of code while being able to bypass picking up those skills one way or another, it's almost invariably a positive indicator that this person lacks the experience, schooling or discipline to write code with the kind of ownership and responsibility I need from them.

<br/>
  Thats the left brain , textual "induction" .
<br/>
<br/>
  The Right side is 1000 times faster at Induction ,
<br/>
 but does not use left side textual translation .
<br/>
<br/>
   The Right side sees pictures , with "connected"
<br/>
  value judgements . "Imagination"
<br/>
<br/>
   Left , sees values only .  It gets values from
<br/>
 the public . I.E. the English grammar system .
<br/>
<br/>
  Thus you can not program computers with the
<br/>
 left side .
<br/>
<br/>
    In programming , we use the buzz word "symbolic"
<br/>
 to mean assigning an image to a memory location
<br/>
  or proceedure or anything you like .
<br/>
<br/>
  To be 100% symbolic , is G.U.I. , but not the lies
<br/>
 you get from Bill Gates , a true GUI has NO text .
<br/>
<br/>
   When i edit text , its a pain to put thought to
<br/>
 paper , but when i do symbolic , i can modify
<br/>
 the image , till anyone anywhere on earth will
<br/>
  instantly imagine it .
<br/>
<br/>
   This is the future of software !  And its much easier
<br/>
  to create ur own G.U.I. , w/o C++ , nor Cobol ,
<br/>
  nor VBASIC .
<br/>
<br/>
    Because once you imagine how to do it , 
<br/>
 it surprises you , there is NO translation in
<br/>
 your left side , it goes straigth to the Right
<br/>
 side and you code it without any reading
<br/>
  thick doc/manuals !!  
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      1)   Programming 1000 times faster than C++ !
<br/>
      2) NO arbitrary 101Key KB needed , cause you will
<br/>
 redefine the keys to suit you !
<br/>
      3)  you can code lowest level , but think
<br/>
 at the highest level !  
<br/>
       4)  It reaches absurd levels , I.E. booting an
<br/>
    ARM7 with no opsys at all , using 2 keys and
<br/>
   a bw LCD !  You can route all the expensive s/w
<br/>
 on earth , you can disassemble copyrighted code
<br/>
 in seconds , because you dont do the hacking , 
<br/>
  the G.U.I. automates the code scan !
<br/>
<br/>
    I dont want to delete the EEPROM in NDS , and
<br/>
 start at the bottom , because the DS BIOS is actually
<br/>
  very good . 
<br/>
<br/>
   So i need a Viewer/debugger/peek/poke  .bin
<br/>
 to load into my 10 DS Lites .   Im a developer .
<br/>
  I have M#-Simply-1GB-SD .
<br/>
<br/>
  But everything i download , dont work !
<br/>
<br/>
   Drunkencoders gave me "Memory Viewer"
<br/>
  but no info on who runs it !
<br/>
   The Japaneese   MOONSHL , in  the M3 , 
<br/>
  wont run .BIN .
<br/>
<br/>
  Where can i get a RAM vu'r/debugger ?

 Easier method to program and interact and work
<br/>
<br/>
 with computers .  Unfortunately , it will remove 
<br/>
<br/>
 WIZARD status from millions of ppl employed in
<br/>
<br/>
 computers ,  sorry abou that .
<br/>
<br/>
  It removes all the detail , and leaves only the
<br/>
<br/>
 logic , so we can program clearly and 100 times
<br/>
<br/>
 faster .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Now its your turn ,  
<br/>
<br/>
  tell us about C++ and how powerful  and fast it is !    
<br/>
<br/>
  And how anyone can script it to do powerful things !
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Im developing s/w for the new ARM cpu's .
<br/>
<br/>
  No need to learn modern language like English
<br/>
<br/>
 or German , you can program it w/o text or 
<br/>
<br/>
  any schooling ...

  "...every active thread " ?    Gross lies .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   You are an obstructionist .  You protect your belabored
<br/>
 methods , to impress , to be a WIZARD , because you
<br/>
 can not compete .  
<br/>
<br/>
 I give new , easier methods to program the 10 DS Lites
<br/>
 i own . 
<br/>
<br/>
 These methods will cut waste by 500% , by eliminating
<br/>
 the "definition" of definitions , that all programmers ,
<br/>
  use . It will be a free method to use touch screen to
<br/>
 program in minutes , what takes you days !
<br/>
   No "commands" to learn , just drag your finger
<br/>
 across the screen and if you like what it did , use it ,
<br/>
 if you did not undestand , try something else .
<br/>
<br/>
   This is the most productive programming .
<br/>
 No manuals , no tutrials , just get 'hands on"
<br/>
 and start programming .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Your job will be  eliminated .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When you say "I don't understand how to put crap into symbols or writing" it smacks of the same kind of impatience, laziness and sense of entitlement that I see all too often in these second-rate candidates. You may spend a career in video games without ever having to do a formal proof. 
<br/>
<br/>
   But if that's your attitude to doing things that are closely related to your field but don't involve specifically hammering out the code (and the interviewer in me wonders, how does he take to writing documentation, or doing thorough testing for errors in his code?), then I hope it isn't at my company.

 Scatter brain .  Can he code , or can he write , which ?
<br/>
<br/>
  Coders can't write , because coding is Right cerebral C' 
<br/>
 100% of writters work from the Left C' C' . 
<br/>
<br/>
 I am a scientist , and progammer .
<br/>
<br/>
  Would you care to compete with me ? 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I do programming , im the worlds fastest systems
<br/>
  programmer .
<br/>
<br/>
   What makes me the best , is , I toss anything that
<br/>
  interferes with clear , concepts and productivity .  
<br/>
<br/>
    The English language is a detour to good programming ,
<br/>
 it is ambigous , arbitrary , so i toss it , i dont use anything
<br/>
 that would be misunderstood .
<br/>
   I have no source code , you must get your hands
<br/>
 on my s/w and USE it , and if you have no imagination
<br/>
 , then you wont get anything from it .
<br/>
    Programming is ALL imagination and zero 
<br/>
  copying . 
<br/>
<br/>
  This is a fast changing world of computers , 
<br/>
very soon , no one will use Linux nor C .
<br/>
<br/>
  Owners try to protect their h/w and s/w . It's
<br/>
  It is  useless .  New h/w , obsoletes old CPU's
<br/>
 and the fast programmers , create everything
<br/>
 new , and you end up with NOTHING to protect !
<br/>
<br/>
   I've seen it many times , this time will be the elimination
<br/>
  of 99% of the people in computers .
<br/>
     You also .   There will be no game programmers
<br/>
  no C/C++ programmers , BASIC will never be 
<br/>
  heard of and ultimately the word Software will
<br/>
  be eliminated from the dictionary , the CPU will
<br/>
 be programmed at high level , using images ONLY .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    You wont have a position as moderator , because
<br/>
 the arguements here will stop ...

If one were to take your refusal to give a demonstration of a single system you've ever programmed as an indication that you haven't ever programmed a system of any kind, it would make you infinitely fast, even.

I don't really have time to compete; I'm too busy writing code at my job, where they pay me to do that sort of thing, mostly because it results in something tangible that can run on a computer and people can use.

Good to know that your non-source-code and imagination have made me obsolete, though! Let me know how that works out.
