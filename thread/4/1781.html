    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know if there are any efforts to port Linux to the GBA?  I figured that if people are trying to port that OS to the iPod (which also uses an ARM7TDMI, albeit a 133 MHz version), some hacker must be trying to do it for the GBA.  Though I'm not trying to start any movement here, I'd be curious to hear about other's efforts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would have to be the Embedded Linux version, since the GBA has no MMU, but other than that..

I'd say there is little use for linux on GBA, but I guess someone might find the challenge intresting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wouldn't getting Linux up and running on the GBA require some highly platform-specific changes to the code?  I ask because it seems like porting Linux to the iPod required a non-trivial amount of work due to iPod-specific issues.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd guess the same thing.  Perhaps it would make sense if someone wanted to create a Palm-like environment on the GBA which allows people to plug in apps through a relatively simple API, but I don't care to say how viable that idea is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
