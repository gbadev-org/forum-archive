    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone have a project file for Visual Studio 6.0 that will allow me to compile and build with DevKitARM?
<br/>
<br/>
I've been using Visual HAM as my IDE, but I like the Visual Assit add-in that I have for Visual Studio.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, will the project file allow me to easily add files to the project?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't say there is a project file you could use, but Makefiles are the thing with VS. Check on the forums, you'll find them. I posted the Makefile that I use on one the the threads.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, sorry, you said project file not makefile.  On the main gbadev.org page, Go to the tools-&gt;misc tools section and get "GBA Project Appwizard" and "VCMake".  I've been using those together for awhile and they seem ok.  Although, the stuff GBA Project Appwizard generates is a little bit out of date, I think was made for the old DevKitAdvance instead of DevKitARM, but it should be a good starting point.  The makefile in particular needs a little tweaking to work right, but see if the makefiles from the samples on <a href="http://www.devkit.tk" target="_blank">www.devkit.tk</a> will work (I haven't tried).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a template project that you can load into Visual Studio that has all the settings ready to go, or do you make a project each time with the makefile and add your source files to that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
