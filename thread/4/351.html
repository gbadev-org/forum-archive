    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I've just installed HAM on two PCs. Both identical apart from their OSs. One runs Win2k the other Win98SE. When I do a make on the 98 machine it stalls at a couple of points during the build. A small program will take a few minutes to compile. Anybody else had this after a new install?
<br/>
TIA</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
After painstaking searching, it turns out that in order for the HAM tools to run without stalling, I need a compact flash card in my USB CF reader (or to uninstall the driver). No big deal - but strage eh?!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cygwin has a slight bug that makes it delay for quite a while if a mounted volume is unreadable. To avoid this delay, you have to put media in each drive, disconnect drives you aren't using, or change the Cygwin config files.  (I don't know deep cygwin wizardry so I can't help you there.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Does anyone out there know how to edit the cygwin config? TIA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
