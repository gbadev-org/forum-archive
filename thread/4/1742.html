    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am making this game wich has a set of sprites on screen (10 in total) wich are 8x16 and blue. They are supposed to give an indication of how much time a person has left before it is too late.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is with my getting it properly displayed. I have used a global s16 variable wich helps me getting the right number of sprites displayed. When I leave that variable alone I see another sprite animating as it should and the timer (one sprite for the timer for now) as it should.
<br/>
<br/>
But when I put in the keypad function
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
void keypad(void)
<br/>
{
<br/>
         if (KEYS &amp; KEY_A)
<br/>
         {
<br/>
              timerfunc--;
<br/>
         }
<br/>
}
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I only see the sprite for a second and then it is gone without me pressing a button.
<br/>
<br/>
The timerfunc variable is only used for this occasion.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone tell me what is going wrong here?<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">are you calling keypad in the main while loop? your keypad function is actually checking to see if A is not pressed - you have to check if the bit is cleared to see if A is pressed:
<br/>
<br/>
if(!(KEYS &amp; KEY_A))
<br/>
{
<br/>
    timerfunc--;
<br/>
}</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
