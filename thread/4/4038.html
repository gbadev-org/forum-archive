    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's the purpose of bios functions. I lately read a thread about how much overhead the swi instruction actually creates. So reagardless of how fast the bios function is the overhead makes it somewhat useless. 
<br/>
Or does Nintendo maybe have another solution than the swi instruction to call bios functions?

Yeah, i know it has much usefull functions, like the affineset stuff and similar.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm refering more to the divide and multiply functions that have absolutly no use with that kind of overhead.

Well. They are there, they don't take romsize, and they are probably fine for some things, and not good enough for something else. You really can't ask why they are there, because only the Nintendo folks will know, we can only guess.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There isn't a multiply function; multiply is supported through hardware. As for the divide, it's faster than GCC's divide operator (on non-constant values) and it provides the remainder (modulus) for free.
