    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all.  I was digging around all my classic mac games, and came across an oldie, but goodie today.  Bolo.   Those of you who are not familiar with Bolo, its a multiplayer tank game for the mac, ( PC and Linux too.  This game would be SWEET on the GBA.  Is anyone working on a port?   To findout more about this game, you can download it  at <a href="http://www.winbolo.com" target="_blank">www.winbolo.com</a> for those with windows, and mac users can get it at <a href="http://www.lgm.com/bolo/" target="_blank">http://www.lgm.com/bolo/</a> .   This game would be a great addition to the gba with multiplayer support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My guess is: no.
<br/>
<br/>
You're welcome to write one, however you may want to either take it up with the authors first or change it for legality's sake.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't think there would be a port, as the original game has gone way of the wind, and not that many people play it.  There are really not enough of these style games made for the GBA.  Advance wars is ok, but most people would enjoy a real-time strat game over the turn based stuff any day.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Man, I love Bolo, I used to play that on my old 68k Mac all the time, and got it for Windows a couple of years ago, haven't played it for ages.

I think that would be a perfect game for the GBA, and I mean perfect. The background couldn't be any more perfect for tiles, I mean it <span style="font-style: italic">is tiles.</span> And the tank would be a perfect sprite for use with rotation because thats all it really has to do for animation besides get damaged and explode. The mines and boats and trees and bases would be simple to make into either sprites or a background with a priority that goes between the tanks and background. And 4 player multiplayer is fantastic for Bolo.
<br/>
<br/>
Only problem is that the source isnt availiable, but I think for it to be a really good game on the GBA starting from near scratch would be better. If anyone wants to work on a project like this I would dedicate some time to making an engine.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hungrydeveloper.com" target="_blank">www.hungrydeveloper.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I had some good programming skills, I would definately help.  I may be able to contact the original author and get the source code from him.  He might rather enjoy some new excitement in his great game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sadly, the author no longer posts his e-mail address. However, his wife's e-mail address is posted.  I'll try to contact her and see what we can get.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
