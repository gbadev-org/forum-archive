    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, lately I have got a wierd problem with tiles.
<br/>
The graphics that I have made is 8x712 big, that is (8*712)/1024 = 5,5625 Kbyte.
<br/>
I am writing to CharMem0, defined as following:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">u16* CharMem0 = (u16*)0x6000000;</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The BG's (3) are all pointed to that charmemory, and in the start of the game everything works fine, i.e most of the the tiles that I need is showed correctly, but some of them (the first 23 or something like that), won't show up at all!
<br/>
I continue the game, and suddenly 35+ tiles is missing, both from the start and the end of the charmen!.
<br/>
I don't do any writes at all to the charmen but this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">for(i=0;i&lt;tiles_size;i++)   CharMem0[i] = tilesData[i];</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
What could possibly be wrong? Does any of you guys know to lock all writing to the Charmem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
