    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There seem to be quite a few of helper libs, like Mushroom, or even stuff in DevKitARM that help with repetitive operations when getting close to GBA hardware (not counting things like Catapult).
<br/>
<br/>
Which do people favor? And does HAMsdk count amongst these, or is it closer to a Catapult?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The HAM SDK simply comes with an IDE for use with development. Catapult has it's own suite of tools which makes it more of a complete development suite.
<br/>
<br/>
I think most of us here have made our own libraries that we use in GBA development.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I find that a little hard to believe, but if you say so I'll take your word for it.
<br/>
<br/>
What are people's opinions of something like Mushroom, which seems pretty close to the hardware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can't speak for others, only for myself, but I've never used HAM, Mushroom, or anything else like that, and in fact I tend to find such libraries often impede me from coding.
<br/>
<br/>
I expect you'll get a similar response from most "serious" homebrew dev people on this board. Not that these libraries aren't potentially useful, but honestly if you're hardcore enough to be programming the GBA in the first place you probably won't be satisfied in the long run using someone else's abstraction library.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I first got into the scene, I'd use programs for graphic conversion and stuff because I barely knew anything about the internals of the GBA. But now, after so many months, I've used nothing but programs that I've made.

You can use the same codebase for your game and map editing tools.  The editor will run on the GBA, but the display routines will already be written if you do it right. =)

libgba should fit the bill quite nicely.

I'm biased though :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
