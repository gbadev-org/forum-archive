    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have asked quite alot of stupid questions or questions where the answer can be found in any newbie tutorial. It is obvious that you have not even tried to read any tutorials or FAQ's to find the answer yourself.
<br/>
Several people (including me) have given you links to a bunch of very good tutorials (like The Pern Project), I suggest you read thoose tutorials and try out the examples suggested in the tutorials.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, VC++.net is a IBM x86 PC development environment. The compiler compiles to x86 machine code. You would know this if you knew anything about computers. Of course, you can still use the VC++ editor if you want to.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, go try out a tutorial before you ask any more questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think confusing the compiler with the IDE is an honest mistake to do when starting with C programming, specially these days when it's really hard for a newcomer to tell what's programming doing what, so I think you should stop your preachering Ampz and just help him or ignore him. I'm not defending him or his questions, I'd just like to have a friendlier tone in these forums.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree with Touchstone about trying to have a friendly tone in the forum, but I can see Ampz's point.  People should make an effort in learning some of the basics before asking questions, although we should all be able to ask newbie questions from time to time (I'm pretty sure I have).  It just gets annoying when it seems a person isn't even trying to do any learning by themself.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've answered some of his previous questions, And I gave him a link to some GBA tutorials. Thoose tutorials list different compilers and I'am quite sure the MSVC++ IDE combined with the GCC compiler is discussed too.

Again, good tutorials and FAQ's:

i can tell you i have not read nothing about VC++, so as i have my friend is GBA programmer licenced and he used completly VC++ to compile GBA game.... but now he is far, and i don't know if there are differences using this compiler or not

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it looks like your friend is using VC++ to make a GBA program, then he's probably using Visual Studio (VC++'s IDE) to edit the source code and run the makefile, and he's hooked up Visual Studio to some form of GCC.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you're just starting out, it may be easiest to prototype your designs in a PC game using the Allegro library instead of diving straight into the GBA environment. (I did this for TOD.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think his question is a valid one. Not everyone can speak fluent English either, so what the question is I think simply, "can I compile a GBA game using the VC++ .NET compiler?". I doubt he means can I use it's compiler, he means it's IDE. And the answer is yes.
<br/>
<br/>
But, the easiest way is to use VC++ 6 and download GBA Project Appwizard r2.6 at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=misc&amp;filename=GBA_AW_r2-6_Setup.zip" target="_blank">http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=misc&amp;filename=GBA_AW_r2-6_Setup.zip</a> which will automatically integrate gcc with the VC++ 6 IDE.
<br/>
<br/>
Visit the PERN project and download his version of gcc, then the Appwizard and your ready to go!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
