    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gee, that really depends on the game you intend to write.
<br/>
There is no "best" mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suppose for 3D games, you would opt for mode 3,4,5.
<br/>
<br/>
And for Rpg, Action, etc...  people use mode 0,1,2 because it's easy to move things around without needing to redraw everything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mode 0 is good for games that need a lot of layers going all at once (you can still do some pretty cool stuff just by changing the scrolling/alpha blending/window regs on HBlank in mode 0), mode 1 for things that need layers, but some rotation/scaling effects too (what most 'mode7' games use, I believe), mode 2 for really high-tech looking stuff with 2 BGs rotating/scaling at the same time (can't recall ever seeing it used before, actually), mode 3 for high-color still pictures (or you can make a back buffer in memory, but you'd spend so much time drawing the backbuffer, and then copying it, you wouldn't be able to do much else), mode 4 if you need the whole screen, but not high-color (only being able to write 2 pixels at a time is a real problem though), and mode 5 if you need the whole screen, with high-color. Good for 3D demos, and if you use the rot/scale regs, you can turn it sideways and scale it to 2x horizontally and you have the same number of pixels as if you just write 2 at a time in mode4. And writing one 16-bit pixel is the same as writing 2 8-bit too, so the speed should be about the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
