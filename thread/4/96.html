Does anyone use this emulator? and does anyone have a manual? I am having a devil of a time figuring out how to use the Debug mode!  I am just trying to single step through a set of instructions. I can load the image and then press f4 to stop execution ( while it is in a loop). I then want to SS through the instructions and watch the CPU registers as it loads and tests data.  I can't figure out what the "&gt;" and "*" are telling me?
<br/>
<br/>
I thought that the "&gt;" should be pointing at the next instruction that will be executed when I press f7 ( run to next instruction),  but most ( but not all) the time the PC is pointing to the same line as the "&gt;", which should be 2 instructions past the current instruction.  I also can't figure out what the "*" is telling me. Sometimes it is on the same line as the "&gt;" and sometimes it isn't.  When the "&gt;" reaches a branch instruction, and then I press f7, the"&gt;" doesn't jump back up  to the addr specified in the BEQ instruction and it and the "*" part company at that point. 4 hours later, I still haven't figured out what it is doing.
<br/>

I apologize for having to post this question, but I searched the author's site and didn't come up when any explanation of the use of the debug mode.<br/>_________________<br/>MysticX is The Defender</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
