<br/>
Some development kit for gba are compiled to support diferent target (arm-elf, arm-coff, arm-pe ,etc.). Does it mean that it can generate different binary output, and could we use them all (or the elf format is enought) ?

Thanks and happy new year.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA takes raw binaries. As long as the assembler, the linker, and the objcopy all support the same object file format, you should be OK. However, if you want to use a debugging emulator such as the shareware version of no$gba, you'll need to use arm-elf because the debugging emulators can load ELF binaries.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
