The build process looks something like this
<br/>
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold">compile</span>: converts .c/.cpp to .o
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">link</span>: grabs all the .o and .a (libraries) and creates a .elf
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">translate</span>: removes all non-essential parts from a .elf and creates a .gba that can actually be run on a GBA .... at least, after you ...
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">fix the header</span>: which, well, fixes the header of the .gba file.</li></ul>Somehow '../projet' seems more like a directory, not a filename. The makefile is looking for filenames. Can't point to an exact cause for this as I don't know the particulars of your project, but my guess is that you didn't enter the source files (.c or .cpp) correctly. Look at some of the samples that came with VHAM and see what you're doing differently.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes you do have .a, they're just part of the toolchain itself and linked automatically.

Without knowing more about the project itself, there's little we can do to help you. Something is missing from your project but unless you tell use what the project's files are we're flying blind. We need to see the makefile, and maybe the list of files that you are using (which should be in the makefile). The error-message mentions '../projet'. What is that? Directory? File? Plane? Train? Automobile? Figuring out why it's looking for it might bring you one step closer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You mean you grabbed tetris sources from gbadev.org? Is that what you meant by gba/c/c++. OK, misunderstood that. Mind you, I don't think those use HAM directly, but that shouldn't matter.
<br/>
<br/>
*tests*
<br/>
I just created a VHAM project with the first tetris source I could find (by Choopan (which you shouldn't use to learn tetris from as it uses the bitmap modes for it instead of tile modes). Compiles and runs just fine. You made a mistake in your VHAM configuration somewhere and it has something to do with '<span style="font-weight: bold">../projet</span>'. Find out where it crops up in the makefile and in your project and mention that here. 
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I did to get a working compile:
<br/>
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Create a new VHAM project</span> (File/New Project) in the tetris directory. An empty project.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Add sources</span>. Add the source files from tetris to the project (right-click on the workspace window, use 'Add Files'). If VHAM made a 'main.c' for you too, you have to remove it from the project (Menu:Project/Makefile/General/Files to Compile).
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Compile</span>. You'll get a bunch fo warnings but it should compile just fine.</li></ul>It occurs to me that you might have a space in the path and that maybe why it's wrong. You can't have something like 'c:/blah/project  foo.c'. Spaces in paths are evil. Yes, Microsoft uses them often as well in their default paths, but that only proves my point.
<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing wrong with the sources themselves. Well there is, but not in terms of compilability. The trouble is something with how you've set up the project and unless you give us some details on that, we can't help you.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider moving away from VHAM, grab a <a class="postlink" href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/toc.htm" target="_blank">tutorial</a> and learn a few things about how to set up your own build scripts and the basics of GBA programming. If you're interested in learning how tetris works, also consider <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#tod" target="_blank">TOD</a>, which is probably the best version you'll come across.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did a IUT in computer science, (progamming) but unfortunatly, I failed to pass the exam.
<br/>
Actually, I was more interested in programming games than programming what I was told to program (boring program with Cobol, or other), and nothing I worked on at the IUT was related to game or even graphics or sound.
<br/>
<br/>
For now, I would like to try a new IUT , maybe SRC (network communication science), or new studies related to it, where I could learn new game programming tech, and be more confident about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
