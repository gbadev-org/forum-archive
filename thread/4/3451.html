Are you trying to plot a single pixel in mode 4? There is some code floating around on the boards that will allow you to do that. Just remember that it will be no where as fast as writing pixels in modes 3/5, so don't expect much. And its in asm by the way.
<br/>
<br/>
Just do a search for "mode 4 plot pixel" on the boards. It should come up with something.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
