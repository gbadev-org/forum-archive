    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try compiling the Day 1 demo from the Pern project at <a href="http://www.thepernproject.com." target="_blank">www.thepernproject.com.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The page has changed recently and the link from our FAQ is broken, as well as the link from the Day 1 page to the file.  Go to GBA-&gt;Examples and download the .zip from there.
<br/>
<br/>
As Dovoto recommends, it's a good idea to read the batch file that does the compiling so you'll get an idea of what you'd have to do yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you could always just reuse that batch file indefinitely. ^_^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
