    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everybody ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Because my gba project don't want to compile since yesterday, I take a break, and think about how to be more efficiently in developping it. :P
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For now, I design what I want to add to this project, and then I (try to) code it.
<br/>
And I work on till it works.
<br/>
<br/>
I know a best way is to design the whole project first, and then developp it in parts.
<br/>
But I would like to know in what parts I may have to organize my developpement.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, I know that I must create the engine of the game first, but may I have to focus on maps then on sprites, or in the inverse way.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to have a simple plan to follow, a easiest-to-hardest plan, you know.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If you are working as part of a team, then organisation is a key factor in keeping everything together. Working alone you can get away with a few things as you know when something has not been done / not working. 
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment we have a task list in groups of milestones. We allocate each other tasks off that list in meetings ready to be done by the meeting.
<br/>
<br/>
Scheduling tasks is also important as it gives people incentive to get something no matter how hard/easy it is.
<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts, I have no idea how it works in the industry but you can read the postmortems at <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com</a> (it is free to join)<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok,
<br/>
<br/>
I think I must reformulate my ask ^^
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, rather than compare to industry team organized project, I ask you, experimented people on gba dev, if there is a logical way for a beginner to have a easiest-to-hardest approach of this machine.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't talk about high level of organization but more on engine coding tasks.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, is it harder to experiment sprites collision or map management. (I take an random and simple example).
<br/>
<br/>
So, I ask this to schedule tasks that you told ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you ^^
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I forgot to precise that for the moment I'm working alone on this project.
<br/>
But a few teamates may join me soon.
<br/>
So to guide them to not have a learning too strong, and to know what I can ask them to do (and what I cannot), I'd like to know what you consider as easy and as hard ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my poor english, but it would be worst for you to understand me if I speak in my native language, French ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In that case, make sure you write EVERYTHING down, how the engine works, how the graphics loaded etc. It makes a whole load easier for your teamates to catch up on the project.<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You may be asking something different, but this is how I have one of my projects organized, one file for each category:
<br/>
Main Program Code
<br/>
Utility Functions (Misc Stuff)
<br/>
Map Grid Related Code
<br/>
Stages
<br/>
Input Related Code
<br/>
Display Related Code
<br/>
<br/>
Every function should do one thing and do that thing well.
<br/>
Every function should only do one thing.
<br/>
You should be able to rewrite a funtion without making many (if any) other changes to the rest of your code.
<br/>
If you need to change data types after you start a project, that may require a lot of code changes.
<br/>
If your project is organized, you should be able to add things to it in more or less any order, so it does not matter how difficult any given component is to make.
