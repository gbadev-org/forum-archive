    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When  I use text backgrounds, and I scoll them using REG_BGxHOFS or REG_BGxVOFS (0x4000010 to 0x400001E).  These work just as I want, if I update these by 1, then the bg will scroll by 1.  But when using rot bgs, and use REG_BGxX or REG_BGxY, it seems like I have to update these registers by a lot just to get them to move a pixel.   Why is this?<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Because they're fixed point fractions. 19bit integer (signed) 8bit fractional so if you're doing a straight scroll you need to add 256 to them.  They're like that to get accuracy for the rotation and scaling modes, eg if you scaled the screen by 1/2 you wouldn't want it to move 1 pixel a time but only 1/2 a pixel (even though there isn't such a thing it saves you working it out if you see what i mean).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh I see.  Thanks.  I figured out how to get it to scroll correctly just a few minutes ago but now I know why it does that so thanks again.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind".

This is because you need better precision when dealing with the rotation parameters.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
