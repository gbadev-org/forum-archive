    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which mode will plot pixels faster?
<br/>
is it faster to draw 8-bit ot 16 bit?
<br/>
I am trying to improve my 3d engine, and it's important
<br/>
for me to know, if I can make it faster on mode 4.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Tomer!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mode 4 is generally faster, and you also get page flipping.  Just try to write 2 pixels at a time whenever possible.  Even games like Doom, which seem to have to write single columns at a time, hack it so they can write pairs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
