    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
<br/>
    I am currently doing GBA development on a Mac, and until now I have been using the (apparenly outdated) devkitPRO, and I finally decided recently to switch to devkitARM.  However, I am not able to get anything to compile.  The compilation of all of the .c files works great, but when it comes time to link, I get the following error:
<br/>
<br/>
/path_to_devkitarm/arm-eabi/lib/thumb/libc.a(exit.o): In function `exit':
<br/>
(.text+0x1a): undefined reference to `_exit'
<br/>
/path_to_devkitarm/arm-eabi/lib/thumb/libc.a(sbrkr.o): In function `_sbrk_r':
<br/>
(.text+0xe): undefined reference to `_sbrk'
<br/>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
<br/>
<br/>
It appears like there is an internal problem with libc.a, but I would have a hard time believing that there is actually something wrong with an internal library like that.  Do I have to define something in my files to make this work?  Is it linking with an incorrect library?  Any help on this is appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe it is release 20, if that is what you mean.  I am pretty sure it is the most recent version, as I just downloaded it within the last month or so.
