<br/>
      Attaching the gba with one of the ext ports to the one of the usb ports on the ps2. With correct programming this should be possible. Also, a harder brainchild- if anyone is familiar with the os level memorycard viewer on the ps2 that lets you see the unique 3d icon for each memory save, to emulate that to the gba with be nice.

A playlist program-
<br/>
     If you are not familiar with the archos jukebox 20, there is a link below. I'm not sure about this one but to directly link the gba and the archos through one of the ext ports and the usb 1.0 on the archos. The gba would have to beable to read the archos, it would also either have to read mp3 tags or at least filenames. Once done it would have to beable to write a txt file to the archos and rename it to a m3u (playlist file).

<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas were to just have simple interaction between the gba and a pc, whether it be organiser, or email interaction and such.

You would have to implement the USB wire protocol in software. At full speed. This is somewhere between extremely difficult and totally unfeasible. =)
<br/>
Also, the PS2 won't use anything but real memory cards attached to the card ports for saving, afaik. Are there any USB-based save devices for the PS2 at present? If not, then you probably won't be able to make one from anything, let alone a GBA.

This would require implementing the USB wire protocol as a *host*, which is many, many times harder than doing it as a device, as for the above.
<br/>
<br/>
The only really feasible way to attach a GBA to any USB connection, as host or device, would be to put a USB (host|device) controller chip in a custom cart and use that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, the PS2 doesn't know how to use an F2A/EZFA cable. In order for it to work, it would have to conform to a standard USB device profile which the PS2 knows how to communicate with.

What, does the PS2 BIOS restrict with which USB device profiles a PS2 program may communicate? Can't a PS2 program implement a driver for the "USB F2A Cable" profile?

USB Serial seems a good match for the various modes of GBA communication.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The original poster was talking about using it as a memory card, thus, it would have to work with existing programs. It's certainly possible to implement any driver you like in your own PS2 code (see the Eyetoy); not that anyone actually knows how the F2A..etc cables work enough to be able to write a driver for them on any platform..

<br/>
But USB Serial is useless if you need the device to appear as a storage device without a custom driver.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
