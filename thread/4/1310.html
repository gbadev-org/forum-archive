    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I`m about to go back to uni to do my final year in a pretty hardcore computing degree. I have messed arround with GBA programming and thought that writing something for it would make an ideal final year project. I could do with some idea`s for something that would not only be interesting for me to develop but also may be something people would want to use!
<br/>
<br/>
The project needs to be something that would take about 30 days to develop which includes requirements analysis, design, implementation and testing.
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to write it in C and, if I can learn enough in time, assembler. To make the project a little more complex I want to use the link port for something. I should have no problem actually writting the application its just thinking of something to write that gets me!
<br/>
<br/>
So does anyone have any ideas (game, app, anything!)?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, there was this idea about a PDA type organizer for the Gba, here : <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=1255" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=1255</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting idea, would be to create a Soft that allow 2 Gbas to play with each other, over the net. But i think because of latency issues, it's not do-able. You should investigate, and people who already looked into it, can give some feedback about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, hope you have fun with your project, i sure enjoy doing so in my spare times :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would be really interested to see a dictionary on a small device, maybe you could make the design for one.. would it take more than a month to make the engine and enter the vocabulary, as well as maybe give it some design?
<br/>
<br/>
Its not a gerat idea, but maybe it will lead to something :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could write an integrated Sprite + Map editor that outputs in .h or a
<br/>
.C file, The Program will let you place sprites on backgrounds, also if you want some more work you can integrate it with pcx2sprite and pcx2gba programs to make a complete gaming utility</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the idea`s guys. The PDA sounds interesting but I don`t think it would be complex enough, I may try to expand on the idea a bit though.
<br/>
<br/>
The 2 GBA`s over the internet was actually what I was going to attempt but I ruled it out a while back as it looks like it`s pretty much impossible to sync the 2 machines.
<br/>
<br/>
Again a dictionary is a cool idea but something like that would be extremely easy to code, just totally tedious entering in all the words.
<br/>
<br/>
I really want to code something for the GBA so I don`t think a map/sprite editor will be something I would do.
<br/>
<br/>
Any more ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just got a really odd idea involving the link port (and some additional hardware)
<br/>
<br/>
Make an infrared device you can plug into your GBA. You can then use this for ie. wireless multiplay, or maybe as a remote control for your TV, stereo? Or read/write savegames to/from your PC (which should also have a IR unit)... Countless applications for it I'd say.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, like the game Mission Impossible on the Game Boy Color (the GBC had an infrared thing built-in). You could learn it signals and then use it as a remote control for any device. It's a shame the GBA doesn't have an infrared port.<br/>_________________<br/>Currently playing: NGC: Metroid Prime

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats a great idea!
<br/>
<br/>
I was looking at a programable logic device that plugs into the catridge slot that I think has a IR port. Anyone know what i`m talking about, I need a link to the site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
