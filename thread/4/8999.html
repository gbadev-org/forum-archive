I guess this is in the Mappy VM source code cos when I googled up popped the delphi file.
<br/>
<br/>
Does this suggest that my elf file format is not correct?  surely it's a standard format.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a standard format yes. Unfortunately it's a moving target - ARM ELF especially is currently undergoing quite a few changes. Even gdb is suffering from this - you'll find that ELF files output by the current devkitARM will crash older versions of Insight/gdb as well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Well maybe they'll update mappy at some stage. I wanted to try it cos GDB stopped working with my code.  I've a previous post from today describes that error.

<br/>
<br/>
could you suggest any version of devkitARM that will work with Insight/GDB or Mappy VM?

This version of Insight/gdb works fine.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was using R17 and that version of Insight/GDB and it was stopped working.    Now its started working again although I am getting errors.  I tryed R8 and that had worked, then R12 but VBA_SDL was taking ages to start but it also seemed to allow me to debug.  Then I reverted back to R17 and it seems to work although it is buggy.
<br/>
<br/>
When you say "work fine"
<br/>
<br/>
I am using GDB from within Eclipse so not sure if that is affecting it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks anyway,

Sorry I missed the Mappy reference .... although they might have the same issue as vba.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
