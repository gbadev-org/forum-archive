<br/>
I notice there is an atan2 function through the bios, do you know how slow it is?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any better way to find out an angle... i've been trying to make up a system using the scalar product aka dot product however as the vectors wouldn't be normalized I would need a divide to utilise it... And I've been trying to figure out a way to not make that divide. However without success.<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

It should be MUCH faster than the BIOS, assuming you have about 400 bytes of IWRAM to spare.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And so the world becomes 3D only through the polygons the "tiles" or rather 'cubes' contains... What I'm trying to do is a fast way to cull all cubes not in my frustum...<br/>_________________<br/>*Spam*

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not up on my 3D, but you can doing culling by testing just the sign of the dot (I think) product of your point and the frustum plane. That will be a lot faster than calculating the actual angle. You don't need to normalize the vectors since you only care about the sign. (Somebody will correct me if I'm wrong here...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
