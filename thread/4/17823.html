    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a glitch were my gba project crashes after holding the same button. for 3 or 4 seconds. I'm sure that this is a glitch you guys have experience and its really doing my head in right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Additional notes:
<br/>
My button input method was working perfect fine before I tried to implement my fancy finite state machine. My finite state machine works apart from this error that seems to occur on it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NO$GBA ends up on an invalid opcode eventually.
<br/>
<br/>
But NO$GBA is simply incompatible with the current version of DevKitARM, because it's implementation of ldmia sp!, {sp} is broken and doesn't restore the correct value for the stack pointer.  All bets are off.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just *fixed*(well not really) the problem by simply removing the implementation I had put since I was beginning to spaghettify my code.
<br/>
<br/>
But with the debugger question:
<br/>
Does programmer's notepad have a debugger similar to visual studio where you can check data as the program runs? Or is the only debugger available the dreaded visualboyemulator's version?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
