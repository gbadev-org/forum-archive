    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, does anyone know if the bytes at 0xB5-0xBC in the GBA header actually do anything? Do any commercial games have them set, and do any loaders/patchers/whatever use them? I was thinking I might use them in my <a class="postlink" href="http://hypernova.amarok-shadow.com/programs.php?id=bootgba" target="_blank">GBA Booter</a> for DS to define the ROM address and other info of a built-in border image, so homebrew GBA games could include their own border like Game Boy can on Super GB. Unfortunately it still has to use the built-in GBA BIOS to boot up, so I can't just put the info in place of the Nintendo logo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
