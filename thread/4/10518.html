    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all, I am fairly new to the GBA world and I have to say I really find it interesting.  I found some tutorials by Aaron Rogers and they have really helped me make progress in the last two days.  Im having trouble displaying text in a small demo that I have made.  Actually, I believe im a little confused of the (modes... and backgrounds...) that there are to choose from.  To get an idea of the demo im working on... It's a ball that bounces off the walls with a background.  Im wanting to add input and I have succesfully done that already.  I want to display some text as well.  I can get the text to appear with the sprite but the background messes up or doesnt appear at all.  Is there anywhere on the net I could look into this at.  Maybe I have overlooked some information already that Mr. Rogers has wrote... If someone could help me understand this I would appreciate it 10 x a whole bunch!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
