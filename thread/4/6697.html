    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys - pointless question but needs to be asked.  In mode 4 what registers hold the sprites bitmaps?  Could you give me the full range?  
<br/>
I think its from 0x0601000 or sumink.

<br/>
Thank you</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sprite cel VRAM is 32 KiB, 0x06010000 through 0x06017FFF. In modes 3, 4, and 5, only the second half (0x06014000 through 0x06017FFF) is available for sprite cel use because the first half is reallocated to the frame buffer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The thing is im having trouble as like i say im using mode 4 and have large sprites taking up lots of space.  What would you suggest?  Using Modes 0 - 1, or maybe decrease the palette of the sprites.  Thank you for your help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes; you can set the colour mode in attribute 0 of your OAM entry.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another advantage of 16-color sprites, other than the reduced use of ROM and VRAM, is the freedom to swap sprites with different palettes in and out of play at any time. But when mixing 16-color and 256-color sprites, remember that with 16-color sprites, each 16-color sprite palette will use a 15-color chunk of your 256-color sprite palette (colors 16*n+1 to 16*n+15, where 16*n is not used because it's transparent).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
