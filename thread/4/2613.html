    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No 32-bit processor can handle 64-bit math. The compiler you are using can, though, by coding some assembly routines to do the operations, stores, loads, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, check that some processors have a few opcodes that can handle addition and multiplication... but typically this is very limited.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have to sort of emulate a 64-bit processor for it. Basically you just use 2 regs to store each 64-bit number, and for addition, add the 2 bottom halves, and then adc (add with carry) the upper halves. Multiplication is trickier and takes a bunch of multiplyingand adding. It's the same theory behind how you do multiplication on paper. I think it would be destLo = lo1 * lo2, destHi = lo1 * hi1 + lo2 * hi1 + lo1 * hi2 + lo2 * hi2. hi1 * hi2 would naturally overflow 64 bits, so there's no point in doing it. Not sure how to do division, but GBA doesn't have a hardware divide anyway, so you could just write a 64-bit divider yourself.
<br/>
To make life easy, let the compiler take care of all that dirty work for you.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I never had any problem with it, so long as I typecast all of my multiply ops as (long long), and then made sure to reduce the result to 32 bits before doing any other ops on it.
