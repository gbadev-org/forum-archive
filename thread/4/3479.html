    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right now I'm making a little racing game just to get comfortable and used to GBA programming. I made a decent pong game through a tutorial, so I understand collision detection for the edges of the screen and the bars. But for a track, it bends and curves, how do you do collision detection on the edges of the tracks?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, anyone know a link where I can get some sprites, I can't make decent sprites.

Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For curves, there are a couple of ways that come to mind.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Create a bunch of small line segments and collision detect with each within a close radius of the object - probably how I would do it.
<br/>
<br/>
2. If the curve is a true circle, define a center, radius,  and start/end angle for it and do a radius check against the sector that the wall represents.  A very fast check against true circle curves.  Confusing so here's an example.
<br/>
<br/>
You have a curved wall that a radius 10 pixel circle would fit.  Place the center of that circle so that the edge of the circle would overlap the wall.  Let's say that it's a hairpin corner so that the wall starts at 270 degrees (bottom of circle) and continues counter-clockwise through 90 degrees (top of circle).  To collide check, setup a collision box around the half circle and check for inclusion.  If within, do a radius check against the circle.  If out of the radius or exactly euqal, you just hit the wall.  Pretty quick for large walls areas, but not as efficient on smaller circle sectors.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">none of the curves would be a true circle. It would just be bends in the road. How would you create a bunch of line segments? I'm not sure i'm understanding this. Could you please expand on this idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It shouldn't be too difficult to create line segments. The concept is like in calculus: a smooth curve can be simulated by a series of line segments, and the accuracy of the match improves when the line segments are shorter.
<br/>
<br/>
Miked is suggesting that when your object is moving around the map, check it against all line segments within a certain radius; say, a little larger than the size of your object. This way, you're not doing the check against all of the segments. It seems like it might be difficult to do the circle/line segment check unless the segments are small, though. I'd probably divide the map into sectors and only check against segments in my current sector, and leave the segments relatively large.
<br/>
<br/>
The difficult part will be detecting collision between your bounding box and the line segment (unless you're up on your math); so just find some code that does it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">collision detection is dirt easy.
<br/>
<br/>
Remember that old maths question, two trains travelling at x mph from y metres, how long does it take .. that is collision detection in its best form. But you don't need to worry about that, I just thought I'd make you aware of real collision detection so that you don't get trapped on the way.
<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming that this a micro machines style racer. Then don't work with curves yet, not even the professionals did so in the early days, so you need not bother - - simple diagonals will do, even then you could use simple square tiles, but here is how you do it with basic diagonals.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I would tackle this with a larger map, which is grid detection. Now if you're on an empty grid, then there is no collision. Now if it is an occupied grid, it can be of two types, partly filled or filled. A partly filled one would be something such as a diagonal line.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">It may help to draw out a square with (0,0) on the top left corner, (9, 0) on the top right, (0,9 ) on the bottom left and (9,9) on the bottom right</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Consider this square with (0,0) being the top left, and (9,9) being the bottom right. And this square is half filled on the top left, and the bottom right is not. Then (x,y) where x + y &gt;= 10 there is not a collision.
<br/>
<br/>
If the bottom left is free, and the top right is occupied then (x,y) where y-x&gt;=0 there is no collision.
<br/>
<br/>
The other corners are the same, just with x+y &lt; 10 and y-x&gt; 0.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this answer was a little too mathematic as I don't even know your age and abilities, but I hope you understand this simple method of detecting collision without having to render a grid and check 10*20 positions on it to check for collision.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I felt it should be on a seperate post so that it doesn't seem too long to read since they are seperate. Bats is right, you do need to understand maths to do collision detection. I assume you have at least done those maths exercises where you have to calculate where two lines cross. That is how collision detection works. If you have for example two objects travelling at different speeds from two different positions, they will either collide or not. If the objects have different gradients then they will definately collide, or if they are on the same position with the same gradient; otherwise they will not.
<br/>
<br/>
But line detection is only ever widely used in the 3rd perspective, but I think people should be aware of how it works. This isn't the best place to write a tutorial on it, so I've just introduced you to the small topic. But I urge you to keep it simple in this stage, <span style="font-weight: bold">besides I'm still unsure what type of racing game you're developing.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was thinking a little bit further. You could have some tiles that are 1/2 road and 1/2 grass with a diagon split. Something like this

It's supposed to be a tile, but that's not the point. If the grass was the white area, and the road the '/' area, and the split is at 45 degrees, you could use some math to create more interesting shapes and more intersting collisions.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by dagamer34 on Fri May 28, 2004 4:41 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

ASSERT is a macro that automatically breaks from the program and returns an error value to the OS. Since we don't have an OS on the GBA, we have to make up our own. Most people simply send the error information to the debug screen and have a hanging loop. Here's what I'm talking about: <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=2999&amp;highlight=assert" target="_blank">What is ASSERT?</a>
<br/>
<br/>
About Miked's code: It's simple collision detection. What you would do to use it is first get input from the player, then move the car, and then do a collision check. If the tile isn't clear, move the player back to where he was before and keep going. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you feel you really understand this, then start moving on to more complex shapes (like diagonals). Hopefully you will, because pure square collisions are very unforgiving, especially if the tile is near a turn.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
