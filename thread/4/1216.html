but the arena picture is too large for a BG.
<br/>
How can I put the arena in a BG?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or (to have more 'differents' tiles to display at once) pick mode 0 in 256x256 and load dynamicly the tiles you want to display.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And if you need a larger map than 512x512, you can use a mode 1 or 2 rotational bg with a maximum size of 1024x1024.

<br/>
Probably easier than having to deal with making a dynamic tile system.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I selected a 256x256 Text BG.Then dynamicly load the tiles from the ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
but in fact,256x256 BG should have 1024 'different' tiles,it will take up the whole VRAM. So,I loaded Tiles of BG of 256x160. Becase it was enough to cover the screen(240x160).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
