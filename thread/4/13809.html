    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyone else getting a problem with the A and Select buttons being frozen in the "held down" position? I just happened to be getting this problem when working on my DS project. I know it isn't my code, as I even went back to one of my old GBA projects that I had worked on at least 1/2 a year ago that had no buttons problems, and even that is having the problem.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it fails on your NO$GBA but works on dantheman's NO$GBA, then it's either a NO$GBA configuration problem, a Windows problem, or a problem with your controller hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Gaming Options &gt; Properties (may vary per Windows version) and see if the buttons still act held down. Or try borrowing someone else's USB gamepad and plugging that in.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
