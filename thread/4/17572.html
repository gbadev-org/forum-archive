    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I downloaded devkitPro  from this tutorial: <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=418&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions *READ FIRST!*</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Before that I was trying to follow the tutorial from here: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mdh165.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/docstuts/docstuts.htm" target="_blank">GbaJunkie</a> and downloaded DevKitAdv.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm confused on which one to use. Should I delete the DevKitAdv now that I have devkitPro? 
<br/>
<br/>
Also I'm having trouble with tutorials. I guess I'll start from the FAQ *Read First* thread. IF anyone could recommend some tutorials to me, I would appreciate it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">devkitadv is really old and I do not think it is maintained any longer. use devkitarm which is installed with the devkitpro installer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">your are not going to find anything current. I recommend the examples that are installed with the devkitpro installer. search this forum for "examples". this question just came up a few days ago - it might have been at devkitpro.org</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
