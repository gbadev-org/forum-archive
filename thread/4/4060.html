    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How do most people do in game transmission?
<br/>
In the SGADE MultiPlayer code I saw that the data is recieved one frame after it was sent!
<br/>
Is it better ways to do it, I want to recieve the data directly.
<br/>
How do the commercial developers do??
<br/>
<br/>
And one more question is it possible to make multiplayer code that makes it possible to resume the game once the cable is putted in again or do Ive to make a restart of the game.
<br/>
I think the error bit is a little strange. Ive tried some to pull out and in the cables but I cant find I way where it always return error if it isnt a connection!
<br/>
<br/>
plz help!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. We comercial developers receive data 1 frame after it was created and run the game 1 tic behind.  This allows perfect error correction as serial transmission is very error prone on this hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Yes, it is very possible to do this once you have your serial code 100% (which takes a very long time to get right)  Play Lord of the Rings Two Towers or Return of the King and Unplug and Plug in to your heart's content.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
