    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone. I'm currently learning about audio and interrupts. I want to use Krawall for audio (s3m's) and when using HAMs irq routines things flow supersmooth, but when I make my own routine (I want to steer away from HAM) the sound jitters and sparks a bit every second or so. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I've done is I've made a regular function to act as my Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) and inside it I've got if statements to check for interrupts. I currently only have code for handling Timer1 interrupts (where I call <span style="font-weight: bold">kradInterrupt();</span> and acknowldge the interrupt). I've set up the pointer for my ISR and the routine gets called. Then I init kraw and I enable Timer1, and turn on master enable. <span style="font-weight: bold">krapPlay(&amp;mod_inspiration, KRAP_MODE_LOOP, 0xff);</span> is called next and then I enter my loop where I call <span style="font-weight: bold">kramWorker();</span><span style="font-style: italic"> ONCE </span>every new frame (I poll VCounter and ensure I only call it once utilizing a bool). That's all! I tried using VBL interrupts for kramWorker(); too but it yeilds the same result. The exact same code works using HAMs interrupt routines, and I wonder what magic extra there is that I'm not understanding here.
<br/>

If you really must, I can paste some code but It's all a mess right now and looks like crap. I've tried all sorts of fixes and testing so the code looks rather glued together with bubblegum.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
