Are there any out there that do? I don't think so. All info around here about such things come from disassembling the multiboot clients.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the F2A info comes from old specs that may have been released by Visoly (but I'm not sure).

That's what they're saying... it's only possible if you can get your specific brand of flash cart to do it for you. There are not "standard" GBA registers to write to ROM since the GB assumes its, well, ROM (read only memory).
<br/>
<br/>
If you post the exact brand and model of your flash cart, it's possible that someone can point you at code to modify the ROM at runtime. But this code will NOT work on any other brand of flash cart. Maybe that's cool with you if you're just building something for your own use.
<br/>
<br/>
Writing to SRAM is easy and supported by most flash carts. If you're out of SRAM space, you might want to do some compression of the data. That's probably a less difficult solution.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, if you post what you're trying to accomplish, then there might be some other suggestions for how to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
