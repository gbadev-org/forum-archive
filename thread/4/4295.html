<br/>
<br/>
Does VisualBoyAdvance properly emulate SRAM? I couldn't find anything on the website about this and there isn't an obviously labelled "SRAM" area in the memory viewer. 
<br/>
<br/>
My flashcarts are on loan for the next couple of days, and I'm itching to work on the save functionality for my compo entry...

<br/>
Thankee,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think
<br/>
VBA and No$gba automatically creates a file called
<br/>
PojectName.sav and that file is the SRAM, Probably they dont want to change the gba-file all the time when people save.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes they both properly emulate SRAM. To see what your saving either look for the file named &lt;romname&gt;.sav/.sgm or for NO$ look in the battery folder.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to view the SRAM on the fly I believe you can use VBA's Memory Viewer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
