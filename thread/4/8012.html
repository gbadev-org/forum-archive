It seems like it should be a simple matter of making sure your ancilliary data (background data, tile data, etc.) is all setup before switching the control registers, but I wondered if there was any gotchas to this before trying it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It works, I did it once fairly cleanly and another time fairly messily.  You mentioned the only "gotcha" I ran into, but it was easily solved by make sure I cleared out all the map and tile data, and making the 0 location on the pallette the same color as the screen (black, white, or whatever)<br/>_________________<br/>Codax
