You can either copy a frame to VRAM as it is needed, or you can store all the frames in VRAM and simply change the tile index in OAM memory.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'd be much better off designing your 3D character in another tool, then exporting to flattened frames to display inside a sprite.
<br/>
<br/>
As dagamer said, you usually have more than enough cycles every game frame to copy a fresh character frame from the cart ROM to your sprite VRAM. So you could have hundreds and hundreds of frames for your character if you're willing to make a multi-megabyte game. 
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, managing all of those frames and when to display them might be ugly.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, OAM Memory is a section of the GB's memory where information about sprites in stored. VRAM (video ram) is the section where actual graphics are stored.

Like say I have one sprite in one scene with 256 colors, and then the next scene I want to swap it with a different sprite that has different colors. Does tha make sense?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can only have 256 colours for all sprites at any one time (assuming no fancy hblank interrupt tricks). These can be used as 1 x 256 colour palette and/or 16 x 16 colour palettes.  So if you want to dynamically alter the palette for individual sprites,  it is important to divide up the available colours between the different sprites and alter only the palette entries for the sprite in question.
<br/>
<br/>
Most commercial games use the 16 x 16 colour palettes setup.
