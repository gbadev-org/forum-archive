    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd recommend DevkitARM. I use it in my own projects.
<br/>
<br/>
DevkitAdv has not been updated in a very long time, but there are a few individuals that still use it.
<br/>
<br/>
I've no experience with HAM, so I can't give an opinion on it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 I am tying to get the Yeti3d game engine to compile am using devkitadv but when I execute the make.bat I just get error messages. The author says to use devkitadv but the compiler is not very user friendly and has no documentation just an FAQ on it homepage. My question is it possible to use DevkitARM with yeti3d and if so anyone have experience with it? What modifications would I have to do make it work with DevkitARM?

Thank you for your time!
