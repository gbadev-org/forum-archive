    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What were the other similar errors you got? "Objcopy: test.elf: No such file or directory" means that either your code compilation or linking went wrong, or that you've got your filenames mixed up; see if you can find a game.elf file somewhere in your project folder, and see if your code is generating errors somewhere along the way.<br/>_________________<br/>(Works for me!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
