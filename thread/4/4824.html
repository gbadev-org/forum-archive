Anyways, the Linux GBA System. I'll take a minimal version linux that will be maybe 10-20 MBs and program it to run GameBoy Advance ROMs. If anyone knows about programming graphics for the linux console, please let me know. Otherwise, if X is required, I'll have to think of someway to make it like 10 MBs and have no window manager, I'd just preload a ROM from the hard drive or a connected GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>All knowledge is good; only the way it is put to use is good or evil.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think a 100 MHz i486 PC could emulate a GBA in real time; it has enough trouble emulating a Super NES. Make it a late PII or an early PIII and I'll talk.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sweet, but I have my ideas. Such as using Xboo to connect the GBA to the system and possibly use its resources or instead just use the computer to store the ROMs on the harddrive. I've already began making a minimal version of linux, which you can see on my site (check for URL in signature).<br/>_________________<br/>All knowledge is good; only the way it is put to use is good or evil.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm hoping to someday see a small version of xfce on my GBA, but that doesn't sound likely.

<br/>
If that isn't possible, <a class="postlink" href="http://familiar.handhelds.org/" target="_blank">familiar</a> with a pointer would be sweet, too.
<br/>
<br/>
GPE looks nice:

<br/>
<br/>
I think Opie would be much nicer, though, and apparently has support for different resolutions and such.
