<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know the address/email/contact information so I could pay the shareware Dragon Basic and get the 32K limit away ? The author of software is Jeff Massung. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks !

Put this at the top of your \include\gba.dbc file (or alternatively, at the top of any specific program you want to compile):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks very much, this works with 1.4.5, at least there's no restrictions with it now. Anyway I'm trying to find registration code for older 1.3.8, it is actually just the compiler, DBC.exe, I'm trying to build a very small environment (to a floppy disk), 1.3.8 takes just 200 kB, some vi-clone etc, OS and emulator, that's all.  Maybe I'm able to strip 1.4.5 to a smaller size, especially if all includes are not needed.

<br/>
Thanks !

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">UPX is actually a good idea, I was able to fit Linux kernel, X11 4.0 and a lot of other stuff to a one floppy (1.7MB) with the UPX. However, it seems 1.4.5 needs more stuff than it is possible to get one floppy, not only includes, also one DLL. two other EXE's etc. I tried to strip it yesterday by moving files one by one but the compiling process stopped to error message "File not found", nothing else. However there's another possibility, stick in 1.3.8 but write two subroutines which makes PLAYSOUND and PLAYNOISE, by poking the sound chip addresses (does it work this way, too ?), that way I wouldn't need to use sample files and 32K would be fine. Any help would be appreciated, I start to check the sound registers now.

(Not sure if I mentioned that I'm building a small environment (an old laptop and GBA), sampler/sequencer for live performances).

Thanks !
