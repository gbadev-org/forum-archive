    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know it's a long shot to ask this on here, but could someone help me out of a bind with helping me create a QR Code Generator for the GBA?
<br/>
<br/>
The idea is simple really, the program would allow you to write any message you want in QR code and then print it to the Game Boy printer.  Maybe it could use other barcodes as well?  I know it'd be a hunt-and-peck limitation due to the limited keys in the GBA, but it could serve useful purposes and give the Game Boy Printer another breath of life.
<br/>
<br/>
Labels are not hard to find if you know where to look as well.  I have a few options listed on my LJ:  <a href="http://chriskewl.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">http://chriskewl.livejournal.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you can figure out the spacing between prints and advance the paper properly then you could use run-of-the-mill labels that are 1.5" wide.  I've tested the 1.5" thermal paper and it works.
<br/>
<br/>
The concept is intriguing to me and I'd really hate to spring for a thermal printer if the Game Boy Printer can do it already.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But in what mode?  The GBA can run the GB Printer from, say, the GB Camera, but could a program running in GBA mode even talk to it properly?  If not, then you would be looking for a GB/C program, which would probably be a bit harder to make than a GBA one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's a good question, yes, it was in GBC mode but shouldn't a simple printer test determine if the GBA could send printer information since it just uses the same port and information?
