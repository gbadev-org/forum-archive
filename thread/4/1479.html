    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only available languages (currently) are :
<br/>
C/C++ (DevKitAdv, Ham, Official Nintendo Kit)
<br/>
ASM (DevKitAdvance, GoldRoad)
<br/>
Basic (Dragon Basic)
<br/>
<br/>
But for serious dev, C/C++ are the way to go (with ASM for performance) because you often need to access low level stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I code mostly in C++, with a dash of C thrown in here and there for good measure.  I have been trying to learn ASM, but the language is still very alien to me, and I haven't really been able to figure out how to do anything really useful with it yet.  :)

I love the GBA though.  It's really helping me to stay in touch with my inner geek.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
