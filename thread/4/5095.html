    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, Im still working on my first game, and i recently view how much hard drive space my game takes up, this includes, source, make files, images, everything and it works out to nearly 10 megabytes, just to put you in the picture, its a sidescroller with 20 levels, and all the sprites used up, 3 backgrounds, it compiles, quite small, like 4meg on the gba
<br/>
<br/>
The question: Would this be an average size of assets? How big are yours for an average game ???<br/>_________________<br/>Chris Davis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Assets dominate the size of a typical commercial GBA game by far. GBA games range from 2 megabytes[1] to 32 megabytes.
<br/>
<br/>
A multiboot game such as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#tod" target="_blank">TOD</a>, on the other hand, might have about 44 KB of code and 116 KB of assets.
<br/>
<br/>
[1] The smallest cart size offered by Ni–∏tendo is 4 megabytes, but a few simpler games do not fill the cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
