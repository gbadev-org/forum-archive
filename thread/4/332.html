There seems to be only a few straight edged areas the main sprite goes behind other than the things overhead, and there are so few sprites in vram all of those could be premade.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it's easier to render a model + have some kind of 3d map for a basically isometric map which you have to check WHILE you're rendering and then decide which pixels not to draw or easier to have a few premade sprites with a stipple in them which would do all the work for you for free?  Speeeed, if it's there for you to use, use it, that's my motto. Why do something one way when another is all precalculated and then handled by the hardware ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It does indeed use 2 rot/scale backgrounds BUT doens't seem to do the "object in front" thing.  Take a look in an emulator and turn off one of those BG's  you just get a crazy mess. ?!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's right a crazy mess because those two backgrounds are only used to get the most tiles in a level.  Rotozooming maps can only have 256 tiles, and so using two maps gives them 512.  Plus they do some kind of tile streaming.  They use geometry to determine where tony cock is and they don't need a z-buffer because it is a boolean test - is tony behind or not.  Maybe they use an image-space mask, but I doubt it.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, look at how they render tony.  It looks like they are using 2x2 metapixels to me.  That means four times faster to render.  Yea!  Problem solved.<br/>_________________<br/>You probably suck.  I hope you're is not a game programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
