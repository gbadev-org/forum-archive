To learn how to implement a basic platform game, look at <a class="postlink" href="http://geocities.com/lordgraga1/" target="_blank">Lord Graga</a>'s platformer source code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
    Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately that is not what I was looking for.  My question was pretty vague, sorry.  What I mean is are there any tools available that can load maps and easily add in collision data.  I prefer not to have to hand create my collision maps.<br/>_________________<br/>"Oh yeah, so what kind of warrior are you?  A code warrior? HAHAHA!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In real games, the engine creates the collision map based on the background map.  Each tile number is marked as "air" or "solid" or "water" or something in a lookup table, and the engine constructs each entry of the collision map by looking up each entry of the background map in the lookup table.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Again, I know how collisions are done.  I have written tile based games before on the PC.  My question is are there any EXISTING TOOLS that I can create my maps with that will load tiles that have collision data stored with them and will write this data out to a file for me.  The bottom line is that I'm trying to save myself the time of writing my own map/tile editor by finding some freeware one that someone else has written.  
<br/>
<br/>
So far I have not found any map editors that load anything except .bmp or .gif files as the tileset and create the maps from these.<br/>_________________<br/>"Oh yeah, so what kind of warrior are you?  A code warrior? HAHAHA!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It allows you to create maps and give a value for each tile.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a generic tool, you can write a export file in order to get the data as you would like.
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't support HFlip or VFlip.
<br/>
<br/>
Since version 2.2 is buggy, only use it to export, create and save with version 2.1</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
