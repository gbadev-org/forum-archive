    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wrote an email to easybuy2000 a few days ago about the technical specification of the X-Rom, but the answer was that the information was only available to the developers of the clients.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I think I will be doing a bit of reverse engineering to find out more, but first I wonder if anyone else has something to share about this issue?
<br/>
<br/>
I also would appreciate pointers to information about other flash carts..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i guess you might want to download the full source code, i am not sure but I think the bank switch should be in there because pogoshell has x-rom support and it needs bank switch to start a rom...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://pokeme.shizzle.it/" target="_blank">Team Pokeme</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, I already checked that out.. It got me started.. Though I don't still know if it works for accessing the last 256mbits (of a 512 mbit cart), I will test that now!
<br/>
<br/>
The hard part to find out will probably be the flashing..
