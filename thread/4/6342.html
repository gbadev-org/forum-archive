    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
This is a kinda noob like question, but anyway, What programng languages can you use to program GBA/DS games, and, Is their any way Visual Basic can be used, since thats basicly all i know.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

I have no idea if dragonBasic is still supported by the developers and the HP seems to be down.

This question is just begging for trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
If your primary concern is with ease of learning, I would recommend starting in C rather than C++. While C++ offers you everything that C does - and sometimes with a more sensible syntax - C++ tutorials are more likely to get you bogged down in learning the object-oriented paradigm, which is a distraction from the stuff you need to learn and may overcomplicate things for you, and they are also more likely to gloss over the nitty-gritty pointer stuff as a disincentive to use it, which is the stuff you absolutely need to know for hardware programming.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, many features of the OOP paradigm, while useful, need to be much more judiciously applied when programming on the GBA, so I think it's better to leave that stuff until you have a better grasp of the hardware's limitations and an understanding of how to bend the language you're using to work with it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, C first, C++ later, if and when you decide you want to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
Dan.

No, Dragon BASIC is no longer available or supported. Sorry, guys.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">C# for the GBA is a no go, it's Microsoft's Java-like language. It compiles to machine independant byte code, which requires a 'virtual machine' to run - a lot like running code on an emulator really. Except nobody has written a GBA C# virtual machine as far as I know.
<br/>
<br/>
As for which is 'best'... Learn C, then learn C++ if it interests you - C++ is a big language and has a lot of gotchas but is capable of generating some elegant solutions to coding problems. But I prefer C and assembler for the GBA, I see enough C++ in my proper job and most games can get away with procedural code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
