    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to implement a Tile memory manager similar to what Raphael Baptista explains in his artilcle, and what TwoHeaded software implemented with the Earth3 demo.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my trouble - when I declare the "Killer Array" of global tile numbers, it's something to the tune of 64k  (32k shorts).   And just declaring that causes my game to no longer run.
<br/>
<br/>
I figure it must be a memory thing?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any easy way to track how much memory I'm using, I'm using straight C, so it's probably static declarations that are killing me right now, but I don't really feel like going through all my classes and counting sizeof's...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>

That did the trick.. thanks!!  I had attempted this BG MemMgr a while back, and got frustrated with that stupid bug, and just left it... but now it's full steam ahead!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
