    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After not coding for a long stint I wanted to play around with my old gba game, but I've immediately run into a problem. I need some sort of debug info, and I wanted to just use tonc's text engine, but I just straight up am not grasping how to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
So can anyone give some description of it's implementation and usage? Do I need any files outside of tonclib?
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll get it tomorrow, things always work better in the day.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before one of us starts explaining, it looks like there's really good explanations of it on the actual Tonc pages. Do you have specific questions that the tonc page wasn't able to answer?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read through it yesterday but I'm gonna try again now, I was just really annoyed because I was tired. I tried a bunch of things and kept getting this compilation error: "undefined reference to 'irq_init'" to a bunch of different things from tonclib.
<br/>
<br/>
All the errors came from this line in my compilation batch file, which if I remember correctly is linking my binaries. "arm-eabi-gcc -specs=gba.specs -mthumb -mthumb-interwork source\main.o source\gfx\*.o source\gfx\palette\palette.o source\gfx\maps\*.o -o main.elf"
<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time understanding other people's code, due to not having much experience, so reading through his examples really kills my brain. I'll get it eventually though!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Recently I moved from building the toolchains directly on Windows using mingw to building on linux using mingw-w64 (things are much, much faster that way). Apparently the newer tools have disabled the old globbing crt0 for msvc compatibility so wildcards won't work from cmd or through bat files.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I switched over to makefiles when I moved over. I won't pretend I have any idea how they work, but it's nice to have everything put together.
<br/>
<br/>
I also had my gba project folder in my devkitarm directory when I updated (didn't know about the erasing thing) so I'm really starting fresh now!
<br/>
<br/>
Can't seem to get a basic tilemap running though...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's time that devkitarm include a text file named "Do_not_create_projects_here.txt" which explains that the directory is cleared with new releases, just to cut down on mistakes.
<br/>
<br/>
Kind of reminds me of long ago when I installed DJGPP to make some C programs, and I learned the hard way that you couldn't name your development directory C:\dev.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
