<br/>
<br/>
I have just got hold of the MBV2 cable. I've got it loading Multiboot ROM's onto the GBA, and the printf thing works too. However, I was hoping that I could use it for a gdb (or other debugger) seesion to actually debug on the hardware. I was told that this was possible, but I can't find any real info on how to set it up. Except for this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">It also allows remote debugging over a serial port (with a proper ARM/Thumb GBA-side stub) which is ideal for embedded systems such as the GBA. eCos comes with GDB stub ROMs for ARM targets that can be modified for GBA use. You can get eCos from here: <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/" target="_blank">http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/</a></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
On one of the homebrew sites (I forget which). However, I don't really know what eCos is, and I don't know how to modify a gdb stub :( 
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me if this is possible, and how/where to get the software that I need to set it up. 
<br/>
<br/>
BTW - I'm using the latest devkitadvance on Windows. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx in advance.

<br/>
<br/>
I saw your post of about 1 year ago. Did you get any private responses on that one? Have you tried out something?
<br/>
I'd also be interested in using something like the GDB remote for ARM or the ARM Angel protocol, but it seems not that easy to implement...
<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I did manage to get the MBV2 cable, which allowed me to put printf's into my ROM, run it from the hardware, and have the printf's output to a console on my PC.
<br/>
<br/>
That's about it tho :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
