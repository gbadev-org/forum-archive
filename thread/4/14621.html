<br/>
Yes.  The bus is only so large, etc, therefore can only allow so many bits the line at one time.  
<br/>
<br/>
But, as to not confuse the actual keyword 'aligned":  Alignment, in that context, will attribute to how they are actually stored in physical devices (memory hierarchies, caches, RAM, etc).  
<br/>
<br/>
So, not having alignment specified can lead to 'default alignment' choices on data, depending on the compiler.

I have to take care in what you are asking here, as I am not certain.  
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean by <span style="font-weight: bold">"the numbers"</span>?
<br/>
<br/>
Are you asking what the numbers represent far as the actual address of a pointer ? 0x8223...blah blah.  Yeah, these are byte addressable, so each atomic unit (um.. each additional number) represents one byte. The value contained in the pointer, as expected has the same properties (since it points to a memory address).
<br/>
<br/>
 But, have fun if you are trying to address on an uneven boundary or other such pitfalls (I've done that more than few times on palm 68k ASM).  Actually, it is fun just for educational purposes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps clarify (and hopefully I understood your question).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So in other words, yes, the numbers represent <span style="font-weight: bold">bytes</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
There's no need to get wordy here guys. Address 0x0000 would be position 0 in bytes. Address 0x0010 would be position 16 (in hexadecimal) in bytes (so it would be 16 bytes into memory). And addresses are represented in hexadecimal to make certain pointer operations more convenient.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to talk about the realities of actually accessing certain addresses and bits and bytes, then I think that's another question in itself.<br/>_________________<br/>I've coded about 17 different implementations of Pong. It's the game dev's "hello, world".
