<br/>
i just have a doubt. did they use a wrapping text background in this game? are the pipes (the ones that are green )sprites or are they background tiles, what about the blocks you can destroy/walk on them are they sprites too.. i have a feeling they are.. but i might be wrong... what i percive is they use a wrapped text background that only consist of the scenery and the floor..  all other things are sprite(all other walls, blocks, holes in the ground, etc.....).. am i way off?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not sure what game you are exactly talking about, but this is my idea about what is text background and what are sprites...
<br/>
<br/>
Everything that doesn't move different than it's environment. (walls, crates, platforms, pipes) are background. Things that you can move or pickup are most likely sprites.
<br/>
<br/>
(However, to limit the number of sprites you can keep it in background until it is being moved. If that happens, the background tiles are replaced and the actual item is a sprite from then on)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would guess that everything are made from tiles except for moving objects (enemies, fireballs, muschroom and flowerpickups etc, questions blocks..) which are made of sprites. I think the green pipes are tiles as well.

If you really want to know how a game do something find yourself an emulator you can setup to not display sprites/backgrounds, that way you can see for yourself. NESticle for instance, excellent emulator to dissect NES games.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
