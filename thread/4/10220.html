    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many games for 8- and 16-bit platforms had nine pre-rendered sprite tiles for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 pixels full. I know at least <span style="font-style: italic">Tet—èis</span> (by Tengen) had all 8 for its tetromino frequency display, and the <span style="font-style: italic">Mega Man</span> series used states 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Games would either load all nine tiles into sprite VRAM and then use OAM to select one, or they would load empty, full, and middle cels and overwrite the middle tile with partially full tile data as needed.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The best method depends on how you want the bar to appear. Screen<a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoshopping" target="_blank">shops</a> please.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I was thinking of loading the entire bar into the sprite/bg tiles and just have a function redraw the correct sprite to the correct fill level as the health changes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
