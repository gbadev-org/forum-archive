<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to implement a very basic sound support in one of my games. I am using sound channels 1 and 2 (not the new DirectSound). The code works very well in looped mode, but I was unable to make it run in timed mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
My question is: are there any additional requirements (like available timers,  DMAs or interrupts)  when using channel 1-4 timed mode or the sound registers programming is enought? 
<br/>
<br/>
A side note: the BeLogic sound examples sometimes display incorrect values for the registers , so don't be confused.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help will be appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
