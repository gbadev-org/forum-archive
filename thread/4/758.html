    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I am a 'newbie' to the world of GameBoy Advance Development and am really keen. I am justw ondering which language is the best to start with. I have a good mind for these things so so far i think C++ or C is good. Any suggestions. Also if you could help me on which compilers are good, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>matt</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would recomend C, as ASM is pretty hard to start with if you doesn't know anything about it...
<br/>
I would recomend that you start with C and then maybe learn a little ASM for optimization.

<a class="postlink" href="http://snowserver.no-ip.com/tharo/hostings/lordgraga/gbadev.html" target="_blank">My site</a> has a list of C compilers that you might need...I recomend Devkit Advance or maybe ARM SDT as your compiler...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, this is an age old debate. C(++) is going to be easier than ASM. That said, I think that people should learn ASM before any higher level language (that's a disseration in it's self). I would suggest C for you, as for just hobby stuff, it will server you fine. If you ever want to do more, you can always learn ASM.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other side of the issue, I prefer English. French is second, with Latin third. That's just me though.

Sorry, couldn't resist that ;)<br/>_________________<br/>--Michael</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
