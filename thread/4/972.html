    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've managed to display a correct map with tiles in rotation background using screen mode 1 and background 2 (using dovoto's tutorial).
<br/>
<br/>
But when I try to display the map in text background mode using screen mode 0, the map doesn't look like as it suppose to do. Displaying wrong tiles in wrong location.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using this:
<br/>
REG_BG3CNT = TXTBG_SIZE_256x256 | CHAR_BASEBLOCK_0 | SCRN_BASEBLOCK_16 | BG_COLOR_256;
<br/>
<br/>
Does the map for rotation background have a different layout than the map for text background (since i'm using same map to both examples)? If so, what is the layout for both maps and where can I get a mapeditor that can convert into both layouts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found out what I did wrong. (A stupid mistake actually =P). When I loaded the map, I did this:
<br/>
<br/>
REG_DMA3SAD = (u32) mapData;
<br/>
REG_DMA3DAD = (u32) BGMapData;
<br/>
REG_DMA3CNT = (32*32/2) | DMA_ENABLE | DMA_16;
<br/>
<br/>
But should have used [x+y*MAP_LENGTH] for mapData instead. Can I still do that with DMA even if the calculation in the source is different than the destination?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
