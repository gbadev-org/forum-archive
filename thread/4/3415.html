    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After doing a bit of research, and getting used to the fact that most of my reverse engineering skills got lost a few years ago, I finally managed to get a bit of working code. I won't do much, just send a multiboot image to the gba via the Xrom usb linker.

The multiboot encryption algorithm is blatantly ripped from smcable.zip, which I just can't recall where I got (anyone who knows?).
<br/>
<br/>
It's coded in c, and compiled with mingw via the bloodshed dev-c++ package.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't even know if this is of interest to anyone else but me, but my goal with it is ultimately to get the X-rom working in linux, and I also got a vision of adding live flash support to pogoshell..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
