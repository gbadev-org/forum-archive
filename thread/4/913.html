I have installed Ham 2.71 but is it complete to code a good game like "golden sun" coz I want to make one RPG with 3 designers so the only problem is the possibility and power of tools

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, you might want to lower your sights a bit; full-blown RPGs are quite a complex thing, why not try something easier to get the hang of the tools and limitations?
<br/>
<br/>
Go to the GBADev's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/docs.php" target="_blank">Docs</a> section, pick up a tutorial and scan through it to get the info on tools. Good enough to start with and it usually gives you instructions on how to use them. If you're feeling experimental though just go to the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/tools.php" target="_blank">Tools</a> part and try them out yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as tools go I'd have a question also- what is a recommended map editor, as far as usability versus ease of use goes? I'm writing a simple tile engine that uses a 32x32 tile [256x256 pixel] Mode1 screen area and reads the map data from other smaller maps row by row [column by column]. It would make my work a lot easier if I could create one large map and cut it up into smaller pieces for export, but the one I use currently doesn't support that [or much anything really; time to get something better]. Any suggestions? I am fiddling with other programs, but I don't want to waste a few days battling some program's interface to realize the one feature I need is missing [or ignore it having missed the feature at first glance].</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on it... my sgeditor for gba (thats right, make you gfx and maps on the gba) already has a working palette editor and tile editor.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on the map editor right now.  The ncurses mock up is going along well.  Once thats done I can port the code to the gba. =)
<br/>
<br/>
After that I'll be looking for suggestions to improve it.

Can't you at least put some screenshots up? Or host it yourself for those of us on the forums? ;)

BTW, how the heck do you get the saved image data out of the thing? As one of the save slots?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The same way you got the progam on.  I use a flash linker, it lets me copy save game data back to the PC.  The alternative is to emulate it, but somehow that just seems really twisted...

So, uh.... how do you like it?  If you are drooling over it, after you stop and realize that it's horrible please tell me *what* you think is horrible.  I'm working on the map editor, as well as some fill and line drawing algorithms that will be in the next release.

Hold select until the screen blanks.  Ascii data will be written to the second 32k of SRAM.  Shut off GBA.  Open the file and scroll down until you find it the ascii stuff.  Copy it out and past it into something else.  This will be palette data if you hold select in the palette editor, or tile data if you hold select in tile editor.  The tile data is commented so you can search for a particular tile.  The palette data isn't commented.

You'll have to write a program of your own for that.  Have your program  save the gfx to SRAM and then use that save file with sgedit.  This will kill you palette though, so you'll want to save those as well.  This is the tile editor save function, followed by the one for the palette editor:
<br/>
<br/>
void tedit_save(void)
<br/>
{
<br/>
  unsigned long data[8];
<br/>
  int ctr;
<br/>
  int sctr;
<br/>
<br/>
  for (ctr = 0; ctr &lt; 256; ctr++)
<br/>
  {
<br/>
    for (sctr = 0; sctr &lt; 8; sctr++)
<br/>
      data[sctr] = *(unsigned long *)(0x06004000 + 0x20 * ctr + 4 * sctr);
<br/>
    save((unsigned char *)&amp;data[0], 8 * 4, SAVE_TILE + 0x20 * ctr);
<br/>
  }
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
void palette_save(void)
<br/>
{
<br/>
  unsigned short data[256];
<br/>
  int ctr;
<br/>
<br/>
  for (ctr = 0; ctr &lt; 256; ctr++)
<br/>
    data[ctr] = *(unsigned short *)(0x05000000 + 2 * ctr);
<br/>
  save((unsigned char *)&amp;data[0], 256 * 2, SAVE_PAL);
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
It rips the first half of screen base block 1 (not 0!) out of SRAM and puts it where sgedit wants it.  The values of SAVE_TILE and SAVE_PAL are in the readme.  Note that sgedit uses 16 color tiles.  You'll need this function too:
<br/>
<br/>
void save(unsigned char *data, int length, int offset)
<br/>
{
<br/>
  int ctr;
<br/>
<br/>
  for (ctr = 0; ctr &lt; length; ctr++)
<br/>
    *(unsigned char *)(0x0E000000 + offset + ctr) = data[ctr];
<br/>
}
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to load functions, I can post those.
