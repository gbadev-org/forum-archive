    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With the wide availability of Wii homebrew, has anyone made or is it possible to have a program to send multiboot roms to a GBA using the GCN/GBA link cable?
<br/>
<br/>
How would I go about writing such a program if it doesn't exist already?<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There was a similar question on this forum a while back, but it never got solved:

<br/>
As for the rest, please correct me if I'm wrong:
<br/>
Is it possible? For a GameCube it HAS TO be possible, since I've seen it work in commercial games. A Wii will probably work also, and it should be easy to test. Just try a commercial GameCube game and see if it works.
<br/>
The GBA side is easy, because it's not hard to find a working implementation of GBA to GBA multiboot, or PC to GBA multiboot. GameCube/Wii to GBA should be the same.<br/>_________________<br/>Bricks-OS, Operating System for Game Consoles</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
