    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been trying to implement multiplayer link with interrupts. What I've done is basicly this: in my interrupt handler I've handled incoming data and setting up outgoing data for the next send. Then, at the very last, I've toggled the start-bit of the link. The link should'nt be busy, so this should work... but it doesn't; it doesn't send anything.
<br/>
<br/>
I've come to the conclusion that one cannot initialize a send from within a interrupt... is that right? What I've done is moving the send away from the interrupt rutine and that is working perfectly fine, but the other method is surely much nicer!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't directly answer your question, but if you haven't looked into the multiplayer code at the SGADE site I'd recommend it. Jaap Sutter claims his code conforms to N's standards (whatever that means) and is stable.

I'm preparing to implement a 2 player example myself. I'd be interested to see what you've accomplished if you care share it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

By the way, I couldn't find the information from Jaap Sutter...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
