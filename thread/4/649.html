So no, there shouldn't be any legal problems, as devkitadvance doesnt 'own' gcc etc.<br/>_________________<br/>microkernel advance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Licenses for compilers apply only to the libraries that get linked into your code.  The library that comes with Devkit Advance is Red Hat's Newlib, under a permissive (XFree86/zlib style) license that allows linking into proprietary software.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you're using somebody else's library such as a mod player, movie player, or 3D engine, you'll have to obey its license.  And if you're using MFXJO's LZO compression library, you'll need to follow the GPL, which includes publishing the source code of your game's engine (but not the graphics, maps, audio, NPC scripts, etc) and opening the game to Total Conversions that can be sold.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're using music licensed from a music publisher, you'll need to obey its license, which typically includes royalty payments; if you're using music written by in-house composers, you'll have to check whether or not the composers <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/law/library/cases/case_brightharrisongs.html" target="_blank">accidentally copied some other copyrighted song</a>.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If u mean sell it on the net for people with flash carts to buy then it would be quite a small market. Plus one person could buy it and spread it around the net so no one else will buy it. Plus there are probably loads of legal implications and you would have to get professional legal advice which would probably cost more than what you make selling the game. I think you're best bet is to show it to a publisher and, if they want it, get it officially released.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanx alot.
<br/>
Also, I wonder if publishers or Nintendo have certain demands or frameworks that every GBA-title has to comply with. 
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.. maybe my questions are better suited in another topic, but are there any <span style="font-weight: bold">commercial gba-developers</span> active in this forum?<br/>_________________<br/>---</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

some commercial could be here, but don't think so.

If you are a commercial gba developper, you don't want to share
<br/>
your code with the 'whole' world. Otherwise someone could copy it,
<br/>
take it earlier to the stores and sells the game before u bring it out.

but that's just what i think.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A program is only a small part of a game. The GNU General Public License typically doesn't require you to open-source your story, graphics, maps, audio, or other assets not compiled to executable code.  Though you can't sue pirates over copying a GPL'd engine, you can sue them over copying the other parts of the copyrighted game.  Example 1: The musical score of the movie <span style="font-style: italic">It's A Wonderful Life</span> is copyrighted, but the rest of the movie has fallen into PD in the United States.  The owner of copyright in the musical score controls the broadcast of the movie.  Example 2: <span style="font-style: italic">Kivio</span> by theKompany.com is free software, but the stencils that make it useful are proprietary.  Example 3: <span style="font-style: italic">Doom</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Quake</span> by id Software now have GPL'd engines, but the trademarks, textures, maps, and music are still proprietary.

If your program links to a library under the GNU GPL, the GPL doesn't require you to publish the source code of your program unless and until you publish your executable program.  Because you don't need to publish the program's source code until the day your cartridge ends up in stores[1], you have a time-to-market advantage.
<br/>
<br/>
[1] Technically, you "publish" a GBA program under the GPL when you send it off to Nintendo for approval, but Nintendo probably won't distribute your source code to third parties.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
