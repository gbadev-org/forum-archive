I am looking into downloading and installing a Linux Kernel into a GBA ROM. This mostly for extra functionality that would be gained by adding Linux to the equation.
<br/>
<br/>
I've already checked the main kernel tree, and must have missed the portion with the GBA hardware. Then somebody pointed me in the way of uCLinux, and I am checking that out right now.
<br/>
<br/>
This is for research for an article that hopefull will make it into an e-zine known as K-1ine. If this shows promise, I may also make games based upon this.
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? Pointers? Leads?<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA linux isn't very useful as the GBA hasn't got much RAM.
<br/>
You get a shell and that's about it.
<br/>
You can download it from here:

DSLinux is much more useful as it includes Wifi, telnet, web browser, games, etc.

Just out of curiousity... how much more RAM does DS have in comparison to the GBA? I knew I'd probably have to lop and chop limbs off of things but if you are suggesting DS instead, it would be nice to know how much less I'd have to cut things off.<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Both GBALinux and DSLinux make use of the 32MB of ROM for kernel code and root filesystem to minimise the use of the limited RAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

On other systems, VRAM is not easily accessable, but on the GBA, things are different.  VRAM can be fully accessed at any time, it's just that if the screen is using it at the same time, it adds a small waitstate before the read or write.  Even with the waitstate, it's still faster than EWRAM.  You can even store code inside VRAM and execute it there, but then you lose some space which could have been used for graphics.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo's GBA-hosted NES emulator, called acNES by the pirate scene, runs half its code from otherwise unused areas of VRAM because reading VRAM (less than one wait state) is faster than reading EWRAM (three wait states).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
Also I heard somebody mentiion that Thumb instructions could be called from the ROM using RAM elsewhere, and run comparably to ARM7 inside EWRAM. Is it posslbe that I could load only the kernel in to EWRAM (as well as the software that handles VRAM), and run Thumb applications from the ROM. (Yes, I know that ROM memory cannot change itself while running under Arm7/thumb or emulation.)<br/>_________________<br/>[ <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakedesu.info" target="_blank">Main Site</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://krfp.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank"> Kid Radd Fan Project</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.dakedesu.info/" target="_blank">Forums</a> ]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
