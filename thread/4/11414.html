Converting the gamemaker program (or any non-DS-based program) is only possible if you have the source code and have made the correct adjustments to use the DS hardware. Likelyhood of that happening when you are not the author of the program is slim to none.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no easy way. You really need to re-program these games using the DS library, and compile and test them on hardware. Gamemaker .exe files are set up to use the windows API, which does not even exist on the DS, which lacks a lot of windows features like oh, say, a file system. No, if you are going to make games for the DS you are coing to have to code them from scratch, and learn the basics of working with the hardware, which is how all console programming (to my knowledge) is done.
<br/>
<br/>
I would actually recommend programming for the GBA first, if this is your way to go, since you can test GBA games with much more accuracy on a PC emulator, rather than having to buy the hardware you would need to program directly on a DS. (No DS emulator is perfect at this point. Most cannot run commercial games of any kind, and the demos they can run have glitches. I bring up commercial simply because it is a good way to judge how good the emulation really is, not because I condone it or anything.)
<br/>
<br/>
The type of conversion you speak of simply cannot be done. They are great PC games I am sure, but you need to learn DS and GBA stuff the hard way, there are no easy back-doors.

Would this issue be big enough to warrant a sticky? Or is it easier to just explain to each person who asks?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As of this writing, there is no simple way to do this. Those development environments are optimized for the larger memory of PCs. You will have to rewrite the code from the ground up.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You might want to expand that sentence to something like "Those development environments are optimized for the larger memory of PCs and rely on Operating System components that are not available on Nintendo handhelds". 
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I could see some people thinking that the <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> barrier is the memory restrictions, and that simply inserting a cartridge with extra memory such as the SuperCard or the Opera memory cart would allow them to run their games on the handhelds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you need to ask, it's safe to assume that a port is going to be a lot of work if it is possible.  The GBA/DS uses arcane display techniques, so certain programs will be impossible to port without excessive source recoding and/or data re-encoding.  Other compromises may be necessary.  The net result is that not everything can be ported, and most of what can be ported can not be ported easily.
