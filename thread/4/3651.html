    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Realizing that the DS is not out until November, and that it will take at least sometime before it penetrates the market, how much longer does the GBA have at the top of the portable gaming world? The PSP won't be out until March either, so are we talking at least a solid year until next June (05), or perhaps even further?

At what point will publishers start to seriously ramp down their projects for GBA in order to focus on the newer hardware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

of cousre there is alway the gamecube that will keep the gameboy alive and kicking so i don't expect it to be completely dead until one of 2 things happen.
<br/>
   1. Nintendo releses some sort of wireless adpter to make the gamecube compatable with using the DS much like the GBA for compatable games. This will make the gameboy absolete for these games.
<br/>
<br/>
   2. This new revelution consol thingy come out. This will also bring a death to the gamecube thus in trun bringinga death a death to the GBA. because they go hand and hand.

Once Nintendo stops selling new GBA and GBA SP systems, it will become next to impossible to obtain flash carts, and if you're not running the program on GBA hardware, then you might as well have made an SDL program instead to begin with (see <a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.parodius.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=nesdev&amp;Number=1993&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;mode=threaded&amp;sb=5#Post1993" target="_blank">here</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://nesdev.parodius.com/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=nesdev&amp;Number=2058&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;mode=threaded&amp;sb=5#Post2058" target="_blank">here</a> which claim that you're not an NES homebrew developer until you've soldered up your own flash cart from parts).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There will be a <span style="font-weight: bold">big</span> market for GBA games long after the GBA stops selling. That's because the DS is backwards compatible (can play all GBA games -- dunno about GB). Developers want to go with what "potential" is there for sales. There are X number of GBA units in circulation right now. After a year from release there will be N DS units in circulation. Until N &gt; X, you can bet there will be more GBA games made than DS games, simply because there is less worry.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="mailto:massung@gmail.com">massung@gmail.com</a>

DS games will probably be just as expensive as gamecube or xbox games.

The audio and video capabilities of the GBA are still good. I think it will live on for quite a while. Especially if Nintendo come to their senses and add a GBA link port to the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all the GBA is no longer in production. In fact I have not seen any new ones in stores for quite some time now.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly reguarding the GBA SP - they are still coming out with new colors ect.... I think you will see this little guy for a least a year more if not longer. Don't forget, the SP price is pretty good and likely to drop lower. This should entice a few more parents to spring for the kids. Don't forget $130 is still not pocket change and I think the price is still alot particularly for pre teens. I have swayed many a parent humming and hawing over the purchase of an SP when I explain the savings due to rechargable batteries. (they are thinking future cost as well as immediate if you understand what I am saying)
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the DS goes - first the official price still remains to be seen. Also don't forget, this is a <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">DEVELOPERS SYSTEM</span></span>.  To me this is almost like an experiment. Its like NINTENDO is saying, here is a bunch of new stuff, lets see what you can make it do. All the ideas are great, but the consumer gets the final say. Its Evolution. If the developers and CONSUMER like the new features, I think they will stay and develop further. If they don't like a feature, that feature will die. 
<br/>
<br/>
We will only see once it is actually in our hands, and we see how the features work. Believe me if the consumer likes somethng they will say. If they don't <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">THEY WILL SAY</span></span>. Remember how upset everyone was when the exluded an earphone jack off the SP! NINTEDO heard that and put it back on the DS, didn't they.
<br/>
<br/>
How much the public embraces the DS and all of its features will ultimately determine the lifespan of the SP and/or its successor.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, if this is long winded, I tried to keep it as short as possible. I'm actually very excited about the DS, but not because it is a new or better system, but because of the concept and ideas behind it.

I'm not sure I follow. Why would console developers not give respect to the GBA? Many console developers come from the SNES and prior era, so what if any stigma is there surrounding the GBA?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I personally see handhelds as a fun challenge - get a really fun, cool looking game while fighting its limitations.

First you write the software trial-and-error style (as described in Graham's thesis). When you are done, you write (or update) the specification, and then you write the software again, from scratch.
<br/>
<br/>
By starting over from scratch, you prevent any bugs due to the trial-and-error phase from entering the final code. But you still get all the code quality benefits as described by Graham.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Programming is an art form, like cooking, painting, karate, baseball and the list goes on... I'm glad everyone enjoyed Graham's little essay (btw, do <span style="font-style: italic">buy</span> the book -- show support and there is a lot more in it than the one essay, but yes, most of these are on his website, too).
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;rant&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
However, my beef with the thread was the posts that began using the word "real" in front of "programmer". This is not only stupid, it emphasizes the posters' ignorance and arrogance. Either age or lack of experience in the real world (or both) was beginning to shine through.
<br/>
<br/>
Was Charles Babbage a "real programmer"? He didn't use a computer. What about an SQL database designer/programmer? That would never work on an embedded device. What about an HTML web page designer? I can't make good web pages, but I program PS2 and XBox games professionally; is one of us a "real" programmer and not the other? No. We're just different. So what constitutes a "real programmer"?
<br/>
<br/>
What many young (or inexperienced) programmers fail to grasp is that they are just beginning a cycle that all that came before them have gone through. Almost all <span style="font-style: italic">good</span> programmers tend to follow the same cycle in their career. This mostly involves learning to program, and then learning over and over again, all the new and wierd languages and strange programming paradigms they can.
<br/>
<br/>
But finally, at the end of the day, <span style="font-style: italic">real work</span> needs to get done. This is what makes a "real" programmers. The one who can get it done. I've met several very talented programmers who can't do this. 
<br/>
<br/>
A beautiful example of this is OOP. OOP is a <span style="font-style: italic">design concept</span> -- a tool used to help in the design process. But many programmers treat it as a religion; everything must be OO. I just laugh, becuase at the end of the day you need <span style="font-style: italic">main()</span> -- which isn't OO.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, every tool has its place (that's why it was made), and you use the right tool for the job. Mr. Graham is a Lisp advocate (and a good one). I love Lisp, sajimori does, too. That's great. Would I use Lisp to program a lexical parser? No -- it isn't designed for text parsing -- C is. Would I use Python for embedded programming? No, I have Forth for that. Would I use Forth for shell scripting? No, Perl works just fine. Would I use Perl for AI scripting? Hell no, that's what Lisp is for!
<br/>
<br/>
What I hoped some of the posters (and anonymous readers) would get out of Mr. Graham's essay was that programming is <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> sequencing together statements or functions in a particular language or using a particular paradigm to find the solution to a given problem. Programming is nothing more than getting an automated process to solve a problem for you, whether using Matlab, recursion or creating a weaving loom. To do this, you need to completely understand the problem and the tools you have at your disposal. 
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/rant&gt;

<br/>
Ack, sorry for that ;)

OOP is a <span style="font-style: italic">design concept</span> -- a tool used to help in the design process. But many programmers treat it as a religion; everything must be OO.

And then the OO Cult will make your program into an instance of an object, making all input event-oriented, and hide main() in a library.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

BTW, I was the one who made the original real programmers post.  I was just refering to the what I have personally experienced from others in the field.  YMMV.  BTW, I believe a real programmer is someone who gets the job done and whos code can be used in "unexpected" ways without breaking :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
