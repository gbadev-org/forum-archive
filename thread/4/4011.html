    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My Multiboot code works nice when I compile the master as multiboot
<br/>
and send it as a multiboot ROM to my GBA and run it.
<br/>
But when I compile as a usual rom it doesnt work.
<br/>
when the master sends the logo it is little distorted behind the
<br/>
o and (r).
<br/>
I cant understand why!! When I send the ROM header I send from 0x2000000 when it was a multiboot ROM and then I changed it to 0x8000000 I think it something of that  but I cant find out what!
<br/>
Any ideas anyone?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is the rom image const?
<br/>
<br/>
2.
<br/>
Display the actual memory address of the ROM that you are sending on the screen or through debug so you can double check the location.
<br/>
<br/>
3.
<br/>
I do believe the header in your file may be corrupted, do you use GBAFIX to fix the header? Try including a const header array into your program ans see if it works from that.
<br/>

It may be your send code. Do you check the reply from the slave units?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
