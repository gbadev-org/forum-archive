    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I understand every time someone tells me to change the first or second bit of a number. However, I don't understand how to do this in C. I noticed that in the header files I do have, some of the definitions point to memory locations in hex. Whats the deal here? Can someone fill me in on this issue? Normally I would use neither, but it's obviously required in GBA programming...<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
