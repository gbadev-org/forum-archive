    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a method to perform a stack trace in code. I'm aware that it is possible using GDB, but that's not what I want. I would like to receive the names of the last called functions to output thethem on the screen. I actually found a lot of information about "how to use gdb" but nothing about how this could be done through code. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any help appreciated. Thanks in advance.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I'm using the latest devkitarm compiler btw.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
First, you'll need to modify your link script to put the debugging information (or at the parts you want) into the rom. I just moved it into rodata, although that's going to mean you won't be able to use gdb. I'm sure there's a better way.
<br/>
<br/>
Next you have to read the debugging information. I modified libdwarf (from <a href="http://reality.sgi.com/davea/" target="_blank">http://reality.sgi.com/davea/</a> ) to read the debugging info from the rom instead of using libelf. 
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you have to generate a stack trace using the debugging information.  This is where I got stuck -- my code crashed, and without gdb I couldn't tell what was going on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
