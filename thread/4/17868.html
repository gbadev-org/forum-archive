Mine currently stands at a slow 20k for a 32x32 4-bits per pixel image. I think I can cut it down to around 13k - 15k but the current build doesn't allow any lower than that I think. This is running the process from ROM and not IWRAM by the way.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
For a 32-bit aligned LZ compression,wouldn't the compression rate be compromised? My 16-bit version has a compression similar to the 8-bit version(roughly 60% of the original file size) but I can't imagine that being the same for the 32-bit version.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I managed to speed it up to 10k cycles for a 32x32 4-bit/pixel image executed from ROM. Is this good or can it go faster with a different process?
<br/>
<br/>
edit: As an additional question, how fast is the built in BIOS LZSSdecompress2vram of the GBA for 32x32 sprites? My data format is not compatible with the BIOS version because I changed some things up to make it run a little faster in my custom LZSS decompression process.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Writing to VRAM can be done with 16 <span style="text-decoration: underline">or</span> 32bit writes.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
