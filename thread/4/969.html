    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering if anyone had integrated the multi player portion of Sgade into a different enviroment, DevKit Advance, Ham or other?  Or has anyone used it period?  I saw ampz keyboard example but have yet to read up on it.  In my head I think I should be able to add just the relevent code/functions to my Ham project and be fine.  Since it appears that most all enviroments are just a facility for manipulating different locations in memory.  Let me know if I'm off the wall :)  (not for using HAM, just in general. sheesh!)
