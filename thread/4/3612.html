It doesn't care how they are triggered.  SIO is a pain because five registers are involved.  Game Pak is odd in that only two are required.  (Every other interrupt requires three.)

Based on how one interperts 'enable'.  Has anyone messed around with a cart yank interrupt?
<br/>
<br/>
A game pak interrupt is triggered whenever a cart is insert or removed, correct?  Do you suppose a game pak interrupt could be used to bypass the need for a valid header on commercial carts?  Would it be possible to create a multiboot image that would "mask in" ROM space.  After that it enables a game pak interrupt it waits for the headerless unofficial cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course that would entirely defeat the purpose of a handheld system.  If that would work, one would need a preboot cart to properly pull this off.  That brings us back to the header issue.
