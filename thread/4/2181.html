    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">WARNING</span></span> Expressed herein are opinions of the author so don't get upset if you disagree...
<br/>
<br/>
Hey all,
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I would inform everyone that it <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> possible to get signed by a publisher from the hobby standpoint. My company is living proof that it does happen. Here are some pointers for all of those that are trying to do the same.
<br/>
<br/>
1. If you're in highschool then don't even think about trying it, chances are you'll fail. It's better to stay in school and keep improving your skills, after all you're in no rush.
<br/>
2. If a coder then you should attempt a BS in Comp Sci or relevant degree before trying to start a company. Believe me, it helps to have that on your resume. Although I've heard of people that have made it w/out the degree, it just makes it easier.
<br/>
3. Your team, at least the majority of it, should be located in the same area so that you can "open" an office or meet regularly.
<br/>
4. Be ready to quit your job(s) and focus on the company/game full-time for at least one year or more. I'm talking 12 hours a day plus weekends.
<br/>
5. Have financial backing or save up money. We've burned through thousands by paying ourselves, buying equipment, lawyer fees, other misc business fees. We couldn't have done it without saving up money and then having family support. We also cut our personal spending down to almost nothing. Just food, rent, bills and maybe a movie every once in a while. Basically we lived off of $300-500 a month per person.
<br/>
6. Talk to every publisher you can. I mean bug them to death, call them, email them, get your product in their faces. But be professional about it and know when to call it quits on a publisher. Believe me, we got turned down many times but kept going until we found one that liked the game.
<br/>
7. Have a good lawyer! We can thank Eric Kinkead from Game Titan for giving us a good reference. Make sure the lawyer is familar with video game laws (or whatever they're called) and yes you will be paying for it.
<br/>
8. Build reusable technology in-house. We have our own tools, libraries, engines, ect. Although 3rd party tools are not bad, it is sometimes better to have your own stuff so you can modify it and change it to your needs. Also don't rely on hobby tools (sorry guys) since you have to pass N's lot check and you need to have the code to all game modules in case of an error. Basically I'm saying that if you are trying to get published then don't rely on HAM, or Krawall, or anything like that unless you can get all the source code.
<br/>
9. Don't try to go over your head with the game idea. If you aren't good at 3d then don't make a 3d game, same goes for RPGs. The last thing you want to attempt first is a full blown RPG. Trust me, we've been down that road before too, it just doesn't happen. To much time, money and resources are needed for an RPG and it's doubtful that you have them.
<br/>
10. Also on the game design, make sure it's solid. Our design doc is over 200 pages, detailing everything we can think of.
<br/>
11. Get to know people in the industry. Ask lots of questions. Most will be glad to help, I know we couldn't have done it without some of our contacts.
<br/>
<br/>
Last thing before I go:
<br/>
You're new thus you will be walked on. This is fine, remember it's not about making money just yet. It's about making games and getting into the industry. After that first title is on the selves it gets easier and you have more say in royalties, titles, ect...
<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on but I figure this is enough for you to dwell on. I hope this helps any inspiring companies out there, I know it would've helped us in the beginning.

    <h4>#11418 - Sean - Sun Oct 05, 2003 11:47 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd also like to note, that if you're in high school, you should work on a portfolio of your work to show what skill you have, rather than spend all of your time trying to get published.  You shouldn't just wait until after high school to make gba games, but you shouldn't be concerned with making an awesome game and getting published either.  Your education is what's most important.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#11424 - NovusAmor - Mon Oct 06, 2003 2:57 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sean makes a good point! Also we began working on our technology (game engine, ect) while still in college. Our final year was pretty easy going compared to earlier years so we all had time to work to get ourselves ahead of the "game". When we went full-time (graduate college &amp; quit jobs) we had a playable demo, some tools, and a basic engine. Thus we didn't start off with nothing and we kept pushing our selves to do better and add more. That I think helped keep us together and see it through. 
<br/>
So basically what I'm saying is that if you're in school you should try to form your team and do some of the ground work and improve upon it while you're not under the pressure to preform. That will also allow you to see if your team is compatible together and where the weak/strong points are.<br/>_________________<br/>Robert

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, I'm not normally one to bring topics back from the dead, but I just found this and have some questions about it if NovusAmor (or anyone else that could help) is still around.
<br/>
<br/>
1. It sounds like publishers are not opposed to submissions made without any official tools or licenses.  From what I can tell, Nintendo seems to view homebrew sorts of things as illegal.  A publisher is not going to run to Nintendo and say, "Hey, these people over here have been using tools X and Y and a flash cart from Hong Kong, and I know you don't like that" will they?
<br/>
<br/>
2. It also sounds like it's just the publisher that needs to be licensed by Nintendo and not the developer, is this correct?  Or does the developer get licensed through the publisher after they've worked out a publishing deal?
<br/>
<br/>
3. What sorts of things would the lawyer be necessary for, besides looking over the contracts and NDA's and such?  I haven't needed to hire a lawyer in the past, approximately how much money in fees should I expect to pay?  Do you think it would be workable to deal with a lawyer remotely (telephone, etc.) without meeting in person? Since I'm currently in Ohio, a deadzone of the video game industry, I'd be surprised if I could find one that knew much about video games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Based on what I've read, this is the case. However, many publishers prefer to have some input into the design and implementation, so don't just approach publishers with a finished product and expect to get it published.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Nintendo knows full well most (if not all heh) licenced development companies use these 3rd party products. I guess they would rather sell
<br/>
their own flash carts but I would hardly think they would sue any manufacturers/resellers of these devices if they we only used for development purpouses (read: not used for piracy).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#21974 - NovusAmor - Thu Jun 10, 2004 4:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To answer your questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1. I don't think publishers care how it's done as long as the end product is legal. Thus don't steal code or ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
2. There are a couple of ways to be a developer. You can get licensed without the publisher, via the publisher, or just work under a publisher as a contract deal. The best is to get licensed somehow so that you can deal with other publishers without the first one having any control over it. You can find out the details on wario world.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Lawyer is useful for setting up a business, checking copyrights, and many other things that you might not realize. I would expect to use $1,000 to $3,000 in fees and maybe more. Our lawyer is in Cali and we're in Tennessee and we haven't had a problem yet.
<br/>
<br/>
And to counter tepples, there are plenty of publishers looking for a finished product. We've been contacted by a couple that were interested in anything we had finished, although that didn't mean they'd publish it but the opportunity is still there. A finished product will go much further than any non-finished product, even if they don't want the game they see that you can do it so they may be willing to sign you for something else.<br/>_________________<br/>Robert

Is this the developer website that allows you to take a look at all the tech specs of they systems (like for example.. the DS). If it is, are you sure you're allowed to give out the web address, even if you need to have a valid account to access anything?

I queried Nintendo about this, and they said that the homebrew market is fine and does not anger or bother them. It is merely piracy that they do not like and told me to continue with my work.
<br/>
<br/>
ALSO, I should add that a business mind is required to progress. Homebrew development is getting somewhat like music development, where people go in search of a major deal before they've got their game strategy set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well they used to post information on how to become a licensed developer, the law etc. I'm not sure if they still have links from their site but the pages still exist - you only have to google, and you can quite happily read their old information, it's even in their old 1997 site design ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Another question: Are you required to purchase the dev kit?  Or are there ways around that, such as do the publishers ever just provide one (perhaps as an advance against royalties?), or can you get by without opting to get ahold of the official dev kit?  If there's no way around the developer paying the $10k+ up front for that (or owing it to someone, as the case may be), has anyone seen any market data on about what percentange of GBA games are able to re-coup that particular expense?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, In regards to the mention about 12 hour days plus weekends, I have to say I'm a little bit suprised to hear that applies to the smaller mobile devices like the GBA and not just the PC/XBox/PS2/GC croud.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised as well.  I've assembled a team and we're working on a GBA game that we'll start pitching to publishers later on in the year.  None of us can afford to work without pay full-time, so all of us have (at least) a part-time paying job and are only able to devote part-time work to this project.  Granted, we'd get more done in a shorter time period if we were all able to work full-time, but I'd argue NovusArmor's point that you'd have to quit your day job and work 80-some hours a week to succeed.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, no single approach works well for everyone, but I see no problem with doing game dev part-time until you're able to do otherwise.  By the end of the year, we hope to find a publisher who will provide an advance against royalties, allowing us to quit our current jobs and move to full-time development.  Even then, I don't plan to work much more than 40 hours per week (with exceptions, of course).  I've read that a dev team that works a well-managed, sensible work week (40 hours being the prime example) for the majority of the project will perform better and more efficiently than one that's on a continual "death march."  I don't plan to burn myself out of game development with my first couple games. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:  Hey Mike, can you provide any insight as to what kind of work week is typical where you work and at other GBA dev houses you know of?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've heard that you can get publishers to loan the dev kit but if you can afford to buy one then do it. That's just another way to make sure you're not stuck with one publisher. I doubt you can go without having one at all since you really need to be able to test everything on actual hardware and run it through some debugging for those hard to catch errors.
<br/>
<br/>
For the 12 hour days, you don't work those all the time, once you've finished the project those hours go back to normal. But our first time through we did because we wanted to make sure the game was polished and had everything little thing we could think of, thus the long hours. Our team was very small the first project so everyone was pulling double duty for example: Two programmers, I was the game coder and the other guy was the tool coder. So between the two of us we had a lot of work to do, we made most of our own tools which required a full-time guy on it and that left me to do the game itself. One musician for all music and sfx and although that's not unheard of, we didn't get the kit until the end of development so he had to do all the conversions and put it into the game in less than two months. One designer, again not unheard of but he did most of the level design, ai, dialogue, and ran the daily business side. One artist, I'm still amazed that he was able to crank out all the art in time.
<br/>
<br/>
Now we have a few more people on board so we can spread the work out more, however I still like to put in killer hours because I push myself to be the best I can. This is something I love to do (program) so I can put in a 12 hour day and not realize it and since I don't have a wife/kids I don't care. However I was burnt out a little afterwards so I just took some time off and now I'm good to go again.<br/>_________________<br/>Robert

Well have you used no$? The VisualBoy debugger just doesn't compare; it's like comparing a trucklift to a rusty old shovel.

Yes No$GBA is worth it.  VBoy offers memory viewing and a good VRAM/palette viewer.  That's nice, but not all I want.  No$GBA offers normal or conditional breakpoints, watchpoints (that is global memory breakpoints), a stack viewer, and some source level debugging ability.  It's just shy of being better than a hardware system in terms of debugging ability.  The only thing it's missing is the ability to easily view local variables, and to do the math for you when looking at structures (and a few minor bugs when .elf files get really big.)  Just watchpoints by themselves are worth 5K to me.  Add the fact that it allows you to print debug info to a file and it gives us a really easy and reliable way to profile code.  
<br/>
<br/>
no$GBC (the GBC version) allowed me to personally become 10x more effective programming on the GBC over the stupid hardware.  No$GBA probably allows me to be x2 effective.  With just the above things fixed, it'd go to x5.  Martin has earned every penny we've sent to him.
