    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
I'd like to use VS NET 2003 as the IDE for writing stuff for the GBA and was wondering if somebody else uses it and has some plan on how to integrate a new language and build tools etc into it.
<br/>
Thanks for any tips!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://hiddenresource.corewatch.net/" target="_blank">hiddenresource.corewatch.net - Aspects in Flash Game Development</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I used to work with VC 6 as my IDE with the GBA AppWizard, but the AppWizard isn't compatible with VS NET 2003 to my knowledge. Lucky for me, VS NET 2003 was able to convert  my VC 6 project to the newer version with no problems.
<br/>
With stuff from scratch or projects created non-VC6, I'm not quite sure other than perhaps adding a working MAK file to a Win32 console workspace that does all the compiler/linker/etc stuff and try from there.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is nothing different, you still run off a MAK file that directs the compiling of your code to a compiler that creates the GBA ROM (like DevKitAdv). VS 2003 is just one of those options to use as an IDE if you have it. I don't know how it is with other IDEs, but with VS 2003 (and VC++6 before), I'd get errors at compile-time, but unlike actual VC++ projects, I can't just double-click the error to direct me to that particular line. I have to open the file and search for the line that it had the error on, and then go from there.
<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who is having trouble getting VS2003 to work with a MAK file, I have something here that might help.
<br/>
<br/>
To use a MAK file, add the MAK file to your project (I usually add it through the right-click menu of the Project Name). Then go under your Project Name in the Solution Explorer and go into it's properties under it's right-click menu. IN the General tab under Configuration Properties, select Makefile. You could probably leave the Debugging tab alone. In the NMake tab, put "NMake /f *The_MAK_File*.mak in the first and second line, adding "/a" in the second.
<br/>
<br/>
That should be it. When making the ROM, use Build/Build Solution or Build/Rebuild Solution. Trying to use Debug/Start will not work, because you are using the MAK file.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: This is just for trying to get the MAK file usable, but in order for your project to compile with whatever compiler you are using, you'll need to make sure you have all the files required of it, like DevKitAdv uses crtbegin.o, crtend.o, crt0.s, and Linkscript. I don't know what the other compiler need.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The other solution is to use a standard makefile with a make command like the one provided in cygwin or msys
<br/>
<br/>
First add the path to make.exe to the tools path of vstudio: Menu (Tools/Options/Projects/VC++ Directories/Executable files)
<br/>
<br/>
Next: you create a "Makefile project"
<br/>
<br/>
Under nmake rules you can put the command that shall be used to build the project for example "make all"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in your makefile use a rule like this one to format the error messages from gcc format to VS one:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
%.o: %.c
<br/>
&lt;TAB&gt; $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $&lt; -o $@ 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed 's/:\([0-9]\+\):/(\1) :/'

Hope this helps

nmake is just barely a step up from batch files where gcc is concerned. The best policy is to use gnu make.
<br/>
<br/>
The makefiles in the examples on <a href="http://ww.devkit.tk" target="_blank">http://ww.devkit.tk</a> are fairly generic and reasonably well commented.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also a small section on setting up VS6 in the setting up section, a couple of pages in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

devkitARM needs a specs switch when linking, that's it. No messing around with linkscripts and crt0, compile &amp; go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
