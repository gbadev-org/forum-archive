    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From the Cowbite spec, with regards to windowing:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">There is also the "obj" window, which can be thought of as another window which is defined by the visible regions of the objs on screen.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found a purpose for this particular windowing feature? I'm not entirely clear on what it can be used for.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it can be used to create non-rectangular windows.
<br/>
those sprites that have the object attribute set aren't actually displayed.
<br/>
instead, their non-transparent pixels form the object window.
<br/>
<br/>
i haven't used it myself so far.
<br/>
i think ham comes with a (nice) example that uses the obj window.
<br/>
<br/>
you can also create non-rectangular windows by reprogramming the normal windows during the display period (using hdma or hblank interrupts)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting. Does anyone know if putting a sprite in the obj window means it consumes a different amount of the 950 pixels/scanline available than a normal sprite?
<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions of cool effects this can be used to create?
<br/>
<br/>
[edit: any MORE suggestions, seeing as tepples' post arrived before mine? :)]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could do some nifty screen transitions that wouldn't be possible with normal windows. Vertical bars would be one example, or maybe a sort of diffusion effect by randomly plotting pixels in sprites covering the whole screen. I'm sure they'll be useful for spell effects in my RPG too, maybe something like a flame-shaped window with a scrolling fire BG showing through it. Plenty of cool stuff^_^<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
