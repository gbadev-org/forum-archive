    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I have recently downloaded DevKitARM 19a, it is able to parse my sources OK but then when it finishes I get:
<br/>
<br/>
collect2: CreateProcess: No such file or directory
<br/>
<br/>
and the .ELF file is not created. This seems to happen on the example sources too.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know what this error message means? There's seems to be no documentation available for DevKitARM, it would be good if the developers of it had seen fit to at least provide an explanation of the error codes...!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't understand WHY these paths should even be necessary? That sort of crap was left behind in the 1980s. It means the program can't be as easily installed, moved or uninstalled, it means you can't have spaces in the pathname, etc. Why does it need all these UNIX crapplets anyway?? Why hasn't it been ported properly? it seems to be only "half-ported" if it needs all this legacy UNIX stuff just to compile a straightforward C program.

The PATH is used by windows for all kinds of things and not just microslop tools.  The PATH on my machine is pretty long and changing it would break all kinds of other code.  The PATH just tells the order and places to search for utilities.  If the msys install modified your path automaticly you would not even know about the need.  If you want to see things break try moving product directories in "Program Files" and see what happens.  There are lots of absolute directories for tools and such but user code can be relative from a fixed point or just relative from the current working directory.

Your make utility and rxvt should be in your msys/bin directory.  Since there is a mixture of case sensative and case insensative searching going on I suggest making the cases match exactly in the PATH variable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That suggests a problem with your mys installation, both rxvt.exe &amp; sh.exe should be found in the msys/bin folder.

The path you show here is messed up, there should be a semi-colon after the first c:\windows\ part. That may actually be the source of all your problems.

The gnu compiler collection happens to be primarily a unix toolchain and there's been quite a lot of work done by many people to enable it to run in a native windows environment. There are several thousand people using the devkitPro toolchains with none of the problems you seem to be experiencing.

For legacy compatibility with the DOS command line. I've never seen any application that requires it. And I've installed hundreds.

<br/>
Well, I used your installer and it didn't work. So there is clearly a bug. Maybe it doesn't affect all users but it certainly affects some. I have noticed other threads with similar issues. So to say "several thousand" people are using it doesn't mean it is bug-free, it seems there is a substantial number who CANNOT use it because of the buggy installer. Or whatever the problem is.
<br/>
<br/>
And the work of "many people" doesn't seem to have resulted in a proper Windows port, if it still needs all this half-assed UNIX crap.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;What's wrong with using relative paths!? Or even looking in the current directory for this stuff would be better than this kind of foolishness!!

How hard would it be to change it to do this? Surely it would be trivial.
