    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone around here has any data on how fast the bios atan2 function is in comparison to other implentations of the same thing, but i'd rather not rip apart my already-too-damn-complicated-arg-i-can't-believe-i-wrote-that-shit lighting code if there's going to be no benefit

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't have any information on the systemcall atan2 but why don't you write your own speed performance analyzer. Just an increasing timer counter with the highest resolution possible/suitable will do! That way you can always check the difference in speed between different implementations, it's really handy. If you write a separate test-bed when checking performance you better make sure the compiler doesn't do any unexpected optimizations. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
