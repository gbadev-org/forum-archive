<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the NDS Homebrew, so I am sorry if I am asking the obvious. 
<br/>
<br/>
1) Where can I find code for games which I can them run on emulators or use the passme to load them? 
<br/>
<br/>
2) I want to be able to 'produce' the code myself from a cartridge I have bought and run it on an emulator, how do I do that? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, 
<br/>

1. Look around the forums a bit.

2. You don't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You don't easily.  Your choices are:
<br/>
A) Disassemble.  This is hard, and B is simpler.
<br/>
B) Reverse engineer.  You write a spec that produces the same feature and program that yourself.  (Or hire someone to do it for you.)
<br/>
There are, of course, sillier approaches that probably don't need to be mentioned. =)

I understand that the game sits on a flash card, why cant I just read it with some kind of reader?
<br/>
<br/>
a few things I dont understand: 
<br/>
1) Why do I need to Disassemble it ? cant I run the assembly on the emulator?
<br/>
2) what do you mean by Reverse engineer? to the HW? to the SW? 
<br/>
can you elaborate please?
<br/>
3) what siller ways? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1) Write it or download Hombrew that comes with it Source Code
<br/>
<br/>
2)Do you want the Rom or the source? Anyway,as it's done with commercial games it's probably illegal</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
