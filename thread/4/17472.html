    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So how does one make a game engine? I've built a level editor and a sprite drawer(Both of which I continually update), but I have no idea on how to make a game engine.
<br/>
<br/>
Where does one start if one were to start making a game engine for gba/ds and maybe soon after release a 3ds?<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I see. But then, I don't even know what a game engine looks like. 
<br/>
<br/>
I thought before that a game engine is some sort of GUI where in you can put stuff here and there and then run the game(Essentially a level builder where you can run the game immediately after building your level so you can test it).
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I asked cause I've not seen a game engine for the GBA or DS around here and thought maybe I could build one. Anyway thanks for the advice! I should probably concentrate more on my tools in the meantime.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It could also have NO GUI. Actually the 'engine' is the set of functions that -given the proper input (graphics, configuration, scripts[!])- make the expected behavior happen. But it could be started as a very small set of basic functions and then expanded as you need it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would just do what headspin suggested.  Design your game, and make it work.  But the whole time you are designing, be thinking:
<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to make another similar game with different graphics, maps, scripts, characters, etc, what choices do I need to make now to ensure that that will be as easy as possible with this same code?
<br/>
<br/>
When you finish, you will (hopefully, if you designed well enough), have a clear line between your game engine and the game-specific assets/scripts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see. So a game engine can be a library of more advanced functions other than the basic library. 
<br/>
<br/>
Like say, how one would implement the display of the background or how one would implement some of the graphical effects, game events, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, although often it can be more like a framework than just a library, in that in a library, your app has full control, and just calls the library.  
<br/>
<br/>
In a framework, the framework often handles the "main loop" and calls out to your code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I see. No more manually creating a while loop and just hope that the stuff you make the device do can be handled by the device. That makes things easier for development alright, but that does sound a little complicated to develop<br/>_________________<br/>help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
