When making a platform-game such as Mario Advance, i think they?ve got three types of backgrounds. one for the "walking tiles", like the ground and stuff..
<br/>
one for a background behind this tiles with trees and stuff... and finally one background behind this like a sky or something..
<br/>
do I have to built this "last" background by tiles?.. mabye I want a big picture behind everything..do I have to build this with tiles?(might be a lil bit hard to have a single tile for every lil 8x8 part of the background)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, if you want multiple backgrounds they all have to be tiles, but you don't have to draw each 8x8 tile, just make a screen the size you want in a graphics package and use one of the converter tools (from gbadev main site) to convert those to tiles.  At least one of those tools will remove repeated and flippable tiles for you to keep the number down.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also not really necessary to use different backgrounds for each of the 3 things you mentioned unless they scroll at different speeds (maybe if each part is very complex and you want more tiles available you would use different backgrounds and therefore could use different tilesets).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
