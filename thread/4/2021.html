    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA documentation says that only bg2 is active in mode4, but I've read somewhere that you can use another one.
<br/>
I just want to make a console like that will always be over the BG2, as the console will only be 240*40 pixels. Can I do that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Off the top of my head, the 2 ways of doing what you want are:
<br/>
<br/>
-  Build the console out of a bunch of sprites, or a couple of big ones that you draw into when you want to make changes.
<br/>
<br/>
-  Use direct framebuffer access to draw the console, or at least the parts of it that need to be redrawn, at the end of every frame.
<br/>
<br/>
The first method is faster, especially when the area under the console changes a lot (such as when the console is transparent), but it takes up sprite RAM and OAM entries.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I don't know anything about sprites, could you just tell me what must I do to make this works or point me to a doc. Will there be enough sprites for 240*40 pixels?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have 16 KB of sprite cel VRAM to work with in bitmap mode. Provided you are not doing anything else with sprite cel VRAM, and you're doing your console in 16 colors, you have enough room for a full-screen-width, 128-pixel-tall console.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The problem with VRAM is that I've put code at the end of frame buffer 1. I'm gonna have to change all this...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
