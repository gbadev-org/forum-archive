<br/>
if itis so i had some cool ideas to use it^^
<br/>
for example you could write a prog such as win2ds and use your ds like an 
<br/>
joypad in an psuedo wii-remote style.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not entirely sure on this, but I think Nintendo is releasing a media player of sorts that will allow you to use a "memory card" that plugs into the GBA slot. If this is the case, it seems you would indeed be able to access the sensor. However, isn't the Wii going to have sensors you have to mount on your TV or something to that effect? If so, you'd have to communicate with them somehow to make the remote work. This may not be valid of course, it's just a rumor I heard.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

It's already out in Japan, it runs entirely in GBA mode, and it's called Play-Yan.

Perhaps some control functions will need the TV-top sensor and others won't.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
