    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made a very simple "multiple"-choice text adventure to teach myself DragonBASIC. I actually made history with my first game by being the first IF adventure for GBA (I think... if not, it's certainly the first IF for the GBA about making toast). 
<br/>
<br/>
Since I don't currently own a flash cart, I'd like to enlist the aid of someone who does to play it on the actual GBA to make sure it works as well on the actual hardware. 
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://projectenthalpy.com/TOAST.gba" target="_blank">The game can be downloaded here.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Note that the bizarre noise after one beats the game is intentional. Technically it is a glitch, but I know how to fix it. I just left it in because I think it sounds funny.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The game is hillarious actually, but can get tedious for short-tempered people after some point. The "B - give up button" sits always there, do some more ways of ending the story and add some small illustrations and it will be sweet :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This game was really just meant to be a test, so it's not incredibly elaborate and I'm probably not going to change it except to fix glitches. I am currently working on another game in DragonBASIC in the style of <span style="font-style: italic">Adventure</span> for the Atari 2600.
<br/>
<br/>
My main concern at the moment is whether the game will work on an actual GBA. In particular I'm not sure if the sounds will work, as they seem to be kind of higher-quality than one typically hears on the console. They're 8-bit mono files, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The good news:  you didn't forget the TURNSOUNDON command like several of the tutorial examples do (if you forget this, it still works on emulators but not on hardware).
<br/>
The bad news:  it doesn't boot on my Supercard correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, fix the header using something like GBATA or GBAfix.  Currently, it has a corrupt header and won't boot unless I manually start the Supercard in GBA mode before loading the file.
<br/>
<br/>
Something in the loading animation causes severe screwups on my Supercard.  See <a class="postlink" href="http://dannysied.googlepages.com/toast.avi.MPG" target="_blank">this video</a> to see what I mean.  I know the FADEIN and FADEOUT commands are known to cause issues with the Supercard, but I'm not sure if that's the specific issue here.  Note that the "TOASTpatched.gba" file was patched with the Supercard patcher, which obviously didn't make any difference.
<br/>
<br/>
I fired up my old Flash2Advance Ultra cart, put the (header-fixed) file on there, and ran it.  It worked perfectly, and the sound effects and music came through fine.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  rather than having the user restart the entire system to try again, perhaps you could allow either the Start or Select button to be used as a reset button or something.  The RESET command is all you need.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
