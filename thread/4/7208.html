    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been coding for a short time and asked for help on the forums, well lets just say a bunch so i don't have to count. I noticed that a lot of people responded to my requests by telling me to use commands I'd never heard of. Is there some standard set of header files I should have to get serious about GBA programming? I've made it through only one tutorial, and from what I hear it wasn't the best in the bunch, so I feel I was shortchanged on this issue.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
