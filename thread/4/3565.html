If I had an array, and I were to do a DMA where the source points to the first element of the array, and the destination points to the second element of that same array, would that repeatedly copy what was in the first element of the array (if DMA did stream copying), or would it actually, in a sense, move the grouped information of the array over by one element?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unless the GBA's DMA does copying in some weird way I'm not familiar with, then it would be like this:

<br/>
As long as dest is always source+1, then if you start at the beginning and keep incrementing both, then the memory would be filled with the first value.  If you started at the end of the block of memory and kept decrementing both, then the the whole data would just get shifted over.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just doing an insertion into an array of numbers, so I guess if I were to do a reverse DMA opertion, it would work, right?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
