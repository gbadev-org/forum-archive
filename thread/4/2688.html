    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am working on some GBA menu thingy which involves sprites. without a BG, these sprites show up fine. but when I fill my BG2 with a nice background. I only get to see the background. my sprites are in mem though. So my guess is these sprites are hidden BEHIND the BG2. I already set the priority of the sprites to 0 (highest priority AFAIK) but it still doesn't work. Is any familar with this kind of problem? plz help me out! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If this BG2 is in mode 3, 4, or 5, you will need to load the sprite cels into the upper 16 KB of sprite cel VRAM and use tile numbers from 512 to 1023. Have you looked at OAM Viewer?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I already did that. else my sprites wouldn't show up in mode 3 (even without a BG)
