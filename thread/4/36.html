So what exactly is HAM or ASM? I've heard people talk about them several times, but still don't know what they're advantages are when coding.  Could anyone help me here?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
They are two completely different things. HAM is a development library created to aid GBA developers write programs faster. While being a library, it is not also a compiler. Instead, HAM uses the devkitadv compiler to build projects. Assembly language, which is commonly referred to as ASM for short, consists of all of the different CPU instructions that a processor can run. Programming a system in assembly is the lowest level you can get above writing actual binary code. All other programming languages are higher level than assembly. Because of it being so close to the CPU, assembly tends to not to be portable to other systems (unlike C code) most of the time.

Indeed it is.  I converted k14.bdf into a format the gba can use and made a Japanese text demo a while back.  I wrote a message that amounted to "Have a safe trip back to Japan" and showed it to my language exchange partner.  I uses shift-jis codes, although I hand coded the message one letter at a time using their hex values.

<br/>
<br/>
Thats not really true. the HAM compiler is not the same as the devkitadvance compiler. They are both GCC, but HAM is built differently. It has been reported to me that the HAM builds work with more C++ features than the version in devkitadvance. Also, using the HAM compiler builder edition, you can easily upgrade the compiler yourself.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Speaking of Japanese text display subsystems, I'm definitely interested in finding a good library of JIS or S-JIS text for use in the GBA. I am half-Japanese so I speak it fluently and am interested in making both english and Japanese versions of a large project I am planning. So far, I found a character set made by an individual who uses the online nickname of "tonosama" but the letters are in a format that is a little unweildy. If anyone can point me to a library of Japanese font pixel data with codes for each of these characters I would be eternally grateful.

I've read about some E-book reader (found it on <a href="http://www.devrs.com/gba" target="_blank">www.devrs.com/gba</a> if remembering correctly) wich featured an asian language. Not sure if it were japanese though, might have been korean. Check it out.<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
