    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They don't take demos in this competition.  But if you're a demo coder at heart, you can still enter this competition:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Write a simple rhythm game or puzzle game that uses only a few sprites.
<br/>
2. Write a demo that runs in the game's background.  Make sure you have some good music.
<br/>
3. Put the game on top of the demo.
<br/>
<br/>
I got this idea when I realized that the backgrounds for Dance Dance Revolution look sort of like a demo.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
