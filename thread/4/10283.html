    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to build a project (namely PocketNES) with the origin address in ROM.  Except the compiler (arm sdt) is giving an extremely unhelpful error:
<br/>
<br/>
Error:        armlink... Relocated value too big for instruction sequence.
<br/>
<br/>
And it's not pointing out where the error is at all.  Previously, it gave errors which included the object filename, and hex offset, so you could find the instructions in the .lst file, but this time, it's not doing that.  I already fixed all the jumps for which it gave .o filenames and offsets.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea of how I would go about finding the error?
<br/>
Or should I just switch the code over to GCC?<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
