    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to tinker with some compression algorithm to be used in my GBA program and needs some help. Most of the implementations I've read were based on C language. So, I planned to use C as well. But I'm not very well versed yet of the terms in this new world (compression).
<br/>
<br/>
I've google'd for this stuff and already found some info. But, I want to ensure that my interpretation is right. 
<br/>
To my understanding,  the <span style="font-weight: bold">threshold</span> word used by LZH or other dictionary compression algorithm explanation/specification means the minimum number of <span style="font-weight: bold">match-length</span> in bytes, i.e. the minimum number of  bytes that match within the <span style="font-weight: bold">dictionary</span> and the bytes in the current <span style="font-weight: bold">look-ahead buffer</span> that have to be "surpassed" to carry-out the "encoding". So, if the <span style="font-weight: bold">match-length</span> is less than the <span style="font-weight: bold">threshold</span>, the <span style="font-weight: bold">phrase</span> in the <span style="font-weight: bold">look-ahead buffer</span> won't be encoded, but will stay as <span style="font-weight: bold">literal</span> in the compression result. Is this correct? 
<br/>
<br/>
There must be some compression guru around here to help me ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This simply means, if the reference and the byte length take up more than the actual data, why bother?  Just write the data as-is.
<br/>
<br/>
Bold terms in your post:
<br/>
<ul><li> Threshold - minimum number of bytes that can be encoded to the dictionary </li><li>Match-length - the length of a phase matching to the dictionary </li><li>Dictionary - a list of phases that are used more than once </li><li>Look-ahead buffer - A buffer than holds threshold+ bytes after the current byte; holds a phase </li><li>Phase - a sequence of bytes </li><li>Literal - a phase from the origional file </li></ul>
<br/>
That should be it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
