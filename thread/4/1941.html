If you want real tme debugging, you should get the SDK kit from nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe this includes an extra cable and special GBA console that links to the JDEC port on the ARM processor in the GBA,. It gives you real time access to:
<br/>
All the registers included built in hardware ports (DMA.. etc)
<br/>
The state of ALL IO ports on the processor chip.
<br/>
Access to read and write to memory locations through the bus.
<br/>
instruction and address breakpoint support in hardware I believe you have a limit to 4 hardware breakpoints with the ARM processor debugging engine.  Essentially it stops the processor and allows you to examine the state of things.
<br/>
<br/>
Now about debugging with Linux and VBA, you probably should find the insight debugger that uses the GDB interface in VBA.. I recomend READING THE INSTRUCTIONS given by forgotten on how to do this.  Insight will give you a nice IDE like interface set breakpoints allow memory inspections etc.  Using GDB directly under VBA does the same, probably you aren't use to it's CLI spec. Essentially you can inspect anyplace in memory put in memory watches etc. however it's a lot of work, hence using Insight might be a tad easier.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to grab insight try <a class="postlink" href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/gdb/releases/insight-5.3.tar.bz2" target="_blank">downloading Insight (BZ2 17.4M)</a> or <a class="postlink" href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/gdb/releases/insight-5.3.tar.gz" target="_blank">Insight (GZIP 22.5M)</a> it is a hefty download though. Curious what features it has try this <a class="postlink" href="https://www.redhat.com/software/gnupro/technical/gnupro_gdb.html" target="_blank">Web Page</a>.
