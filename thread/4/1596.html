    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First I made a nice tileset of about 32 tiles..and then I placed them into a background..it worked fine.. but then I tried to make a tileset of a 240x160 image... (like if I wanna display a image or something)..and when I tried this the whole screen turned orange.. 240x160 is 38400 bytes of data and the VRAM is about 64000 so I guess it doesnt take to much space?..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of All, I know its not a good idea to switch modes in a single program but I usually start with mode3 for my titlescreen/logos and the main menu screen.  I then switch to a tile mode for the game.  I know this probably isn't the best and most efficient way but what I do know is this works and is <span style="font-weight: bold">much</span> simpler.  Instead of making 600 tiles all u need to do is create a .bmp or some other 240x160 image and use a converter for it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why is switching modes a bad idea? And what do you mean by 'when used poorly'? What's wrong with switching modes when the things you're doing are best done in different modes? Like a tilescreen sidescroller and a bitmap intro pic. Is there any <span style="font-weight: bold">technical</span> reason why switching modes in one game is a bad idea?<br/>_________________<br/>Guns for show, knives for a pro</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's nothing wrong with changing display mode. I seriously doubt the hardware takes damage by changing mode so what could possibly be so bad.

I suggest instead of making multiple posts you edit your last reply if you need to clarify something ;) It's just kind of spammy otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
What's the color resolution? which background are you using? what display mode are you in? (IE 0, 1, 2) 
<br/>
how are you loading your tiles sets?
<br/>
are you setting the tileset begining?
<br/>
have you set the location where the background data begins?
<br/>
<br/>
There innumerable possible variations. When all else fails BE specific :)
