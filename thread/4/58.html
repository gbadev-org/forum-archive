I have not do much with SRAM, but from what I understand it has some restrictions.  Let's look at Martin Korth's GBA tech docs again:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm#backupsram" target="_blank">http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm#backupsram</a>
<br/>
<br/>
"Reading from SRAM should be performed by code exectued in WRAM only (but not by code executed in ROM). There is no such restriction for writing."
<br/>
<br/>
That means that you will have to copy your SRAM data reader to WRAM and run it from there.  I'm sure you know that reads and writes involving SRAM must 8 bits.

<br/>
<br/>
I've never heard about this restriction before, and I have successfully written and read  to\from SRAM from ROM before.

<br/>
This zip from staringmonkey might be of use, if anyone's interested, seems to be code for saving and reading from SRAM.

NVRAM (battery backed SRAM) savegame is simply a matter of reading/writing to the SRAM memory area, it's really that simple.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
