    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've have some sprites, which i am rotating, but they seem

<br/>
<br/>
So if it's a square sprite from 16x16, like mine, the rotating center
<br/>
is: 8,8, which is the middle/center point.
<br/>
<br/>
Now my question, is there a way to change this center point?
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from withdrawing my sprite in greater sprite dimensions
<br/>
and adjusting the centerpoint by a lot of transparent pixels.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To rotate a sprite around a point other than its center, move the sprite a few pixels as you rotate it.  Likewise, to rotate a background around a point other than its upper-left corner, scroll the background (by changing the layer's x_origin and y_origin) as you rotate it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
