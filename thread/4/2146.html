I figured out how to do an simple perspective projection + world matrix transformations, the matrix calculations itself are pretty easy to figure out for me, because I did 3D programming for PC before. Now I need to know how I could implement an view matrix because I couldn't find out where the view matrix gets involved into the process... Some informations about it would be cool...
<br/>
<br/>
Another Q: Do I have to calculate the distance to the camera using the sqr of the dot product of my cam vector and my object vector or is there a less computing intensive way which I could implement within the rendering process (for culling out objects which are too far away for example...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
