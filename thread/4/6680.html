It would be soo nice to be able to program my GBA games while riding the bus or sitting in a park!   *Sigh* :)

Just pop out the compact flash from the PPC and pop it into the GBAMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Last time I checked, the version of Windows that runs on Pocket PC devices (was "Windows CE" then "Windows Mobile" now what's it called?) did not support pipes, standard input, standard output, or a command prompt. Has GCC been ported to environments that do not support even the most basic UNIX features that Microsoft added to DOS 2.0?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
