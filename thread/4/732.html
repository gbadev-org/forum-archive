    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering which is the minimum chunk size for which using DMA transfer makes sense. For example: is it worth using DMA to copy 2 or 4 words of data?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it would be faster to do that normally. Since you have to write the src/dest adresses, the count and control reg, you've already written 2 words and 2 halfwords. I think it's about 32 bytes where DMA really starts to improve over normal copying. Also, there's a SWI for copying large chunks of data 32 bytes at a time (0xC), but I haven't done any speed tests on it myself. It might be even faster than DMA, since it's in 0 wait-state BIOS ROM, and copies 8 words at a time, but it would have to push/pop 8 regs onto the stack to do it, plus one to use for a loop counter, so I don't know exactly how big of a chunk you'd need to be worth all that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't see how any software copying routine could be faster than DMA. zero waitstate, yes, but that's still 1cycle per instruction. DMA use no instructions at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, probably so, but then why would they have put it there? I guess it would be the next best thing if you were doing something like DMA1/2 for sound, and DMA0/3 for different things on HBL, and needed a fast way to copy something without DMA. Not sure. I'l do some speed tests sometime and see how it goes. Probably won't get the chance tonight, but maybe tomorrow</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DMA may be faster for <span style="font-style: italic">copying</span> memory (memcpy()), but an unrolled loop of STMIA instructions may be faster for clearing large blocks of memory to a constant value (memset()). DMA must read and re-read the same 32-bit value from the stack (1 cycle) for each 32-bit store, whereas STMIA reads only one instruction (1 cycle) for every set of 8 32-bit stores.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
