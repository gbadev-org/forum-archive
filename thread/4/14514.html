    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just updated to 21 of devkitARM, and after recompiling my program, my 3D test models all ended up getting stretched out of proportion. Was something done to the perspective?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eh, forget it. I checked through some of the new examples that came along with the new devkitARM, and it seems the fovy (field of view) was changed to be double what it was previously. I doubled my own, and now it looks like it did before updating. Any reason for this?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The FOV was corrected to what it actually should have been in the first place. Previously it needed doubled to match the equivalent settting in openGL code.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
