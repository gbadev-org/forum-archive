Those are hexidecimal numbers.  They could represent any type of data.

0x39ef == 14831

0x07 == 7

<br/>
<br/>
as there is a new "Beginner" thread group here, you should post such questions there (It is the "less worse" place for that, as I think that such a question is not related to GBA).
<br/>
Then if you read tepples' FAQ (a must-have-read-once-at-least), you'll find some answers to your questions, or at least, ways to find an answer to them by yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
Part of this advice says "before starting coding for GBA, you should get a good knowledge of programming in general, and in C in particular" (It is not expressed "as is" in the FAQ, but I think it can be interpreted that way)
<br/>
<br/>
Don't take this as an offense, just keep in mind that (as I, and many other people here understand it) this forum is dedicated to GBA programming, and not to programming or basic knowledege of computers in general.<br/>_________________<br/>GBA,GC,NGPC,GP32,FPGA,DS stuff at <a class="postlink" href="http://torlus.com/" target="_blank">http://torlus.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Please take a good book and get at least more then half way accros with them before you really try to start coding for the GBA, I know those DOS excersizes arent any fun but you really do have to get through them to get a grasp of the programming language.
<br/>
<br/>
I myself have also started to learn to program through this site but from my experience you only can really work on something if you know enough of C. I couldt do shit at first either but once I got halfway accros with one C book Im doing fairly ok. Of course GBA dev specific elements are hard to learn as in you'll find out most first hand, but poeple here wont find those as bothersome as these questions wich really make clear that you are not trying to learn.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've learning C++ but unluckily for me and you i never found in the books these forms (0x07...). I've always wanted understand it, but now i must use it really for developing for AGB that became need!
<br/>
I think it is a thing concern really much with developing of AGB, so i ask it here, in others programs i did for windows i've never used that form!
<br/>
However thanks much sgeos!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I know what Link needs it's not further C/C++. If think it's general Computing knolege of how things like hex and binary work. For that you will need a computing book that gives detail/examples and experienced knolege of what this is.
<br/>
<br/>
The computing book I learnt from is Heathcoats Computing. It is not the best book but it will get you there. It also includes information on declarative languages such as prolog. 
<br/>
<br/>
And link try to get some experience before asking basic questions. Then you might not need to ask them at all.<br/>_________________<br/>Rolling a six is unlikely but how do you know if you have never picked up the dice.

Collecting information, so take your favourite search engine and
<br/>
go find some docs on hex- &amp; bin values.

And other basic computer stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You have to understand that your initial question as nothing related to GBA. Expressions such as 0x... or whatever are something related to general knowledge about computers.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't feel ashamed to post such things in the "Beginner" thread group. But as said before, answers to such a question could be found on the net.
<br/>
Didn't you notice that almost every one of your posts here are "flamed" (this one included) ?
<br/>
<br/>
I think GBA programming could be "easy" for someone already having a good knowledge of low-level computer programming. Making "point-and-click" c++ with ms tools could not be considered as a programming experience (imho). If that's your only programming experience, i think you should have a look at tools such as DragonBasic, which seems to be a very good way to make your ideas become something concrete.<br/>_________________<br/>GBA,GC,NGPC,GP32,FPGA,DS stuff at <a class="postlink" href="http://torlus.com/" target="_blank">http://torlus.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
