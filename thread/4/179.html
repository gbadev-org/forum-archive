The 1st ever thing I got running on gba 2 days after deciding to learn the system was a demo of Paradroid (old c64 game).  That used to slow down.  Basically because I didn't understand the gba fully (it'd only been 2 days since I even saw any docs or anything) I was doing things all the wrong way.  Took me another day of REALLY reading the docs instead of scanning through to work out that it was a whole lot easier than I had made it (too used to other consoles/computers) and it than only took about 1/16 of a frame to do everything it was doing in 1+ frames b4.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have a slow computer an emulator might not emulate it fast enough, I have a 33mhz pc and it isnt fast enough for the emulator, some fames even arent 100% with 9 frames skipped.<br/>_________________<br/>?There are no stupid questions but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
