    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Taking the risk of being flamed, I just wondered. I just stumbled on a pdf document found on a website I won't name, called AGB Programming Manual version 1.1 dating from April 2 2001. It looks like an official Nintendo manual, and I was wondering if it was something that got leeked recently or does everyone have this by now? It gives all the hardware details of the GBA and probably all that is in this document is already part of GBATek or Cowbite. Anyways, does anybody know something about this document?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But GBATEK and Cowbite is just a lot better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree the documents you mentioned are good LordGraga, but I think the official documents were much more comprehensive.<br/>_________________<br/>"Oh yeah, so what kind of warrior are you?  A code warrior? HAHAHA!"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Like mentioned before, it's real.
<br/>
Version 1.0 and 1.22 are floating around on the web as well, so there's no reason why 1.1 wouldn't have been leaked as well.

I agree with sketcher btw :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I must admit that I never really read any of those documents, only had a quick look through. They are very similar to the free documens that are avaible for us, but I just feel that Cowbite/GBATEK does a better job with the layout and some a few descriptions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
