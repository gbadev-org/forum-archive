it works great with Boycott Advance, but in VBA it will only sleep for one seconds, no matter how many seconds I tell it to wait..is there any setting in VBA I got to do or a bug or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I gave up and used vblank as the "wait" timing. It's the best method for a couple of reasons: it works as predicted on hardware and all emulators and it saves batteries by not spin waiting - an empty "while {}" is the equivalent of having the accelerator pressed with the hand brake on!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have to turn off the timer before you can write anything to it's "counter" register, if you even _can_ write to it's counter-register, I don't remember. Besides, if you are waiting for seconds, or even 1/60 of a second you are probably better of counting vblanks and use the timer for something else.<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before all that, check if you're missing some "volatile" declarations on the REG_TIMER stuff. If you don't do that, no matter what you put in the address, the machine will never check it. Dovoto's #include files didn't have them, and I had a few headaches because of that.
