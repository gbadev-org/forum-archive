    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I am using Kalied to convert a bmp to a mode 4 bin and pal.bin.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to transfer the palette into an array 256 big but it does not seem to be as obvious as my_array[i] = image_pal_bin[i].
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any form of mask that needs to be &amp;?
<br/>
Is there 128 entries that need to be split to 256?
<br/>
Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If not, are you saving as binary files, and if so why not output as C source if your using C.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I think Kaleid only outputs the number of colours that are used in the bitmap, so the pal array may not be 256 long.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it should still work though. Maybe your reading a 32-bit number, while the palette values should be 16-bit?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes I am saving as a bin file, this is for a NDS game and the header file points to a palette, a beginning and an end but when I address the palette into an array to allow me to fade from one screen to another, the palette is not complete... I have still not sorted this problem...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
