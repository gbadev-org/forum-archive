    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! I'm new here at gbadev and I am from Sweden. I have a question.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to make such a collision map, or something else that makes the character stop when he collides with a solid objects. Anyone who knowes that?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">that is a very hard question to answer as it depends a lot on how you are internally storing objects. there are a lot of options, bsp trees, bounding boxes, directly intersecting the geometry - just to list a few. you may want to search google for collision detection.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are doing basic 2d tiled sprite games, the easiest is usually to have a bounding box for your character and other sprites, and test bounding box collisions (for object-object collisions) and for object-map collisions, have a map that tells whether each tile (or meta-tile) is a collision or not (or what type of collision) and then check the character's bounding box against the looked up collision value for tiles that intersect the bounding box.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
