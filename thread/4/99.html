    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone found, or does anyone have any good information on programming a multi game menu for a flash cartridge?  Since visoly.com now reroutes me to the now basicly defunked lik-sang, it has been difficult for me to find any information at all on the way that vipack.gba (the included multi game rom with flash linker xtreme) is written.  There is an sdk included with my installation cd, but it does not include source for the vipack rom.  Anyone?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the pogo source is good, but maybe a little too much work.  im not looking to write my own menu, just to hack at one.  like the one that visoly provides.  there isnt much going on with it, i just want to be able to font hack the rom, maybe put a background for now.  minimal work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
