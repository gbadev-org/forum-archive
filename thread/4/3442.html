    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone!
<br/>
I have finished writing a 3D engine for the GBA, and I am thinking
<br/>
to expand it's features by making a BSP file renderer (BSP is the file
<br/>
format used by quake 1, and it contains the level data).
<br/>
The file format is in binary mode, and I need somehow to make a
<br/>
function, that will read the BSP file and process it.
<br/>
How the hell do I do that. The GBA isn't exactly reading extenal files,
<br/>
so there must be a way to compile the BSP file into the project
<br/>
and then process it as if it was a file....
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who made a GBA project. that consisted of reading any file
<br/>
data (i.e - Doom levels etc..).
<br/>
Another thing - Please don't tell me to convert the file into some kind
<br/>
of processed data (like raw files), since the BSP file contains much
<br/>
complicated data structures - Binary Trees, linked lists.
<br/>
<br/>
any help is welcomed!
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Tomer!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
