    <h4>#81045 - Schultz - Wed Apr 26, 2006 9:56 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently have I developed a method to make really nice images for the Game Boy Advance in <span style="font-weight: bold"> ANY </span> resolutions consuming <span style="font-weight: bold"> NO EXTRA MEMORY </span> on game pak.
<br/>
    To that method I shall input the name "Images of Schultz".
<br/>
    For instance, a 256x256 image created with this method shall consume the very same amount of memory that a 1024x1024 or even a n x m image consumes: <span style="font-weight: bold"> LESS THAN A 8x8 16 COLOUR TILE. </span> (approximately 4 to 64 <span style="font-weight: bold"> bytes </span> ).
<br/>
    I would send one of those images as well as the complex algorithm. Nevertheless, one image of those formatted as a bitmap would consume decades of my internet effort and I do not really know how to post programs in this forum.
<br/>
    I shall, then, ask how should I post programs in the forum.
<br/>
<br/>
    There is a negative side, nevertheless. To generate an image of those, the CPU must work for quite a time, but not much actually, perhaps 2 frames or less. (Although I have not tested it yet on a GBA)
<br/>
<br/>
    It is getting late, and I must return home. In spite of that, I shall send the algorithm tomorrow perhaps.
<br/>
<br/>

Dude, farbrausch had a whole 64k to work with!  I've created games on highly memory-constrained platforms, and kept the size below 25k.  Imagine what SMB1 would have been like if Nintendo had decided to keep the engine and expand its size to 64k...

<br/>
    I had an idea, may any of you send me your e-mail address so I shall send the pictures and a readme with its size in the GBA? Do not worry, I shall not send viruses.
<br/>
    The matter is that more than 200000 pictures in 16 bit colour mode could be held in a cartridge.
<br/>
    To make the method more clear, it is a precalculation of the colours indeed. It is not vectorial, as someone suggested, but it is really, really nice. I mean, not every picture may be compressed, but there are specific ones which, although highly complex, can be described in a simple and beautiful mathematical manner.
<br/>
    The effects are worth seeing. The source code I might send, but I have not yet implemented it for the GBA since for the next months I shall be very busy indeed.
<br/>
     In short, send me your electronic address and I shall send the pictures. It is really woth seeing.

You know that there is a proven maximum rate on lossless compression algorithms?
<br/>
<br/>
if you take the best random permutation of a 256x256 image with 16bit color, where each color appears exactly once, there is no chance of reducing the the bits/symbol.
<br/>
<br/>
I mean i'd really like to see such algorithm, but i don't see a chance. 
<br/>
I highly doubt that the en&amp;decoded image at these compression rates (3MB [1024*1024*RGB]=&gt;64Bytes) has much in common with the original image. The loss is much too massive.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If random, yes.  If pseudo-random, then you could compact it to a few seeds and other RNG variables... 16 bytes?  Then again, what are chances? =)

my judgement is that there is a generally unfriendly vibe in the forums due to some folks that think they are all that and like to bash newcomers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because I had nothing better to do, though, I skimmed the last month worth of posts in the Beginner's section.  I was hoping to find no more than a couple mildly condescending posts.

The number I found was zero.  Are you sure it's not just this one person that is getting a negative reaction (and for good reason, I think)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. I must agree with Dwedit and I think it is perfectly reasonable for us to believe that this is a scam, as no evidence of its true existence exists. Though it may exist, without any proof it is as good as non-existant. Also, we have no reason to believe that a compression this powerful can exist, and this basically decides that this is a scam.
<br/>

2. I don't think we need to be mean to the guy, but let him know that we want something that does something and that a lot of great and awesome words, are basically just a lot of wasted words if they have no support.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a bomb technitian.
