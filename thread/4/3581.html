    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was messing around with my game engine for a little bit when I came across this revelation. All my sprite data updates are done in the vblank anyways, so I really don't need a copy of the OAM, I can just edit the real thing. Now, I now it's locked during the vdraw and if you do edit the OAM during the vdraw you can get undesired effects. But if you code is quick enough you can get everything done during the vblank. I haven't had the chance to implement such a practice, but I thought I still post the idea to see what ya'll think. I'll give an example of what I mean in a bit, but let me hear your thoughts first.<br/>_________________<br/>How many boards could the Mongols hoard, if the Mongol Hored got bored</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
[code]#define sprites ((OAMEntry*) 0x07000000)[code]
<br/>

It would probably be better (?) with a pointer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
