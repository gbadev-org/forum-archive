    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe this is easy for some folks but it would be interesting to see a matrix showing a bunch of popular games and the different graphic modes used within them, showing which modes are used in which portions of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anything like this exist?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree, that would be very helpful. As a beginner myself, I'd have loved to see something like this included in the popular tutorials so you could really get a grasp for the different modes.
<br/>
<br/>
The only problem I can see is that some games don't really use the modes as intended, for example the mode 4 raycasting engines in DooM and Wolfenstein... well, they are as intended but not in the scope of the tutorial if you see what I mean... ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, this is my educated guess from the games I've seen and worked on:
<br/>
<br/>
Mode 0 : 80%
<br/>
Mode 1 : 10%
<br/>
Mode 2 : 1%
<br/>
Mode 3 : 1%
<br/>
Mode 4 : 5%
<br/>
Mode 5 : 3%
<br/>
<br/>
The Bitmap modes on the GBA just don't take advantage of the graphical hardware enough for use beyond static bitmaps (which mode 0 still does as well at) or 3D rendering (which usually go in either mode 4 for resolution or Mode 5 for speed.)  Mode 2 also isn't that useful except for very certain demo/special effects.

<br/>
Other opinions welcome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Since you seem to know so much, give us your estimates of the percentage of games that use 256 colors per tile compared to those that use 16 for more than 50% of the game.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Man, that sounds like a slam on me when I read that.  If it is, why?  If it isn't... :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I'd guess (and this is a guess) that 80-90% of the mode 0 games use 4-bit graphics as it preserves more of VRAM for other things.  We've yet to use an 8-bit scrolling background because it eats too much VRAM and leaves not enough for the other planes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
