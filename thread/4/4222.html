<br/>
<br/>
  I hope this is in the right section (it's a little hardware, but mostly coding)
<br/>
<br/>
  Something I've been thinking about doing for a while but never really got started with was using the gba as a sort of lcd screen for the pc (you've seen the ones you can mount in your pc right to give song name, cpu temperature etc. ?) with the advantage that it's got loads of buttons for controlling stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
  The idea would be that you boot your pc, connect the gba (I have a mbv2 cable) and a program on the pc sends software to the gba that basically sets up a multiplayer 'game' where the pc is the other 'player' and reacts to what you do on the gba, changing songs, playlists, volume etc without you needing that 1million watt crt monitor switched on on your pc. 
<br/>
<br/>
  I'm just getting into multiplayer stuff on the gba so I'll do that first (walk before I run), so (finally I get to it) has anyone attempted to write a pc-side application that talks to a gba?  I guess it's just writing to and monitoring the serial port, but that's an area of pc programming I've never gotten into (and what the messages sent through the port would look like, I have no idea).  
<br/>
<br/>
  I'd really like to not spend any money to get this done, so ideally it'd be mbv2 cable that's used, rather than any of the controller/serial packs/carts you can buy.
<br/>
<br/>
  Any advice or comments very much welcome.
<br/>
