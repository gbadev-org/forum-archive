<br/>
I have succeeded on doing alpha-blending for a single sprite using REG_BLDMOD and REG_COLEV. But, when I tried to use the same code, only changing the REG_BLDMOD mode flag to lighten and darken and using REG_COLEY to control the amount of fade, all the sprites were affected...
<br/>
Does anyone has a solution for this case? Source code will be cool :) .

Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try setting the sprite alpha flag (bit10 of attr0), and see if it does anything. I know with blending mode 0, it will only blend sprites with their alpha flag set, but I've never messed around with lighten and darken. 
<br/>
Or if that doesn't work, you could just make a solid black or solid white tile and use a layer to blend with the sprite you want to lighten/darken, unless you need all your layers for other things, then the only way would be to give the sprite a unique palette (unless you're using 256 color sprites, then you're out of luck) and blend the actual colors yourself (that's how I do fades, so I can use the HW alpha for shadows).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
