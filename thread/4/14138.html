No, it's not. The cheapest version is 15$, but that does not include source level debugging. To get that, you need the 1750$ version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, you'd be very wrong about that. no$gba is pretty close to a very expensive hardware debugger which allows you to freeze the entire system at any given point in it's execution. There's nothing else available that comes even close to how well no$gba performs.
<br/>
<br/>
A homebrew programmer will rarely have the need for the advanced features available in the commercial versions so don't feel I'm trying to convince you that you need one of the high end editions. I'm just pointing out that no$gba is good value for commercial developers.

I <span style="font-style: italic">really </span>doubt that. We're talking about gdb, not a mid-term project of CS undergrad.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From a developer who chose to use No$GBA over the hardware boat achors from Nintendo, I can attest to the power and accuracy that is no$gba.  The speed at which is allows me to load new builds, load and save snapshots into problematic code areas, the break-point system, the vram viewer, etc.  All are so far beyond what the hardware debugger can do it's not funny.  No$ is a bargain - we'd have paid x10 his price for what it does.  On the GBC, it made me 50x more productive than with the crap from N.  On GBA, about x5.  On DS, if he'd ever send us an invoice so we could buy the best version, I know it would be a large increase again - though the DS hardware debugger isn't too bad.
<br/>
<br/>
VBA is pretty good and has some nice features, but its best features are copied from no$.  I can't tell you how many bugs were found with just the exceptions dialog.  The writes to ROMs, or writes to mirror RAM when accidently playing with NULL ptrs is just awesome.  Our publishers are amazed at how stable our games are and a large part of the can be attributed to No$'s debugging ability.

Same problem here, I sent an email asking if he could re-send my key since my files got lost and so did the CD I burned them to.

I also sent in a bug report with that request, hopefully it got read.

I don't expect him to resend my key since it was my responsibility not to lose it (though I did try, that backup cd has to be somewhere) but it would be nice.

Is your program crashing inside NO$GBA, or is NO$GBA itself crashing? If NO$GBA crashes, this is a defect in NO$GBA, so follow these steps to isolate and report the defect: <ol type="1"><li>Upgrade your emulator. Older versions had problems with power management code. Make sure that the <span style="font-weight: bold">emulator's about box</span> shows the latest version. </li><li>Reduce your program to the smallest example that exhibits misbehavior. </li><li>E-mail the .nds file, along with a report of what it does in NO$GBA and on a DS, to Mr. Korth. (<span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT</span>: Peter is right. Use a link, not a MIME attachment.) </li></ol>
