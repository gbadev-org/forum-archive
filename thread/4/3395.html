    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you have to ask the question, then the answer is no.  It's much more complicated than simply writing some code and wiring the two together.  Typically, you would need some kind of USB chip that the PC would talk to, software on both ends, and some other stuff that I'm probably forgetting (besides the PC, GBA, and link cable you already mentioned).

Can it be done? sure.  Can it be shown in a sniplet of code on a forum? no<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though those who programmed for the GBA will have a significant head-start into the 2D side of the DS compared to the number of developers who haven't touched a Nintendo DevKit in a while.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Super Robot Taisen MX came in second on the<a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=3879" target="_blank">Japanese sales charts for the week ending June 6</a>.  It is a 2D game.  That leads me to believe that there is a profitable market for 2D games.  (Not sure what to make of Fist of the North Star Pachinko's being in first.)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what the North American or European markets are like.  I suspect that there is a market though.  In my experience, young children (4 years old or so) have an easier time dealing with 2D games, although my little cousins have figured out Star Fox (SNES) to some extent.  (Thats not to say that they are very good at any of the games they try.)

If the DS sells, I suspect that it will replace the GBA.  How many new GBC games have been released recently?  From what I know, GBC games can even run with enhaced color on the GBA!  (Shantae)

Funny to think that a high profitable 2D game (SRTMX) was released on the PS2, of all systems.  Then again "Asia" really is a different market.  SRTMX is a content game of the strategy genre packed with years of intellectual property.
<br/>
<br/>
Just in case anyone is interested (and because I am reading them), here are some <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dra-mata.com/manga/4koma/" target="_blank">Super Robot Wars Comics</a> (Taisen = War).  Most have been translated.  If you don't know the characters, these may not make much sense (assuming they make sense even then).

The reason GBC doesn't sell is because Nintendo basically gave up game creation for the device and so did other companies. But when DS is releasd this system isn't design for the excact same target so I predict that GBA will be around for a long time to come. ...
