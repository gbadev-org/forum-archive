<br/>
<br/>
I've implemented my own interrupt handling code instead of modifying the crt0.S script. That is my code writes the adress of the handler function into 0x3007FFC and the handler manages everything else.
<br/>
I'm not sure if this is as fast as using the linked default interrupt handler... could this become a performance issue ?
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,
