You can't communicate with a GBC/DMG from the GBA (unless you are in GBC mode, in which case the multiplayer speed select is unavailable), because the voltage is wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for all of the replies. I think I'll assume that for multiplayer game coms, 115200 bps is the right choice. I can't see dumbing the whole thing down because of crappy cables. To be honest though, my 3rd party cable (mad catz I think) stays connected much better than the official cable. The slave side of the N cable wiggles lose after picking up the unit 3 or 4 times.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know that any such crappy cables exist, but if a cable did exist with bad crosstalk between pins, it would work better (though perhaps still not well) at slower bitrates. You should be fine using the highest rate always.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

People keep saying that, but I don't really see why the difference in power sypply voltages would be a problem.
<br/>
The DMG is rather old.. Perhaps old enough to use TTL signaling instead of CMOS? 5V TTL signaling is perfectly compatible with 3.3V CMOS signaling.
<br/>
Even if the DMG does use 5V CMOS signaling, while not perfectly compatible, it can still work with 3.3V CMOS signals.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
