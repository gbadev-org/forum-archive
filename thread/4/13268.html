    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am realey angry with yeti3d right now. I canot get GBA version of yeti 3d to work with my levels when even when I rename it  e1m1.c  
<br/>
I can get working using the yeti3dgpl-SDL editor based on GP32 version,but when I use the texters that come with editor It woks greet. But when I use the BMP_Convert tool both the The converter of texture by AnataGP  and  the Onethirty8 YetistuffSDL  version I have the same problem. 
<br/>
My use texture filse in the editor most of my textures are messed up except ground texture and brick walls textures is there something I am doing wrong?
<br/>
