    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It pains me to ask this as it's something I know I should already know, but I don't have a very comprehensive background in hex. We briefly touched on it in my assembly course and that's about it (although I was rather good at doing hex arithmatic). Anyway, when setting the registers you OR various predefined values into them. I understand how this works. What I don't understand is how the hex values are defined.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, when setting REG_DISPCNT's various attributes, you define in gba.h several things.

<br/>
#define MODE_1 0x1 
<br/>
#define MODE_2 0x2 
<br/>
#define MODE_3 0x3 
<br/>
#define MODE_4 0x4 
<br/>
#define MODE_5 0x5 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, those look fine to me. I understand where the values come from. But a little later down the line in bits 4 and 5 we use 
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">

#define backbuffer  0x10
<br/>
#define H_BLANK_OAM  0x20
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand how the values 10 and 20 correlate to bits 4 and 5. Or later on we have values of

What's so handy about Hex is that it is easy to figure out the binary value by looking at it. Each digit is worth 4Bits. If it's still not clear, then you'll have to look into binary values.<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out. (Hoare's Law of Large Programs)

I presume you know binary..
<br/>
<br/>
take a value and put it into binary
<br/>
eg 150 = 10010110
<br/>
<br/>
divide that up to groups of 4 bits starting from the first bit
<br/>
1001 0110
<br/>
<br/>
the values for hex go as follows
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">0  0
<br/>
1  1
<br/>
2  2
<br/>
3  3
<br/>
4  4
<br/>
5  5
<br/>
6  6
<br/>
7  7
<br/>
8  8
<br/>
9  9
<br/>
10 A
<br/>
11 B
<br/>
12 C
<br/>
13 D
<br/>
14 E
<br/>
15 F</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
then translate the groups of 4 into hex values
<br/>
therefore: 
<br/>
1001 = 9
<br/>
0110 = 6
<br/>
<br/>
so 150 to hex would be 96 or in C/C++ 0x96
<br/>
<br/>
in reverse
<br/>
0x20 = 0010 0000
<br/>
which is 32<br/>_________________<br/>[<a class="postlink" href="http://parabellumgames.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Blog</a>] [<a class="postlink" href="http://yaustar.no-ip.org" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It easy... it's just counting.
<br/>
<br/>
1=1
<br/>
2=2
<br/>
3=3 ,etc
<br/>
9=9
<br/>
A=10
<br/>
B=11
<br/>
C=12
<br/>
D=13
<br/>
E=14
<br/>
F=15
<br/>
<br/>
The right column is your "ones" column and the left column is the 16's column (just like our familiar base-10 numbers)
<br/>
<br/>
So the hex number "12" is 2 ones and 1 sixteen (total of 18)
<br/>
<br/>
The hex number "09" is 9 ones and 0 sixteens (total of 9)
<br/>
<br/>
The hex number "1E" is 14 ones and 1 sixteen (total of 30)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that's simpler than converting to binary then back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was awsome man. Clear as a bell now. I could interchange base 10 and binary and base 10 and hex easy enough, but until that I never saw the correlation between hex and binary. That clicked right away. Thank you.

Hexadecimal notation really comes into its own when you are concerned with anything to do with binary, because it represents binary numbers in an easy-to-read but much more compact form.
<br/>
<br/>
A char (or byte) is two hexadecimal digits. A short (or half-word) is four digits. An int (or word) is eight digits.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to get at the 20th bit of a 32-bit variable, rather than trying to remember that 2^20 is 1,048,576 it's much easier and human-readable to use 0x00100000. And likewise, 2^20 - 1 (useful for masking with bitwise-AND) is 0x000FFFFF.
<br/>
<br/>
Other useful things to keep in mind: the numbers 1, 3 and 7 are the (first), (first and second), and (first and second and third) bits of a nibble turned on. (A nibble is four bits, or half a byte, or one hexadecimal digit.) So if I wanted to get just the bottom 6 bits of a variable, I would bitwise-AND it with 0x3F.

It's just a pity we humans (assuming it's safe to assume game developers are indeed human) weren't born with 8 fingers instead of 10. Then perhaps we would have devised a much more sensible counting system.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">When you find yourself in the company of a halfling and an ill-tempered Dragon, remember, you do not have to outrun the Dragon... </span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Note that given any arbitrary base, n, the number 10 base n equals n.  If you didn't know that already, you might want to take a second to figure out how and why that works.
