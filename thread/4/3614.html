    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What is the best way hook various game objects to either the keypad or various prerecorded (and other) input streams?  Hooking everything to one or the other is easy- just use a different key state update function.  (ie Do not read from KEYINPUT directly.)
<br/>
<br/>
Do I want to keep a list of input streams and point each object to a member of the list?  (Update each stream every frame.)
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a better way of doing this?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Page 223 of Design Patterns (chain of responsibility) gives a pretty good object oriented solution.  It's basically the same problem that OS GUI writers face when they send messages to various window objects.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just an idea for pre-recorded input for say a demo mode:
<br/>
<br/>
have a mode where the game plays as normal, only in this mode a variable is set to record input. you simply play through for however long, and while playing the input is recorded every 60th of a second. then to replay your inputs, reset the game and use the recorded input instead of the key input.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that sounds like the easiest way to do it. I was thinking it would soak up a lot of space to be storing the register value every frame, but simple RLE compression would cut it down to only a few bytes each time to actually press/release a key, so it wouldn't take much at all.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Yep that's how Andre Lamothe did it in "Tricks of the Game Programming Gurus".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
