    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just noticing that official GBA games contain code (located at address 080000E0) which installs an interrupt handler pointing to address 080000FC.  From there, there is a standardized interrupt handler.  Most games replace the default interrupt handler with their own, but some games actually use that ROM interrupt handler.
<br/>
<br/>
So what are the pros and cons to having an interrupt handler in the CRT?<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pros:
<br/>
  Easy, interrupt handlers can be a bit of a pain to write
<br/>
Cons:
<br/>
  You wont have full control over interrupts if you use a standard version (some games may want to change priorities/take special action for certain interrupts)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
