    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using dovoto's advanced scrolling demo (scrolling big maps the hard way as he calls it) and it's seems to work fine. But when I try to scroll two different maps on different layers at the same time, only one layer scrolls correctly. The other one doesn't scroll at all. Can the scrolling registers only handle one layer at a once? Or is there something I've missed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a quick thought for you to check up. Each layer has it's own scrolling register. Did you update the second scrolling register?<br/>_________________<br/>-Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out. (Hoare's Law of Large Programs)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I'm updating each corrisponding scroll register. Using the layers 1 and 2, I'm updating BG1HOR, BG1VER, BG2HOR and BG2VER. But I'm using one x and one y value on both layers.
<br/>
<br/>
I've setup both layers to handle a map of 256x256 and the maps that I use are bigger than that. The first layer updates the big map correctly and shows the entire map even if it's bigger than 256x256. But the second layer doesn't do that and just shows a map that is exactly 256x256 (which crops the actual bigger map). I hope that you understand what I'm trying to say. Kinda hard to explain.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like it could be a problem with your tile loader, since the map should automatically wrap around.
<br/>
<br/>
This is a longshot, but I don't suppose you're in Mode 1 by any chance? If you're in Mode 1, then BG2 is a rotation background instead of a text background, and won't automatically wrap around (you need to set a flag in the control register first). You should be using different registers entirely then, though, so I guess it's pretty unlikely.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I found out my problem. It was an static variable, that's why it only updated one layer. Should have known, a stupid mistake. But thanks for the help anyway. May the source be with you =P.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
