    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now when I change the background to a rotation background, the background isnt displayed properly.  My 512x512 bg gets cut up into chucks about 256x256 (1/4 pieces).  And that top corner chunk just keeps repeating.

<br/>
<br/>
Remember rot/scale backgrounds are byte per tile and therefore can only have 256 unique tiles. Also for the setting which would give you a 256x256 text background you only get 128x128 rot/scale.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One way to do it would be to replace the tiles with blank ones when they're about to wrap  OR use a couple of windows one for the desired side and another for the top or bottom (just need a maximum of 2  left or right  + top or bottom) just need to update a few registers then instead of changing tiles (and maybe having to replace them later).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
