    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I got Visual Studio to work with DevkitADV, but I really don't know where to go from here. I got the 3dsprite demo to compile and work in an emulator. I am not new to C++ in any way, but this is confusing me. I suppose my question is : how do I start programming!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Learn how to use the different modes, learn how to do sprites, maps, collisions and how to load/save, then go program something fun? Plenty of tutorials out there. :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Find a small, very very very simple demo by someone else and start changing it.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, pull bits out to structure it - it'll give you a handle on making some useful libraries.
<br/>
<br/>
And then think of a project and build it. It's the best way to learn.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, after having done set tutorials for the gba, like this one (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.thepernproject.com/index2.htm" target="_blank">http://www.thepernproject.com/index2.htm</a>),do a small project do get a better understanding. 
<br/>
<br/>
I did a card game. I saw someone do a calculator.
<br/>
<br/>
The important thing is to do somehting not too ambitious for your first try.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
