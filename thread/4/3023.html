    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am trying to code a frame counter.  the timer I am using is supposed to loop at 59.595ns (thus reaching 59595 and reseting to 0, or is this where i'm wrong?!)
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, when using visualboy advance, the counter goes as high as 64000+ thus making the frame counter a bit crap and inaccurate really.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this because vba doesn't emulate the timer well, or am I doing something drastic?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The timers just run until they get to 65535, and then set back to 0 when they overflow. If you want to loop 59595 times before overflow, set the timer data to 65536 - 59595 before you start it up and it will reset to that value instead of 0 when it overflows.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
