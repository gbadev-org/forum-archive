    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm newbie on GBA programming. I had tried to use HAM to make an simple progame that function likes a photo album. Then I converted a lot of photo in 240X160 pixels(bitmap, I use mode4), and use left-right key to select the photo. However, I found that if the number of photos is over 4 then can not use "Multiboot" (because over the WRAM size?). If I take out the "Mutliboot" then it can store up to 60 photos (may be more) in VBA. But if I download to Flash cart it can not work. The GBA will show nothing!! Would anyone tell me how to fix? I think I must do something to patch to rom or add some option when programming?
