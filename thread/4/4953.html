I haven't quite got my head around how the memory on this thing works.  I know there is a limited amount of sprite ram but the cart is so much larger.  I don't want to be wasting ram.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You should avoid using .h files for data purposes, as this is not their intended use and can be the source of many, many headaches even as a project is just beginning to grow out of its infancy. <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=2605" target="_blank">This thread</a> talks a bit about why this is the case.

The cart has room for many, many images. From there, you can copy them into Sprite VRAM as you need them, and only keep the ones in VRAM that you need to display at any given time.
