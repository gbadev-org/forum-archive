Microsoft released the source code for Windows CE 3.0. You can get it here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/ce.net/previous/downloads/source/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/embedded/ce.net/previous/downloads/source/default.asp</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The licence on that code explains that it is for use in debugging/developing Windows CE applications. You can't use it to make your own copy of CE, or to port to other systems. I suspect it won't build a full copy anyway; there are probably parts missing. Certainly, the boot loader and such wouldn't be needed. Previous source releases by Microsoft have rarely included all code neccecary to build the binaries in question, and certainly not a sane build environment for doing so; MS are only interested in you using the source for debug and app/driver development purposes.

I'm loathe to take a look at the code, since I am writing an operating system for the GBA already and don't want to end up licence-contaminated. =)
