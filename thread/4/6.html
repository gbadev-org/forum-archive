    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe in entering also.  Hopefully, I will produce a demonstration that surprasses anything else at the competition.  Of course, this is only a goal.  It would be something to be proud of if accomplished.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I might be one of the judges for that compo. I don't know if it is final, but I've been told that demos won't be accepted because they are difficult to judge fairly along with games.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While this news is a shame, my new goal would now have to be creating a game, instead of a demo.  I would have to agree with you, Costis, a demo would be much more difficult to judge if it was also being judged with games.  I hope you good judging in the future, as well as prosper.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
if cdworld is down, try gbaemu since they are hosting it together.
