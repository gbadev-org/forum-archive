    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't know a thing about DirectDraw... but if you are confident enough with low-level C (ie. working with pointers and pointer arithmetic, understanding the internal representations of datatypes on hardware, etc.) then you can probably learn GBA programming easily enough from one of the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbadev.org/docs.php?section=tutorials" target="_blank">tutorials</a> on the gbadev.org main site. (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.thepernproject.com" target="_blank">The Pern Project</a> is pretty popular for people starting out.)

<br/>
GBA programming can be very much like computer game programming, but it depends on the computer, the operating system, and the interface to that OS. The GBA has no operating system, so you might be in unfamiliar waters if you've only ever worked with event-driven OSes. But if you've ever had to program a game's event loop from scratch then you should feel right at home.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DirectX programming is fairly contrived and requires a great deal of memorization (or at least a rather large reference card) of a great deal of structures. GBA programming is quite a bit simplier in that regard, requiring usage of only a small number of fairly easy to use structures. It also has a lot of useful built-in hardware support for rotation, scrolling, etc. that must, generally, be implemented in software in DirectDraw.

I'd say that it's easier to program for the GBA than DirectDraw - on the other hand, one might say that it's far more difficult on the GBA to program it <span style="font-style: italic">well</span>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA is easier than DirectDraw because you know everything that happens to your system. No need to check fro an outside Windows message every frame or reserve some of the RAM so the computer doesn't crash.
<br/>
<br/>
One drawback is that the system doesn't improve (at this point, neither does DirectDraw). But there are so many neat little tricks you can do. 
<br/>
<br/>
Remember the first time you played Mario Kart (SNES or GBA version). Though it was 3D, right?? Those are the things you can pull of on this system, and its as simple as setting the right registers!<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I love Cocoa... it makes programming event-driven apps ridiculously straightforward once you've had a little practice at it. Interface Builder is SWEET.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus I had to learn Objective C to use it, which it turns out is the first object-oriented language I've come across that hasn't made me want to put my fist through the computer's monitor. (Except perhaps JavaScript, but that doesn't really count.)

You must be one heck of a coder. I rarely go through a solid day of programming <span style="font-style: italic">without</span> crashing my GBA.

On the other hand, I have written code to set up DirectDraw several times and have managed to screw something up every time.
