    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
just a few clarifications, 
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the kit is included on the books' CDROM . Yes, the kit covers simple HAMlib programming , in a single newbie chapter. The rest of the book covers devkitadvance style programming using HAM. 
<br/>
<br/>
There is this great misconception about HAM being incompatible to devkitadvance. In fact, I have yet to see a single DKA app not compiling in the HAM tool chain, and I know a load of people that use HAM without ever touching HAMlib. To them, HAM is, to my great pleasure, just a much easier to set-up compiler tool chain that comes with instantly working debugging facilities and all the tools they need.
<br/>
<br/>
The books author has chosen HAM not for HAMlib, but for the ease of setting up a standard GCC based compiler + toolchain. This is not a HAMlib tutorial book.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why would anyone write a book on it? not that it is a bad idea or anything because it would come in useful. Programming the gameboy advance is tehnically illegal without a developers license from Nintendo or is it only illegal when you distribute your games?<br/>_________________<br/>The GBA is one Lean and Mean machine!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
marcmccann: it's of course not illegal, you could do whatever you want with everything you own, you could also change the gba hardware or so, but you are not allowed to sell anything without Nintendos permission (For games I'm not even completely sure about that though, I think as long as you don't declare the ROM as "Nintendo (c)(R)(WHATEVER) GameBoy Advance game" you're still allowed to sell it because it's not a game, it's just some plastic :))</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Greetings from Amazon.com.

<br/>
We have contacted the publisher by phone concerning the status of your

order for "Programming the Nintendo Game Boy Advance: The Unofficial

<br/>
<br/>
The representative we spoke with indicated that this book has not been
<br/>
published and is not expected to be released until December 31, 2005. 
<br/>
Release dates tend to fluctuate, however, so there is a chance that
<br/>
this will change.  If we receive additional information about this, we

will let you know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<span style="font-style: italic">I can't believe it's November already! Well, I have some good and bad news. The bad: Programming the Nintendo Game Boy Advance will not be released. In case you haven't noticed, Amazon.com has removed it from the online listing. Nintendo was gracious about the issue, and I must admit that I don't blame them for wanting to keep the wraps on the GBA, even though I still maintain that this book would have been a good thing for the GBA community. The good news is that most, if not all, of the book's resources will be available right here on my site for free.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
