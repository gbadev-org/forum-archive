    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm an experienced C/C++ programmer, and I'm experienced in developing for handheld devices - PalmOS, Symbian, etc. And I've read a number of GBA tutorials, and even got as far as learning how to use the different GFX modes and make some basic little programs for my GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
But I've never done any games / gfx programming.  And that's what I want to do on my GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
So - I thought maybe I'd find a book or two on the subject.  So off to amazon.co.uk.  Not much out there, unless you're doing 3D DirectX Windoze :(
<br/>
<br/>
I did find 2 books. First up, Game Programming All in One (de Sousa).  I bought it for its chapterson 2D, maths, physics and AI.  Turns out it's all about 3D Windoze DirectX.  There's no 2D chapter. And the maths/physics chapters are examplesless and generally useless.
<br/>
<br/>
Next I found was Programming the Nintendo Gameboy Advance (Harbour et al.) Still not delivered... but same publishing company... not high hopes...
<br/>
<br/>
So... can someone on here suggest some good books on stuff like:
<br/>
<br/>
- 2D gfx stuff, like...
<br/>
    - rotating / scalling stuff
<br/>
    - fx like plasma
<br/>
- semi-3d gfx like...
<br/>
    - isometric 3D
<br/>
- basic 3D stuff
<br/>
    - so i can make demos like i saw on my old Amiga :)
<br/>
- basic game stuff
<br/>
    - game loop
<br/>
     - 2D collision detection
<br/>
    - seriously - i've never written a basic game loop...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any responses!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers
