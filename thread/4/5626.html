    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I would like to create a new GBA emulator for PalmOS and was wondering if there are any emulators that have source code release. Can anybody help me. I realize BTW that there is a GBA emulator for Palm, it just costs $20, and yes there is a GB emulator, but I want a scratch built GBA emulator.
<br/>
Anyone?
