    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been using DevKit<span style="font-weight: bold">Advance</span> ever since I started writing for the GBA, but recently I've moved onto DevKitArm. Apparantly it's faster and better and yada yada. However I've run into a few problems, and I was wondering if anybody else has come across this?
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, let's start with my most recent project. I've recompiled a game I had running in DevkitAdvance into DevKitArm. Of course the rom is fine with the DKAdv compile, but when I try to run the DKArm version I just get a blank white screen. Using VBA to have a look, it seems that nothing has happened (e.g. no registers set, no bitmaps loaded etc.). It has just crashed on startup.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so that's strange. But before this project, I was working on a quick test for a new frontend. I was happily slapping in bitmaps and sprites and making the rom size bigger, and everything was compiling with DevKit<span style="font-weight: bold">Arm</span> just fine. However, I seemed to get to a certain rom size (about 300k or so), and then I got the "blank screen of certain doom" rom (as above). Sure enough, removing some graphical data (making my rom smaller), meant that it compiled fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Both examples run fine when built with DKAdvance, but DKArm is giving me problems. Does anybody know what's causing this ruckus? I assume it's something to do with the rom size, but I might be wide of the mark.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated greatly....
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yea, you might be compiling as multiboot, like Graga said, or you might have run out of IWRAM. Some of the other people here would be able to help you with that better than I can though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Did you get the -specs= right? Are you putting things into EWRAM and IWRAM, and if so, how?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And, before we get on with this: DKArm is not supposed to be ccompletely like DKAdv. There are differences, and you cannot be sure that everything will migrate from DKAdv to DKArm smoothly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yep, you guys got it in one. I was compiling as multiboot. Doh! That'll teach me to swipe makefiles straight from tutorials!
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I've just saved an entire 4kb by recompiling with DKArm. Woohoo! The inner-nerd in me is going crazy! Thanks for your help guys!
