<br/>
<br/>
4 years ago or so i made a GBA emulator and debugger in java. I only
<br/>
recently found the code and opening up the source for those that are 
<br/>
interested. Have a look at <a href="http://www.flawedreasoning.com" target="_blank">www.flawedreasoning.com</a> under projects.

Not particularly, i put it together in 2 weeks or so and after that i lost interest. I'd prefer someone finishing THUMB support and running the original BIOS correctly rather than doing HLE though. That said, i know it's somewhat dodgy to provide the original bios rom, so i guess both are an option. I've included the source in the hope people will revamp it to a newer/better codebase and keep me in the loop. Maybe i'll get bored one day and continue with it...maybe ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Being that Java and C# are pretty close, and that 70% of the Java code base is math/logic operations which are directly compatible, it should be very doable. The only thing I ask is that if anyone does anything with the code to keep me up to date on your progress ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You can use J#, which should be compatible with most of, if not all of the code. So this way you can keep your interfaces, etc, in Java, and slowly integrate over to C#.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
