    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just getting started, I really don't have a computer to do any of this off of, but I have experience with computer graphix and some of the code that goes into it. Anyway, I'm looking for a quick list of all the shit I should download, buy, read before I venture further, and I have a few questions to be asked:
<br/>
<br/>
1)Mac or PC? I was thinking of getting a new G5 (purdy), or maybe a custom PC, which would be better?
<br/>
<br/>
That's it for the questions really. What are the best programs and tutorials? And where can I get hardware to tranfer games to the GBA cartrige?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all of your time,
<br/>

I develop for the GBA on a Mac, so it's doable, but there's little contest that the current tools that exist for GBA development are much better on PC.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, assuming you want a computer for more than just GBA development, you can always drop a couple hundred bucks on a perfectly functional, modern PC to run your GBA tools. I have a Windows laptop that I keep networked with my Mac for when I want to do debugging using VBA. I've even got SSH running between the two so I can edit and recompile everything on the Mac side (from a terminal running on the PC) and then run it in VBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, we have a Beginners forum with a FAQ. Please make use of them.

The reason the beginners forum and FAQ exist isn't to water down someone's learning capabilities by restricting them to a lower level of learning, but to reduce the redundancies in posts and to allow for proper thread management -- this being the reason forums are divided into separate catagories at all. Most people don't have a problem with helping people, but others may be annoyed if they have to sift through a forum with beginners threads (that could have been answered had the FAQ been even glossed over) that don't belong there.

Then you shouldn't be asking beginner questions.
<br/>
<br/>
There's no shame in being a beginner, but if you want people to be responsive to your queries then you should post them in the appropriate forum.
<br/>
<br/>
And as animension pointed out, please read the bloody FAQ.
<br/>

(Sorry if I was being repetitive just now, but I didn't feel animension's post adequately reflected my annoyance at people who want help but don't feel the inclination to respect basic group ettiquette.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off, you are missing the point entirely. Secondly, as Dan pointed out, there are certain rules of ettiquette that are expected of you, which you seem to have no compunction tossing to the winds.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you even read the FAQ here? If you have, what makes you think it's for the intelligence-impaired? Frankly, I think it's an insult to the FAQ writer to say so, as I can confidently presume that Tepples did NOT intend it to be for the intelligence-impaired but for the beginner -- the both of which are mutually exclusive concepts. If you haven't read the FAQ, then there's absolutely no ground for you to assess this particular FAQ as being for the intelligence-impaired.

Thanks for telling us how to run this forum after posting here 3 times. Interesting that you should mention manners while lacing your suggestion with the word "shit". I've no intent to argue with an immovable mountain. If you don't want to read the ruddy FAQ, then don't read it, but DON'T expect anyone to help you with an attitude like that. If you still disagree with the very basic request that you read the FAQ before persisting to ask questions that are readily answered there, and think we are being obstinent snobs in doing so, then the door's to your left -- don't let it hit you on the way out.<br/>_________________<br/>"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy."

The way I see it, all tutorials are for beginners.  If you want to jump into the deep right away, find some reference docs, download devkit and start experimenting.  google "gbatek"
<br/>
<br/>
You'll want to get an MBV2 cable and some type of flash cart.  Again, google is your friend.

I fully agree with the others on this issue. Offering help is a favour and not a responibility. Most people are happy to help newbies, but one have to give some to get some. And the currency in this particular case is effort. A mutual give and take. Do your reasearch, and whereever you fail or don't understand, post your issue here (if not already answered). Our job is not to clear the path ahead of you, but rather to help you overcome your (well defined) obtacles. I have a hard time believing that you possibly couldn't find information about what devkits and tools there are out there googling or searching the forum, especially being, as you claim, "an advanced user".<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
