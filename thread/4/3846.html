Has anybody tested this, or are there not that many people on this board with more than one GBA?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have only one gba, but this would be easy to test.  Seed your RNG, send a random number every frame and store it in SRAM on the remote end.  Dump SRAM to your PC and compare it to the stream of random numbers.
