    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If my code works on a GBA Emulator (VisualBoy Advance PC), can I be sure that it will work on GBA without bugs (perhaps synchro/speed problems; but no alloc problems, no VRAM or OAM bugs, ...).
<br/>
Can I develop a game without regular real GBA tests ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would be wise to try it out on a GBA once in a while... It looks very different on hardware compared to the emulators... Also, emulators are not perfect...
<br/>
I hardcoded my colisionmap to EXTRAM... Worked perfectly in many emulators, didn't work at all on hardware... Found out that I missed one zero in the EXTRAM adress, so my colisionmap was actually written right over the BIOS area. Some emulators accept that, the hardware does not :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Generally speaking you shouldn't have any problems, but as has been said, it's probably not a good idea. Emulators, for example, will not give you any idea of how dark the Gameboy's screen really is. Things look different on emulators. Also, occasionally you will run across problems that emulators don't duplicate... See my thread on sprite overlap problems for an example.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can write them without testing on hardware, and be fairly confident it will turn out okay on hardware. It's just not a particularly good idea. :)<br/>_________________<br/>-Arek the Absolute</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
