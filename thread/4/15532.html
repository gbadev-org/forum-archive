    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this goes there, but I can't find more information on this.
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to compile a GBA toolchain and strat building some games, but now, after formatting my Debian 4 I can't compile it.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem seems to be in newlib (and maybe with automake). I got this error:
<br/>
<br/>
configure: error: can not find install-sh or install.sh in .. ./.
<br/>
<br/>
I have installed automake, autoconf, and all the required stuff. Where is the problem?
<br/>
<br/>
I unzip the source and I run ./configure --target=arm-thumb-elf. Then I run make. 
<br/>
<br/>
If anybody can help me I would be really happy.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Im using x86, but I don't want to use any devkit, I want to compile my own copy of gcc, binutils and newlib.
<br/>
<br/>
Check linux.gbadev.org

If anyone could help...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps you could just download the versions of GCC, Binutils, newlib, and GNU libstdc++ that correspond to some version of devkitARM, and then apply devkitPro's patches on top of them.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll try it, but some months ago I managed to compile them without patches and now I'm trying with the same sources (I backuped them into a CD).
<br/>
<br/>
It seems an automake error, because the message is that it cannot found a file which is gerenated by configure.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thanks for your interest! ;)
