(save link, controls in pic, rename as *.rar), and I am stumped on a few things hindering my progress. One is an x-scrolling camera, so I'll also need to get a long background on there, not just one 240x160 image. And putting up the other half of the gun also wouldn't hurt (it's outside of the main 32x64 sprite).
<br/>
<br/>
But my main concern is how I'm going to do all of this in mode 4. I'm just expanding on subjects form the webbesen.dk pong tutorial (DevKitAdv), really, and don't know how to do anything in mode 1, although I've heard mode 1 is better for 2D sidescrollers like mine.
<br/>
<br/>
If a camera-like thing is possible in mode 4, OK. If not, a mod would probably want to move this to beginners since it'll end up being a teach-me-how-to-do-mode-1 thread.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope you like the demo I have so far, 100% debugged and I drew all the sprites except for the gun (which you can only see half of, anyway...).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately, google is pointing to the old version.  Hopefully they'll update it eventually.  Maybe we can get one of the admin people to update the link from the main page here so it will point to the right place, and help google figure it out....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
