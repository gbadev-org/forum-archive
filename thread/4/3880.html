    <h4>#24953 - gb_feedback - Fri Aug 13, 2004 8:47 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have just added a power saving SWI 2 instruction to Bookreader (V4.91), and to check how effective it was I took some battery current measurements this evening. if anyone has tried this you'll know what fun it is to insert a meter into the battery circuit on a GBA SP, when you don't want to ruin the battery or the contacts.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I thought that the results were instructive. I took a few readings in different software situations, all using an 256Mbyte F2A Ultra cartridge, and rounded to 1mA.
<br/>
<br/>
Pogoshell (Light On)...................72mA
<br/>
Pogoshell (Light Off)...................46mA
<br/>
Bookreader V4.9  (Light On)........71mA
<br/>
Bookreader V4.9  (Light Off)........45mA
<br/>
Midi plug-in playing on Pogoshell (Light On)......70mA
<br/>
Zelda (start of game play) (Light On)....78mA
<br/>
Bookreader V4.91  (Light On).........41mA
<br/>
Bookreader V4.91  (Light Off).........17mA
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusions? Well first of all the light is taking 22mA. Turning off the light in an official game could extend battery life by 28%.
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, in spite of criticism of Bookreader for not using SWI 2, it doesn't appear to use more current than other programs.
<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly though, with the light off, the new Bookreader will run for more than 2 1/2 times longer than the older one. With the light on (essential in my opinion) the new Bookreader will run for 73% longer than the older one. 
<br/>
<br/>
[Pogoshell V1.2 was used, later versions may have been power reduced. Bookreader 4.91 has not yet been released.]<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by gb_feedback on Sat Aug 14, 2004 2:17 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Sure. 
<br/>
<br/>
There's another thing I'm wondering about. Do DMA transfers uses more current than CPU memory transfers ? If you could test it one of these days, it would be cool. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also could you make some tests with some other interrupts enabled, like say HBLANK, serial, etc. I think battery consumption is really an important parameter when you are developing software. Don't you think ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it would be fun to do more measurements too.
<br/>
<br/>
However you can probably guess some of the answers. SWI 2 will turn off the CPU (but nothing else) until the next interrupt. The interrupt is just a process using the CPU. So the consumption of the GBA without light or CPU is about 17mA (or maybe a bit less) [with sound circuits enabled]. With CPU on continuously it's around 45mA. So regardless of which interrupt you're using the current would seem to be 17mA + (28mA times the proportion of time the CPU is on) + 22mA if the light is on.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure these figures could be refined - I only spent a few minutes taking the measurements, using programs which were to hand.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep, it should be less. Maybe could you just do some measurements while the cpu is completely halted (not even VBLANK irq to wake him up) ? And so you would have a correct base value.

True, and it even depends on the flash card type. But this values aren't interesting in absolute terms, at least for programming. They are because they indicate which 'proportion' of power is used.

<br/>
<br/>
Effect of Playing from F2A Ultra 256Mb cart (presumably just quiescent cart current - as it's still a multiboot program)...additional 0.8mA
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it makes sense. I noticed that I had left the multiboot cable in. That reduces the current by half a mA or so for some reason, so the real result maybe should be 1mA higher in some cases. Bear in mind that if the game is actually doing anything the reading goes up and down all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT - Later experiment. I dumped a commercial cartridge and put it (very temporarily) on the F2A Ultra 256Mb. At the same point in early gameplay (light off) the commercial cart took 31mA and the FLASH cart took 51mA.  A 64% increase in battery consumption, or a 40% decrease in battery lifetime. I have now of course deleted the temporary backup.
<br/>
<br/>
It would perhaps be interesting if we tried a version of TOD which actually ran from the FLASH cart. I leave the idea in tepples court as I don't have time to compile his source right now.

Minimal. I wonder what battery consumption would be like with a program that loads itself to RAM but keeps its assets such as audio samples in ROM, which is what happens when a DevKit Advance R5 program is loaded by a loader that relies on DKA crt0's dual .mb.gba capability.

We really need the data from TOD on FLASH to be able to claim this, I think. (Not saying that you're wrong - just that we have to compare the same game in the two different circumstances. After all Bookreader working from FLASH now takes the same current as TOD working from RAM - but of course nothing is going on in the CPU while you stare at a book page.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, interestingly, we now have two active official games (measured on FLASH) 51mA and 56mA - quite similar figures.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have measured the current consumption of several official games on the original GBA. The consumption is almost constant, no matter the title of the game or if it is measured during gameplay or during something static, like a menu. The current consumption for official games on the original GBA is always 100mA, with only 10-20% or so deviation.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, 100mA is higher than that of the GBA SP, this is because the original GBA runs on 2 NiMH batteries, so the voltage is only about 2.4V, while the GBA SP runs on a 3.8V LiIon battery.
<br/>
Also, the original GBA uses a boost (step up) type power supply while the SP must use a buck (step down) type power supply. I don't think they can get as high efficiency from a boost PS as from a buck PS. Take theese two factors into account, and the power consumption becomes equal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I expect similar behavior out of TOD's title screen. Perhaps TOD will use a bit more juice because 1. sound is still on (so that you don't get pops all the time) and 2. its audio mixer is still running but mixing silence.

Does the use of alkaline cells (2x1.5V) change the boost vs. buck figures any?

<br/>
No. The difference can hardly be measured.
<br/>
<br/>
The video hardware (including the LCD itself), the processor, the cart (especially if it is a flashcart), and the light (if GBA SP). Thoose are the big consumers.
<br/>
<br/>
If you wanna save power:
<br/>
Turn the GBA SP light off.
<br/>
Put the processor in a sleep mode whenever you don't need it.
<br/>
Limit cart accesses.
<br/>
Shut down the LCD (yeah, right...).
<br/>
<br/>
I find it weird that most commercial games don't appear to use the sleep modes very much. I would expect that to be a requirement from Nintendo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
No. The difference can hardly be measured.
<br/>
<br/>
The video hardware (including the LCD itself), the processor, the cart (especially if it is a flashcart), and the light (if GBA SP). Thoose are the big consumers.
<br/>
<br/>
If you wanna save power:
<br/>
Turn the GBA SP light off.
<br/>
Put the processor in a sleep mode whenever you don't need it.
<br/>
Limit cart accesses.
<br/>
Shut down the LCD (yeah, right...).
<br/>
<br/>
I find it weird that most commercial games don't appear to use the sleep modes very much. I would expect that to be a requirement from Nintendo.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It's probably because most 3rd party games aren't played for very long periods of time. Nintendo makes most of the games that take a long time to complete and are most likely to be played for longer periods of time.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I previously made the following measurements on tepples TOD in multiboot, which I don't think I included.
<br/>
<br/>
Changing volume control from min to max with NO SOUND playing increases current consumption by 0.5mA
<br/>
<br/>
Changing volume control from min to max with loud music playing increases current consumption by 3mA
<br/>
<br/>
Compare thse with the overall consumption to gauge the significance.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bookreader.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.bookreader.co.uk/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
