<br/>
<br/>
Haven't done any GBA coding for a while - did Spacies and Coin Adventure (mental.gba) a while back.
<br/>
<br/>
I've since upgraded to Windows XP. Will I be able to use my *ahem* version of ARM SDT - I seem to remember there was a patch for Windows 2000.  Will this work on XP, or do I not need it...
<br/>
<br/>
Any help much appreciated - I don't really want to use GCC. The ARM set up is so much simpler.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Michael, I've got the pistols</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
