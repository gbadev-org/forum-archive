    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For reverse engineering and research purposes, there are some carts that I would like to inspect.. And the vba disassembler works somehow, but I can't find a way to set breakpoints and stuff there..
<br/>
<br/>
What would be perfect was to be able to attach insight/gdb to it (using assembler view, and gdb also supports external symbol tables). However, gdb won't open the raw gba file, so I need to convert it to an elf binary..
<br/>
<br/>
Somebody who knows how to do this?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in Advance :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can't really convert a binary to an ELF file because all the sectioning information has been discarded. objcopy might be persuaded to dump the whole lot into one but .text segment (read its info file) but this is unlikely to help you tremendously. =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Any other tricks on disassembling roms?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My personal suggestion would be 'buy IDA Pro'. It's $400, though. Other than that, you just have a lot of work ahead. Use a debugger where possible rather than a disassembly.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't figure out the VBA debugger, you are probably using the wrong version of VBA. The standard version has only the GDB debug stub and the basic ability to pause/resume execution. Get the SDL version - it has a full command-line debugger which is able to do most things that gdb can.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been playing a bit around with IDA Pro before (x86 version), it totally rocks, and might even be worth $400 just for hobby purposes if I had the money right now, but unfortunanately I promised my girlfriend a vacation to some  exotic country.. $$$ :P
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it was really debugging I meant.. I didn't know SDL VBA had internal debugging capabilities too, but then again I'm pretty much a newbie to the gba dev scene..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
