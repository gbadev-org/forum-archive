You can copy multi-boot GBA programs (compiled for RO section 0x2000000) from normal GBA programs to EWRAM and execute them from there if that's what you mean. That's how some GBA programs support both multi-boot and normal execution modes: They check if they are located in ROM when started and if so, they copy themselves into EWRAM (like they would normally be if they were multi-booted) and run from there.

If you have several .mb ROMs (which run from 0x02000000), you can toss them into my multiboot menu program, available at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/" target="_blank">http://www.pineight.com/gba/</a><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

look into PogoShell's sourcecode. you'll find a "visoly.s" file that contains the code to select the page of ROM that must be remapped into 0x08000000, and run it (it's a soft reset, basically).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
