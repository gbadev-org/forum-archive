    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently trying to get a basic understanding of the multi-player mode. currently I can connect 2 GBA's together (using VBA linker atm) and establish a connection and can send data between them.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem I'm having is how to send data x and then send data y so both GBA's could send a position between each other.
<br/>
<br/>
From what I've read there is meant to be a delay of 600 ticks + send interval.
<br/>
<br/>
so far I'm just sending the data and then waiting for the 7th bit to become 0 of SCCNT_L (REG_SIOCNT in libgba) and then giving the send register a new value and start the communication again.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also not using a interrupt for the communication (mainly because I have no idea how to set it up).
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you very much.

I will have a good read through this and work out where I am going wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
I take it multiplayer.c has all multi-player functions and pin8gba.h is your definitions of memory addresses.
<br/>
<br/>
and the two agbtty have no relevance to the actual multi-player code</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, that all sounds right. pin8gba.h is an excellent little wrapper by Tepples. The adbtty is just for console-like text display.
