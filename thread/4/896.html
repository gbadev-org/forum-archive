    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone recommend a good way of displaying the current score?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm making a simple game (chickens, baskets, clouds, maybe a windmill) and I need to display the current score in the top-left. 
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the only idea I have is to use a sprite for each digit of the score. It also occurred to me I could make the score part of the background (if I make tiles that are digits).
<br/>
<br/>
Which would be the better method?
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of a different way to do this or has some nifty routines then all help would be welcome.

"If you only scroll a limited amount, try setting a vcount interrupt to partition the image into status-bar and playfield regions. Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 for NES do essentially this."

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a trick that is pretty much obsolete on the GBA, because of its multiple layers. 
<br/>
<br/>
You scroll most of the screen the regular way, then when you reach a certain scan line, the interrupt kicks in and you set the scroll registers to 0. The rest of the screen then stays fixed. Very cunning, but if you just have 1 or 2 BGs and the score board, you'd be better off sticking the scores on a seperate background layer or doing them as sprites.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
