    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I was just wondering if sprites have priority over drawing a regular pixel to the screen? If you had drawn them to screen, and the plotted pixels over them, would the pixel appear over them?
<br/>
If not, how can that be done?
<br/>

Not always, in mode 4 the background appears over the sprite if you display it a certain way even without changing priority. I know this for sure, I spent a few hours getting mad becuase of this and trying to find the priority tags.
<br/>
<br/>
The priority can be changed, 0-3 and 3 being new and 0 being far but that can be changed too. The Pern Project has an RPG demo that uses it, they are BG_Priority(0) (background), and Priority(0) (sprite)
<br/>
<br/>
I think even a one pixel that is drawn is drawn into the background, but I have never tried it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That last sentence is wierd.
<br/>
<br/>
You have to change the priority of the background to change the dot. 
<br/>
<br/>
Like..
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">REG_BG0CNT = BG_COLOR_256 | BG_PRIORITY(0)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
The 0 in the BG_PRIORITY is the top layer... this is currently the only way i know how to change the bg_priority, it could probably be done in other places accept REG_BG0CNT.. also bg2 would obviously be REG_BG2CNT.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try and catch the next question.. I am still new to gba programming</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can in mode 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 I know that, so you probably can in all modes as they wouldnt just exclude 5... plus I think priorities would be essential when making a game for all modes. Do you need an example of sprite priority? thepernproject.com has tutorials with priorities in them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Mode 4, likely. Mode 3 and 5 I'm not so sure about, unless Nintendo did the right thing and made bit 15 of the color value act as a Z mask.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
