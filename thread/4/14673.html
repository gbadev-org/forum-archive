    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently writing a (Windows) program to copy/extract NDS roms onto a MicroSD card and I want to process the .NDS file and extract both the title and the icon to 'pretty up' the interface a bit.  I have no problem in getting the title but I am having problems converting the TileData into a Windows BMP/ICO ready to display.  Does any one have some code I could crib from (Preferably Delphi but I can handle C or VB)?

<br/>
Thanks,

Can you post it here or do you want to mail it me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're talking about copying commercial roms, be warned that any talk of piracy is strictly not allowed in the forum.<br/>_________________<br/>I've coded about 17 different implementations of Pong.

Copying/extracting means "copying" a .nds file from a disc (CD/DVD/HDD/etc) to a MicroSD card and "extracting" means pulling the said .NDS file out of it's .zip/.rar/.7z compressed container.  I never mentioned *ANYTHING* about commercial roms...Homebrew roms contain icons you know!

I've been looking for some code other the past week on the Internet and I don't know who these "experts" are but I'm not sure if anyone else is gonna post on this subject. Please don't raise my hopes - I'd rather just have some code (no matter how dirty/unkempt it is) to look at...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh okay, I just wanted to make sure you weren't asking for any "inappropriate" information. Typically when someone talks about "roms" they imply commercial, pirated stuff. Which is not okay around here. I'm pretty sure that "binaries" or ".nds files" is the more common term on this forum.

Your menu idea sounds interesting and I wish you good luck with it. Though I think you should know that not too many people here use Delphi so you're kind of on your own with that one. C and C++ are the main languages used by far.<br/>_________________<br/>I've coded about 17 different implementations of Pong. It's the game dev's "hello, world".
