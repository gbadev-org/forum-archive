    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One of my own goals in GBA/DS is to try to make it as easy as possible to get things set up and running (Hence, the old <a class="postlink" href="http://www.twistedpairgaming.com/gbadev/" target="_blank">GBAForVS6</a> AppWizard I made). It's been my intent to update GBAForVS6 to work with the newer versions of DevKitARM and with DS, and also to make it easy (either through GBAForVS6 or otherwise) to get set up to compile a D program for GBA/DS.
<br/>
<br/>
But it's occurred to me that Visual Studio 6 might not be particularly popular (being pricey commercial software, and a rather old version at that). So I need to get a better idea of where I should focus my efforts.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

Visual Studio Express is just a form of Visual Studio .NET, just a different tier (Express/Professional/Enterprise/whatever). As such, it handles AppWizards/etc completely differently than the way it's done in version 6.
<br/>
<br/>
I may very well put effort into VS.NET (including Express), but again, for all I know, there might be comparatively few people interested in that versus eclipse, or plain command-line, etc. Hence, this poll.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

Nice text editor, you can hit F7 to compile, and with WW, you can use shorthand names for opening files (and don't have to worry about what folder they're in), and flip back and forth between headers/source files.<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I never understood the whole hoopla over the managed make files.  It's pretty easy to write makefiles that automatically add targets based on source files.  That and considering that the managed makefiles don't seem to do so well with custom make targets (like for your graphics and other resources), I don't see the advantage.

Maybe there's some functionality I'm missing with them, but I don't get it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is quite an opinion, many probably wont agree.
<br/>
make has a pretty ugly learning curve, so if one is to simplify that process, managing make doesnt seem like such a bad idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As long as the tool can handle the concept of a unmanaged makefile and a managed one I would be happy with that part.  On existing project I have already built a makefile and the tool should just use that and defer to me to maintain the makefile.  On a new project having the tool maintain the make file is good as long as the way of describing what needs to be done is flexible enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Beyond that, I'd put in a vote for Visual Studio 6 over .NET.  I have both, but the improvements in .NET aren't worth the extra weight and .NET framework dependencies to me.  Obviously the latter wouldn't be relevant to what you're doing but it does affect which I'd prefer to have installed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The Makefiles from the libnds examples are pretty complete - they already generate and include the depend files, for example. I find it easier to hack together a Makefile, or add to an existing one, than learn another IDE's non-standard layout at least.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
If you mean my plugin <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9795" target="_blank">NDS Managedbuilder</a> .. this works well for me. If you have trouble or found a bug simply write me a mail/pm and i'll try to fix it.
<br/>
