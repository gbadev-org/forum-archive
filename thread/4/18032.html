Yeah, tonc really is the best tutorial. If you have specific questions about things that are confusing you, don't hesitate to ask.

Communicating between 2 gba's is relatively complex, compared to other development tasks on the device. The best instructions that I know of are from gbatek (<a class="postlink" href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbacommunicationports" target="_blank">http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbacommunicationports</a>), but that's not written in a very tutorial, newbie-friendly way.  I've never done much with communication between them, so I wouldn't be much help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're planning on using his library, you might as well include the whole library.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I didn't use his library .... I just read through the tutorials to get a better explanation of the how the hardware worked, and wrote my own code to use the hardware directly. But to each his own.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
