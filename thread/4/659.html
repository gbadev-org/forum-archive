    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Kind of new at this, but my assignment involves creating a logging system for debugging purposes.
<br/>
<br/>
What is the best way to do this?
<br/>
TCP? 
<br/>
GDB? 
<br/>
???
<br/>
<br/>
Working in a windows environment, and would like to ouput logging to file if possible.  
<br/>
<br/>
Please reply asap.  Any suggestions appreciated.
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">VisualboyAdvance SDL version has a console for text output to screen, very useful for debuggin purposes. It's slow, but works well if you wrap each call that uses it with a preprocessor directive that checks to see if you are building with debugging turned on like so:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
// Some where in one of your main headers:
<br/>
#define DEBUG 1 // set to 0 if you want to turn it off
<br/>
...
<br/>
// Then in the actual code you do:
<br/>
#if DEBUG
<br/>
blah blah blah // output something to console
<br/>
#endif
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
For specifics, consult the VBA SDL manual. Also the HAM dev kit has functions for outputting to console, as well as GDB debugger, so if you don't want to learn the process VBA SDL version uses to output to screen you can just use that.
