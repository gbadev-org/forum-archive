    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I've spent ~3 weeks (not straight) trying to figure out Multiplayer mode. I can get one way transfer. But can anyone explain or point me to some documentation on Multiplayer mode. I don't want another line to Cowbite's gbatek document. Its my main hardware reference, I've interpreted it in many ways with still no sucess.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance
<br/>

If you haven't already, they'll probably help.<br/>_________________<br/>Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself: "Mankind". Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes I have. And no offence. but the tutorials I've read on that site arn't very technical. They are good if you want something spoon fed to you. I want to understand multiplayer mode as well as use it. Besides, the linking tutorial doesn't use multiplayer mode as far as I can tell from a quick glance. I am grateful of maverick's site though. I've used the multiboot header and source in order to use multiboot. Thanks maverick.<br/>_________________<br/>[url="http://www.ice-d.com"]www.ice-d.com[/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
