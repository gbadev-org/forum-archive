    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"pcm wav files" can be a bunch of different formats. The GBA uses specifically 8-bit signed PCM. Most sound editor programs (I use CoolEdit 96, although it's a little hard to find nowadays) can save a .wav file in that format.
<br/>
<br/>
To mix sounds, just add all the PCM values together. 
<br/>
It's actually a bit more complicated than that because you usually need to do resampling and volume and then keep your values from getting too big to fit in a signed 8-bit sample, but it's not too bad.
<br/>
You might want to check out my GBA sound tutorial, which can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://deku.gbadev.org/program/sound1.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The first 2 sections are basically writing a simple mixer from the ground up.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.
