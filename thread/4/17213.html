    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone set up to use Viisual Studio Express 2008 as an IDE for GBA development?
<br/>
<br/>
I've been searching gbadev and DevKit Advance's sites to try to find something that explains how to accomplish this, but I haven't found anything concrete.  I honestly don't usually deal with the compiler side of things...  Just the writing of the code that gets compiled, so some of the setup information that I did come across is a bit confusing.
<br/>
<br/>
A while back, I know I had set up DevKit Advance with Visual C++ 6.0, but I have no recollection of how, and I wanted to be able to compile my old code in the IDE I use today.  (It was a Klax style game.)  Though, my reason for wanting to compile this is mostly for reference.
<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, my main reason for wanting to be able to compile GBA code is so that I can jump into writing a short game without having to deal with setting up anything that deals with Windows.  I've worked with NDS before, but I don't have a professional dev kit for the DS at home, and with no great emulators for the DS (that I'm aware of), making and sharing this short game as a DS rom would likely be more difficult.  So, if anyone has a solution to this situation that I did not think of, I am open to suggestions.
<br/>
<br/>
Once I get past the hurdle of being able to compile and run something, I should be all set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Having used the official NDS emulator (Basically NDS hardware with extra debugging info hooked up to a compy) for so long may have spoiled me somewhat on emulators...  I'll take another look at NO$.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Following that setup (and installing devkitPro) was easy.  Compiling one of the NDS example files that comes with devkitPro, and running it in NO$ was successful as well.  My concept works better as an NDS game than a GBA game thanks to the touchscreen, so I think I'll switch my plans to use NDS.  Thanks a lot for your help.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Thajocoth on Thu Apr 29, 2010 9:16 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

That's cheating! ;)
