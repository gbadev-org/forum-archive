    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if there was any possible way to give enough free memory to allow double buffering on mode 3. I know that you're not supposed to, but mode 3 is in my opinion the easiest to draw for and I would love to find a way to use double buffering with it.<br/>_________________<br/>All knowledge is good; only the way it is put to use is good or evil.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, what you can do is:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Create another buffer in EWRAM. This will suck up about 1/3 of it and its not as fast as VRAM. I think people use DMA3 to get some decent speed.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Halfing your resolution by using the BG scaling registers (correct me if I'm wrong). You only get 120x160 which is about the same as mode 5.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right. That's why I tend to say there are two double-buffered 120x160 pixel hi-color modes: one row-major (scaled mode 3) and one column-major (rotated/scaled mode 5) depending on whether your rasterizer draws rows or columns faster.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
