However, you can use a disassembler to see what ASM code is executed.  It can not recover symbol names, so you only have memory addresses to go  by.
<br/>
Some emulators have a Debugger feature to let you step through the disassembled ASM code, and set breakpoints.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is not exactly true -- you should look at <a class="postlink" href="http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Boomerang</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
However, AFAIK, Boomerang only currently supports x86 CPU-based executables, not GBA/ARM like the OP is looking for.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
