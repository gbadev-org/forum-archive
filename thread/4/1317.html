    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, there is this <a class="postlink" href="http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm</a> which is not so much a SDK than a description of the hardware.

But if you want a doc about the C/C++ functions usuable with the GBA, I don't think there's really one, since it's just standard C/C++  aimed for the Arm processor. There's no official library made especially for the GBA, that I know of.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
