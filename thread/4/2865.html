    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I am sure that I have misunderstood something, or I don't have reliable info, but this is bugging me out so here I go.
<br/>
For tile modes, you save your tile data into these character blocks, sized of 16KB (16384 bytes), say that you use text background layer and 4-bits pixels (16-color palettes obviously).
<br/>
This means that every tile takes 32 bytes of space. Ok, then, when I do a simple calculation
<br/>
16384/32, I get 512, so this means you can have 512 different tiles (at most) per character block.
<br/>
The thing is that, text background layers has 10 bits reserved for tile index.
<br/>
2^10 = 1024
<br/>
What's the point having support for 1024 unique tiles, if you can only store 512 per character block?
<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something here? Or don't I have the right info?
<br/>
Is the one bit unused? Or does it use the tiles from next block if index is bigger than 512?
<br/>
<br/>
It all makes sense for rotating/scaling background layers, since you can only have 256 unique tiles (8 bits per tile index), and you can only use 8-bit pixel tiles (which is 64 bytes per tile).
<br/>
16384/64 = 256
<br/>
<br/>
I'd appreciate if someone clarified this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heh yeah, it probably should. x_x
<br/>
I wasn't sure where I should post this anyway, so feel free to move.
<br/>
Well, thanks for clarifying then.
<br/>
What if I used the last block as starting block, and then used index greater than 512 (so it would exceed the 0x600FFFF), would it use the sprite character data from 0x6010000?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
