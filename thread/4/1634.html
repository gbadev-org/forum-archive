    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two ways:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Put you code and data in IWRAM section in a scatter file.
<br/>
     In addition you can use various flags to control where the code, and    
<br/>
     static and dynamic data goes.   Before ADS 1.2 this is the only way 
<br/>
    (short of some big hack) to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Starting with ARM ADS v1.2 there is a pragma that you can use to control where your code and data goes.  You'll still want to at least setup a basic scatter file with EWRAM, IWRAM and CODE sections.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
