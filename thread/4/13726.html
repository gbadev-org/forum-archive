    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been using DevKitAdv on Windows / Cygwin, but I'm having problems getting GDB / Insight to work correctly. Insight just says 'Invalid path / filename' every time I try to open my .elf file.
<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering what combination of devkit / debugger people have found to work well on Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
Gaz.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The insight combination with the VBA-SDL code works well if you have the correct version of all the components. It turns out that the version issue that most important is the the version of the VBA-SDL code.  If you have the 7.2 verson it has the most problems with the debugger.  The prior version is better with the debugger but still has problems.  The version 1.8.1 has "most" of the debug stuff fixed but still needs some work.  That version is one that I have fixed to clean up the debug environment.  I have been trying to get it to be part of the devKitPro tool kit to get it out so people can find more issues and others can fix problems.  The code and executables are available to anyone who wants them.  The current executables were built with Visual Studio 2005 Pro so they require some runtime files (because that is the way MS does it) so they need to be installed as well.  The SDL version is the only one needed for debugging.  This code has been used by numerous people for the last year in my class at Full Sail so it is pretty stable.  I have posted links in the past and could re-port them if there is any interest.  The devkitPro folks have looked at the code but it is not part of the distribution yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
