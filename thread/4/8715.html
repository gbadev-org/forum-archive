I want with gfx2gba a picture in 16bits with a "palette"
<br/>
But in 16 bits you have not palette
<br/>
I try with -c32k :
<br/>
gfx2gba -fsrc -c32f -pnameimage.pal nameimage.bmp (or pcx)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Second, what do you really mean you want a 16-bit paletted picture?  The point of paletted pictures is that you reduce the number of colors your picture can support, so that you can represent individual pixels with fewer bits.  But the gba can't support color-depth beyond 16 bits, so there's no colors to reduce FROM. 
<br/>
<br/>
In gba, paletted images are 4 bpp or 8 bpp.  16bpp are full-color.  There's no way around it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
