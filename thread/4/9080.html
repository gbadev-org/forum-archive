    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does anyone know if its possible to run a GameBoy Advance emulator in an html page?
<br/>
<br/>
my reasons for wanting to do this are quite simple, i have two kids that want to play their games on the pc but they are young and cant get their heads around the rom loading etc, i am quite good with html and think i can come up with something easy for them to use if i could only get the emu to run in a frame or something.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a mac running osx tiger with dreamweaver if this helps. please help! i thought maybe a java app would be a solution but im not too hot on java so anyone elses thoughts would be much appreciated... cheers</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
