    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am sure all my questions have been asked before, but I need some clarification. I want to make a little RPG (who hasn't?), so I am trying to figure out how to fit all the stuff together. I am going to use devkitARM and libgba. This is where my first two questions come in.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Is libgba just a set of header files like the ones from the pern project and similar tutorials? What all is in the library?
<br/>
2) What is up with the crt object files? I think they have something to do with interrupt handling but what all are they for and why does the pern project want to go writing a IRQ handler?
<br/>
3) So could sound be using some timers and DMA for two PCM sound effects made with TektronicWave? Why does this also use some custom crt? Darn the crt stuff.
<br/>
4) BoyScout with the other sound channels for BGM. It looks like this is included in libgba? How would I use this?
<br/>
5) I think I would use a interrupt for the vblank and during this time write some assembly to update the sprites and such. Is there anything else you should do during certain times?
<br/>
6) The main game loop is for the game specific stuff, reading input and loading and starting areas and sounds and such?
<br/>
7) Anywhere I can find a little more info on tiles and maps.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand C/C++ and some assembly, I get most of how this stuff works, I just need a little help putting it all together. If there is something I have wrong or may be missing, please tell me! Set me straight :D
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you time. Please don't flame me :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The 'crt0' file contains the startup code needed to 1. copy a multiboot program from ROM to RAM if necessary and 2. set up the execution environment expected by a C program. Older versions of Jeff Frohwein's GBA crt0 contained interrupt handling code; this has since been moved to a separate file.

There are a few games that do almost everything in the vblank interrupt, including game logic. Examples include <span style="font-style: italic">Super Mario Bros.</span> for NES and <span style="font-style: italic">Road Rash</span> for Sega Genesis; I can imagine that some GBA games do almost everything in vblank too.

To get a feel for tiles and maps, use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#agbtty" target="_blank">AGBTTY</a> and then try to change the font it uses.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
