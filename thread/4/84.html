    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know what all the registers in IO RAM are initialised as when the GBA is first turned on? I'm asking because there are many 'write-only' registers which means I cannot determine the initial values. I am convinced they are not all set to zero.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, does the GBA allow reading VRAM?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the official statement is "they are randomly initialized, assume nothing". If this is true I don't know but it sure sounds like a healthy starting-point. :)<br/>_________________<br/>You can't beat our meat</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
