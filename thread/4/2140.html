    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using HAM, but I want to setup DevKitAdv. I couldn't get the source to compile properly under linux, so I downloaded the binaries, but I am wondering if it is worth the trouble to set up the environment, because the linux release version is so far behind the windows version. It looks like there hasn't been a linux release since last year sometime. Should I just boot into windows to use devkitadv? Does anybody know if the linux version is missing any features that are key in later windows releases? 
<br/>
<br/>
I just hate switching operating systems midstream. Working with a dos command shell is pretty painful for me...
<br/>
Anybody else use devkit under linux that can assuage my fears?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Both MSYS and Cygwin use Bash, a shell in the Bourne tradition.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This works great so far, but of course only on Debian, which is (one of) the best dists anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At the URL I posted there also are tar.gz-packages, which might work on your Redhat install, too.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using DevKit Advance under RH Linux 9.0 for quite some time now (originally started using RH 8, upgraded shortly after the 9.0 release).  So far, it's been fine.  But, I do use a custom version of the crt0.s and lnkscript files, so I'm not really using all of DevKit Advance -- just the compiler/assembler/linker portion.
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend giving it a shot -- it's much better than the alternative to moving over to Windows (IMO) :)<br/>_________________<br/>dennis</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You are just the guy I want to talk to then. 
<br/>
Did you make the lnkscript yourself? If not where did you get it? Did you compile the cross compiler or just install it? 
<br/>
<br/>
This game development scene (and me especially) could very much use a how-to setup devkit under linux, with a code sample that compiles and runs. Think you are the man for the job? There is no pay, just a big thank you from me, and maybe a few more linux users hiding out there.

Booting into windows actually makes me feel queasy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

LOL -- no, I didn't make it myself, I just used the one Jeff F. made.  You can download it from devrs.com/gba/ someplace.  What I do is just make a directory for each project that looks like this:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">project/
<br/>
   |
<br/>
   + Makefile
<br/>
   |
<br/>
   + lnkscript
<br/>
   |
<br/>
   + src/
<br/>
   |
<br/>
   + include/
<br/>
   | 
<br/>
   + bin/</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I put the crt0.S file into the src directory.  My makefile then handles the details of using the replacement lnkscript and crt0.S file.  My Makefile can be downloaded at <a class="postlink" href="http://munsie.dhs.org/gba_code/makefile.tgz" target="_blank">http://munsie.dhs.org/gba_code/makefile.tgz</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The other trick that I do is that I have an alias setup that sets all the environment variables to point to the devkit.  That way, I can have windows open for working with the GBA tool chain and others for the regular tool chain.  Here's my alias (put this in your .bashrc file, if you are using bash -- if you're not using bash, you'll have to figure out the equivalent for your shell):
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">alias devkit='export PATH=/usr/local/devkitadv/arm-agb-elf/bin:$PATH;export GCC_EXEC_PREFIX=/usr/local/devkitadv/arm-agb-elf/lib/gcc-lib/;export PS1="[gba \h:\w]\$ ";unalias devkit'</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
You may have noticed that I also change the prompt (PS1) in there.  That's so that I can tell which toolchain that I am using by simply looking at the prompt.  Comes in handy sometimes.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I think everything is pretty much standard.  I'm using a RH 9 box that was upgraded from RH 8.  I'm using Virtual GameBoy Advance for emulation, and a MBV2 cable for quick testing and writing out to a flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a script that I use to create a new project that I can make available as well.  Let me know, and I can post that as well.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I originally created this Makefile and the new project script under Windows with Cygwin.  Even the idea of the alias came from there, except that I used a batch script instead.  I had very little problems with moving over to linux -- most of my problems come from having a slower linux machine (800mhz Duron vs a 1ghz PIII).  But even still, it's a much nicer environment to work in (IMO) :)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  I forgot to mention.  I downloaded a binary install of devkit advance.  Here is the details on it:
