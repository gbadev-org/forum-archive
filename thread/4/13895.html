    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quick question, if anyone knows.
<br/>
<br/>
I just set up devkitpro on a new computer (windows xp pro), checked out my code that I've been working on forever, but found out that on this new machine, make.exe takes about 10 or 15 seconds between when you launch it, and when it starts doing anything.
<br/>
<br/>
The same application with the same makefile works normally on other machines (including slower ones with less ram), but consistently takes forever to start on this particular machine.  Once it gets going, it churns along at the normal rate.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone experienced this before?  I'm wondering if there's some odd voodoo going on that is preventable?  It's driving me crazy :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you have any shared folders? Do you have a software firewall on the PC that logs outgoing connections from each process?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I experience similar problem on pretty fast machine with XP when I try to compile with Programmers Notepad. Sometimes it took over 10 seconds to start the first task. The strange thing is that the make.exe process take 100% CPU during this 10 seconds. Sometimes I even need to kill the process. Then it will work with almost normal speed. I could compile 20-30 times and then it may happens again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never used MSYS, so I don't know how this would be configured, but when the make.exe process is starting up, maybe some directory in the path of the executable or parameters is taking a long time to check. Try moving the required directories to the beginning of the path so they are checked before the directories that are causing the delay.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In some cases slow startup is related to on demand scanning which makes for very slow compiling. It's worth disabling the scan for the devkitARM folder if you can.
<br/>
<br/>
The other main cause is logitech webcams weirdly enough but this one usually causes make to crash.

No webcam either.
