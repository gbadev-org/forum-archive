    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GBA CPU is possibly fast enough for a Super Mario 64-alike from the isometric perspective of Super Mario RPG (which would use a tile engine), or from the fixed-camera perspective of Alone in the Dark or Final Fantasy VII (which would need primarily sprite-scaling), but not for mobile-camera 3D rendering (for which the PPU offers little help).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples is correct, and there is a neat existing example of just such a game: check out "Banjo Kazooie - Grunty's Revenge" on the GBA.  Does a pretty good job of translating 3D platform gameplay to an iso perspective.
<br/>
<br/>
Super Monkeyball is 3D.  However, I'm betting that the developers needed to do all sorts of whacked tricks and optimizations, and that the engine is therefore probably inappropriate for a free-roaming platformer.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">"Artificial Intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello to all.I wanna give my opinion about it.I think IT IS POSIBLE a mario64 like game on advance.You dont need polygons for it,(personaly i prefer mario  kart advance than Ds version).With mode 7 and several add and optimitation it would be posible.
<br/>
An example is sonic robo blast 2

<br/>
<br/>
it is a pc game with the engine of doom legacy modded (other version of doom engine.)The graphics are beautifull and it seem really a real 3d.
<br/>
The only problem is "the engine used".It is not very effective,it use a lot of cpu (software version) but it is because it is not optimized,the pc has not 2d accel and the goal is a enjoyable game ,but no limits its requisites.
<br/>
That game would be ported on advanced (it would not easy,it is true) .The problem is a lot of job must be done.(in there forum is said Ds is not able to do,(other lie)

<br/>
A good programer and time,it would be posible.GBA is a 2d 32 bits console,and it has power for it.It makes scalate and rotation via hardware.
<br/>
Maybe the models has to be smaler and scale for hardware (as mario kart ,but it is posible).I have seen several demos of advance using poligons,and other stuff,but it is not necesary.(but show its power)
<br/>
Only using the power of 2D sprites and 2D hardware aceleration.

I think gba is a a good plataform and none game hit is top on graphics.
<br/>
(there was a lot of adaptations and no enought time for it)

<br/>
if gb can do it :

i dont think it is difficult see the sonic adaptation on advance.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes,i know.For it i posted it here.I think that game can be ported on GBA,and it was the most similar to mario64 and beautifull advance can do.(although 2d sprites.but simulate well 3d and better than use all poligons on such console.
<br/>
<br/>
change res of images and voila ,a mario 64 similar game on advance
<br/>
<br/>
It  is not only doom,it has several adds,as "make floors over floors".
<br/>
It's based on Doom Legacy, not Doom.and also is not real 3d.
<br/>
also maybe add skybox as seing on :http://www.realm667.com/images/stories/doom/ultimatetnt/DOOM0021.jpg</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA Doom games aren't based on a GPL source port, so it's hard to tell what cheats its renderer used without disassembling it. But based on <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9484" target="_blank">changes to the rules in May 2006</a>, it appears that dumping and disassembling commercial games isn't what we're supposed to be talking about on this domain.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd almost prefer an Alone in the Dark/FF7/Res Evil style engine with scaled sprites over largely prerendered scenes. Either that or a Super Mario RPG style isometric engine.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am not speaking about disassembling anything,i only said that sonic uses doom engine modded ,and with the power of gba,it could run on it,and it would the most similar and beautifull way to create a mario64 clone,with camera moving.Only see the pics and you will be agree with me.
<br/>
<br/>
The sources of game are freely,and it should be adapted to console,and using optimitation and advance technology.
<br/>
(reduce sprites,and scale via hard,using the rotation the console give us..)
<br/>
<br/>
we have also doom 2 ,mario kart advance and several demos showing the  power of gb advance .
<br/>
<br/>
I also coment the best way of a  mario64 game on  advance and how create it using mode 7 and a good sprites to create the ilusion of 3d.
<br/>
In homebrew we have demos as berseik,waterfall

<br/>

Also other demos as 3D Texel Engine would be a good beninging.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using poligons are not a good way,a lot of programing and the result is impresionant but less beautifull.
<br/>
An example is Beyond The Limits ,a great demo but less "beautifull" than seing mario on mariokart advance or sonic on such demo i spoke.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The kind of engine you propoused is great for rpg,adventures ... but for plataforms ,in my view is less interesting than a "mario64" stile.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And i prefer the rotation and view of impresioning views as seing in mario64 than a isometric game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My point is that the GPL version of Doom and the GBA version of Doom are two separate forks of the code base, and I know of no easy way to reconcile the forks. The GPL Doom can't run on a GBA without a huge overhaul. If you plan on volunteering to do this overhaul, good luck ;-)

Notice how flat the track is in Mario Kart Super Circuit. If you make anything in "mode 7"[1], it will be that flat.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think if you're going to do any kind of more complex perspectivized game with Mode 7 you'd want to do a Software Rendition of the Effect. Then use a simple poly renderer to put 3D Objects on the playfield. I think that would be acceptable for the GBA. I mean you could use full 3D, but this way the most you'll need is Frustrum Culling and Painters Algorithm. Keep it simple.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a decent tutorial on the Mode 7 effect in Allegro, I found one with QBASIC code a while back, but can't find the link.

<br/>
Also Darkfader's Hardware Perspective View Source is quick and easy to understand. If you'd want to use Hardware.

<br/>
<br/>
Another way to go is a Voxel Terrain, which is a very similar concept to Mode 7. You could put 3D Objects on there if you wanted terrain more like Mario.

The DooM GBA port is not actually a port of PC DooM. For some reason I neglected to mention this during my post a year ago, but I'll mention it now.

DooM GBA is derived from the DooM Jaguar port and the source code for that port has been made available.
