    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, Im new to this forum, and im not sure if this is the correct place, but it seemed the most sensible..
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I need to be able to communicate with a PC from a GBA. I need to simply send a string from the GBA to the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
Idea:- 
<br/>
<br/>
I will make a small mp3 player in my car (pc), and use the GBA as a starting point for the *controller*, so the playlists etc will be listed on the GBA (i can compile and makes the menus etc), im very unsure about how i can talk back to the PC however. Is it posible over the USB linker cable? or do i need to make my own serial connection up? Any help would be appreciated!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, but the search on this forum seems to return about 100 unrelated posts for various combinations :S
<br/>
<br/>
Just for some hope, is it possibe to use the linker usb cable to communicate? (surly the linker software can send, and it knows when the GBA state changes start+select etc?). Or is a serial to Rs232 better?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any code prewritten.  I know some C (probably intermediate), and i did 68k ASM for a bit at college, so im not going to be able to jump in at the deep end without being able to hack at some source code.
<br/>
<br/>
The pc end isnt a problem, i can write the software to do pretty much anything, its the GBA end im going to get stuck on. 
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Problem with USB linkers is that there is no documentation on most of them. RS232 is the easiest. The Xboo cable also work, but is a little more tricky.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Cheers for the info guys!
<br/>
<br/>
i now know i need to either build a rs232 cable with voltage changing etc, or get one of those handy cables (they have rs232/par on one end), they are about ?10?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Did you have any success with this linking a GBA to a PC through serial port?  This is exactly why I'm lurking in this forum now.  Any information you could share would be much appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
