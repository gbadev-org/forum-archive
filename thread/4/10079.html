    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been frustrated by the source code debugging support in VBA for some time and have been using 1.7.1 because that seemed to be the latest release that had a working insight/gdb interface.  Of course each time you disconnect the emulator would crash but I had adjusted to that.
<br/>
<br/>
After playing with 1.8.0 and fixing issues I found with the PREFETCH implementation I have also fixed the crash problem in 1.7.1.  I go the code from CVS and would like to work with someone to integrate the code back into the package.  While doing my investigation I added the ability to disassemble the code as it ran to see what the system was doing if you set the system debug to a high level.  I assume that there is some bdy of people who are maintaining this code currently so I would like to talk to them.  I tested the code (SDL only) using Visual Studio 2005 and I am rady to test it under Linux. 
<br/>
<br/>
Should anyone know how to contact these developers please post the contact information.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got the souce from "http://vba.ngemu.com/".  The source on source forge does not contain this version (1.8.0) so I did not know where the "offical" location was.  The fixes to 1.7.1 I could update on source forge but there is no 1.8 repository.

Getting an account and uploading the changes would duplicate the places to find the code would it not?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
