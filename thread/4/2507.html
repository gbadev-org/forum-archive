    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone install <span style="font-weight: bold">ARM SDT 2.5</span> on Winxp?
<br/>
<br/>
I have done with my project on GCC, but  I want to compile my code on ARM SDT to see what is the different of size and speed between them. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have installed with many error. I dont' think it can be run on Winxp.
<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other version of <span style="font-weight: bold">ARM SDT</span> (Not GCC) on Winxp which it can be downloaded?  or Replacement of <span style="font-weight: bold">ARM SDT</span> (Not GCC but use <span style="font-weight: bold">ARM Co. </span>Compiler), Please give a link! 
<br/>
<br/>
thx many
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Near as I can tell, ARM doesn't offer patches for their products. If there is indeed a problem with version 2.5 on Windows XP, then you're likely out of luck should you not own a copy legally. In any case, ARM claims that the ADS replaces the SDT - you might try obtaining a copy of that. 
<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation, personally, is to forget about the issue. Using an unlicensed copy of ARM products is, of course, illegal, and the GBADev scene, as a whole, wants to err on the side of legality as best as possible. Besides, while there are minor speed benefits to ARM compilers, they're generally negligible. Certainly nothing compared to what good coding can accomplish.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No problem, you can download gcc from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html</a>.

<br/>
Sorry, had to do it... :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">SDT is several versions behind.
<br/>
<br/>
Your much better off using the latest ARM ADS 1.2 version instead.
<br/>
Bug fixes, and more features; some in particular you want for GBA dev.
<br/>
<br/>
I beleave you might be able to find an evalutation version at
<br/>
<a href="http://www.filedonkey.com" target="_blank">www.filedonkey.com</a>
<br/>
Please buy it if you use it of course.
<br/>
<br/>
IMHO the ARM ADS is a more profressional toolset then the GCC.
<br/>
Plus several public tests show the ADS complier generates on average at least 10% faster code..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree.  
<br/>
<br/>
And why not make a less expensive "lite", or "student" type version.
<br/>
It could be tailored for GBA type environments and they could take off a lot of the fluff.
<br/>
<br/>
They could take out: the Codewarrior IDE, floating point emulation, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me they would sell more product that way..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ARM don't bother to develop an el cheapo version of their devkit because you can just use GCC. Not that GCC is always as good, but there is relatively little demand for the ADS outside of people who are doing 'real' development because GCC is normally *adequate*. =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
