    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I was wondering if there is anyway I could use a "A+B+SELECT+START" kind of booting on my programs so I could boot back into EZFA menu? EZFA now has an IGF option in its writer program but it doesn't work on any of the .gba's generated with HAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Set up an ISR to generate an interrupt on pressing keys A, B, Start, and Select and then use th bios to do a soft reset.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you could check to see if all those keys are pressed every frame and use the bios call then.
<br/>
<br/>
HAM doesn't have any bios functions, but I know there is a library somewhere around here on the site that does what you want.<br/>_________________<br/>Little kids and Playstation 2's don't mix. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you dagamer, I found the library you mentioned (or I think I did), it is called SWI Libraries by Andrew P. Bilyk.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=demos&amp;filename=swi_libraries.zip" target="_blank">http://www.gbadev.org/download.php?section=demos&amp;filename=swi_libraries.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I tried calling SWI_SoftReset() , but the function seems to only freeze the GBA/game.
<br/>
<br/>
1. I added the libraries to ADD_LIBS section of the HAM makefile (had to change the .lib names with "(" and ")" because HAM doesn't like those in its makefile)
<br/>
<br/>
2. Added the include to swi.h in main.c
<br/>
<br/>
I do think now that I've compiled it incorrectly, tough I tried different approaches, because I removed the libraries from the ADD_LIBS section and I observed the same effect. Perhaps it has something to do with the renaming? Is there anything I am doing wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
