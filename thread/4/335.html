    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok i have this code:
<br/>
<br/>
	std::ifstream mapFile(fileName, std::ios::binary);
<br/>
	mapFile.read((char*)&amp;m_byMapType, 1);
<br/>
	mapFile.read(m_Sectors, sizeof m_Sectors);
<br/>
	mapFile.close();
<br/>
<br/>
in the address of m_byMapType was inserted the first Byte of the file (the id), but in the m_Sectors (array) was inserted the rest of the file. But i don't understand if is inserted the byte or the contents of the file. However i would know the array that is in the following .map file:

Can you help me to extract the array by this file and what in this string became doing: mapFile.read(m_Sectors, sizeof m_Sectors);</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How big is m_Sectors, what size is each entry etc etc  you can't expect people to know the format of an unknown map file by showing some code like that.  Then even if we knew how big the array was how does that convert to the map graphics? is it 1 entry = 1 tile?  How big (x and y) is the map suppsoed to be?
<br/>
<br/>
I've downloaded the file and looked at it and it does indeed look like a map (but it could be something else) and from the code you posted it looks like it does indeed load the 1st byte into m_byMapType and the rest of the file to m_Sectors.  Do you have the graphics which go with the map?

And PLEASE stop posting UP or Please help!! and starting other threads that just point to this one saying HELP SOMEONE!!  I'm not a moderator so It's not my place to complain but you're less likely to get help from people if every time they come to the forum there are lots of posts from you basically asking for the same thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
