    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe this is a really stupid question, but I've never been good at math... Anyway, I've got the mode7 tutorial of the Pern Project up and running but I can't help wondering how one could keep track of one's position on the background map. In other words supposing the player's feet are at (120, 160) - at the bottom of the screen in the middle - how do I work out where his feet are on the background map, so that I could check if he can step on this or that tile? 
<br/>
I do appologise for such a silly question - I have tried to work this out myself before posting this here but I really am dumb at math. :-((((<br/>_________________<br/>Guns for show, knives for a pro</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You should keep track of your critter in world coordinates.  All of your display and internal calculations should be based on these world coordinates.  You probably just need an X and a Y, maybe a Z, maybe a world number.  (Think mario.  World 3-2, etc...)
