The problem with this is once the hardware is used enough, the emulator authors will add support for it in their emulators (eg, various save methods).

Then how will casual PC users run them? Or how do you expect your games to become popular without the support of casual PC users? Do you intend to make your games something other than freeware? Are you willing to burn a cart after every build while developing and testing your game?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But who runs a file without seeing the source code on their hardware? Wouldn't people be reluctant to do that for fear of bricking? And if they do include the source, then it should be easy to take out that check.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They do this by detecting emulation errors, especially timing errors. VisualBoyAdvance has lots of them; all you have to do is run the Toast decoder (as seen in GSM Player) for one frame and see that the CPU time is much shorter (on some versions) or longer (on other versions) than on a GBA.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Wouldn't the encryption on the ds carts count as 'exotic' hardware? The thing is that if your game really was popular and there was demand, the pirates could find a way. They've cracked practically every possible uncrackable package out there, including the hardware dongles. There are thing you can do, but why? What do you gain?
<br/>
<br/>
Pokemon was the most pirated game of all time, now look at its sales. Now you're going to remove that entire market of free gamers. Word of mouth is powerful, and who is to say whether some piracy is a good thing. I for sure know that I heard of pokemon first through emulation (long before it was out in the UK).
