<br/>
Say that you can pick a sprite with the mouse and drag it around...What I would like to do is to be allowed to only drag in the direction the sprite is rotated. I believe the solution would be to create a rectangle around sprite and orient the rectangle with the sprite...but im not sure how this can be achieved.
<br/>
Could use some advice :)

Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, you'll want to create a data model.  The sprite will be the view of that model.  Attach flags like canDragLeft to the model and update them to reflect whatever you are trying to do.  Then when the player tries to drag the object left, only move it left if the canDragLeft flag is true.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
btw, I meant stylus above and not mouse :)
<br/>
<br/>
Basically what I would like to do is to create a rectangle extending forward from the sprite like in here: <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/Obstacle.html" target="_blank">http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/Obstacle.html</a>
<br/>
No movement around is necessary. Say that if the sprite is rotate 80 degrees, this rectangle should was be oriented correctly with the sprite, then you can only drag the sprite within that rectangle, the direction it is facing.

It does not matter what your pointing device is.

<br/>
In that case, just make your object move "forward" at an 80 degree angle using whatever math you are comfortable with (probably trig or matrices).  You might need a check to prevent movement if user tries to move the object backwards.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
