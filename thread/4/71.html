    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok.  I am a well-experienced programmer who knows C++, QBasic, VBasic, x86 Asm, Java and DirectX (mostly DirectDraw).  However, I am new to the GBA environment.  I am trying to learn all i can about the GBA: structure, coding techniques, how the hardware operates, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The only problem I am facing is that the documentation is so scattered from site-to-site. If someone who has the knowledge--and the time, for that matter--could IM me, so that I can get quick some answers to a few newbie-potential questions, it would be greatly appriciated.

I hope that helped you some. If there's something in particular you're looking for, don't hesitate to ask and I'll see what I can do. I'm far from a pro my self on GBA coding, but I'm far enough to feel like the pussel pieces starts to make sense.<br/>_________________<br/>"The best optimizer is between your ears..."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
