    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm running Debian woody with some upgraded unstable packages and added the debian cross gba toolchain to my system.  I have downloaded source from tutorials and other demo projects and they all seem to run fine on the boycott advance emu.  however i'm having problems compiling my own source or recompiling these tutorials/demos.  They either have compilation errors, or after compiling/linking i get just a black screen on the emu.  I've also gotten the devkitadv rpm which i ran alien on to make it a deb package and installed that.  with the same outcome. I am doing a gba game for my college senior project and i REALLY need to get this working.  Any help, suggestions would be great.  - tHe_pUnK</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
