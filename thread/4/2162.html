    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is expected. Because of the ARM pipeline that executes an instruction two cycles after it's fetched, a mov from pc actually uses the address of <span style="font-style: italic">the second instruction after</span> the instruction. This would be pc+4 in thumb mode or pc+8 in ARM mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
