<br/>
So then how does Make find arm-elf-g++.exe? Probing a bit further, I guess it's the makefile's job to copy the DEVKITARM variable into the private PATH of Make. From line 64 of C:\devkitPro\examples\gba\graphics\SimpleBGScroll\Makefile:

<br/>
But if one wants to run a quick <span style="font-weight: bold">arm-eabi-nm -n mygame.elf</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold">lsgbfs mygame.gbfs</span> to see what the big space hogs are, what is the recommended way to do this? Or is it intended that the programs in $(DEVKITARM)/bin are never run by anything but a makefile?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My needs are probably slightly different from the average user given that I could potentially be working with around 6 different toolchains at any given point. I like to avoid any chance of conflicts by never placing them in the path except when absolutely necessary. The devkitPro build system reflects this need and I do feel that it's a convention worth following.
<br/>
<br/>
For the most part I use a shell with a temporarily modified PATH when I want to use the tools independently of the build system.
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the SimpleBGScroll Makefile is from an older version of the build system where most thinsg were specified in the project makefile. A lot of this has now moved to the base_rules &amp; ds/gba_rules files distributed with devkitARM.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Impressive. As a mere user of the toolchains, I use two different toolchains (MinGW and devkitARM), both with devkitPro MSYS. They are named so as not to conflict ("gcc" goes to MinGW; "arm-eabi-gcc" goes to devkitARM).
<br/>

<br/>
I use something similar, a shortcut that puts MinGW and devkitARM at the front of the PATH and then starts cmd.exe. I understand the value of your GBA/DS build system to e.g. beginners, but one reason that I don't use your templates is that I have projects that build the Windows, GBA, and DS versions from the same source tree, and the GBA and DS makefiles may compile several custom Windows command-line tools to convert assets and generate lookup tables.
<br/>
<br/>
But based on my new understanding of the system, I'll stop recommending that beginners edit the PATH in My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; Environment Variables, except to verify their installation: make sure that PATH has MSYS near the front and that DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM are present and correct.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
