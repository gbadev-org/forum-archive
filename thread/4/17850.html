    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When you have two sources, both of them using many parts of libnds, and you #include the library in both sources, what exactly happens? I've heard including is pretty much a copy paste direction for the pre-processor, so does it paste in the library on every source file?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by MisterLogan on Fri Apr 27, 2012 8:41 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, include is like pasting a copy of the included file in the precise point you insert the include directive itself. So beware, only header files (<a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/IgqEyN" target="_blank">declarations</a>!) should be included!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yiQrz9" target="_blank">libXM7</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://bit.ly/yJwcOo" target="_blank">NDS programming tutorial (Italiano)</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://disjointedstudio.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Waimanu DS / GBA</a>|<a class="postlink" href="http://adshomebrewersdiary.blogspot.com" target="_blank">A DS Homebrewer's Diary</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Instead, like sverx is telling you, you should only #include header files, and to actually use the library, you need to link it in with your source during linking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, thanks. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you're using functions and such from two or three libnds headers, is it better to just pick out the ones you're using at the time and add them as needed, or just include nds.h? In other words, how much space does nds.h take up in a program?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nds.h takes up 0 bytes in a program because it is only declarations.  The only resource consumed by including more declarations is RAM used while compiling the program.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
