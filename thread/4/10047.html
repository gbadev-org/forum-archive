<br/>
<br/>
Tepples is your statment about memory sizes right ? I was under the impression you have less IWRAM than EWRAM. I see lots of programs trying to push nearly everything onto EWRAM because there worried about running out of IWRAM.

Anyway just thought I'd point that out<br/>_________________<br/>John Noon</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't forget that all that a lot of people have is a GBA Movie Player, and that you succeeded in your heroic attempt to get emulators working on it. But don't forget that the technique you used, a swap file on flash memory, is good only for read-only access, and a lot of programs have more than 256 KB of mutable state.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget that most C compilers don't understand the quirks of the GBA memory controller that require different write sizes in different address spaces. For example, 8-bit writes to 0x05000000 through 0x0DFFFFFF don't work properly, and 16-bit or 32-bit writes to 0x0E000000 through 0x0E00FFFF don't work properly.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
