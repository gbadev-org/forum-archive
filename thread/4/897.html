    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I read somewhere that floating point math is not good for GBA development. I have several questions (that hopefully can be answered)
<br/>
<br/>
Why is Floating point math not good?
<br/>
<br/>
Would fixed point math be a good replacement?
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be faster to use floating point math or create my own fixed point math library (coded in ASM)?
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have any helpful hints on this topic?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance (no pun intended)! I'm new here, and I hope to learn and contribute as much as I can.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Basically, it's made up of two separate words - "mank" and "ind". What do these words mean ? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a way to see my compiled code in ASM? What I mean is, can I somehow compile the code and compare what the compiled software floating point operations look like?
<br/>
<br/>
This would be helpful in comparing to fixed point math correct?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
