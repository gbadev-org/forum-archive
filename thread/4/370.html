    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whats the best way of detecting collisions when making a platform game such as Mario?...
<br/>
I tried to use tile collisions but if I use that I can?t have sloping hills and stuff...
<br/>
is it better to use "linje-collisions"...that I put lines in the memory where I cant walk and see if my player cross thatlines like

I can store my lines with 2 positions and just check if the player cross a line..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nah, just do pixel collisions (sub tile collisions).
<br/>
Eg. look at the colors inside the tile. color 0 = free, the rest=collision.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alternatively, the way I do fine-tuned 2D collisions, which is quick and easy, is to store the extents of an object for each raster of it.  Basically 2 numbers per row which describe how many pixels in from the left that row starts at and how many pixels from the right the row finishes at.  Then, when 2 collisions boxes collide, with simple addition down the height of the 2 objects you can tell if they actually overlap at all.  Okay, so for doughnut shappes, or shapes with colour 0 holes in it, it doesn't work perfectly as a collision method, but in general terms it works fine.  This is also how I properly kern my strings when I display them as sprites :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I know he wanted to do slopes and stuff, which is just as easy, and a spin-off from what I said, by processing column extents, not row extents, and hey presto, a height map to use for collision, which is how a lot of old Sega Megadrive games did their collision, on a meta-tile basis.  Then if there is too great a height distance between where you are and where you ideally will be then you get blocked.  If not, you can walk safely.  Still quicker than doing pixel checks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I m doing like this right now...I draw unvisible lines where I cant walk..like
<br/>
<br/>
                          /
<br/>
______________/
<br/>
<br/>
so if I have e.g. a square in the air I have four lines around it.. each line has two 2d coordinates..
<br/>
then I have a "line" between the players position and his old position the last frame..
<br/>
<br/>
then I just check if the player-lines intersects an other line...and if its intersect Im just moving the player like if I walk between p1 and p2 then I move the player to 'x'
<br/>
           x /
<br/>
            /\
<br/>
          /    \
<br/>
  p1--/----p2\
<br/>
      /
<br/>
<br/>
this works fine, I can have different "frictions" on the ground and slopes...but is there a better way?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
