    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No problem; check out the beginners FAQ in the Beginners forum. Since you have no programming experience you will need to get starting in learning "coding" as the GBA/DS/GB is <span style="font-weight: bold">the deep end</span>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The first thing I would do I learn alittle c/c++, I can't personally recommend any sites as I learned through books and college. Once youve got a nice understanding of that you can move onto focusing on games either GBA or DS. Im pretty sure with afew google searches you could find some simple tutorials on programming. There is also the beginners FAQ <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=6770" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=6770</a> you can check out.
<br/>
<br/>
First thing I did (im still new at this) is install devkitPro. If your using windows you can download the windows installer and its all setup for you.
<br/>
It also includes some example files.

Im sure someone else can be of more help to you, but Im not exactly in a place to give advice :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
