Write only means that you can only write to it.  You can not read from it.  The only way to get around this is to write to a location that you can read from at the same time, as tepples suggested.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to read a register that the GBA changes after you write to it, you are out of luck.  (As far as I know, at least.)
