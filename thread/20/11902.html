    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an unreliable dslite, it cuts out/freezes quite often, and playing games on it is almost impossible because of this. I was just wondering how easy/difficult it would be use one of the screens for something else, like a video display for a tv plug-in game of famiclone.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">as for the receipt thing, most retail stores can search they're database and print up a new one. but as fir using the ds screen im sure its not impossible, but you'd have to find information on what kind of input it uses, i know that gamegear screens use rgb which is useless, but im pretty sure the ds would have something more modern. try emailing one of those popular portable console creators (like ben heckendorn) for more info.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't unflash it, just use FlashMe stealth.

Here's why: In the back of every Nintendo game system's box, there is a hole for a scanner at the store to read its serial number. If your store scanned the serial number and sent it to Nintendo, then Nintendo already has your receipt. Also, Nintendo doesn't ask for a receipt in the first 12 months after a launch because all systems are under warranty by definition.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As for connecting either of them to something else, although I think I understand the theory, the practical seems a little beyond my skill.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
LCDs generally only take digital signals, so would be incompatible with normal analog RGB like from a console.  I'm less sure of this part, but I think that LCD screens of different resolutions also have different inputs, so you wouldn't even be able to easily use the DS screens for displaying video from other digital sources.  I don't know how the digital RGB signals that an LCD takes compare to HDMI and things like that.  They're definitely not directly compatible, but adapting them might not be as hard as analog-to-digital.  Or it might be harder.
