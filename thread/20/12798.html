    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now that both my CF cards are dead I bought a DS-Xtreme. When running apps it only shows the titles and icon of the homebrew roms in the list, not the filenames. So my main problem is having a bunch of "PAlib demos"'s with all the default titles and icon that are from the PAlib project template. So I can't tell what programs they are.
<br/>
<br/>
So I need a program or some other way (hex-editor?) to change the titles and possibly the icons, in linux. Is there a program to do this? It seems like a pretty simple program to write.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ndstool is bundled with devkitARM. Or are you complaining that ndstool is missing from the Linux version of devkitARM, or that the Linux version of devkitARM is missing altogether?
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the PAlib project template probably runs ndstool. You can edit the template to specify a name and icon, right?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
