    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did a search for Sonic Rush on ebay and noticed that most of the games were from Hong Kong.  Decided to also search Mario Kart DS.  There are also some from Hong Kong.  Maybe I'm behind the times, but I didn't think there were knockoffs yet.  Does anyone know what's going on? 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not asking because I want to buy them.  I'm personally very much against cheap HK knockoffs.  I don't pirate.   I would just like information on whether these really are knockoffs?
<br/>
<br/>
If they're DS pirate copies, has anyone seen them?  Do they look like real DS cartridges?
<br/>
<br/>
They don't seem to be much cheaper than buying the real version if they are pirate copies.  I've looked up a few of them and at least the supposive box art doesn't have any obvious errors from a quick look over.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's because the largest videogame shops are from Hong Kong (Lik-Sang, HKSuccess, PlayAsia.com).
<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to play pirated DS games, but you can't buy them anyhow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ATM pirate ds games would have to come on GBA cart, with a passme.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is most games are released in the East before the west and europe.
<br/>
<br/>
Games are manufactured out there so you don't pay much extra for transport (the factories like on your doorstep).
<br/>
<br/>
They get it cheaper, they can sell it cheaper and so undercut most of the other sellers.
<br/>
<br/>
Also by saying they're in HK they can jack up the shipping charges which means they pay less ebay fees.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They haven't been able to replicate DS cartridges properly, because there is some sort of old arcade encrytion on the rom that hasn't been hacked yet right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Right. Neither the DS encryption nor the CPS-2 encryption has been fully cracked.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it would be interesting to have pirate games coming out of HK, not for nintendo and that area, but because that would mean there would very likely be a whole load of blank (and cheap) DS carts floating around - with one of those, you could make homebrew DS carts (Obviously they would require to have parts of an official DS game prepended onto them, meaning they would be illegal)...but it would still be cool :D
