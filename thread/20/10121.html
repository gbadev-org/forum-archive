    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a way to bridge a fuse (F2) even though it is already bridged?
<br/>
The fuse was not working before and after bridging it, it was working. After that, I was messing around with the Power Management chip on the DS and then it stoped working. I was playing with the chip on another DS which was not bridged before. I managed to fix it by bridging the fuse (F2).
<br/>
<br/>
How would I make the other boards working again?<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'd have to figure out what the next weekest component in the circuit is.  As, the fuse is there to protect the circuit, you removed the protection by shorting (bridging) it..  So, you must have blown a component.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey shaz... do you have a multimeter that can test for continuity?   Any cheap digital multimeter should do and you can use this to check some simple components and see if they're dead.  Maybe you should start with the other fuse, F1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Playing around with the chip was fun. I found out how to change your green led of the ds to orange! Without replacing the led!!! It lookd kinda sick.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS board actually does work with the battery connected. I turns on for about 1.3 seconds which is what it should do but when I connect a lcd screen or something to the board, it does not turn on. I have turned it on and the quickly put in a lcd cable and while holding the cable, it was kinda hot. Also the led change from green to red as soon as I inserted the cable.<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise.

<br/>
If your next post contains the word battery or Direct current I'll stab you, shoot you and hang what's left on a bridge above some sharks with laser beams on their head.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah but the main reason why I was playing around with it was to get the screens brighter. I managed to get it brighter (One step more like the ds lite) and I managed to dim it to save battery. I also managed to increase the volume alot.
<br/>
<br/>
If I can get more boards, then I can do some more research and reveal all I know. I can get boards for ?20, so if anyone drops me ?20, bobs your uncle :)<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise.
