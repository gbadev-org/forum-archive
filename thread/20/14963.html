I was thinking of interesting things to port to the DS, when I thought of Defend Your Castle for the DS.  You probably would use the stylis for flinging the little stick people, which would be fun to me.  And maby you could customize your own campain if you want to if whoever would make this decides to with that feature.  I know this would require almost or complete reconstruction of the program, but that's what the person who created the flash version of Portal for the DS had to do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought that game was made as a DS homebrew, but I searched for it and couldn't find anything. I did find this similar game though: <a href="http://palib.info/forum/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2234&amp;forum=38" target="_blank">http://palib.info/forum/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2234&amp;forum=38</a>

But I still think I remember playing defend your castle (where you pick up stickmen and drop them) on the DS...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ideas are generally not lacking, but rather people who can actually code the ideas.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
