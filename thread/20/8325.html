    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok as far as the RSA encryption on the DS goes it seems nobody has figured out the private key to run homebrew on a unmodified DS. Seems like we've found every other way to run homebrew on the DS, passme flashme wifime. One thing that bothers me on wifime, when you send wifime to the DS how does it pass the RSA encryption? How can it do that when it was never signed by nintendo? Its like the only program that does that.<br/>_________________<br/>MKDS friend code-

<br/>
so theoretically if this is true, could it be possible to use the header (Mario 64's wireless boot code) to pass the RSA and make homebrew run on the DS?<br/>_________________<br/>MKDS friend code-

Ya i've heard of that somewhere on the forums. I can't see why nobody would go into in further. I "would" get it done, I have the time but... someone would have to tell me what to do... my knowledge on programing is zip.<br/>_________________<br/>MKDS friend code-

Howto make a wifime2 (afaik): 
<br/>
0. write a wmb server, that can send the multiplayer part of game + data
<br/>
1. pick game, that sends a multiplayer game+data and dump it
<br/>
2. figure out what this data is exactly (for example, a game level)
<br/>
3. figure out, how it gets loaded from the game
<br/>
4. try to find a possible buffer overflow
<br/>
5. if there is one: try to make an exploid, that runs own code (which is part of the data and then starts code from the gba slot)
<br/>
 if there is no overflow -&gt; goto 4, if there are no more parts of the data to check, goto 1
<br/>
<br/>
Thats not an easy task and can take very long if can't find a good (say: buggy) game...
<br/>
<br/>
If the DS lite has no easy way to get flashed and normal passmes won't work, this will become an interesting way to go, but as long as there are easier ways, i woudn't waste my time on that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
