Find out where it writes it's data to VRAM (gpu_write_byte?) and just re-direct the GFX to the DS's HW.

<br/>
That is reasonable, since the PSP has to render the screen, while the DS is a tiled based system.

EDIT: the main reason of current SNES emulators for DS/GBA can't run Chrono Trigger (and many more games), is simply HDMA. I believe HDMA can be emulated on the DS with proper optimizations.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not an issue. Loading the ROM into RAM is utterly stupid when you've got a cartridge slot that's plenty fast for the job. There's no reason to cater specially to people who can't buy a real flash cart. Both SNESDS and Snezziboy read the roms from the cart, so they don't have to worry about RAM.

The real issue here is clearly that SNES9x would be far too slow on the DS, and the two SNES emulators out right now are doing things the way they need to be done to achieve full speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless you want to license your emulators to licensed publishers of classics compilations. Licensed games run only from the Nintendo DS slot, which resembles a GBAMP more than anything else.

    <h4>#87821 - HyperHacker - Thu Jun 15, 2006 7:56 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I might be wrong on some of these, but here goes:
<br/>
<br/>
Chrono Trigger doesn't work because the emulator isn't developed enough yet and because it doesn't fit into memory. Possible solutions include copying parts of the ROM into VRAM (I don't think there's enough though), keeping the ROM stored on the GBA flash cart or the extra RAM of the Supercard/M3 when using those, or streaming from the CF/SD card. These should all be doable, but they only solve one of many problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Super Mario RPG is really, really unlikely to work. In addition to the ~4mhz 65816 in the SNES, the cartridge itself contains <span style="font-style: italic">another</span> 65816 running at ~10mhz (the SA-1). Currently the emulator struggles to emulate the SNES hardware alone; adding another ~10mhz CPU is not going to go over well. One thing I do wonder, though, is if the entire SA-1 or 65816 program in these games could be HLEd? I bet one of the CPUs does all the work while the other just performs simple tasks; maybe if these tasks were done by native DS code, it'd be fast enough to run.
<br/>
<br/>
Using the DS's graphics hardware to do the rendering instead of rendering everything into one bitmap is a good idea - so good that this is what the emulator does already. There is a problem, though - the SNES could override layer priority on a per-tile basis (layer X is above layer Y, but some tiles of layer Y still show above layer X), and the DS can't. You can see this problem in Super Mario World, with the scorebar going behind the background.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that the emulator's just not finished yet. There's still a lot of bugs to work out. A big one is really bad SPC700 timing (I seem to recall hearing that there's no attempt at all to keep the CPUs synched) that prevents a lot of games from running. It doesn't even work quite right in Super Mario World; there are sound bugs and the sound usually stops after a few minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
To summarize, wait until "simple" games like Super Mario World work before you expect Chrono Trigger to be playable, and don't count on Super Mario RPG running at all.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But not from within the emulator, and definitely not from within the 65C816 core. Usually the flash card writing software (for NOR cards) or the built-in menu (for CF/SD adapters) does that for you.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I guess if the ROM is embedded into the emulator, but who wants that? Then you'd have to have a copy of the emulator for each ROM.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PocketNES works with "compilations", or an entire folder of up to 31 MB of NES ROM files appended to an emulator to create a .gba file.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just hoping for compatibility with GBA Movie Player and future Nintendo DS native flash cards, which don't have the extra RAM of a SuperCard or M3, for at least ROM files smaller than 4 MB.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
