    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got my m3ds real. I put in the special m3ds real version of moonshell in 1.71v. 
<br/>
<br/>
1.Can I use the orginal moonshell on the m3ds real, not the prepatched version from m3adapter.com
<br/>
<br/>
2.The main screen has several windows. Can I close these windows, i've tried but they dont close.
<br/>
<br/>
3.Can I go back to the m3ds real interface when im finished with moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
