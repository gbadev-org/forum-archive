    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a NDSlite with a G6lite/passcard3. I don't have a wireless router, so I bought the Nintendo USB stick to play online. I followed the <span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshooting WiFi Homebrew problems</span> topic. Everything works great. I can play online games that are on my G6lite-card. (for example: mario kart, tetris)
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is I can't connect with the USB stick when I startup some homebrew. (BEUP) It's like the program doesn't see the Nintendo USB anymore. I'm aware of the Open/Shared functions on the ASUS drivers. Also tried it with WEP turned off. So, I'm out of ideas here, can anyone help me? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have tested with Buffalo Wi-Fi stick and hacked drivers.. With Wi-Fi xDSL Router. With no luck. I have spend days and days with trying to get it working. That router has WEP on. Oh, and have no problems setting up private home networks, fixing PCs, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
