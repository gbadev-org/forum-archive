    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The default setting.
<br/>
<br/>
Video rate of anything higher than 288 was shown to skip or pause.
<br/>
My friend discovered this after encoding various 16:9 / 4:3 ratio videos at multiple different rates.
<br/>
So LS5 has set the default to 288. (well, he never mentioned if it was due to my post but doubt it's a coincidence. hehe.)
<br/>
<br/>
Medium profile is the best. Unless you are leaving it to encode over night while you sleep. 
<br/>
Then High is obviously a little bit better. But it's not very noticeable. 
<br/>
Especially when it takes nearly double the amount of time to encode.
<br/>
<br/>
For the audio, I usally choose Mono/Normalize and 96kbps @ 48000hz.
<br/>
With stereo, 48000hz may not work properly and uses more space as you need to do at least 128k or higher for similar audio quality to Mono@96kbps.
<br/>
<br/>
Mono results in quicker encoding of the audio also. =)
<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
