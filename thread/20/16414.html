By modifying, if you meant adding that hardware, and somehow getting it to all work together without any problems, then sure......but I assume that isn't what you meant.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If the appropriate connections are still in the GBA slot for being able to read the GB/GBC data, then it would only require that the emulator use those connections in a way to read that data from the cartridges.

<br/>
Unfortunately, it has to be designed into the emulator, and for current emulators, that is not part of the development.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GB/GBC carts cannot be read in the GBA slot in a DS. It does not have the needed circuitry to access them. The main issue is GB/GBC carts are 5V, and GBA carts are 3.3V. It's theoretically possible to build an inexpensive hardware adapter, but nobody has done it thus far. Even if the adapter were built, you'd then need to modify the emulator to be able to support it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does that kind of control over the pins even exist in GBA mode? Do the pins for a GBA cartridge and a GBC cartridge work the same, not counting the voltage pins? It seems like in order to handle the mappers directly, you would need finer control over the hardware than the GBA hardware would let you have while running in GBA mode. So unless the pins work the same way in both modes, I don't think you'd be able to mod the card reader in the DS to read a GBC cart directly like you would like.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I also don't pretend to be an expert on how mappers work, this is just theory I'm pulling out of my rear from reading a bunch on the subject a while back.
<br/>
<br/>
Although a novel concept, it seems like this is more trouble than its worth. Props to you if you can make an adapter of course, but I wouldn't expect it to work the way you describe it.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I understand it, all the bank switching hardware is on the GB cart, so I presume the adapter would just memory map the GB cart in a way the DS could read it (including all voltage conversions, etc).  At that point the supporting emulator could live in a slot 1 device</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
