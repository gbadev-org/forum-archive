    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was searching around and can't find the answer.  Why doesn't gbfs work with gbamp?  Is this something that can be fixed or am I just SOL?  I'd really like to play the collecovision emu on my gbamp but it uses gbfs for the multi-rom menu.  Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It works if the GBFS is embedded in one of the executable binaries, so that it is loaded into memory along with the program. However a lot of programs that use GBFS append it to the NDS, which means it is accessed on the GBA cart itself, and not loaded into memory. As you may be aware, the GBAMP doesn't allow programs to access the GBA cart normally, so it doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
To fix it, you either need to get the program to load the files from the CF card or get it to access the GBFS in RAM. Either way is not easy without the source if the program hasn't been designed to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cool thanks for the info.  Pretty sure I'm SOL then because although I might be able to get my wife to email the author (she speaks french) but I doubt I would be able to implement the changes myself.  I'm still trying to learn the basics.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
