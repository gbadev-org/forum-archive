    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm new here and with Moonshell. I went to 
<br/>
<br/>
"http://mdxonline.dyndns.org/archives/2007/03/moonshell_ver171_dl.shtml"
<br/>
<br/>
and downloaded Moonshell. I open the setup and it ended normaly. It 
<br/>
went to my micro SD card. When I inserted the micro SD card in the "Super Card lite" and selected "_boot_mp.nds". It didn't work. It says "can not found moonshl folder." Yet the "moonshl" folder is in my micro SD card. Please tell me how I can make it find the folder.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Supercards and the SD cards they use can be picky.  Try patching the .nds file with SCSD.dldi first, and if that fails, retry SCLT.dldi, and if that fails use SCSD_moon.dldi
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a miniSD card that only works with SCSD_moon.dldi while the other works with both SCSD_moon and the regular SCSD one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Like I said I'm new to these things. So what's a  SCSD.dldi, SCLT.dldi and a SCSD_moon.dldi and where can I get it? Patch? How? Do I need to download a program to do so?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for asking many questions at once. ^^'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The easiest way would be to install DLDIrc.  More info can be found on the DLDI wiki at <a href="http://dldi.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://dldi.drunkencoders.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Once installed, just right-click the .nds file to patch it with the appropriate patch.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
