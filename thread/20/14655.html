of any packet capture/sniffer apps?

(For capturing anything visible

on the WiFi channels)

I googled,

but I couldn't find anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The dswifi test application has basic support for capturing packets (well, displaying them at least) and some other interesting functions.
<br/>
<br/>
But the principle problem is that the DS's hardware is limited to 2 Mbps, so unless you have authenticated to the AP (and thus forced it down to 2 Mbps), the data will be going by too fast to accurately capture.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I meant packets sent by DS,
<br/>
possibly Wii if I wanted to.
<br/>
(I might use that to capture DS Demos off the Wii,
<br/>
when that channel comes to the US.
<br/>
Is that channel available in the US, or when will it come here?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
