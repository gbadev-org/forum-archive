<br/>
-&gt; Collision system for any map of any size
<br/>
-&gt; Level system, every level is a .c file with it's images. Easy Level change. I can do as many levels as I want :D
<br/>
-&gt; Bombs that hurts the hero when exploding
<br/>
-&gt; Arrows Implemented
<br/>
-&gt; Most of the swords attacks implemented, normal, in the air and spin attack in the floor and in the air.
<br/>
-&gt; Title screen
<br/>
-&gt; Life system with hearts just like in traditional Zelda
<br/>
-&gt; Lots of sounds for the hero
<br/>
-&gt; 8 direction boomerang with a well done movement

Would you by chance be referring to the one made by MattCoz?  It used the same graphics as the one on the website.  But yeah, I remember that project as well.  Too bad his website shut down, and it's a shame he never finished it either.  I've got a couple of his demos on my home PC, so I'll upload those tonight when I get home.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, a few people have been mentioning you at ZFGC since it got reopened a couple of weeks ago, especially when they discuss old members that haven't returned.  Just thought you should know that people still remember you.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  here are the demos he released:  <a href="http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/CastleOfGanon.zip" target="_blank">http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/CastleOfGanon.zip</a>
<br/>
The controls should be pretty easy to figure out, although the wall-jumping takes a while to get used to.  Space is jump (and double jump).  As of demo 2, the Z, X, and C letters are the sword and items.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by dantheman on Fri Apr 14, 2006 10:56 pm; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Its a misconception that breaching copywrite automaticaly lets people or companys sue you. The best they can do is bully your host into stoping it being hosted.
<br/>
To sue you or to have any "real" punishment you have to be damageing their brand or profiting from it. (eg, loseing their money in some way)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, theres a difference between copywrite and trademark.
<br/>
Dont use the Zelda trademark at all.
<br/>
Put simply.

Using Link or a depiction of link is fine though. (as long as your not directly ripping an asset from the game),</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
To be sued you have to prove money was lost either directly or indirectly.
<br/>
Its not specific to this situation, its just generaly how sueing someone works.
<br/>
They could argue, purhapes, people would get this game and "enjoy zelda" and then not buy the full game. Or maybe they could say this game is so bad it damages the good name of "zelda".
<br/>
But in both case's they are tieing it to lost income to Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I agree with the above, we shouldnt be too scared of these types of copyright issues. Its mostly vapour and empty threats. The case's here are like  drawing a fanpicture or fanfiction. Minor breachs that really arnt worth mobilizeing Nintendos lawyer-armies for :p
<br/>
If you get a high google rank on a fan project though, Nintendo (or those acting on Nintendos behald) might ask the ISP to take the site down. Thats about as worse as it will get for us.
<br/>
<br/>
We should, of course be ever watchfull for true piracy though. As that very clearly does lose money for Nintendo...a company I would hope everyone here respects a lot.  One of the reasons I like this forum so much is because theres a clear and hard line between homebrew and merely running illegaly roms.

As for my spelling, ignore me, I am an idiot.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With OCR, it's more like "it's not illegal if you don't get caught, and we never expect to make money off this". There are some publishers that consistently ask for their works to be removed from sites such as OCR and vgmusic.com. See <a class="postlink" href="http://www.vgmusic.com/faq/faq-gen.shtml#PrincessBobby" target="_blank">the case of Bobby Prince</a>. Making at least a plan-B build using completely original content (or ReMixes of classical music) will make it easier to respond to cease and desist letters.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
