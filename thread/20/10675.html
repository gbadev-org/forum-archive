    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HI 0xtob,
<br/>
 i bought my DS lite 2 days ago. I had to choose between GP2X/littleGPtracker and DS/Nitrotracker....and i chosen the last one ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a musician...i make music with my GB and Nanoloop/LSDJ...and the idea to make music with my DS...eh...eh..i'm very excited.
<br/>
<br/>
These are my questions for you:
<br/>
<br/>
1)Superkey+Supercard SD (maybe the new Lite version)+SD card&gt; are these the right items to run yr soft?
<br/>
<br/>
2) As musician, i need to ask you if you want to give you  a sort of professional mood to yr work. In particular, i think this could be great to use all the power of DS hardware making not only a simple soft to make gingles when we are in train....
<br/>
as wrote on wiki page it could be great to make all the midi implementations that allow to yr soft to act as a master sequencer. Do u plan something about this? I immagine that it's hard 'cause there is the need to build a midi device too but DS lack in ext. ports so i cannot imagine how/where connect the device to DS.
<br/>
<br/>
3) I've read that Nitrotracker allow me to manage sample (resolution? 44.1khz/16bit?) or to make by myself...maybe by int. mic....but Nitrotracker is able to generate sounds as LSDJ or Nanoloop?
<br/>
<br/>
of course...i know there is a lot of work to do....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
good luck 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
;)

Hi leelinn!
<br/>
<br/>
Nice to hear you made the right decision :-) No, just kidding, I honestly don't know what I would choose myself if I had the choice. I've played around with littleGPtracker on my GP32 and it seems cool as well. The interface is pretty easy to learn even for people (like me) who have little LSDJ experience and you can get cool sounding stuff done quickly. Anyways: Please use the official <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8981" target="_blank">NitroTracker thread</a> in the future.

I'd say no, becausethe Supercard SD support in FATlib is very slow at the moment, and I don't know if FATlib will even work with the lite version of SC at all. The cards that are reported to work well, are: GBAMP CF, M3 CF, M3 SD, M3 miniSD(v1!), SuperCard CF. This may change in the future, I'm only talking about the current state here. I just updated the <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net/index.php?cat_id=4#requirements" target="_blank">compatibility list</a> to the current state.
<br/>
<br/>
For running DS code from the GBA slot, you can probably go with any NoPass device.

Well, there's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.collinmeyermusic.com/dev/index.html/2" target="_blank">DSMIDI</a>. I wonder if this guy would sell these devices. If I could get one of these, I would probably try to integrate MIDI into NitroTracker.

<br/>
Yes, samples can have arbitrary sampling rates (even 48khz should load) and can be 8 bit or 16 bit. The mixing rate of the DS is somewhat lower though (32khz I think).
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, NitroTracker is not able to use the DS's programmable sound generator. It's in my long term list, but I'd either have to abuse the XM format or create a new format that would be incompatible with everything else. Also, the DS only has pulse wave and noise generators, so you won't have as much possibilities in terms of (hardware) chip sound as on the Game Boy.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck getting your equipment ready! I hope for your support in terms of feature requests and bug reports!
<br/>
<br/>
Bye!
