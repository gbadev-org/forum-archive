    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, i'm looking for something that'll open word documents with images inside them, or do the same thing with html files.  I have a bunch of tutorials, guides, etc that I really want to put on my ds for reading without having to sit at my computer.
<br/>
<br/>
  ideally, maybe some kind of pdf viewer that uses the ram expansion or something would be the best, but I'm just looking for something that will show you text and pictures together on the same page.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For rendering (X)HTML files theres also the DSLibris available. Features:
<br/>
<ul><li>antialiased, proportional text
<br/>
</li><li>UTF-8, so both eastern and western languages are honored
<br/>
</li><li>auto-scan for multiple XHTML files stored on your mediaâ€™s root
<br/>
</li><li>power-save upon closing the DS lid
<br/>
</li><li>restoration of latest book and page on restart
<br/>
</li><li>brightness control on DS Lites (simple toggle on/off on DS Phat)</li></ul>
<br/>
The only problem: DSLibris likes to crash instantly, if the selected file isn't valid coded XHTML.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bunjalloo can open locally-stored HTML files I believe, though its image support may not be what you're looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
My solution for something like this would be to install Paperless Printer on your computer (assuming you're running Windows) and print your document to a series of JPEG images through it.  From there, convert them to ComicBookDS format to view them on the DS.  This would at least preserve page layout, though reading paragraphs of text might be difficult.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">k, well i've have bunjalloo and dsorganize, and both are great and i use them a lot, but as far as what i'm trying to do at the moment, neither of them work for that.

  i'm having an issue running dslibris..i'm going to try an earlier version, i think i have the latest, but it keeps giving me "guru meditation error" once it loads and i hit a button... i have no idea what's going on here, so if anyone has any ideas, it'd be greatly appreciated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i dont think this would work..i've given it some thought and have played with this in the past for other things, and blocks of text just dont show up readable enough for me
<br/>
<br/>
i was able to finally get dslibris working(downloaded a different version, i think i had an old one), and created a couple xhtml files and got it to work...it was kind of a pain converting pdfs to xhtml, and i still dont have images...this is still a good step forward, because i like the interface a lot more than moonshell's text viewer...so as far as txt ebooks go, i think i'm going to convert them all to xhtml and read with this

oh well, i guess if i want handheld pdf files i'll have to buy a palm or a psp :P ...right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
