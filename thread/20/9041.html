    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a request
<br/>
<br/>
and I don't know where to put this.
<br/>
<br/>
can some one who has more experience programming for ds make a wifime app "rom" that runs on a flashed or passed ds to send a flashme to another ds? is this possible yet? because my computer will not run a wifime nor an emulator to run my code so I have no clue if anything works, even simple things
<br/>
<br/>
ps i've been programming gba for a very little while so</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for replying i barely switched from gba to ds so i have to refresh on the basics. I think i should have a blue screen on top and a black screen on bottom but no way of telling yet. 
<br/>
<br/>
whisper from a noob: i never even got the chance to create a multiboot for the gba before i had to start school. and now people are going to start wanting ds homebrew rather than gba homebrew. just when i was about to stop being a newbi i was draged back in:((</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
