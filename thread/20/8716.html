<br/>
NOOOOO!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm excited to see what Moonlight will achieve next, with the burden of Moonshell slightly relieved.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
<br/>
So far, not much is different from the beta...
<br/>
The Jpeg bug is still present, and image viewing still causes the top screen to go blank :(
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can fix this myself using old JPG code that worked...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, video synchronization works fine, except when I skip ahead in the video -- then it goes way off :(
<br/>
<br/>
The debug text is still there when I press Start - isn't this usually removed in final releases?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Just use the defaul one for audio (that "use mencoder.exe...").
<br/>
<br/>
You should select the setting manually because one-4-all settings does not exist. It really much depends on the video souce (animation/real_video and the framerate).
<br/>
If you are trying to encode real video, then maybe you could make a small video clip and start to test with high settings and lower them if video playback skips a lot.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quick update on my mindless fumbling with the JPG plugin:
<br/>
After comparing sources between 0.9999's jpg handling and the JPG plugin in Moonshell 1.0, I see that the use of the decoder is quite different...
<br/>
<br/>
I have found (through the console text... okay, I agree; the console is always useful!) that the error is in rbsDecodeHuffman (most likely in the functions that it is calling), and I am going to see what happens if I swap a few bits of code.
<br/>
This will probably end in disaster, but it's worth a shot :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Well, there are a few things that could be put in ;)
<br/>
<br/>
-Text editor
<br/>
-Bookmarks for the text reader..ala ebook
<br/>
-Mp3 streaming once tcp/ip in sgstair's wifi lib is complete. (winamp radio plugins anyone?)
<br/>
-MoonShell Web Browser. ;)
<br/>
-Compact Flash/SD Card writing (
<br/>
-In-program configuration
<br/>
-Better User Interface (the play control could use buttons with icons for instance ;) )
<br/>
<br/>
there's tons of ways to improve MoonShell and turn it into a stellar application. What you're saying is that it already is stellar, which I completely agree with. But, there are still some more things I would love for MoonShell to be able to do.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

The audio synchronization when playing large DPG files has definietly become worse... While watching a video, the audio became (almost suddenly) at least 5 seconds offset from the video after a bit of watching. It had been fine for about 10 minutes before. This definietly isn't a problem with the encoder or the original video file.
<br/>
It also appears that skip frame and pause will only make the audio synchronization worse rather than better :(<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Put your files into folders ;)
<br/>
<br/>
This is probably a hardcoded limit in MoonShell, since it needs to scan the entire directory and remember all the files in there for it to alphabetise them. Try compiling the source yourself and increase this limit.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

What.. 255 ..now that's a lot of files. I'm also thinking that you should put your files to folders. I personally have all my MP3s in folders alphabetically ordered.

Thank You!!!!!

That was quite cool, being able to completely change Moonshell with that one little file.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it isn't displaying any file information, and there is no progress bar. This doesn't really matter, but is probably easily fixed if you ever feel like it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is the top screen is going blank when viewing images because of something in Moonshell itself (and not the plugins)?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Disregard my comments about audio sync issues. The video I was running was being changed from 25 FPS to 24 FPS, which (according to VirtualDub) can result in syncronization problems. I am going to try playing around with different ways of converting the frame rate to see what can be done.
<br/>
Perhaps this is a deficiency in DPGEnc?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

from that point on all my videos shows without skipping, i was very happy as it greatlyly simplified the process of conversion, knowing whatever i converts will work, it's just a matter on PC side settings</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to give Moonlight my deepest thanks for this great program. I was a bit worried about a few bugs in audio playback that crept up somewhere around version .992 and got worse with .999test2nocnt, but have been rectified in the wonderful version 1.0. I would have mentioned something earlier (actually I did mention one of my .mod files stopped working with version .992), but each time I checked back there was a new version and I did not get a chance to do a whole lot of extensive testing with a lot of them. I'm just glad that it's back to being rock-solid again. And soon enough, I will have a Supercard SD to use this on besides just my GBAMP. Thank you so much Moonlight! :D<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

OK, I seem to have problems with audio and video sync with Moonshell. I am using the default setting for the video encoder.   The audio seems to be in sync until I fast forward and then it is out of sync.  I'm sure it has to do with some setting that I should adjust. 
<br/>
<br/>
Which audio setting do you all recommend such mencoder, ffmpeg. etc. when encoding?
<br/>
<br/>
What is a good happy medium video bitrate and framerate to use when encoding? 
<br/>
<br/>
Does it help to have the video and audio bitrate the same?

It's a lot worse in older versions of MoonShell, which means his Interpolation is working for some of it. It probably just ignores the higher frequencies after a certain point, I seem to remember old versions of of Modplug Player doing the same thing. It's probably fixable. Then again, maybe not. Most Nintendo DS games have this problem.. it's not a big deal, really.  It might also be a hardware limitation of the DS's soundchip..

Hmmm... GBA and Nintendo DS use a pulse width modulation digital to analog converter (PWM DAC), and the GBA had best results when the sample rate was synchronized to the PWM frequency. So what happens when I make a sweep at the native sampling rate of the playback hardware? MPEG audio doesn't support that rate, so I'll have to use something in an Ogg container.

So do you still think it's a problem with Moonshell (or the MP3 plugin itself) or with the DS's sound chip?
<br/>
<br/>
I did notice I was getting some garbled audio in a few songs, but it only seemed to happen once. It may have been the order in which I had opened files or something strange. But most of my audio sounds great. The only thing that seems to be a little off are some of the instruments in my trackers (like flutes in particular) seem to get pops in them where they aren't present if I record the song to linear and encode it as a MP3. But this has been present for a while, so I haven't been too concerned nor picky about it.
<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you that I am very impressed by the ability for Moonshell to randomly play different file types in the same folder now. I know it could do it before sequentially, but now random play works just as well. Even more impressive is that they files are handled by different plugins and work seamlessly. And I really love that random play won't repeat a song until all others have played. That's a great feature. As is the Flexible shoulder mode. I am very happy with Moonshell 1.0 as a whole. Thanks again, Moonlight!<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did a little bit of fine-tuning of my encoding methods, and it turns out that 32640 Hz is the best rate I could find for .ogg playback in MoonShell 1.0. With sine sweeps, which are more demanding than any practical audio signal at plucking out frequency aliasing, I get at least 24 dB signal-to-alias ratio at that rate, though it actually varies from playback to playback. I'm seriously thinking the PWM DAC is the culprit; a given playback might reset the audio channel at different points in the DAC's cycle, and MoonShell seems to be performing an 8x linear upsample.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I noticed is that files at all rates play back a fraction of a percent faster than the header indicates (e.g. 32640 Hz file plays back at closer to 32768 Hz).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yes DVD Decrypter can do this...you have to use IFO mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I figured I'd point out MoonLight has made a different plug-in (based on Game Music Emulator...haven't heard of that program though)for NSF and GBS music...it sounds quite a bit nicer and better than the old NSF player. :)  Has a nice stereo effect also.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Oops, actually I guess it's a version of MoonShell with this new capability built in.  I think it uses the ARM7 as well as ARM9, so that's probably why it's built in like DPG (although this is just a guess...it could use the ARM7 for some of the extra sound chips some NES games have).  Anyway, sounds great.  FYI, it splits NSFs into seperate tracks in the file list, so you may want to stick them in their own folder.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit two*
<br/>
It seems it breaks DPGs, so save the regular 1.0 version to use with DPGs, at least for now.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by The 9th Sage on Sun Mar 05, 2006 5:06 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

How it would work is that the first 14 channels would be played through Nintendo DS hardware channels, and the last 10 channels would be software processed and put out on NDS Channel 15 and 16 (for Left and Right).
<br/>
<br/>
a PSF player of sort would not be an actual Playstation sound emulator, but an actual interpretor that would wrap the samples from the music to an in-program engine that would play it back. Someone could use an existing MoonShell plugin sound core to do the heavy stuff.. Like, maybe adapting Mikmod of some sorts. :D

Wow, 5 Mpix.. have you tested bigger ones, like 7Mpix?

<br/>
Yes, Moonlight is working hard with MoonShell and it's plugins. Maybe he loves it as much as we love him for his work. ;)

MoonShell is awesome mediaplayer update for the NDS. Other companies are also planning on incorporating Moonshell to their adapters (not only M3/G6 dev team)!<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

If it's the most recent release of the Midi plug-in, make sure you include the updated version of MoonShell that supports that plug-in.  It seems to be an MSP (MoonShell Plug-in) 2.0...something new in the format must be.  All the other plug-ins still work with this version (I tested 'em to make certain), and on the plus side it includes the GME NSF/GBS player and DPG works even (the last release with GME in it would seem to have broken DPG).
<br/>

You use mencoder to make a gsm.wav file and an .mpg file. 
<br/>
You use juhees headermaker to make the header.
<br/>
Cat them together (header gsm.wav .mpg) and there you go.
<br/>
That's how i do the because DPGenc is for windows, and i use mac/linux.

Sure there's plugin support now, but if he's gotta make proprietary versions of MoonShell for some plugins to even work, then it's redundant, and proves MoonShell is not fully complete.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think he should keep updating the plugin interface. Maybe add general plugins and DSP plugins and the like, like WinAmp contains.
<br/>
<br/>
However, correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't seen anyone but MoonLight MAKE any plugins for MoonShell, yet. Is anyone even trying to expand it?
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I love about Nintendo handheld systems and older systems is doing something on the system that people didn't think could be done. Of course, it takes a while to do, and there's not many out there who actually try to push the bar. That's something I respect about MoonLight, he keeps trying to make the DS do things it's not really supposed to do, it's making homebrew better because of it.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I bet that MoonShell v1.0 will be updated with that release eventually.  It'd make sense with the internals of MoonShell being updated somewhat (NSF and GBS stuff and the MSP 2.0 thing).  Maybe after he's done with the MIDI plug-in...it seems like it's being updated a lot still. :)  From what I've seen on how he works, he probably wants to work all the kinks out of this stuff.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do not think that there is a problem in remodeling.

MoonShell is GPL.

Everyone can freely remodel it.

If the source code is open to web, it is possible to upload/sell it.

The code used with the DPG player is GPL.

If DPG and GME are detached, it is likely to be able to upload/sell it by closed source.

I am sincerely wishing the announcement of improved MoonShell.

<br/>
MSPV20 only corresponds to a dynamic loading of the plug-in outside file.

Anything has not changed excluding this.

Just drop the plug-in's *.msp file into shell/plugin, along with the smid.bin file (that's all the instruments, so it's VERY important you put that in there).  Replace you regular MoonShell v1.0 with the mshl10_mspv20.nds from the file.

Have you tried launching it with Start?  I think I remember having this once (MoonShell trying to load from EXFS) when I started it with A...probably some aftereffect of the M3 loading MoonShell into internal RAM.  I have an M3 CF, but I'm willing to bet it'd have the same behaviour on the M3 SD.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is anyone else having trouble compiling Moonshell?
<br/>
<br/>
The filepath has no spaces in it, I have devkitPro along with devkitArm and libnds, but it doesn't want to work.
<br/>
<br/>
It goes fine for the first bit... with a few warning messages... nothing that stops it, though.
<br/>
Then, when it starts linking, I get hundreds of errors in plug_gmegbs.cpp with undefined reference to 'Effects_Buffer::config_t::config_t()'.

I have run the DevKitPro Updater, but to no avail.

Is anyone else having trouble compiling Moonshell?

The filepath has no spaces in it, I have devkitPro along with devkitArm and libnds, but it doesn't want to work.
<br/>
<br/>
It goes fine for the first bit... with a few warning messages... nothing that stops it, though.
<br/>
Then, when it starts linking, I get hundreds of errors in plug_gmegbs.cpp with undefined reference to 'Effects_Buffer::config_t::config_t()'.

I have run the DevKitPro Updater, but to no avail.

I had the same problem, it is not DKP that has the problem, this seems to be a case where the include file that contains the def of Effects_Buffer (I named the header file in my previous post) isnt being shared properly.

I wish moonshell was still around to explain why it compiled for him and not for a mere mortal like myself :P - I have to assume that the source he gives us is not what he used to compile it for the official build, or that he compiled it and did not do a make clean and recompile it after making changes.
<br/>

Also, I note that the current source on his site is not the origional 1.0final source that did build fine for me.

Are you suggesting MoonShell save state saving? That'd be kinda cool

Anyway, I'm still working on my soundbank, people. It's much smaller than the one MoonLight's using and it sounds better, in my opinion. It's about 4 megs so far. Here's a test mp3:

If you know anything about digital signal processing, you could reduce the size of the file by implementing a recursive comb filter as a synthesis tool and then procedurally synthesizing those samples needed for a given MIDI file before playing the file.

That's actually fairly similar to the filter cutoff/resonance that Impulse Tracker/SoundFonts in general can utilize.. The biggest problem is, I would assume that MoonLight isn't actually doing any heavy work when it comes to playback of actual General MIDI files and it's soundbanks, he's simply porting a program that's doing the "hard stuff" for him, and allowing the playback from its wave output to play in real time through the DS's audio. So I guess the biggest question is, does Timidity itself support such effects?
<br/>
<br/>
Though I'm not denying that I'd absolutely love an ADSR for filters support the same way soundfonts can utilize them, but my soundfont is pretty much designed to do all that stuff through samples, it's going to be 100% compatible by avoiding the advanced features that the SF2 format can use, so that when it's converted to GUS Patches, there generally won't be as many problems. Also as far as I know, those effects are unsupported by GUS patches, unfortunately. Unsf could probably support the special GUS patches with the effects, but I don't know if it's modified Timidity plays back the effects itself.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I question on the sound font.
<br/>
<br/>
Because the loop noise is generated, the loss-less compression is necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
The ZLIB compression has compressed 52MB into 41MB.
<br/>
It is four seconds in the start of the reproduction.
<br/>
It hangs for 12 seconds when it is ZLIB compression.
<br/>
<br/>
In the expectation, when the TTA(The True Audio) compression is used, it is about 36MB. (rough 
<br/>
estimate)
<br/>
However, it is likely to hang in the start of the reproduction for 30 seconds. (The badness : for as much as one minute. )
<br/>
<br/>
A different approach is to decrease the number of sound font tones.
<br/>
<br/>
The tone in accordance with SC-88PRO is adopted of The High quality version sound font file.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, the following drum map is deleted.
<br/>
<br/>
DrumMap 9 010-HIP-HOP
<br/>
DrumMap 10 011-JUNGLE
<br/>
DrumMap 11 012-TECHNO
<br/>
DrumMap 27 028-CR-78
<br/>
DrumMap 28 029-TR-606
<br/>
DrumMap 29 030-TR-707
<br/>
DrumMap 30 031-TR-909
<br/>
DrumMap 53 054-CYMBAL&amp;CLAPS
<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to decrease to 30MB by deleting these. (trial calculation of no compression)
<br/>
<br/>
It is troublesome to prepare a lot of sound fonts.
<br/>
I want to adopt the sound font with a lot of demands.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, high quality version GM tones are 8MB.

I will see if adding the other fixes it.

Edit: perfect MoonShell, thank you!

changing it to this worked perfectly:

<br/>
Can Moonshell support compressed files or not, at least text or .TXT files? I have many ebooks to read. So if Moonshell can support compressed files ==&gt; this great homebrew will be much more wonderful.
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No one's stopping you from adding the ability, though. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I mean: i have readme.txt for example, then i compress to readme.zip; we still can read readme.zip on Moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
At first, I think Moonshell just can support 1 TXT file in a compressed file and this file will be extracted into RAM. Maybe, now, the TXT file just is around 1.5 Megabytes.
<br/>
<br/>
That's just my idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

If I'm not mistaken, it's the ability to have the plug-in dynamicly load stuff from a file (or files I'd assume) off of the compact flash card like the MIDI plug-in does.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically the new plugin system allows the loading and releasing of samples into, and out of memory on a needed basis. This helps it so that you can probably load up to 2 megs (or more, i don't know for sure) of samples at a time when the MIDI file actually calls for the sample's use. I guess in English, this allows you to play music with higher quality samples without having to load your entire sample library into memory. A very nifty feature indeed.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what benefit it would have for other plugins, though I guess it would definately open the way to play back more complex music formats in the future as well. Perhaps it could be utilized for ..who knows, future website viewing should someone decide to write a "MoonShell Browser" html viewer? :) Oh man that would be completely awesome.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
