    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there, I'm just wondering a few things about the program Moonshell and its mp3 playback.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you load playlists in the program... and will it play them through continually?
<br/>
<br/>
Can you create playlists by selecting individual songs or albums?
<br/>
<br/>
Can you save playlists? 
<br/>
<br/>
Can you play streaming media (a la Shoutcast, .pls) from moonshell?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.  :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It supports less formats then moonshell, but those that it does support, does a heck of a lot more with.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know this is silly, but I've noticed this quite a few times and it's bugging me. DarkFlame, you keep saying DSorganiser when it's just DSorganize. I know, 1 letter, woop dee doo, bu t someone might not be able to find "DSorganiser" on google because it doesn't exist.  Oh, and it's a z and not an s :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It makes more gramatical sense, however.
<br/>
<br/>
The same way I dont say "Sonic Advance" I say "Sonic AdvanceD".
<br/>
It just flows better. (the other option is they could call it "Sonic, Advance!" which would be like your commanding him to run forward :p)
<br/>
<br/>
In some case's it really piss's me off, in fact.
<br/>
eg, the god awfull film called  "Shark Tale", its just begging for an S on that title. (Shark<span style="font-style: italic">s</span>) sounds much better.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, you are right about google, so ill try to stop.

Honestly, why people would think the music would play on the speakers when the lid is closed is beyond me. Acoustics, anyone?
