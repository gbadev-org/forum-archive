    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if anyone has been able to figure this out and get the saving to work for nesDS on the m3 / R4s.  I figured this would have been a no brainer, but I haven't heard of any updates or if nesDS is DLDI ready yet.  Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got it working just fine with my R4 last night actually. I had found that saves didn't seem to work when these requirements weren't met:
<br/>
<br/>
1- Delete any previous nesDS.sav file you may have on your DS
<br/>
2- Patch with dldi patcher, and not the automatic one through firmware

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you have an older sav file when you installed it? I did and it wouldn't save until I figured out I had to delete it and let my R4 make a new one :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Last time I used it, it would randomly silently fail to save even on GBAMP. That was a while ago though so maybe it's been fixed.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
