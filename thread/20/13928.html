It is possible. 
<br/>
Will it be ever implemented? You should rather ask GnM developers. Do they read this forum? I have no idea, but i wouldn't count on it.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

Asking for what to have skin support? The GnM's own menu, or some homebrew program?

You are asking a bunch of people that code homebrew for the DS to modify a loader on a closed source card.  We are not the people that can help you here.  If you want to see a feature on a specific card, the people you should contact are the people that make the card.  What you are doing here is akin to asking an independent film production studio to change the font on the DVD player you use because their movies play on your device.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here are your options:
<br/>
<br/>
A:  Write your own DLDI bootloader, name it bootme.nds, and use it.  Add whatever features you want, but you've got to be a good programmer, which takes some learning.
<br/>
<br/>
B:  Ask Datel, but seeing how responsive they are, you won't ever hear back from them, so it's quite pointless.
<br/>
<br/>
C:  Use DSOrganize, it has a nicer interface than the GnM menu anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
D:  Get an R4/M3DS if you're that concerned.
<br/>
<br/>
Point is, skin support isn't super important, all it needs to do is boot your files correctly.  IF I get booting working in DSFile2, you could use that, but the interface isn't as refined as the GnM menu.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They didn't get MMD to play roms, and they wouldn't want their device playing illegal filth anyways.  ROMS just interfere with the homebrew community, bringing us down because the devices homebrew runs on can be used for software piracy.  If you support software piracy, you are yourself a pirate, a criminal, and belong in prison.  Else, you hate piracy and support homebrew, which is what these forums are for.  The Games n' Music isn't going to fall into that hole in the MMD, Datel doesn't want either of their products to play illegal files, which would render them illegal, and they wouldn't be able to sell them in stores.

As for the RAM GnM, sounds interesting, and if I didn't spend my money on a GnM already, I'd want to buy it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just a question about the GnM rom itself.   I own the GnM and Just recently dumped its rom. ( dont bother with ragging on me for piracy cause I dont use pirate software) I have both the Gnm and GBAMP not the best HW for that crap anyways. 
<br/>
<br/>
back to my question. does a compay like Datel hold the same rights to a rom that Nintendo has. or is it okay to tear apart the GnM rom?
<br/>
<br/>
I just cant stand seeing that STUPID SPLASH SCREEN every time i boot DSO.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S 
<br/>
just for info. its kinda weird that the rom is called <span style="font-weight: bold">ASMA-0.NDS</span> and is 16MB (128mb) but is empty. could it just be encrypted.

<br/>
<br/>
I thought we already hashed that out in another topic, either on this forum or on That Other Forum. GBA Movie Player and MAX Media Dock are both CompactFlash adapters. Now CompactFlash is just (parallel) ATA in a different form factor, and all ATA controllers have to have the same registers. GBAMP just happens to use the most obvious way of laying out these registers in GBA ROM address space, and it's more than likely that the MMD's design was conceived independently.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
