    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you downloaded the video from youtube and the extension is .swf, then you downloaded the wrong file. It should be a .flv file. If you're having trouble with .flv files, I would ask if you have BatchDPG installed correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're trying to comvert an actual .swf file, the kind that will play in your browser, then you can't do that in BatchDPG. You'll need some other program to record the .swf file into an actual video file.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Can you recommend any program for Windows available for download over the Internet at no charge that will do this? QuickTime Pro will, and I used it to convert the "We Drink Ritalin" video for use with StepMania, but that's $30 and won't work with newer versions of SWF.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You might try <a class="postlink" href="http://videohelp.com" target="_blank">http://videohelp.com</a> though, they list tons of free tools that aren't ever found on google because of the amount of advertisement spent on those annoying 30-second limit watermark tutorial programs.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
