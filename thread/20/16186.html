    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I might make a DS Forth later, which would be less retarded than DS BASIC. I don't know when I have time (right now I work more on <a class="postlink" href="http://zzo38computer.cjb.net/vonkeror/" target="_blank">Vonkeror</a>) but when I do it is good. Forth interpreter is simple it shouldn't take much time to write that. Just based on DS BASIC but make it Forth instead, with full-screen editor and control without using a stylus (in case you lost it or whatever). Do you know if you are interested in this project?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
