Talking about strategic games, Chinese chess would also be cool. It's called XiangQi.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Chinese chess is also very good. (Although I am not very good at it)

Both normal 2player Shogi and Tsume Shogi (similar to chess problems, but you have to check every turn) is good<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could totally see a PC-interface (be it an online JavaApplet, or an offline client) so that we could play against PC players as well. If there was a lobbying system for all DS homebrew games to use, then we could also interface to that and connect to each other.
