<br/>
Otherwise, good luck converting all that x86 assembly.

What are you trying to port anyway?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">there are a lot of games i'd like to see ported.. i wish i could learn to do that.. infact maybe i will. i used to code a little back in my c=64/amiga days.. been forever.. (yes - i'm old[er]) i also heard it was easier to port from amiga than pc/dos. i don't know if that's true or why that would be but..
<br/>
<br/>
some of the games i dug was cinemaware games.. it came from the desert, king of chicago, wings.. and defender of the crown..
<br/>
<br/>
i tried looking for source code for cinemaware games.. don't know how that will go i'll keep looking, but i found a list of "players" from all different platforms, programs, games etc.. with each amiga compressed file was a compressed file containing source for that player.. i don't know if it will help.. but it's still kinda cool.. here's a few i thought were interesting..
<br/>

Sierra AGI player (v1.0 &amp; v2.0 AMP)
