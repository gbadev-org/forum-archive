Well certainly. Given infinite time, anyone can do anything physically possible. Trivial and also irrelevant.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that Opera can't download. So port wget. 
<br/>
<br/>
But today, people expect of a web browser to do frames, tables, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, Java... Just think of all the forum posts bitching that Opera can't do Java on the DS, and the Opera folks have ages of experience with building web browsers on many platforms. If you can't (sorry -- lack the time to) do all of that right, you will get more trouble than thanks from the homebrew community.
<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: Forget it &amp; use Opera instead.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for the Opera thing, I'm pretty sure Opera did not code the DS web browser, but Nintendo did. I read somewhere when they were talking a bout the wii browser that Opera sells some kind of platform porting development kit, you buy that and then program the browser yourself with the engine.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-It's closed-source, proprietary, and costs money.

-It requires a RAM expansion and is compatible only with a proprietary expansion card, so even if you have an M3 or such already, you have to carry this second expansion card just for Opera.
<br/>
-It lacks features like downloading, and can't be expanded (see #1).
<br/>
-It has to be imported in some places, and can't be translated (see #1).

DSO's browser works nicely for an alpha, even on my GBAMP. Of course people will complain that Youtube doesn't work and this Java program won't run and blah blah blah... they should take a look at the DS's specs and consider buying a laptop or PDA.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah I have the Opera Browser for the DS and it costed me about $55 dollars! I rather sell it in my city (for like $70) and buy myself an M3 Perfect (yayyyyyy). I think Gnirfleo is going to work and be a popular homebrew web browser. But then again, Dragonminded is catching up... and is 2x more reliable aswell.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSLinux is still text-only with no GUI (though I guess nanoX might count for something) but it's really not that hard to use.  If you download the "Ultimate Wifi script" all you have to do is type "wifi -&lt;options&gt;" to do a number of things with wifi, from automatically setting up your configuration file to connecting with the default config file to scanning and automatically connecting to an AP via DHCP.  Then just type Retawq and you're good to go.  
<br/>
<br/>
So the steps you would need to do to get Retawq working:
<br/>
1.  Download and extract the DSLinux files, copying them over to your card (linux folder has to be in root, dslinux.nds can be anywhere).  Make sure you use a program like 7zip, not Winzip, as there are a few empty folders (like Home) that need to be present, but some extractors will remove empty folders.
<br/>
2.  Grab the wifi script from <a href="http://dannysied.googlepages.com/DSLinux_addons.zip" target="_blank">http://dannysied.googlepages.com/DSLinux_addons.zip</a> (original source link is down) and place it in /linux/usr/bin
<br/>
3.  Boot DSLinux and login if necessary.  
<br/>
4.  Type "wifi -setup" to setup your wifi profile.
<br/>
5.  Type "wifi -d" to start the wirless network with the profile you just setup.
<br/>
6.  Once the power light starts blinking rapidly to indicate a successfull connection, type Retawq and hit Enter (or the A button).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Although yep, the OS itself could really use a menu-driven interface. I have been slowly building one myself using Dialog and a shell script, but it's taking a while partly because I am learning shell scripting as I go and mostly because I am writing / testing it straight within DSLinux. Just if any enterprising fellow happens to be reading this debate again: Feel free to try making an interface with Dialog :)
<br/>
<br/>
A nice update has just come about for the DSO alpha. Nothing particularly new, but there are some good fixes. It's much more reliable now!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The sad part about this is that one of these more fancy web browsers will finally be released, people will download it onto their DS via the PC's web browser, then have no idea why they wanted it in the first place.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

This is when I feel really bad about having sshd working on DSLinux and not submitting a patch yet.  Dev goes a lot quicker when you can use a proper keyboard instead of stabbing at a screen.  Another idea would be to get dialog on your pc and test there first.  Also I ported a smaller menu app called replimenu.  It's a lot simpler than dialog and much smaller.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's something here that I simply cannot understand. Is this an objective pool? If it is, it should include a "Yes" option of any kind, don't you think? So far, the only options I see on it is "No", "No way", "No fucking way", "I love [commercial webbrowser]", "I love [unfinished h/b 1]", "I love [unfinished h/b 2]", ""I love [unfinished/fake????? h/b 3]", and "post your inane comments"...
<br/>
<br/>
(I believe I listed an extra option... I forgot which :D )
<br/>
<br/>
And, quite frankly, I wanted to say "Yes", a simple &amp; plain "Yes", even if that "Yes" is not one of the known web browser projects...

Currently it needs inetd, which I've submitted a patch for but it hasn't been accepted yet.  Also it requires some changes in /dev, and the way I've done it probably isn't the best.  I've tried compiling sshd standalone but somethings not working properly (forking I think).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm guessing that the "recent version" you're referring to is the fairly recent release of the DLDI version, which allows it to access the filesystems of most DLDI-enabled devices.  Unfortunately, it won't boot at all on some devices like the Supercard DS.  Either way, Retawq is packaged with it, and as far as I know it should still work on a slot-1 card or other non-RAM-enabled device.   Basically, the DLDI version actually allowed Retawq to be used on some devices it never could be used on before, as previously these users would be restricted to the WMB build that does not have Retawq included.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
