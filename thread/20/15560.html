    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I don't currently have a wireless network at home, no need as got all 3 pc's in the same room and no laptop. But with all the crazy capabilities of the DS using WIFI I'm looking to buy a wireless router, and I was just wondering if any wireless router will be compatible with the ds wifi or if I need to get a specific type?
<br/>
<br/>
For instance would this work? Dynex? - Wireless-G Broadband Router
<br/>
Model: DX-WGRTR
<br/>
It's the cheapest available from bestbuy. :P
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways thanks for the help.

I googled for that router, and it should work with the DS.(It has WEP and 802.11b. A router must have WEP &amp; 802.11b to work with DS)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

802.11G routers generally have a setting to switch modes between "B only", "G only", and "mixed" (which is the default).  If you have it set for "G only", it will not work with a DS; otherwise you should be fine.<br/>_________________<br/>#include &lt;sig.h&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I have a Netgear WGR614 v6. I had it set to B-only until I got my Wii, when I noticed that channels were taking a long time to downloaded. So I changed it to B/G, and it sped up Wii downloads while still letting the DS work.
