    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">after looking for the right forum to put this topic in.. i jsut decided this one was the one for it..........
<br/>
<br/>
alright... i have about $250 and i am very interested in this whole DS "modding" thing..... I bought my DS the first day and i have the GBA movie player version 2 and a 256mb compact flash card.... i've been wanting to play the demos that are given out by people and i also want to play the games and progams that other people have been making for DS(such as the calculator and the demos from E3 and Linux).  Also, if possible, i would like to be able to play downlaoded DS games and such.  
<br/>
<br/>
Can somebody plz make a list of things that i will need that will give me good quality but stay under a 250 dollar budget?  Yah, i know I'm a TOTAL newb so please help me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You just need a V1 passme which is about $15.
<br/>

<br/>
Then you can play a lot of the DS homebrew out there.
<br/>
However E3 demo's don't work (incorrect setting of power bit or something on the GBAMP) niether will hexenDS or HererticDS.
<br/>
As for "downloaded DS games" i assume you mean roms which =  piracy, which we don't discuss here. Take it to a warez board.
<br/>
Due to DS RAM limitations, the GBAMP can't play roms anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since this seems to be a bit of a newbie thread I'll post here. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a hope that demos and homebrew will eventually be able to transfer to the DS without modding the system and/or using a flash cart?  I'm on the fense about getting an M3 and this might push me one way or another.  I'd rather not flash my DS... but it's a japanese model anyway so it's not like I have a warranty or anything with NoA. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the newbie questions, and thanks for all your work and time!

I think you lose you warranty if you import your DS, like me. So flash your DS it's definately worth it.
<br/>
<br/>
I have an M3 and it's very good. But GBAMP 2 is better for homebrew as it's cheaper.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y240/Laintsurge/Sigs/Sig8.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Flashing your DS means flashing your firmware (changing it). Your firmaware is sort of like you OS (Windows) for you DS. Flashme is fully working with no problems. You need a passme to flash your DS in the first place. But once flashed you do not need the passme anymore.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suggest WiFiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
Go to a local store and buy one of these (NOT A ROUTER OR USB WIFI STICK!).
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It can act as a virtual PassME and it can send E3 demos to your DS.

P.S.: And yeah, if you buy M3, you CAN run demos off it and you CAN run backups off it. It's expensive, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That list of Ralink adaptors is for 2500 series chipsets, which includes a couple more specific chipsets. The PCI and PCMCIA use the chipset for which we have a custom driver written (thanks to Firefly). The routers and USB adaptors used a different 2500 series chipset that ISN'T compatible. The USB adaptors are not like the Nintendo version. Nintendo's WiFi and the Ralink cards with homebrew driver are different.

I'm pretty sure it's limited to 802.11B speeds, which isn't slow to begin with.<br/>_________________<br/>Work in progress: <a class="postlink" href="http://dual-soft.com" target="_blank">Dual-Soft.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. However you'll need to FlashME your DS first (you have GBAmp, so there's absolutely no problem at all)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Slosha, at the moment there's no SWF-player for the DS (i.e. Flash games).
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you can use your Xbox as a WiFiMe transmission device. The whole point is that a driver was written that works in conjunction with the Ralink RT2500 chipset. (I bring mention to the list, found <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">here</a> again.)
<br/>
<br/>
If it's not on that list, the driver won't (rather can't) work with it.
<br/>
<br/>
D-Link has a bunch of WiFi PCI cards, from what I remember. Make sure it's the model that is on that website (DWL-G510, C1 revision). If you're not entirely sure what revision it is, make sure that you can return the PCI card to the store you bought it from and then try.
<br/>
<br/>
