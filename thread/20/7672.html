So if this is going to be a "let's gang up on the guy who openly admits he plays ROMs of games he owns!" then fine, I'm done with it. This topic is getting out of hand, anyway. It's off topic. Get back on it please.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Nintendo's policy, while sometimes interesting, is less relevant than the copyright laws of the nation in which you live. Particularly since many elements of Nintendo's policy on piracy are intentional mistruths, particularly as they describe game copiers as illegal (they are not, they simply have illegal uses, similar to VCRs and DVD burners), and attempt to represent emulators themselves as illegal (although they manage to avoid directly stating that in the current version of their policy).
<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, a copy of a ROM is only legal if you did it yourself for backup purposes.
<br/>
<br/>
The DC Emulation forums have a decently researched article that summarizes this and similar issues fairly well, although it'd be nice if they were clearer on their sources. (Fortunately, this information is verfiable in the DMCA)

<br/>
If one is going to bandy about comments about what is legal and what's not, one must be careful whom one cites. Nintendo has a vested interest in representing certain technologies as illegal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only until Nintendo starts putting EULA stickers on game packaging: "By purchasing this game you agree to the terms and conditions presented at www<span style="font-weight: bold"></span>.nintendo.com/eula". Then, Nintendo or a licensed publisher can add restrictions to the sale that go beyond copyright's all rights reserved.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Future: New laws are comming here too, "cracking" will be illegal starting 1.1.2006 and that sucks. Decrypting your own DVD to HDD will be illegal as it is cracking after all, OMG. :( Also ppl can't make MP3's from their own music CD's. Sony has that virus/trojan stuff in their music CD's. That makes me think that it is safer to get the music from somewhere else than buying for CD's (buying MP3's is more safer). Ohh, I almost forget that copyrighted music CD is not a CD at all.. it's just music disc (they don't have permission from Philips to use that Compact Disc logo on copyrighted materials.

As long as you still obey copyright. Finland law respects US copyright, last I checked. If you believe otherwise, I recommend checking with a lawyer before acting on that belief.

<br/>
Do you mean copy *PROTECTED* discs? In the US and nations with similar laws, the moment data is affixed in a physical medium copyright exists. A quick once-over of Finnish law suggests copyright similarly exists immediately upon creation of a literary work.. Which the Finland Copyright Act kindly extends to music and programs. This means all CDs produced in such nations are copyrighted. 
<br/>
<br/>
Some copy protection mechanisms do not violate the standards from Philips, so you are making a sweeping generalization that does not always apply. (Of course, the copy protection mechanisms that still count as a CD are often ineffective, but that doesn't change the fact that they're still a 'copy protected' compact disc).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heck, with PC stuff you only agree to the full Eula after you have purchased it, and if you actualy read all the Eula's youd spend your life just doing that ;)

Imo, the law has to be changed. Eula's should be summerised in one page, with perhapes. hyper-linked subclause's.

<br/>
Depends on which court. Some have held them binding, others have not.
<br/>
The prevailing opinion seems to be that if the consumer had the opportunity to learn the conditions prior to the completion of the sale, then they're binding, although some judges are of the opinion that the full agreement needs to be present at the time of transaction, instead of simply referred to.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It also depends how reasonable the Eula is.
<br/>
Common sense things will almost certainly stand up, but other things probably wont.
<br/>
<br/>
The court's know its unreasonable for everyone to read every Eula for everything they buy. Due to the (stupid) length of Eulas thats impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would be a good idea for them to have to put it on the packaging? (not a link to it).
<br/>
That would force them to write in more compact, layman's terms.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
