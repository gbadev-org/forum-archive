I just noticed last night that there is no binary package of libfat for DS.  Not a huge deal -- it can be compiled from source. But it definitely wasn't clear what other source packages were needed.  I already had libnds as a binary package, but there was at least one required header file (ndstypes.h) that is in libnds's source distribution but not in the binary distribution.  I ended up just cheating and using wine to run the windows installer and have it download libfat for me.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a suggestion to the devkitPro maintainers, it'd be nice to release either a binary package of libfat for ds, or have some sort of readme letting the user know what other source packages are needed to get it to compile.
