    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I don't know if this is the right place to post that, but there is no contact e-mail in moonshell, so I am trying. Moonshell works perfectly for me now (since the new libnds) and became my mp3-player of choice. There is just one thing.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be very nice to be able to disable the L and R buttons, i.e. turn off that they Pause/Skipt to next track. Because I am carrying the NDS often in my pocket and the buttons trigger automatically very often.
<br/>
<br/>
That's all, rest is perfect for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>
