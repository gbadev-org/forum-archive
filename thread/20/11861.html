    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wondering if anyone's made a good working app that can play streaming MP3 (at least 128kbps), or better, AAC+ (~40kbps for the same quality). I know DSOrganize can, but poorly. It connects, grabs a few seconds of sound, disconnects, plays it, reconnects (often failing), and grabs more sound, so you get a very choppy result. I notice it usually takes less time to download a piece than to play it (even 128kbps MP3), so if it did both at once, I just bet this'd be quite possible.
<br/>
There's also Dissonance, which only plays one station and won't do anything for me anyway. (Sometimes it connects successfully, then just blanks out with one black and one white screen.) I figured the station might be dead so I tried hex-editing the URL in it, but it didn't help.
<br/>
I also know of SylphAmp, which isn't truly streaming but might do in a pinch if I had real good upload bandwidth. It's fairly buggy though. I want to be able to just connect wherever and not have to worry about leaving the computer on first, and with the bugs in this I find I often have to go back and restart Winamp frequently anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
So are there any other streaming apps I could try?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSOrganize <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> stream (and one channel that works perfectly for me is KPLU.org), but you're right that it does it a bit slowly.
<br/>
One reason for that is that it is built on the older, slower Wi-Fi Lib.
<br/>
<br/>
A dedicated app with some fancy parallel processing stuff and built on the new Wi-Fi Lib would definitely be able to do better.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been intending to port Splay or some other text-based audio player with streaming to DSLinux, but they all require a few extra libs that I'm too lazy to deal with... but if you feel like doing it check out freshmeat.net and fsf.org (to find nice, portable apps), and there's a really helpful section in the DSLinux Wiki about porting stuff.
<br/>
Be sure to keep it simple (hopefully the program is written in C and doesn't need any libraries you don't have) and find a lot of time for it.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I wish that there was such a project. There have been a few attempts at it so far, but none of them really pulled it all together.
<br/>
<br/>
Being able to search the ShoutCast directory on the bottom screen and show visualizations and the station info on the top screen, that would be awesome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
