    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is something I've had issues with since my old Supercard CF, but it was less common.  Now on my M3 Perfect microSD (using a 2GB Kingston japan-made), it happens more frequently.  In fact, sometime Moonshell will lock-up right away when I select a song to play, but it seems to only do that with OGGs...  Yet things are fine in Lick's Media Player (the ipod clone, but I don't like it because it plays ALL media, not just a folder)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, whenever I play a converted AMV Hell 3 in moonshell, it'll lock up right before the scene changes, AKA right before the TV appears and makes the static image and sound.  Yet, other videos seem fine like AMV Hell (1) and Diggnation.
<br/>
<br/>
Soooooooooo..........  Any ideas?
<br/>

NOTE: I know I spelled "too" wrong in the topic title, but I ran out of letter space for the second 'o' :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had MP3 files crash simlar to that in DSOrganize on my Games n' Music...they'll play fine for a while then randomly skip a lot and then the whole thing locks up.

As for Moonshell, I've never had a problem on either my GBAMP v2 CF or my GnM.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But what about OGG playback?  I understand that you have no issues with MP3, and I'm pretty sure mp3s are NOT the problem, but OGGs are.
<br/>
<br/>
But, I need to use OGGs because not only are they smaller than MP3 but also I use my SD card for excite truck and the songs I want it to use I have formatted as mp3 since Exite Truck doesn't recognize OGGs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
