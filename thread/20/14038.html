    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently the Pandora's Battery was released for the PSP. Basically, you modify the data stored on a PSP battery using a homebrew capable PSP. You can then use that modified battery to downgrade/unbrick any PSP of any version. 
<br/>
<br/>
My question is is there any data stored on the DS battery?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A battery does not store data. A battery-powered chip does, but the one in the DS stores only the current date and time along with a flag stating whether the setup wizard has been run since the battery was last changed.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Although the battery itself does not store data, the encased electronics that are perceived as part of the battery could.  I don't know anything about the PSP battery or this specific instance, but there are batteries for laptops that have additional electronics such as level indicators.  These additional electronics could include just about anything.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's what I thought at first. I thought it was some kind of April Fools joke. But apparently there are three pins on the PSP battery: positive, data and negative.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How long will it be before Sony screws with this jigkick style method?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The PSP Pandora battery thing involves changing the serial of the battery to all FF's, which I'm still surprised you're able to do. :P
<br/>
<br/>
...and, the whole thing works...tried it here succesfully, and put away an 'altered' battery in case I ever need it. :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What suprised me about using the battery is that the PSP instantly comes on and boots the files off the MS like 2 seconds after the battery is inserted, without touching the power switch at all :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah I'm not much of a hardware guy at all, but I've always hated those Sony "sliding-toggle" power switches. They break much more frequently than other normal-types. (The DS-Lite one seems sturdy enough though, but I still dislike it.)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
