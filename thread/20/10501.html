    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This would be an interesting prject for someone to make. you may be familiar with 20Q.net, an online 20-questions game, with a huge database of animals, minerals, vegetables, and other items. it asks you questions until it narrows it down to one item, and can usually guess something very similar to what you're thinking of (ie, I thought of a DS, and it said Game Boy). They also have a portable version that has a small LCD screen, and four buttons: yes, no, maybe, and sometimes (and the usual handheld game buttons, like start, and reset). if someone could somehow access 20q.net's database of items, a Ds version of the 20q game would be really awesome. not sure how hard it would be to program, though.<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: DS Lite &amp; Phat (both FlashMe v7), M3 Perfect SD, PassKey 1, Max Media Launcher, SanDisk 1GB SD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm pretty sure that's gonna cost you. Even though they paid nothing for their DB (it was created by users freely entering information into it), they definately are going to try to make money from it. (check their licensing faq)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

nope.
<br/>
Wikipedia is nothing like a semantic network of knowledge.
<br/>
Its merely a (vaste) humanly readable collection of pages. Wikipedia is existingly collected human knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
You could never use it for Q20 still information querys, its just strutured wrongly.
<br/>
<br/>
A semantic database of world knowledge would let you ask almost anything and get a meaningfull reply.
<br/>
No mater how bizare the question.
<br/>
("How many species of animal are green?", "Whos the tallest prime minister england has had?","What is the circumfrence of a mouse"?)
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, stupid examples, but the point is it would be able to answere knowledge based querys for anything.
<br/>
The contributions to science and research would be huge.
<br/>
A semantic database in many ways lets you link knowledge together in new ways. 
<br/>
It dosnt relay on someone having already wrote about an existing relationship.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
