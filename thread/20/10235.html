    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I'm fairly new to this but I've been reading and searching this site like a mad man for answers to this.

<br/>
I have the M3 SD slim model and a DS lite flashed with the latest(as of now) flashme firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
The only version of Moonshell I can actually get to boot is version .9, I have tried 1.1, 1.21, 1.31 and 1.32, they all setup to the SD card just fine with the installer.
<br/>
<br/>
I boot the DS up, get to the generic M3 loader, go into the game option, select the boot.nds file and both screens go black on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there something I'm missing or need to be doing?

are you using the right _boot_thing.nds? you can change on what kind of hardware you want to use it (supercard, M3, cf, sd, flashcart).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try other homebrew...both NDS and ds.gba style homebrew.  If they work then I'd guess that it's not the M3 itself, unless MoonShell is having an issue with SD M3s for some reason, but it shouldn't be that I know of.  I'd probably try reformatting the SD card with FAT32 if it's FAT16 (FAT) or FAT16 if it's FAT32, just to see if that helps.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Also, if none of this works, try a different SD card if you can.  It's possible it's having some weird compatibility issue...I've heard of this happening with some SD cards and the M3 SD.  Also make sure the M3 is flashed with it's most current firmware and see if that fixes it (you can always 'downgrade' if you wish).  I wouldn't think it'd be an issue, but I seem to remember some strangeness with old M3 firmwares and the DS Lite.  Never experienced it myself, so not sure what that was about.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which problem exactly?  (just curious)  At any rate, glad it's working for you.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
