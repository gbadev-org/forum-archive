<br/>
<br/>
A new patent published by the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office for Nintendo Co. Ltd. on Feb. 2nd, 2006 has revealed an interesting new DS model. 
<br/>
<br/>
Seeing as how the patent was originally drafted on Jul 29, 2004, and filed on July 19, 2005, there is no real way of telling whether the DS model featured in the patents is simply a prototype for the DS/DS Lite or a third DS model. The patent could theoretically have been edited by Nintendo in some way since the initial drafting as well. The important thing is the functionality mentioned in the patent. First off, here is the patent illustration of the new DS:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.maxconsole.net/content_img/newds_001.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
As you can see, this resembles no other DS model that has been announced. Additionally, the cartridges used for the system resemble SD cards much more than the current DS game cards, and the X and Y buttons have been removed. 
<br/>
<br/>
What's even more interesting is what it says in the description of the new DS model:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.maxconsole.net/content_img/newds_005.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
A game apparatus includes a touch panel on which at least two pointing positions are simultaneously detectable. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, either the DS Lite will have multiple touch functions that have yet to be announced, or another DS is in the works to be launched at some point after the DS Lite. 
<br/>
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is the prototype of the DS but what about the missing 2 buttons and the "2 point positions"-touchscreen?
<br/>
maybe the lite has indeed this new touchscreen?<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm... sounds like the next GameBoy. In fact, I'm amazed that the speculations don't think that, since it's obviously not a direct successor to NDS.
<br/>
The mono sound and the fewer buttons seems to suggest that.
<br/>
Two point touch screen is a nice idea, but I think it's nearly useless considering it would require use of both hands, and the system only has one stylus. It could be interesting, though. Definietly expands upon the touch screen in a good way.
<br/>
I wonder if perhaps this system's games would be compatible with the (probably) more expensive regular DS.
<br/>
The SD-shaped card also brings up speculations of all sorts. Maybe it is an SD card, and it'll have a multimedia viewer!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, what would be <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> cool, and would probably sell the thing to me, would be if those two sections with buttons could detach from the unit :)
<br/>
(Though they're probably just like that because it's an illustration...)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

a gba successor with only 2 friggin' buttons? NO way.

maybe Ninty releases an open-source "Gameboy DS" like GP2X.

so it's old, and nintendo decided not to go for a multi touchscreen, probably because of the price of that screen</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, that's a Nintendo DS Lite.
<br/>
That's the reason why they didn't release DS Lite earlier. Maybe they wanted the wait for approval of their patent?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would explain it. For Nintendo to release something with less buttons than the DS would seem rather dumb, and mono sound, while not really a big issue, would probably upset people too. I know I heard rumours about being able to do things that would require multi-touch with the DS, such as pressing a coin on the screen to make a 'charcoal' rub-effect. Also I believe touch screens capable of sensing multiple touches are fairly new, and thus probably quite expensive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I saw a video a while ago of a new multi-touch capable LCD, and it was quite neat. They were demonstrating experimental interfaces using the new screen, and it looked very useful for graphic editing. In the demo they could rotate images by touching two or more points at the same time and rotating, as would do with a real piece of paper. Resizing was also done in a similar fashion, not to mention it was possible to drag as many windows/objects as you could touch, and properly use on-screen keyboards naturally.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then again, they also had a patent for a GBA game using a tilt-gyro and it used an image of the original GBA. So these very well could be out-dated patents on things for the original DS. A lot of Nintendo stuff has "Patent Pending" on it. Why they would be filed now, though...<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
