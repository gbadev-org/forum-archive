    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello all,
<br/>
  I am running Moonshell 1.71 and it will freeze up after I view some jpgs  or listen to a mp3 and then view a video. No matter the order I do things in, if the final thing I try to do is view a video Moonshell will freeze. I can view the video first and watch it all the way through with no problem. I can stop the video and then go view jpgs/listen to mp3s. If I then again try to play the video Moonshell will freeze up.
<br/>
<br/>
   All of my information is below. If anyone has an idea of what I can do to fix this I would greatly appreciate hearing back. 
<br/>
<br/>
Versions:
<br/>
Moonshell 1.71 dled from the homepage
<br/>
Video encoded with dpgtools1.31 &amp; batchdpg 1.0 final
<br/>
<br/>
Flash kit:
<br/>
R4 with Kingston 1gb japan TF
<br/>
M3 lite with kingston 1gb japan TF
<br/>
<br/>
Method:
<br/>
Currently using the R4 as a passme and running Moonshell 1.71.nds from the m3 lite. However, this problem also occurs if I run Moonshell 1.71 straight off of the R4. On the R4 I have used the build of Moonshell packaged with the updated firmware. On the M3 lite I used the Moonshell setup software to generate the build of Moonshell for my M3.

<br/>
Thanks!
