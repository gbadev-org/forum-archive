    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My old-faithfull DS original has served me well since release.
<br/>
I use a GBAMP+4GB CF for homebrew, comics and music.
<br/>
<br/>
However, yesterday the user-settings of the ds reset themselves; It asked me to calibrated the screen, my birthday etc.
<br/>
However, moonshell still booted as when the gbamp was in, so the firmware was still ok.
<br/>
<br/>
I shrugged this off, and tried booting a game, but to my horror found slight yellow-tinted lines over the screen...both in moonshell apps and in commercial games.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any idea what could cause these two seemingly unrelated errors?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd happy buy a new ds, but I didnt really want to go to the bother of figuring out how to make my GBAMP setup work on a newer ds model.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I've sort of worked out the problem. It seems to be something to do with the battary, either the connection or the battery itself.
<br/>
Running the ds with the battery not sealed in results in the error going away.
<br/>
<br/>
The battery is curved slightly, which dosnt look correct, and I'm guessing when its sealed in, it press's down at the wrong angle, which some how mess's up the screen.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
