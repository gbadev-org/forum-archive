Has there ever been any discussion of trying to hack the mic/headphone port into a keyboard port somehow?  I'm not hardware hacker type and I don't even know what would be required on the software side, either, so I really have no idea if that's even remotely feasible.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine how uselessly cool it would be to be able to plug a little chat pad into your DS for things like this, though!  OMG!

I think you could do it. According to GBATek, the microphone is connected to the AUX input on the SPI bus, so assuming the external microphone port just overrides that connection, then it would probably be more accurately described as an all-purpose serial port that just happens to only have a microphone accessory to use with it :p
<br/>
<br/>
But even with easy input, you still have the resolution problem, although you could improve on that using subpixel fonts.<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I think it is very doable, you only have to sacrifice a keyboard and get a plug that fits the port... and hope you don't blow a fuse. :^D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

Again though, if you want a computer, why not just use a computer?  I do not think a DS + keyboard would be very useful on the go unless the keyboard was stiff and firmly connected to the DS, and even then the usefulness of the notion is dubious.

I detect a hint of sarcasm. But there aren't any other netbooks at Best Buy, Circuit City, Target, or Wal-Mart either, only full-size, full-price laptops that aren't labeled for use with anything but Windows Vista or Mac OS X.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

kusma is right.
<br/>
The market is growing steadily. Nearly all major manufacturers already have a product either in stores or near release and at a comparable price to the EeePC.
<br/>
Also, the EeePC gets it's second successor model very soon and a fourth model is in the works. So I guess these products will be widely available rather soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Just imagine what will happen when the first Tegra powered devices (in shape of mini computers) flood the market! ;^D
<br/>
<br/>
Btw: I prefer a touch screen keyboard over a phone's keypad. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I didn't spot the sarcasm and was about to answer to that post. Thanks tepples. :^D<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

Absolutely no problems here.  It is natural for conversations to ebb and flow.  The correct thing to do is fork a thread when it no longer has anything to do with the original topic.  I would fork the thread, but I can't as I'm not a moderator.

But if I buy a laptop online, I can't try the keyboard or the hinge, and if I find a product unusable despite what the reviews claimed, returning it is a female dog. That's why I prefer to touch products before I buy them. (See <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=15773" target="_blank">previous discussion</a>.)

You can generally return something.  The problem is, it you need to repackage it and ship it back.  The whole process takes a long time and it is a pain.  In the meantime, you don't have a laptop.
