<br/>
now, m3sd is fully supported, so maybye smbdy may look at his source and do something to improve sd compatibility to other homebrew...
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, it didn't work on my M3CF... (rainr14)
<br/>
<br/>
...But I used that M3/G6 power loader and it works!!!! However, my ds shuts off when I close it after 4 blinks.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want homebrew to try to work on your M3SD, then search around for "G6/M3 Power Loader"
<br/>
<br/>
It works with like <span style="font-weight: bold">all</span> homebrew exept project-dipstar.
<br/>
<br/>
I am still trying to get dipstar to load, so if anyone has succesfully gotten dipstar working on an M3CF, please let me know!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!

<br/>
i can run homebrew on my m3, even without that, but rain14 has full i/o support for m3 sd, and for what i know that's the second hb that do this (the other was mp3play i believe...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
