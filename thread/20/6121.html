seems that it works on GBAMP.
<br/>
i tried it but games won't boot(the emu menu boots though).
<br/>
I'm not sure if I have all the  needed files as I wasn't able to translate the readme...&lt;_&lt;
<br/>
Do I need the "FMPAC"-rom too?So far I only have copied the emu-file(renamed to _boot_mp.ds) ,some roms,the msx-rom file and the disk-rom file to the root directory of my CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got it working yet? If so,how?

Using this software, assuming, even when, that your Nintendo Co.

I haven't tested it, but I guess for MSX1 emulation you would only need MSX.ROM. For MSX2 emulation you'd need MSX2.ROM and MSX2EXT.ROM. MSX2+ emulation (default config of this emu) needs MSX2P.ROM and MSX2PEXT.ROM. DISK.ROM is optional but required for disk-based games. FM-PAC isn't supported, so there's no need to have FMPAC.ROM. All roms should be put in the root.<br/>_________________<br/>dus.... <a href="http://www.bombaman.net" target="_blank">http://www.bombaman.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suggest using google sometimes... :D
<br/>
<br/>
MSX is a z80 computer which was released 1983. ASCII are the ones who made it together with Microsoft. Coding language was called MicroSoft eXtended BASIC. Konami among other companies released games on the MSX computers. MSX cpu z80 is clocked at 3.58mhz. CPU is double on MSX with TurboR. 
<br/>
Audio chip is the AY-3-8910, same one as in Sinclair ZS Spectrum 128. This provides 3 channels.
<br/>
Konami released Metal Gear 2 on the MSX which is alot better than the NES version due to the fact that they actually tried writing a great story :D
<br/>
Gradius is pretty much the same IMO.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that I check msx.org I see they written news about fmsxDS 0.02 ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The emu boots fine but I can't find the game anywhere in the emu-menu.
<br/>
<br/>
