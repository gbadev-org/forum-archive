If you do this in Pictochat or in homebrew paint software, you will get a line instead of getting 2 points!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If the touchpad registers more than one point (which it normaly does, because your finger is too big ;-) it calculates the middle between all points and this point will be returned. This is done in hardware, so you can't read all points touched. Try in PicoChat to touch 2 small points (with 2 stylus) and move them both in one direction, you should get a line between these points (as if you would touch it in the middle between the 2 stylus).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could interprete a very sudden move as a second touch. You can then calculate the second point by using the first point and the new averaged point. It probably won't be very accurate. Perhaps even three points will work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Indeed. However, the microphone could be put to some affect if you were prepared to implement some voice recognition for notes, so the user could tap one note, say a C, and say "A" for an A. Obviously if you wanted flats and stuff you'd need to think of other words, and this isn't a very usable solution, but it would do the job.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now here's would be useful on the DS: an S3M editor.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
