    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The NDS Wi-Fi games work over a standard 802.11 b/g network, but they do not support ad-hoc mode. Just make sure you have an access point somewhere on your network and you're fine. Configuration should match that of your other PCs on the network.
<br/>
<br/>
Some wifi cards also support an Access Point mode, with certain software. If you have a spare wifi card floating around, check its driver CD, or check out the SoftAP software available online.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would look up on nintendo's website for router information before you buy one, I think a router is more useful since computers can use it as well, but some routers need to be set to crippling wireless speeds just so your ds can use it, which sucks since you might as well have gotten the wifi dongle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
