    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok see today i had booted 5 roms on the games and music  chip, but here is the catch, it had no touch screen support so like when the game i booted came up i had to touch alll the 5 games.I tried  and i couldnt touch my friends tried it to and other people on our games and music homebrew site tried it. I just want to know why there is no touch screen support and could touch screen support be added to so it will work.
<br/>
So basically all i need is touch screen support and maybe it will work.
<br/>
p.s
<br/>
Please give me feedback.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by bigleak2 on Fri Aug 24, 2007 2:46 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

hmm.. its actually interesting a little that some roms show initial screens if the nitro fs is not available - it has nothing todo with the rom size, most will only show white screen, but some surprisingly show some graphics. They are far away from being playable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've seen a site where a user claimed he got commercial files to work by first trimming and then compressing some 8 MB games so that the total compressed file was under 4 MB, then launching using a custom loader that could understand the compression.  However, I kinda doubt this, as wouldn't there need to be some place for the uncompressed file to go before it could be launched?  No files were available from the site, so I'm assuming it was just talk.

Regardless, to my knowledge the GnM remains a homebrew-only device, at least for the time being.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I don't really care for piracy, but I downloaded SM64DS and the Metroid demo that was included with early DS'es (I have both of those on real carts) to test the Max Overload for GBAMP.  It worked, though I won't go into detail as it's piracy.  But, neither the GBAMP or the Games n' Music (the 2 carts I had in when using Max Overload) have extra RAM, so there's got to be a way to run ROM's (MO uses a PAT file to patch it, but still the roms were big).
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, SM64DS loading times, as well as Metroid demo loading times, are horrible on the GBAMP, and the GBAMP is WAY faster than the GnM, so even if it did play ROMS it would take maybe 30 seconds to load a game, when a real cart (my preferred method) takes about 1 to 2 seconds.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
