    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since I traded in my SP to get a DS I have been really missing Powder. Is there any way to run Powder on the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I currently have a Supercard SD Rumble. I've not researched the possibility of running GBA homebrew on this, so ANY pointers would be very appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested Powder is an excellent 'rogueline' rpg that has infinate replayability. Here is a link to the website: <a href="http://www.zincland.com/powder/" target="_blank">http://www.zincland.com/powder/</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">However, if you still have it, the GBA flash cart that you used to play Powder on your SP should work just fine for playing Powder or any other GBA homebrew on the your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
As would pretty much any other GBA-slot flash cart.  You just picked the wrong flash cart if you were interested in GBA stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
What's the technical reason why the Supercard Rumble won't load GBA stuff, by the way?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Considering that the rumble feature is fairly gimmicky, I would suspect the main reason was to lower the price of the product in order to attract more customers.  The rumble was probably added as an additional incentive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It probably won't work then.  Here's a thread with some more info, and it links to the thread that has the program I'm talking about - <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12389" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12389</a>

<br/>
And I was wrong.  It's the Flash Advance Pro that can be written with the program, not Flash2Advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It should theoretically still be able to run multiboot (the GBAMP can), but apparently it can't even do that. At least, that's what I remember reading here...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
