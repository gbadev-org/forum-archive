It's a DS video/audio player.  It includes a 4GB HDD that connects through the GBA slot.  What's interesting is the following comment on their site:

I don't think much more than a microdrive and the adapter could fit into that attachment.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if there is any way to be able to access more than 4 GB via the GBA cart slot?  I seem to remember someone saying that 4 GB is the limit.  The PSP has a 4 GB limit on the Memory Stick slot, which is why the PSP version is only 4 GB as well.  But the PSP's limit may be able to be overcome with a firmware update.
<br/>

EDIT: SPiercey, the GBA Movie Player had 'alright' quality videos.  This product has access to all of the DS' hardware, so decent quality videos <span style="font-weight: bold">should </span>be possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If Datel made their own codec for this, there's no doubt they could make good quality video at 24 or 30 frames per second. Just look at what the Movieadvance people did with the GBAMP. But, I wonder if Datel would go through the trouble to do that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, the gameshark/action replay doesn't have the nintendo logo data.  It simply just passes through accesses to the Nintendo Logo data from the game pak for a certain period of time.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, if you try to flash the nintendo logo data onto the action replay for gba or action replay duo for gba/ds,  Then the internal fpga or whatever it is in the action replay disallows read access to the first sector of the flash. (It still allows write access for unbricking purposes.)  Essentially, trying to put the nintendo logo data onto the action replay to make it boot without a gba gamepak turns it into a brick.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now,  a completely unblockable passme would be a "game card" fully supporting the regulation ds card protocols, including the correct lfsrs, and secure area encryption.   The header would not need to redirect the code execution points out of range.  No need to, as the code put onto this game card would be Branch current location, for the arm 9 executable, and Ldr r0,=0x8000000, bx r0, for the arm 7 executable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, but that one is slightly smaller than just the game because it needs a little more hardware. And it isn't very likely to fit a passthrough device together with an original game into a regularly sized game card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good job that the DS cards don't use RSA in any way then :D (WMB downloads are RSA signed, not the cards, which use command, secure block, and stream encryption)  Had they signed the cards, including the header, DS homebrew wouldn't have been possible at all (without a leak of the private key, buffer overflow exploit in a game, or the key table for firmware encryption), so be grateful that nintendo botched the job.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, DS cards are far more complicated to make than a GBA flash cartridge, but they're makable.  Both types of encryption have been understood for quite some time, just not spread publically until recently (although it's likely the datel effort predates any of the recently publically released info).
<br/>
<br/>
BTW. those longer 'passme upgrade' cards are passme1, not passme2, and contain an original DS rom chip and the eeprom from them.  There isn't room for the datel card to do this, and it wouldn't be all that cost effective for them to do it either.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I could care less about turning my DS into a very bulky music player for a total cost of more than a sleek standalone unit with the same or more storage, so I hope they sell the boot card seperately (and it's very likely to be just that, with minimal or no flash storage).  If not sold seperately, they might include some checks to prevent using the card with anything other than the max drive, but it's probably at most the checks + read a boot sector from the drive (or passme* if they stick some flash in the max drive).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">* By passme I mean actual code blocks containing an arm9 loop and an arm7 branch to GBA space (not the traditional header manipulation passme).</span>

But each project has to be approved by Nintendo.  I can imagine how the interview for this project would go:
<br/>
<br/>
Datel:  We want to make a media player for the DS...
<br/>
Nintendo:  Well, it would be competing with our Play-Yan, but at least we would get the licensing fees from it...
<br/>
Datel:  ...and it would be able to execute homebrew pr...
<br/>
Nintendo:  OH NO YOU DID <span style="font-style: italic">NOT</span>!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That was a quote of someone commenting on their website, and I was making fun of their spelling and lack of knowledge about homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, it's not a licensed product, and if they used an official debugger, they did so while it was on 'loan' over the weekend from someone else (i.e. pretty unlikely) :D  It'll be interesting to dump it and look for codewarrior or GCC sigs, i.e. did they use a leaked SDK or homebrewed it properly.
<br/>
<br/>
None of datel's products are licensed by any of the console makers (well, at least not the big 3, dunno if they've made anything licensed for more permissive systems like gp32).  Nintendo especially are against cheat devices, which is datel's largest market by far (or at least, against unlicensed products, with cheat devices being an easy target).  Datel are wisely diversifying with other products now, because making cheat devices for next gen consoles gets harder and harder, and most likely, eventually effectively impossible (same for homebrew, but not for piracy sadly, those bastards just need to make a perfect copy to ignore signing).
<br/>
<br/>
On the private key, it's something more like hundreds of computers for many thousands of years (or maybe it was millions).  Dig through the forum for a really old thread on WMB, someone dug up some numbers for factoring an arbitrary 1024 bit key.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

<br/>
<br/>
Datel are the ones that bought the rights to 20 or so homebrew GBA games a few years ago, and then publihsed them as a gameboy advance emulator running on an un authorised gamecube or playstation 2 disk.
<br/>
<br/>
It was called maxplay instant classics vol 1 if you want to track it down on the net.
<br/>
<br/>
They have a long proud history of unauthorised products.
<br/>
<br/>
I imagine this will probably be able to play "backups" of commercial games, and as a side effect allow home brew stuff to run.

I'm quite certain it's the same with the Max Drive Pro for the Gamecube (that yes, does load DOL files).  I looked at this disc with a homebrew Gamecube viewer program and apparently the name of the disc is some hockey game.  I'd have to check to get the exact one, but eh, I can't find the disc for it. :P<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Apparently this barcode is an encryption key or some such... some DVD-ROMs can read it but most don't support it.
