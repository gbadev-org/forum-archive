    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am looking for an application like virtual dub that will allow me to open a dpg file and resync audio that plays a half of second to early. 
<br/>
<br/>
I encoded the video from an xvid (dvd source) file that has no issues to begin with. 
<br/>
<br/>
I used BatchDPG and the following settings:
<br/>
FPS: 20, Video bitrate: 386, Audio bitrate: 128, Mode: Joint Stereo
<br/>
Max bitrate: 512, Samplerate: 32768
<br/>
Passes: 3, Profile: Ultra, Resizer - Spline16, Width: 256, Height: 192
<br/>
<br/>
With all that said the audio is playing to early. I had hoped that ffdshow supported .dpg so that I could simply decode the video stream and run it with the mod of virtual dub.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any suggestions, be so kind as to post back.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This may be a long shot, but I've heard that the 32768 samplerate of the audio, while it does greatly improve the audio quality, can screw up the audio sync.  Try setting it to 32000 and see if it helps.  If that fails I don't really know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

for some reason, 3 passes can introduce a/v sync issues</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
