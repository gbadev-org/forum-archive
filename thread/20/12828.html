    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, the only thing this has to do with DSdev is that I used DSOrganize to visualize the problem, but I'm asking about this on various DS related forums, so I figured I'd ask here, too.

<br/>
Have any of you guys had or heard about a touchscreen calibration problem like this?
<br/>

What you're seeing is a grid that I made on my PC and then transfered to my DS and tried to accurately trace over (using the Scribble Pad in DSOrganize).  As you can see if you look at the red lines which are my tracings, I didn't do too good a job of tracing the lines, but actually I traced them very well with my stylus, but those red lines are where the DS saw my stylus.  At the top of the screen, the DS reads my pen to the left of where it actually is and by the time I get to the bottom, it's reading the touch somewhat to the left of where it should be.  Of course, this is only for the x-axis, y-axis calibration seems fine.
<br/>
<br/>
No matter how many times I try to recalibrate the touchscreen in the DS BIOS, the problem is not solved.  I've even tried sort of adjusting for the inaccuracy when I do the recalibration, but that doesn't really work either.  This is not just in homebrew that I have this problem, either, even in commercial games, if the touchscreen precision is high enough, I'll find the same pattern.
<br/>
<br/>
So what's the deal?  Anyone know of this.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing there's not really any fix for it, but I wonder how common it is.  I'll be exchanging my DS Lite under warranty next month, so hopefully the replacement Nintendo sends me won't have this problem.

<br/>
ANYWAY, i have the same problem. it differs slightly for me as the grid is more matched at the top and pretty way off on the bottom.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.holbrooksfilms.com" target="_blank">www.holbrooksfilms.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it's happening with official games then yeah, you should probably look into replacing it. Check for crud between the screen and the plastic though.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
