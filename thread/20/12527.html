AFAIK there's only one unofficial client, a GAIM plugin, which still didn't work great.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lol xfire for ds thats funny although xfire is a pretty good application for keeping track of your game times and talking during games i see no point in porting it to ds.
<br/>
<br/>
I would much rather see YIM and Google Talk on ds because a mass of users use it compared to xfires small user data base. Personally I think it would be great if beup joined up together with some other people and made a multi-messenger but still maintain the sleek easy to use interface it already has. Out of all the messengers on ds I've used beup has been the best aim ds is a bit less user friendly but still manageable but that would be great if someone could make a trillion like applicationor at least find a way to combined beup and ds aim into one super messenger and then add in the others. lol</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
