    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now I've seen plenty of emulators, but I'm wondering which are the best. I find it hard sometimes to find out which ones there are and how good they are, since there isnt a single site that brings em all into one place that I know of. I'm using PicoDrive .15 or somethin for Genesis, I think its the latest one, though it still dosnt support sound, and its frame skip is a lil weird. And I forget which one for SNES, but it runs smooth (just a lil slow) and it has sound, although it wont run mario rpg. 
<br/>
Also, does anyone know of a sweet NES emulator, and GBC emulator?
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing... in any emulator I've used, the modes for windows is full, where it cuts off top and bottom of the screen, and stretched, where its stretched vertically to fit in the screen, but distorts sprites. Is there any way to have an emulator (or is there one) to play in a mode where it can be full screen, but not stretched, like adding left and right black bars? Sort of like if you played a GBC game on GBA.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depending on what kind of scaling is used, generally stretching/squishing vertically is much easier than horizontally, due to the fact that the DS screen is drawn vertically.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
