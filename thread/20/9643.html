With Japanese it's probably still readable that way. [Edit: Except that it cuts off wide characters near the edge, just as it does in the file browser. Same bug I'll bet.]
<br/>
<br/>
As for translations, I'd do it but I only speak one language, which this post is written in. I'm slowly teaching myself Japanese but that doesn't help much in this case.
<br/>
<br/>
And no more 404s! :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, some nice changes here. Clock plugin config in global.ini, change the date order, and some sort of "developer tool" option in the setup app... not sure what that does.
<br/>
<br/>
It's still crashing with JPEGs though. :-( I see a few instances of "extmem:unknown cartridge type" and "FAT_fopen error" in the debug log at startup. Maybe when he added support to the JPEG plugin to use M3 memory he broke GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Hm, also, selecting //EXFS or //GBFS by accident freezes the system instead of saying media not found.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, what's that "auto start" option for Startup Sound do?

<br/>
<br/>
Also I replaced the JPEG plugins with the ones from V1.21+6 and it works, even in double screen mode. It freezes when I zoom out in dual-screen mode though. However one image, which I could swear worked before, shows errors about progressive JPEGs not being supported.
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, did anyone notice it shows info for .msp files now when you open them? It treats them as sound files though. O_o Also when I tried to add my own startup.mp3 in place of the existing one it says it can't find it. Maybe because it's 5MB? (I was hoping it'd keep playing while doing other things, heh.)

I think Japanese fonts in general are fixed-width. That might be why the character cutoff bug exists in the first place.

I feel the problem that the capital letter has overflowed...?
<br/>
<br/>
Incidently,
<br/>
<br/>
The width of the character overflows. The character lacks, and is skipped. Do those bugs exist still?
<br/>
When the file name or the text file, etc. that can reproduce the bug are posted, I am glad.
<br/>
<br/>
I cannot yet access gbadev.

It is possible to read occasionally by making good use of the tunnel of the proxy and the translation service.

The readme for moonshell doesnt give instructions for this particular media storage (it's not SD or CF, so I have no idea what option to pick when running setup.exe!)

Also, are there any programs that will convert itunes .m4v video files (like TV episodes) to .dpg format? DPGtools doesn't seem to want to do it.

<br/>
I heard over the web on a host of sites saying that moonshell is only partially working... but not very specific as to what that means. I'm debating whether or not to go with CF or SD at the moment, and if mp3 playback is screwing with the SD then I'll definitely just get the CF, regardless of its size. I'm just holding out hope that the SD m3 does support mp3 playback and Bleach _on the_ DS :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Syr on Wed May 24, 2006 8:48 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
In the scanning loop:
<br/>
When it sees a newline character ('\r' or '\n'), it draws the line so far.
<br/>
When it sees a space character (' ' or '\t'), it stores its position in a variable called lastSpace.
<br/>
When it sees a hiragana followed by a kanji or katakana, it stores the hiragana's position in lastSpace. (This will break Japanese words after their case endings.)
<br/>
When it has enough characters to fill the line, it draws everything up to lastSpace unless there wasn't a space in this line, in which case it draws all the characters in the line so far.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Is it possible to customize the real time clock so that it doesn't display seconds or the date?

Isn't this referring to the M3 version of MoonShell in the setup (that you can launch with A rather than Start from the M3's menu) or is the wording just weird?  I'm talking about launching an NDS FROM MoonShell running on the M3 CF.  I thought MoonShell only had support for this on the GBAMP and the Supercard.

<br/>
<br/>
I have a big problem. I try to get a new Verison of Monshell on my 4GH HD with the Max Mediaplayer. But it dont work. There is an older Version preinstalled but when I download the new 1.3 Version and copy the files on my DS it doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
My steps, how I tried to install Moonshell:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Run setup.exe
<br/>
2. Setup target drive: I:\fixed-HDD [Datel-Max]
<br/>
3. Everything is checked
<br/>
4. I pressed the Setup button
<br/>
5. the program copied all files to my HD
<br/>
6. run the Boot_me.nds (something like that ;-) )
<br/>
Now there comes that screen:

<br/>

I'm converting a video to run at 15 frames / second from 25. It takes about 30 minutes before the unsyncronization is noticeable.

The problem may be DPGenc, since the audio is always unsynchonized even if I skip ahead in the video, but I have tried numerous configurations to no avail.

<br/>
Has anyone else had trouble with audio desync in big videos and found a better way to change the frame rate without killing it?

This is'nt exactly what i meant - when i use moonshell to watch movie's with the volume on both the DS and moonshell at 100% i still find it hard to hear (I am on a train) is there anything in the global.ini that can be changed so that the volume at 100% is louder than it currently is?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before converting the movie, try using level compression on the audio in VirtualDub. This will make the quiet parts louder, allowing you to keep everything at similar volume levels. For instance, a compressor set at 2:1 will map parts that are -30 dB, -20 dB, and -10 dB to -15 dB, -10 dB, and -5 dB respectively. The same thing works for classical music; I use a 2:1 compressor with a cutoff around -48 dB on my Grieg and Beethoven CDs.

<br/>
As for popular music such as the YTMND soundtrack, I run amplify, limiter, and soft saturation effects until <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_Gain" target="_blank">Replay Gain</a> reports a value of -6 dB.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I've just been playing with DSM stuff, it seems to be the same as DPG - I suspect they're using the same method as Batch DPG to get better videos. The smoothness is a trick - I think they turned off the dithering, so it skips to keep in sync - you dont notice as much unless there is a *lot* of action.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice! The setup program has really been improved, and the global.ini has more detailed and easy to read explainations. In the app itself, I don't see much changed. Random startup sound still just makes no sound at all; are the files supposed to be in \SHELL? Anyway I do notice one cool feature: When the backlight goes off, it dims the power LED! If you look close you can see it's flickering on and off really fast, just like how FlashMe dims the backlight. I was gonna try that and see if it worked, I guess this answers my question. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
Oi, I just closed a window with the X in the corner, and it closed the date/time window too! Looks like it responds to being clicked in the corner, and closes, even though it doesn't have a close button.
<br/>
<br/>
JPEG viewing is much improved, but with a few problems. It's far faster and the images almost look a bit clearer than usual. (Looks great at 50% especially.) When viewing large images it doesn't mess up when seeking through the file. Unfortunately it has to seek through them a lot more. A 640x779 image requires quite a bit of seeking, when it wouldn't have on older versions. (Only HUGE images needed to before.) Seems like if you just move around the image to get it all on the screen, it loads all into memory and won't have to seek anymore (except with HUGE images), so I wonder why it doesn't just load them into memory right from the start?
<br/>
<br/>
The only other problem I see is the lack of support for progressive JPEGs. That isn't a signifigant problem, but when it shows the error message, you can't use L or R; you have to find the next image manually in the file list. (Plus, these images showed up fine in older versions. O_o)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, other formats such as GIF and PNG also load faster and look better.

It's because it can really only seek forward. Meaning, if you want to seek backwards, it has to go from the beginning of the file to the point you seek to.
<br/>
<br/>
It probably has something to do with the way the FAT file system is read from, but I don't really know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I just now started using version 1.31 and I have a question. Does anyone else get audio dropouts or hiccups every few seconds while playing MP3 files? Granted, I haven't spent much time with it yet and only tested the Supercard version with my SCSD, but I'm getting very noticable dropouts now where it used to be perfectly clear before. I know it's not a problem with my audio files as they play fine in DSOrganize. Has anyone else experienced this too? Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds alright to me. Maybe your SD card is too slow.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, red/green alternating power LED is normal when your battery gets just weak enough to go red, especially when sounds are playing. It will switch between colours as the power consumption goes up and down, until it gets weak enough that it just stays red.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The last few versions I've tried with my SC seem rather flakey for some reason. It was either v1.21 or v1.31b that I used last and it seemed to have some issues running homebrew apps. Then again, I was using a GBAMPv2 for a long time before I got the SCSD, so maybe I'm still having teething troubles with the SCSD. It just seems like older versions like v1.0 and v1.1 were more stable for some reason. Maybe I should just drop back to one of those.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Did you just drag and drop the files there or did you use G6 U-DISK Manager?

Did you start the moonshell nds file with button "A" or with "START"?

What's a good video bitrate to set in BatchDPG to make the colours of encoded videos less noticeably blocky and seperated? I mucked around last night at around 280 and even though it was better than the default moonshell encoding tools, I still could see quite a bit of blocky/pixelated areas wherever  scenes of high action and panning occurred (say the piano intro to Family Guy and quick panning/zooming in a WC06 soccer match).

Movies, you don't, but for two screen picture viewing, go to Shell/global.ini on your memory card (that you have MoonShell installed to) and look for a section called '[ImagePlugin]'.

That's odd. Firstly because I thought the Supercard SD could only accomodate up to 1GB SD cards. Secondly because the generic SanDisk SD cards are some of the slower kind. So it doesn't seem like it's a speed issue of the cards, either. Although RiDATA is a lesser-known brand. Then again, it does it on my PNY SD card too.
<br/>
<br/>
So that leads me back to looking at the Supercard. Do you know what firmware you are using? I'm pretty sure I'm using the latest Kernel V1.62 on mine with FlashMe V7. I wonder if that might make a difference?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

That's odd. Firstly because I thought the Supercard SD could only accomodate up to 1GB SD cards. Secondly because the generic SanDisk SD cards are some of the slower kind. So it doesn't seem like it's a speed issue of the cards, either. Although RiDATA is a lesser-known brand. Then again, it does it on my PNY SD card too.
<br/>
<br/>
So that leads me back to looking at the Supercard. Do you know what firmware you are using? I'm pretty sure I'm using the latest Kernel V1.62 on mine with FlashMe V7. I wonder if that might make a difference?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it seems that the Supercard SD can accept 2GB cards after all. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I have a genuine Supercard SD with Supercard kernel v1.62 and FlashMe v7 on a launch ordinary DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps somebody could write an app that benchmarks Supercard and flash media combination speeds at reading and writing?<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was listening to music and watching the clock with all the particles bouncing around and the VU clock the other day and got to thinking about something. Does anyone know if the DS has enough horsepower to display a visualization of the waveform like an oscilliscope or spectrum analyzer while playing back? I know, it would probably be pushing it, but it seems like that would be the ideal thing to display on the other screen while music plays. Like the visualizations for Winamp and Windows Media Player. I know it couldn't be as advanced, but do you suppose it's possible?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

DSOrganize displays an o-scope. An analyzer might be tough if you can't "cheat" and grab values straight from the transforms inside the MP2/MP3 codec.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Sorry, but that G6_Setup.cmd is just a script that replaces the original _BOOT_MP.nds to the file that G6 dev team built. They have promised to pass the source code to Moonlight, but they seem to be too busy to do it. I'm not sure if it's because they don't feel it being important enough as they don't get any money directly of giving the source.. maybe only happy customers.
<br/>
After Moonlight gets the source, G6 support will be integrated in to MoonShell and G6 will have wider homebrew support (as for now it doesn't have any).<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
