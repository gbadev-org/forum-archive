    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just ordered a Passcard 3 for my DSLite and GBAMP, but before everything is shipped I just want to make sure if all of those thing go all together
<br/>
<br/>
I know for homebrew I either need a Passme tool or Passcard 3. Since I have a GBAMP and it dont work with Passme 2 I got the Passcard 3.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is, do PassCard 3 and GBAMP work together ? I just want to make sure of this before receiving my package
<br/>
<br/>
thanks !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In general, NoPass cards such as PassCard 3 should be compatible with GBA Movie Player v2 CF. There are a few isolated incompatibilities between specific NoPass cards and specific GBA slot devices, but based on my sources (which the forum rules prohibit me from citing), they should not affect the GBA Movie Player.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
