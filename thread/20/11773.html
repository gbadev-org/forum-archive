    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I have more than one .wad file for DS Doom and want to have them on my CF card at the same time. The problem is that DS Doom only loads doom.wad from the root of the CF card, so the only way I can change them is keeping on renaming them back to doom.wad.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to have multiple .nds files of DS Doom that each load a different wad file.
<br/>
<br/>
I've downloaded the source code and need to know how I can change the filename that is to be loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if one of the porters of DS Doom is reading this (or anyone else who could do this), will there be an option to choose a wad file to load in DS Doom later on? It would make it much easier to use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I recompiled my own version with such a menu, with 4 wad files (Doom, DoomII, TNT and Plutonium), each wad has its own save folder, and all the binaries are in a "DOOM" folder (at the root of the SD/CF memory). It works pretty well ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It freezes during the Texture Flats Sprites Tranmap build.

<br/>
It seems to work fine now.
<br/>
<br/>
Even though i already tried removing the whole thing and putting it on the card again. Ah well. XD
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Or i'm weirded out even more now.
<br/>
It works fine on my 32 MB test-SD card, but not on my 2-gig main card, while the official release works fine on both. Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit2: Blargh, sorry, nevermind. I think my SD card is fuxx0red. Gotta send it in. &gt;_&lt;
<br/>
<br/>
Edit3: Uhh... this is getting kinda weird. I tried it on multiple SD cards now and it only seems to work on on the 32 meg one. And that one's really slow. The others all seem to freeze during that building part. The official release works on all my cards. Tried it with SC firmware 1.63 and 1.7, to make sure that's not the problem.<br/>_________________<br/>maggiekarp: Aghhh okay guys why would my right ide hurt in my ribs

Well, im having problems using DSOrganize green version, the 2.3 one.

It works fine except for everything that writes on the card. The files have 0 ks and i assume they end up corrupting the folder.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anna, as I said, I did NOT touch anything related to the Supercard driver, I don't understand why I doesn't work on your SC....that's really strange
<br/>
<br/>
You can try to disable translucency (edit prboom.cfg, goto #Video settings, translucency                  0)....I know that I had a problem with DSO green fatlib not working correctly with DSdoom with translucency ON, the trans_map file couldn't be overwritten....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yep, no problem, I did not take your answer as a blame ;) ...but I'd like to understand why my custom build does not work correctly on SCSD.

Bluemercury, you need devkitpro and the M3 libfat, then you just have to replace the old libfat with the official one, and recompile it with devkitpro.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
