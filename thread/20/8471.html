<br/>
<br/>
from the picture they release, we are pretty sure that they use moonshell's open source code, and then modify the code and combine it as M3's kernel. Of couse, they won't release any source about the "modified moonshell". It's illegal, right?

I doubt he will be credited. MoonShell has done almost the most in the homebrew community and if they don't happen to credit him, that's simply retarded. I know M3 is basicly quite a good product, but some design was stolen from SuperCard, now they even want to rob MoonLight. I wish they'd burn in hell.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If moonshello is gpl, and/or some of the libraries he uses are, than the source code must be released as GPL as well, otherwise it's illegal. If the license is a BSD-like, than they can do all they want as long as they credit him and all the other authors.

I hope they are forced to release the source at least.

I totally agree that they shouldn't take advantage of him and like everything if sourcecode is used and they open source it completely *very unlikely* the community would continue to patch/improve it and do there own thing.
<br/>
<br/>
If they don't release it.. but give him credit - There Devs will continue to update and support a high quality product.. if they release it good for them if they close it.. they are still going to put out a quality product.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a fan of the GPL and I believe they SHOULD release the kernel but if they are using the base Homeshell and simply including support for there own functionality... thats were its upto to personal believes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

Have you ever read the GPL? That would be a "derived work" and as such the complete source has to be released (but not nescessarily on the internet, they could choose to just send it out on a cd)

Before everyone starts pointing fingers and SPECULATING wait and see first.

The only thing I see when people post like this is possiable connections to other groups with people that are scared their product will be inferior (thus the need to slag off or belittle the compertition)
<br/>
<br/>
If were going to speculate here Moonshell/Moonlight has been gone for a fair few days from this forum but yen he still is working on bits and pieces for Moonshell (said he had a cold over a week ago), does anyone one know weather or not he's been paid to help/write the M3 software? I don't think it was ever mentioned where/how he worked out the M3 SD code (although he did say talking to someone at/had something to do with M3).
<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that those are only screenshots so it might just look similar heck they might of paid Moonshell for the interface... to be honnest at this point this is the equivalence of Nintendo killing El Hobito because their interfaces they designed look similar.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just going to wait and see what real information comes out I have no doubt that Moonshell/Moonlight will be the better for it eventually because well we respect him and it appears that he is a very resourcefull person.

Kudos to M3 if they have paid him to write them something Moonshell/Moonlight deserves it!

Does Chinese New Year have any effect on the Japanese?

Anyway, someone should email MoonLight about this startling news and development.

If he is not involved and they're stealing his code, he could probably sue.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, I've skimmed through this thread and found a lot of _wrong_ or misinformed statements. You should read up on the gpl, gpl-violations.org and some stories about the programmers of iptables.
<br/>
Iptables is a GPL-based firewall. It has been used in a lot of access points, routers and other embedded devices. The owners of iptables filed a lawsuit against some companies, forcing them to publish the source code. They won.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been involved in trying to get a decent uClinux distro on a router. This router used uClinux - patched to work with the specific device - but also some proprietary software. They published the patches, but not the source code of the proprietary software.
<br/>
<br/>
The M3-case is the same. They should publish the source code for moonshell on their website, as well as patches they've done to it.
<br/>
However, they don't have to publish the full source code for their kernel. If moonshell is loaded on top of their current kernel, all is in compliance with the GPL. The GPL is not THAT viral.
<br/>
<br/>
If moonshell is published under a BSD license, things are a little different. M3 has to mention they used code from moonshell, but that's it, no further obligations. Microsoft also used a BSD-licensed TCP/IP stack for windows 9x. If you look at the 'hosts' file on a MS windows 98 pc, you can still see this (starting from Win2k, they used their own TCP/IP stack).
<br/>
<br/>
As a side note: could somebody explain the attitude towards open-source in the GBA and DS homebrew community? I've found a lot of projects where the binary is put up for download, but the source code is nowhere to be found. Do all you DS devs work from ground up? (using libnds) Are there projects where real collaboration is taking place? Are there sourceforge.net project pages for DS homebrew?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Moonshell is under essentially a PD licence(public domain).  In that so far as I can tell it declares no licence for itself explicitely, only the notice Moonlight posted on the page now.  A pity really I doubt moonlight understands how well a commercial company can rape source code.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  it's varying libraries are under several different licenses.  Several are PD, or other very open licence like the BSD lincence.  Those allow anyone to do anything with them.  Though several require the copywrite notice to be supplied along with any releases, and require that proper props are given.
<br/>
<br/>
A few are under GPL.  Now.. I can see several of you dont know WTF this means.  The GPL licence requires that any dirivitive copies of the work MUST be released under the GPL licence.  DONT CONFUSE THIS.  It does not mean that works that LINK to this library have to be released under GPL.  It means if you take the source, and modify it, the modified source must also be provided under GPL, IF you release a binary version of it.
<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean?  It means if they release a compiled Moonshell derivitive binary that comes with built versions of everything moonshell links with, that M3 will be required by law(for any countries that signed into the international copywrite agreement[I dont think China signed into this btw]) to release the source code for the GPLed libraries, not for the modified moonshell, AT the request of anyone.  They dont have to have the source posted on their site, just have to supply it if you ask for it, and ONLY for the libs in moonshell under GPL.
<br/>
<br/>
So in summation, for this to be legal.  They must supply with their releases several notices for the libraries they have used, that show copywrite ownership and indimnification information for the varying libraries that require this(several do).
<br/>
<br/>
They must not misrepresent the origin of the software(and a credit is requested, but not required) for: zlib, libpng, gba_nds_fat
<br/>
<br/>
They must supply a notice for: giflib, libogg, libgsm
<br/>
<br/>
And they must, at request, supply souorce(and GPL satements) for: mpeg2dec, libmikmod, libmp3
<br/>
<br/>
(must also not promote themselves by mentioning xiph.org without permission)
<br/>
<br/>
Anything I didn't mention that is included I could not find a declared license for, software of this nature so far as I know is still owned under copywrite law by the origional designer, and that person can at any point, even after release of a commercial product including their software, declare the software under a particular license, and those using it are then bound by said license.(so be careful if you use any code that doesn't come with a notice of licence, you could get boned)
<br/>
<br/>
I feel I should also point out that any violations of these licenses can only be prosecuted by the copywrite owners, or representatives there of.  If any of these policies are broken by M3, feel free to contact the copywrite holders.
<br/>
<br/>
On a final notice, please don't discourage anyone, including companies, from the FAIR and LEGAL use of open source software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, if that's the case, that's not so bad I guess..I feel better knowing Moonlight has no problem with this.  I really hope (still) that they at least say 'Thank you Moonlight' somewhere, to at least give him a nod since the core of that firmware looks to be his software though. 
<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of when Jaleco (I think it was) used Loopy's PocketNES for a NES compliation GBA cart they sold....he was perfectly fine with it because, much like Moonlight he basically said if someone could use it for something useful they were welcome to it.  It had the same effect...the author was fine with it but it irritated the users of the software to no end. lol

I don't think I would say that neccesarily.  It's the stuff some people are doing with it that is illegal.  The same with GBA flash carts.  Just because someone has one of those it doesn't mean they are using it for 'illicit' purposes or some such thing.

Yea I covered that.  But the official statement made by moonlight implies that it is pd.  He said they were free to use it, and that he doesnt want honor or credit, and is just glad to see it used in such wonderful ways.  This is very indicitive of a PD nature... (I did say ESSENTIALLY)

However, the secion of the GPL that refers to having to put derivitive works under the GPL, is section 2.  And it refers to modified copies of the work.
<br/>
<br/>
It then goes on to say that you can copy or distribute the origional in the form of object or executable.  And only says in this case that you must provide the source code for the GPLed software.

Sure would be nice if they cleared up their intentions tho, cause thing are obviously confusing.

Anyway..  It should be worth pointing out that atleast one of the menioned libs(libmikmod) is under LGPL as well(I forget which one), so that one is atleast safe to link against.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Nphinity on Fri Feb 10, 2006 5:51 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
Actually, the Wikipedia articles states that nobody is sure for <span style="font-style: italic">certain</span> whether linking, particularly dynamic, counts as a derivative work or not; there's not been a court case about it involving the GPL, and even if there was, it's something that would differ from country to country. The court cases that <span style="font-style: italic">were</span> completed, were about whether the GPL was enforcable at all (spoiler: it is) (second spoiler: since the court cases so far have treated the GPL as a contract in clear contradiction to the FSF's views on the matter, it's fairly obvious that their interpretation of the license is unsurprisingly not to be relied on, if you ever thought that.)
<br/>
<br/>
The mere fact the binary is inside your program doesn't make it a derivative; I could zip up libmp3 with one of my programs and it doesn't magically become derivative because it's all in one file now. It's derivative if my source was <span style="font-style: italic">derived</span> from the GPL'd source according to the copyright law in my country. 
<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, even if linking can create a derivative, accessing GPL'd code through a generic interface almost certainly doesn't, so they could still avoid releasing their source code, if they wanted to, provided the GPL'd code is easily separatable into a distinct library. Which looks to be the case here.
<br/>
<br/>
And most importantly, does anybody even know whether they'll be making any changes yet? ;) If they effectively package up Moonshell as it is now without really changing anything beyond sticking an appropriate boot loader on the front, it's not like you'd be missing out on any source...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not really.  The device in and of itself can not decode anything.  Its simply code sitting on a memory chip.  Just like any other piece of software.  The execution of the code takes place on a seperate device(the NDS).  Now whether or not Frauenhaufers licences allow one to execut code on an arbitrary machine to decode mp3 audio is beyond me, this seems to have been tried a few times here and there, I think the only time royalties ended up being required was when there were profits to be made.
<br/>
<br/>
As you prolly know several linux distros do not come with mp3 playback capabilitiy for this very reason.  IMO it should be flat out illegal to distrbute anything that decodes mp3 at all in anyway without permission from the patent holders.  In this way, people will stop using crappy old patented mp3's and used good higher quality open source oggs instead.  Long live VORBIS!   (^_^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dont use WinLAME.. so I dunno... but seing as tho lame is for encoding MP3's and not OGGs.. um I dont knwo why it would be soo good.  Needs a good decoder, and possibly frequency converter... and a good OGG encoder.
<br/>
<br/>
OGG is not losless, except at the highest quality(even then, I think its sposed to be technically not losless dont quote me on that one).  It has varying quality levels you can use tho... just like MP3.. variable bit rate.
<br/>
<br/>
Some OGG encoders go by bitrate, others use quantinization factors for quality level.
