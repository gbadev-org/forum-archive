    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I've been wondering if there's a DS homebrew that can display pictures in a slideshow? I'm not looking for a manual picture viewer like moonshell or dsorganize (have both already), but something that can display my pictures/photos, possibly resize them to fit the DS screen and after a certain amount of time continue onto the next picture? Thanks for reading. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Closest thing I can think of would be one piece of GBA homebrew:  the GBA JPEG Viewer, which has slideshow capability.  It will automatically resize images to fit the 240x160 screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the main reason why there is no slideshow type application is because directory listings has only been added to fatlib quite recently. The only way to do it would have been to compile a binary with the images built into the ROM, or have the images in a directory in the root with images named "Image001.jpg" etc. But now I think with the new fatlib this could be a good idea, I might knock one up with jpg &amp; png support. I have the libs for those formats working on DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the replies guys, and thanks for explaining the situation headspin. It might even tempt me to start homebrewing, but it's much appreciated if someone does knock something up. Thanks again!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
