    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have wrote on three different places here on the forum but havent got one single reply... 
<br/>
I have also wrote on the IRC channel but none ever answer me.
<br/>
<br/>
So...
<br/>
<br/>
I have the Nintendo USB Wifi adapter with the Wlan driver I got from a guide here. Im using a M3 Lite with a microSD card and all my wifi games works fine.
<br/>
I have searched this forum for tips but when Im starting Beup I get connected with my computer but handshaking never stops!!
<br/>
I have tried all different 0.3 version I have found here but noone works.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone help me with this?
<br/>
<br/>
And please dont lock this thread. I have read every post I've found about this but there is so many questions ppl havent got answered.
<br/>
<br/>
Why does Beup keeps handshaking forever? Doesnt anyone know the answer to this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And it works with all my wifi games yes.

<br/>
In Beup I get connected to my PC but it wont stop handshaking.

Do you mean the 46 pages buep thread or the 24 pages one? That's what I've been saying is the problem with these gigantor threads. There is no orginization, simply chronological.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
