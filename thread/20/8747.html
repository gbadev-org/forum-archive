The bricker can't flash the whole firmware without SL1. Only the unprotected part. The protected part lets you recover to FlashMe (if you had it installed, otherwise you have to ppflash) if your unprotected firmware gets nuked.

True, but they would probably have to incorporate the check into the game code, or let the game execute downloaded code, which is the same security hole that let homebrew and piracy flourish on the Gamecube, in Phantasy Star Online I&amp;II.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I am pretty sure that <span style="font-style: italic">Mario Kart DS</span> executes downloaded code from an SSL server. SSL avoids the <span style="font-style: italic">PSO</span> loophole by using RSA public-key crypto to verify that the code comes from a Nintendo server.
<br/>
<br/>
Or they could check it in the game code: put a signature into future firmware versions, and then have the game check the signature of newer firmware versions and special-case older firmware versions.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Even then, there are some DSs out there, mine included that has all pages of the firmware, except for the upper 8 reserved by nintendo write protected.  In cases like this, the bricker cannot kill the DS without SL1 being shorted.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Current hypothesis over at That Pirate Board is that MKDS downloads code from an HTTPS site that checks <span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span> some area of the DS card in SLOT-1, and if it's not the secure area of an authentic MKDS cart, you can't log on.

You can't read the secure area after the card has been put into data mode, which is done by the BIOS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Friend codes are generated by combining the NWFCID and the Gamecart ID. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they banned by Gamecard IDs when they noticed that 'several' had connected with the same Gamecart?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
