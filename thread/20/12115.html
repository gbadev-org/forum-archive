    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Spent all day to figure out that this thing is not compatible. There is no info on the box, nor on the card itself about revission, so it`s really hard to figure.
<br/>
Also device supports AdHoc with the software it comes with. DS sees AP, but on every test connect it gives error "Couldn`t connect to AP...". 
<br/>
The driver that is installed for device is named after chip, so this one named:
<br/>
RT61, but DS compatible are RT2500 or RT2560. Also found on disc pdf file titled "Declaration  of Conformity" where indeed is written that this is v4.1.
<br/>
Tried to install all those other drivers (RT2500 original, RT2560 by firefly) by adding VID\PID strings in inf files, but that nothing of a help. Same goes for bridging, sharing... I`m out of ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, nothing useful, but maybe this could help someone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It`s a funny thing, though, but if you look at this document you may see some interesting changes to the drivers... like

2. Fix multicast encryption issue if using ZeroConfig.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
So the struggle goes on.
<br/>
EDIT: So "soft AP" and "Ad-Hoc" is not the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How can you tell what revision it is, if you are saying it isn't listed on the box or the card?
<br/>
<br/>
And no, Ad-Hoc is not the same thing as soft AP, or Master mode. The DS cannot connect to Ad-Hoc networks (even though it will show them when you search for APs).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only way I think of is by installing this card into PC and looking for driver that is installed for it (there is 2 drivers on disk v.4.0 RT2500 &amp; v.4.1 RT61).
<br/>
<br/>
But that`s really doesn`t matter now. Here`s a tutorial for configuring your Linksys WMP54G v.4.1 (RT61 chip) for DS:
<br/>
1. Install card &amp; drivers from CD.
<br/>
2. Go to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ralinktech.com" target="_blank">Ralink`s site</a> -&gt; Support -&gt; Windows &amp; download appropriate pack.
<br/>
3. Install it, you should have Ralink Wireless Lan Card icon in your tray. Right click on it, select switch to soft AP.
<br/>
4. Share your internet connection (ethernet card).
<br/>
<br/>
That`s all. Commercial games &amp; homebrew should work. Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
