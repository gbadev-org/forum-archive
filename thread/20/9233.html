    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi! This is my first post so don't be too hard :P
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to know if its possible to convert a game I made in java into a nds rom. Even if the ds isn't powerful enough to play a java game I was thinking maby a small one? Or a program to convert the java code into nds code?
<br/>
<br/>
Im not too sure if this is possible, I just thought it would be cool to play a game I made on my ds.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But to answer your question: I don't think so. I think the dev kits only work with ASM and C/C++.

Correct me if I'm wrong...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It's obvious that a Java VM is out of the question, but it seems to me that if someone can cross-compile gcc for DS, I dont see why GCJ wouldn't be feasble without a little work. (Although I've never gotten GCJ to work on my own PC, so I'm probably not in a good position to question this)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If Classpath depends on POSIX and X11 functionality that is not implemented in newlib, then yes. Such a dependency is likely.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

i tried to search into it, but it is pretty hairy (the wikipedia entry for virtual machines is a good start)... so ill stick to c
