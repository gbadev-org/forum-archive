    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Erm, you'd have to port it as a library that can be integrated into homebrew apps during development...
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if TS is designed with this in mind, but I'm pretty sure it's not the case, so you might end up having to write a lot of new code...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It  isn't open source either. It would be a lot easier to just write a custom VoIP client/server for the DS than try to replicate an existing, close source, product.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even a stand alone TeamSpeak app would be nice.. though Nintendo stuck that stupid Mic jack on it.. But you could easily set it to VOX and wear a headset when playing colaborative games on a PC as well as just use the internal mic if you really need to..  Or, set it to allow you to press ANY buttons for "talk" and it wouldn't be much trouble to push something to talk..  Either way, a pretty cool idea, be it a lib for other homebrew games or a stand alone app..

<br/>
I say go for it!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
