    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Being quite a big Stepmania fan, I've been randomly searching on Google for "Stepmania PSP" and "Stepmania DS" for the last year or so to see if something would come up, and I just discovered that there is an actual PSP port now D:  DANG IT!  I swore to myself I wouldn't get a PSP... grrrrrrr &gt;_&lt; *bangs head into wall*
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, this is more of a "would it even be possible for a Stepmania DS" topic.  I have no idea how CPU intensive mp3 and ogg audio decoding is (I do know mp3 is less than ogg though), but I really don't think moving 2D arrows could really tax the CPU much at all :P.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Mp3 decoding can be done on ARM7, reading in the music from FAT.
<br/>
That leaves ARM9 (the main CPU of the DS) free for whatever you want to do; should be more than capable of "making arrows move" and such. ;)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now, using DSerial for the interface, and putting pressure/motion sensors on your shoes.. That would be worth taking a look at..  course.. knowing where to step might be a problem.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In The Groove no longer exists. It was a commercialization of StepMania. Roxor had to give the product to Konami to settle a patent lawsuit.

If you have no problems using buttons, then try AmplituDS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
And a technical reason: The StepMania engine had trouble running on a PlayStation 2, let alone a DS. It would be more work than just taking StepMania and making a new back end. It would have to be a rewrite, like DWI or FFR or Pydance.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

- Support official Stepmania files

- offer a way to use gif's as a background (while dancing on "the floor")

- Just rock.
