    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So last thursday night I was up late converting movies to DPG to copy them onto my M3 adapter. I have a long plane ride on friday, and as soon as I get on i start watching them. everything's working fine. i start using dsorganize's calculator to take care of some homework. after that, i'm messing around in dso and i create a drawing in the paint app. i hit save, and DSO starts getting all glitchy.
<br/>
<br/>
i restart my ds and open DSO again. it says it can't find the /dsorganize folder and can't load any of my files. when i open the file browser, it can't find ANY files or directories in my SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
when i run moonshell, the same is true: it says it can't find the /shell folder, so it doesn't open. none of my homebrew programs at all can access any files on my SD card. Everything on the M3 works fine (loading homebrew apps, etc.) but no programs can read from the card.
<br/>
<br/>
in addition, i haven't been able to get my DS to connect to any wifi hotspots since then, even in commercial games. i'm still not at home, so i haven't been able to test it on any hotspots that I KNOW used to work, but each hotspot i try i get the same error message.
<br/>
<br/>
it's an early DS lite, and an M3 SD (the oldest version). I'm using flashme v7, i believe. if anyone has any ideas or suggestions for what's wrong or how to fix it, it'd be very much appreciated.<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: DS Lite &amp; Phat (both FlashMe v7), M3 Perfect SD, PassKey 1, Max Media Launcher, SanDisk 1GB SD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you tried using chkdsk? The procedure in Windows 2000 is as follows: In My Computer, right-click your SD writer &gt; Properties &gt; Tools &gt; Check Now. Or in Command Prompt:

(replace J with your SD writer's mount point)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In some cases, using Windows' error checking tools would fix it, though not necessarily recover everything. Other times it would just create 10000 files (exactly) of garbage and not help, and I'd have to format the card.

The scan for bad sectors is responsible for the majority of the time that it takes to format a volume.
<br/>
<br/>
If you choose the Quick format option, format removes files from the partition, but does not scan the disk for bad sectors. Only use this option if your hard disk has been previously formatted and you are sure that your hard disk is not damaged.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> <a class="postlink" href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=302686" target="_blank">Perhaps</a>?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-xtra.com" target="_blank">http://www.ds-xtra.com</a>
