    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't really call it a fake, rather just wishful thinking.  From what I can gather there is only one coder working on it at the moment and they don't have the necessary skills for it to happen.

Personally I think it's a bit of a waste of time.  Streaming video to the DS has been mentioned before in this forum and the challenge is to get a 256x192 video stream and an audio stream into 120kB/s worth of bandwidth, that is in a format that can be uncompressed on the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Hmm. 2 mbit should be more than enough for streaming video and audio to one screen with the right compression. Would need special streams though, so that would mean that the online stream would have to be a) made for the program b) grabbed and repacked by a computer middleman.
<br/>
<br/>
Would be quite awesome to put up a personal server that could grab and convert YouTube/Stage6 videos :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It can be done without any problems.  Of course, the real question is quality.  Make it 127x96 at 5fps and you have plenty of bandwidth.  Now, is anyone going to want to watch that?  Probably not.. but it can be done.
<br/>
<br/>
The real question, is can you fit something watchable into the current bandwidth?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
