    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm starting up a ds homebrew site for reviews of software and hardware an as a site for  guides, like how to install flashme. I don't have much hardware to write on, so I need help.
<br/>
<br/>
The site uses Drupal, so people can register and submit articles. Please sign up and write guides for running programs or setting up hardware. I don't need people to write guides on setting up GBAMP things. I can do that. I need people to write guides and reviews for other hardware though, like M3 and Supercard.

Sorry if this is seen as a promotion for another site, cuz I guess it kinda is.  I just need people to write guides and reviews.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by quadomatic on Wed Jul 12, 2006 6:38 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dshacker posted the first guide on an Intro to Homebrew! I'm not sure if it's the same one as here, but thx dshacker!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in India right now, the opposite side of the world from my home in the states, and it's 10:20 PM right now. Tomorrow morning i'm going someplace where there are no computers or internet. I'll be there for 3 days. Hopefully there will be more guides when I get back.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, just a note (it's in the FAQ on the site), when you post something it won't appear on the site right away. I need to see what was written before it goes anywhere. Since I won't be around for 3 days, the guides won't be visible for 3 days.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wow.. I kinda really like your AutoIndex script.. I just wish it could support individual file information pages or something so you could include a url/image/comments/etc on one page instead of having a url file, etc..  But I really like the layout and organization it uses..  And the fact that you can easily have multiple files like .ds.gba, .nds, and .sc.nds in one directory.. as well as have archived versions..
<br/>
<br/>
Would you be mad if I headed over to autoindex.sf.net and used that same script on ndshb.com?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
