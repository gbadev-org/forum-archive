I'm quite shocked. Internal memory? Interesting. No more slot-2? Poor Opera... I hope it has more onboard memory. Larger screens? Yes please.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, with the DS still selling loads I doubt we'll see it soon. Very interesting still.

I hope homebrew will work on it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Probably not. Once this revision is officially announced, Nintendo will probably switch to a combination of RSA code signing for new games and ARM9/ARM7 binary whitelisting for old games. The only thing that had been holding this up was a lack of space in firmware to hold the whitelist, and the "onboard storage" would be more than big enough to hold a whitelist of about 4,000 32-byte records, one for each title.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The only official SLOT-2 accessories made exclusively for the DS that I've seen in stores were the rumble pak (included with some pinball game or sold separately) and the RAM pak (included with Nintendo DS Browser); both of those could be integrated into the new design.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Anyway, even if there is protection - it's been broken before, it'll get broken again!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No Slot-2? What was wrong with the slimmed-down Lite carts? Larger screens? No thanks-- the current screens are already large enough at 108.5dpi, that's about double the pixel size my cellphone has. If Nintendo decides to upgrade the DS with more memory, I'd at least expect they upgrade the entire platform, with a higher clockspeed and optional higher resolution (352x288, to fit the larger screens with decent DPI).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that would mean game developers would need to develop games essentially for two subplatforms, but hey! That's what PC developers have been doing with varying hardware configurations for about two decades! Not to mention MIDP2/J2ME developers, as any phone can have a resolution varying between 128x160 and 320x480, and processor speed and Java implementations vary even more per manufacturer and model. And for the Wii, there is also a difference between 480i, 480p, and 576i, so I don't think it'll be a big issue.
<br/>
<br/>
What I am looking forward to is better integration with the Wii, if they stuff in a motion sensor and BlueTooth (although theoretically, a DS could connect to the Wii by ad-hoc WiFi instead of BlueTooth), you could use it as a controller with status display (I'm thinking ammo and minimap display on Metroid).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Bear in mind that IGN are a large media company who film producers are more than happy to quote reviews from (indicating notability). Also note that any web based media site will be laden with advertising. Having said that it has no more advertising space than cnet!
<br/>
<br/>
As for the analyst, that's pretty much common sense about gamer purchases, hardly a radical theory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh.. so someone leaked the new handheld, which probably has nothing to do with the DS directly, but was interpret as such..  Will release November of 2009 or 10, and will not actually be available on shelves till 8-10 months later. If your lucky.  funny!
<br/>
<br/>
And they can honestly say it's not a DS redesign, because it's probably a whole new design.  Just as the DS was backward compatible, the new handheld may still play DS games, but also play it's own games as well.  So, just because it doesn't have a GBA Port doesn't mean it won't have an expansion port of some kind.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
