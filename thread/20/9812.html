    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I saw this game in a news item posted on drunkencoders.com, has anyone had a chance to try it out?  It looks interesting.  A Smash Bros. game on DS would be incredible, especially if you were able to play against people over wifi.

I think that is a GBA game and this is a NDS game, so it is different. Anyways, I think "Super Smash Brother Tactics" is good name for this game.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
