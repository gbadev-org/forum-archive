I just released this demo for Neoflash forums... but suddenly, today I've turned on my computer and seen it on <a href="http://www.gbarl.it" target="_blank">www.gbarl.it</a> or <a href="http://nintendo-ds.dcemu.co.uk/starwarsdiesolo.shtml" target="_blank">http://nintendo-ds.dcemu.co.uk/starwarsdiesolo.shtml</a> and even here... it's gone too quickly for me... anyway as you can read in all those places:

&lt;_&lt;
<br/>
yeah it was rude but not (completly)wrong.Not much is out yet.
<br/>
But this game contains much potential.
<br/>
I mean: a <span style="font-weight: bold">2D</span> Star wars shoot'em up!!
<br/>
Millions have been waiting for such a thing.
<br/>
Add star wars soundtrack+soundeffects,other controlls(touchscreen controls=not good for shoot em up),collisions and PLEASE shrink the mainship(x-wing) a bit(it's far too big) and it will be an awesome game.
<br/>
I can't wait for the forthcoming updates.
<br/>
keep up the great work chava!<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It works with my loader too. You just have to remove the first 0x200 bytes with a hex editor. It is basically an NDS with a loader prepended, which needs to be removed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
