Depending on the software you use to write to your flash cart, renaming flashme.nds as flashme.gba may work.
<br/>
<br/>
It it doesn't, then download <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/ndsloader.bin" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/ndsloader.bin</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Then run this:

MaHe: So, does the amount of flash protected by the SL 1 contact vary between machines?

BTW, It took me ages to track down this thread. They do great work with the new firmware, but telling us WHY we should want it would be helpful!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#84172 - HyperHacker - Sat May 20, 2006 9:39 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most systems have only the first quarter of the firmware protected. It's enough to contain an emergency bootstrap (as FlashMe has), but Nintendo didn't put one in (too easy to run unsigned code that way), so if those systems get bricked and don't have FlashMe, they're toast unless you can solder. Some newer ones have all but the last 8K (or is it 8 pages?) protected, which hold the configuration, so they're bricker-proof so long as you don't short SL1 (a bricker can only delete your settings, the system will still work). This unfortunately means you have to short SL1 for every update, but it's a rather small price to pay IMO. (Unless you have DSLite. Dunno how much is protected on them, though.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
