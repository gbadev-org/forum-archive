    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@quadomatic: it's a patch, you need to patch your rom with our patcher...
<br/>
before somebody asks, it's not possible to use standard patches like ips or ppf, so we ended writing our own patcher and format...
<br/>
<br/>
@knightofdragon: i studyed the rom a lot, and now there are only few mistery left to solve, mostly in the koma text part (i've only gave it a rapid look, but dunno if it's so difficult), and the font hacking...
<br/>
we already managed to resize the font so 4 lines per page can be shown instead of 3, but it's still too spaced, and i can't find a way to make it less spaced....
<br/>
however, i'm somehow interested in your work, maybye you found something we still haven't found...

Why's that?  Just curious. :)  (I don't know a heck of a lot about the limitations of say the IPS format...so please don't shoot me if it should be obvious why you can't use it.  ^_^)  Good luck on this by the way...this is a fun game, it would be interesting to see it in English.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Ah, it is utilizing NDS tool...so it's decompiling, patching, then recompiling the ROM?  Interesting. :)  I wish I knew more about that stuff, so many different parts of the NDS file format I'm unsure of as far as what their purpose is.  Any hacks I've made have gone the 'cheese' route of re-sizing a file and inserting it in place of another...works well for some stuff like playing in the beta testing area of the MP:H First Hunt demo though.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">unfortunately, at the moment asm hacking of the rom is impossible, or, impossible for us, cause without a nds real time debugger we can do nothing...
<br/>
of course with that we would implement a vwf...
<br/>
<br/>
@the 9th sage: know more about what? :P
<br/>
however ips format (with is 16mb limitations) and ppf are not good cause, the rom, after being extracted and recompressed with the ndstool (and that's the only way i know to edit files and reinsert them...), is totally different from the original, and it will end up being a patch as big as the rom...
<br/>
and that's no good xD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, the different parts that make up an NDS format file.  I have no idea what some of that stuff is, like the overlays.
