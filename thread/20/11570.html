    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I haven't had time to try it yet, but can you copy level from Mario vs Donkey Kong 2 onto your computer and back again to make backup? I would try changing DNS setting to your own computer and write a server software that will copy the file for you, but I don't know how hard it is because I have never tried. Does anyone else know?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you want to do it the hard way, fine.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How does the wifi level transfer work? Is it DS to DS only, or does it let you upload over the internet?
<br/>
<br/>
If it's DS to DS only, it will be much harder to crack, and will require a special card with special drivers (like wifime). If it's uploading over the internet, then all you need is a packet sniffer, like Ethereal (aka WireShark). Simply start it up, set it to listen, then upload the file. Then you can sort through the packet dumps, and if you're lucky, they'll use some standard protocol like HTTP POST. (I know Animal Crossing:WW uses HTTP for a few things)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
