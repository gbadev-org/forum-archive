    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to play some dpg movies with moonshell but when i boot the _BOOT_MP_EXFS.ds.gba it says that fat 12 is not supported and the dpg files don't show up. I read that the format has to be fat 16, but i don't know how to format my SD card to fat 16. When i click properties on the drive with the card it just says "FAT" in the window where the format is selected. Can somebody help me out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
