    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I've got an Idea on how to protect our DSes from "bad" software. We would need a new firmware and i'm not sure this can be done...
<br/>
The new firmware would test the signature of the code (1024 bit RSA like a normal DS). But instead of testing for one sig (Nintendos), it would test for 3 sigs and runs the code only, if it is signed with one of the 3 sigs. 
<br/>
The first would be Nintendos (for official, legal games).
<br/>
The secound would be a sig for the homebrew scene.
<br/>
The third can be choosen before flashing.
<br/>
<br/>
If you write your own program, you would sign it with your own private key and run it for testing on your DS. if you want to share it, you send your sourcecode to a thrusted person (only he - or a few thrusted persons - has the private key from the homebrew sig), he tests your program and take a look at the sources. Than signes it and sends it back. This programm can now run on all flashed DSes and can be shared any way you want.
<br/>
<br/>
Can unthrusted Software run on your DS?
<br/>
No, only Software form Nintendo, tested by a thrusted person or written by you.
<br/>
<br/>
How can I share a beta version for quick testing?
<br/>
Send it unsigned. If someone wants to try it, he has to thrust you and signe it himself (with his key). 
<br/>
<br/>
What if i don't want to share my sourcecode?
<br/>
You don't make it open source, you just show it one person. If you don't want to do that, you will have to life with it and share it unsigned (so anyone will know that he has to be carefull...)
<br/>
<br/>
Can I run everything i download anywhere?
<br/>
You can try it. If it runs, it's tested, "not bad" code. If it's a virus, some pirated stuff or any other suspicios code, it will never get a signature! So it will not work and you are save.
<br/>
<br/>
Would this work?

You don't like that a few people have the control over the signing but you're fine with a few people have control over the thrusted sites? Seems to be the same for me...
<br/>
<br/>
What about new smaler webpages with collections of the "best homebrew tetris versions" or the "top 10 graphic demos"? You wouldn't thrust these guyes and have to seek for these programs on thrusted sites... But you could download homebrew and homebrew collections from everywhere (including p2p), because only thrused code gets a sig!
<br/>
<br/>
Do you thrust pouet.net? Never heared of it? It's a big demo site with tons of demos for the gba, perhaps someday for the DS. you don't know it you don't thrust it, but there you have a good sorted collection of graphic demos with 0 searching.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know if anything like this is possible at all with the community's present knowledge of the firmware, but another idea would be to include a warning in the firmware that pops up if a homebrew program is unsigned, so you wouldn't have to sign unsigned code before running it.
<br/>
<br/>
But I think this sould be left an option. People who want the security could flash the new firmware, people who don't want it sould still be able to run all homebrew, signed or unsigned, with the current FlashMe.

That routine could be crypted and gets decrypted and executed only once in 10 runs (and only if it doesn't detect an emu)...
<br/>
You can't check for that maschine instruction and you can't run it to see if that instruction gets executed.
<br/>
<br/>
But you could write a virus scaner for already known virii. This could run from gbamp on your ds (build in in your multiboot loader program?). If you try to run a known virus it just prints "i can't do that dave..." ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Would be a easy alternative to new firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you also run only trusted software on your computer? I think not.

Do you sign the programs you write for PC with the HobbyProgrammersKey? I think not.

<br/>
Guess what, anybody could trash your motherboard's BIOS or format the hard drive. Ever heard of rootkits? And still you download software from shady non-trusted sites.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, any coder who has enough skills to read a simple datasheet could easily write a NDS bricker... in 5 minutes. But why would a person who spends his spare time writing homebrew games and applications (generally for fun and recognition) shoot himself in the foot by releasing a bricker? The very idea of "all homebrewers" (as if they form a tightly-knit comany) uniting in their evil quest to brick every DS out there is quite stupid and out-of touch with reality. And frankly, it's also quite insulting.

Nope. Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, and Linux have memory and I/O protection. Only an app running as admin can access hard drive sectors by number or overwrite the BIOS chip. Besides, a lot of motherboards have a double-size BIOS chip to allow for anti-brick protection as part of the POST (power-on self-test), such that if the content of the BIOS chip doesn't match the encrypted checksum, it falls back to the last known good configuration in the other half of the flash chip.
<br/>
<br/>
Consoles, on the other hand, generally don't have such a full-featured privilege system. Licensed games run as admin, and the intent is that everything else doesn't run at all.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

i think we all owe df a lot more than that, without his work id be suprised if we had passmes/wifimes/flashmes at all. df has done a GREAT deal of good work for the ds scene, and one single dumbass thing. 
<br/>
<br/>
i know exactly how he feels, i used to write millions of 'doors' (games) for BBSs on the amiga, got quite a name for myself. then randomly when drunk decided to add an evil back door to one of my most popular doors...and used it to take control of another persons bbs. clever me picked on a part time police officers bbs. eventually i did recover from the complete humilation and the complete lack of trust i gained, but i never wrote another door, and my old (trojan free) doors soon disapeared completely.
<br/>
<br/>
at least df was doing what he was doing for the right reasons, even if they were slightly misguided and it was all blown out of proportion. i actually know someone who bricked his ds with it tho. good thing is he was a dumb pirate and it allowed me to laugh at him (i even loaned him my passme coz he wanted to try it)...i did tell him to put flashme on (mainly so i could get my passme back sooner)...but he wanted to see if the loader worked before he 'risked' flashing his firmware. i can assure u he feels rather silly.
<br/>
