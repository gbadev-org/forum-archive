<br/>
<br/>
My DS won't connect to the server, the following description is given:
<br/>
<br/>
Unable to obtain an IP address. Move within range of the access point or check DHCP settings. For help, visit <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com." target="_blank">www.nintendowifi.com.</a> Well I've been to that site, but without succes. I'm using the softAP, maybe that will help to give a answer on my question.

Look there. It seems manually setting your ip and stuff works for some people. Set it to something different.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If its with the gigabyte drivers and the ralink card, then you need to connect the computer(laptop, whatever) via ethernet(or a secondary wireless card) to the Intarweb, then the AP(the ralink card) should be bridged, under Network Connections (if using Win XP). 
<br/>
<br/>
To bridge, just select both cards(Ethernet/Secondary Wireless, and Wireless, and right click, and click on "bridge connections")
<br/>
<br/>
If it fails at first, try, try again!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I believe I tried bridging before, and it didn't work too well. ICS works, but not as good as a direct connection. I'm behind another router anyway. It's wireless, but Nintendo had to make the DS's connection hardware suck (It will only work right if I set the transfer rate to 2mbps, which is silly).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
