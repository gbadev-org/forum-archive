    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm still using the .99 release actually i think...somewhere arround that...it works and I heard about problems with video playback with the newer versions so I never upgraded...though..i haven't realy been keeping up with moonshell anymore.  I'll probally just stick with the version i have since it works realy well and I have my custom skin i made for it which i really like.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: The day i'm bored and having nothign else to do..i'll probaly get the newest moonshell and try it out and make sure it works fine for me :-P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
