    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I bought Mario Kart DS, nothing two special about that, but it also happens that I have two DS'es, One silver and one blue.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing I noticed was that on the blue DS it seems like there's interlacing being done. On moving screens on the blue one there are horizontal stripes (quite annoying, once you've played on a silver DS).
<br/>
<br/>
I must tell you that the silver DS has a (borrowed) firmware from some guy in the US. Have there been any reports on the above?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBC was "interlaced". The GBA was "interlaced". This isn't the same as actual TV interlacing; instead it means that every other line in every other frame is drawn darker.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps they switched back to the supplier of the screens from the Micro and the new SP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

When driving in dark grey coloured road in Mario Kart my DS has that horizontal interlacing.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that the fault is on the LCD screen or in some DS's components?<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Well, this is true to an extend. I just adjusted mine and it seems it only adjusts the brightness of the screen. This will do NOTHING about the annoying lines I experience while playing Mario Kart or any other fast-moving game.

The trimpot requires <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> fine adjustment. Get a game where at the push of a button you can see the lines, then slowly adjust it until they fade away.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, I used those dials and managed to get rid of the annoying interference. I used Mario Kart for testing.
<br/>
Those dials are for adjusting the flickering (stated by Nintendo). Of course they will affect your screen contrast (screen comes grey if "wrong" setting is set), but not for the LEDs brightness, bummer. 
<br/>
<br/>
Seems that the upper LCD's backlight LED's are yellowish ones. Only my DS's bottom screen has white backround light LEDs.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: darkblue">Nintendo:
<br/>
"A positive and negative voltage controls Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). The "contrast control" that you are referring to is actually a flicker control. The adjustment is used to synchronize the positive and negative voltages. If these voltages are out of adjustment then the LCD will no longer respond correctly. The result will be an excess charge built up in the liquid crystal and permanently damage the LCD. The excessive charge gives the appearance of a brighter screen because the liquid crystal is not reacting properly to the voltages applied. When the adjustment of the voltages is correct the changing polarities will not allow a charge to build up, which prolongs the LCD life.
<br/>
This adjustment is set by the manufacturer or must be performed by a qualified Nintendo Technician using proper equipment (Proper lighting, special tools, test equipment and software). Adjusting the flicker without the proper tools and lighting will put the voltages out of sync and may cause damage to the unit."</span><br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
