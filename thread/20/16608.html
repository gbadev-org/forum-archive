    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I currently own a Cyclos Ds Evolution flash cart. I've installed all the latest moonshell files on it and everything, and it was working fine for me for a couple of days. But starting from yesterday, everytime i selected it from the menu, it would run, but then immediately freeze up on me. this has happened countless times already. I've tried reinstalling it over and over again. Reformatting it doesn't do anything either. Any help that can be given would be most appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
