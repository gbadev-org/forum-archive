A brand new, DSLinux only (until a new FW comes out, that is), miniSD adapter/memory extension/RS232 adapter is still in the prototype phase, but is already working. It can get really useful for developers, IMO.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and BTW - no SRAM is built-in ATM. This means no PassME2.

Hopefully he can include some SRAM plus allow for more DS accessible RAM.
<br/>
but that the moment.. its still pretty interesting.. Serial included for real nerds.

right now it seems supercard CF,

is the only thing that can handle the requirments of XIP with windows :P...

It's a pretty big topic.  I'll try to give you the basics of ram useage from the different ways to run  dslinux.
<br/>
<br/>
Running from WMB:
<br/>
Everything has to fit inside the DS's 4mb of ram.
<br/>
<br/>
GBAMP &amp; M3:
<br/>
Programs are stored on the Compact Flash cart, but have to be copied into system ram to be run.
<br/>
<br/>
Traditional Flash Cart:
<br/>
Programs can use XIP to run directly from the flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
Supercard:
<br/>
Programs can be stored on the flash cart, but can be copied to the supercard ram, and be executed from there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The M3 should be able to work the same way the Supercard does, but it is not known how to switch the M3 between from being able to write to the ram to being able to access the compact flash card.  Hopefully either the M3 team will release the needed info, or someone will reverse engineer the M3 firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, I wondered if it was something to do with the on-board RAM.  I'm sure somebody'll figure it out eventually (hope so at least...I posess an M3, I have no desire to buy a Supercard too).  :)  Besides the Supercard, would I be right in guessing that the two partition version of the GBAMP build would be lowest after that?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, I'd forgotten about that.  I think it is possible to use the CF and RAM at the same time...the M3 people have a feature now (that doesn't work that well yet, but it still is there) where you can play a game from compact flash directly and it simualtes the GBA-NDS 'link' feature of some games by loading the GBA game into the RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
I wish all these companies would release information to the general public about how this stuff works so no one had to reverse engineer it. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
