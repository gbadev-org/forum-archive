    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just an idea...
<br/>
<br/>
Have a framework to either load multiple NDS files
<br/>
<br/>
or 
<br/>
<br/>
To have a plugin system where multiple applications an be used.
<br/>
<br/>
Uses of this can be using beup while aimds or playing a homebrew game while listening to music...the possibilities are endless<br/>_________________<br/>White DS --- Supercard SD --- Passcard ---

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not possible. The DS does not have a built in multitasking operating system. Games are created to take exclusive control over the hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
You can create plugins for WinDS or Moonshell which is about as close to running multiple processes on the DS as you'll get.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The best bet, in my opinion, is programs aware of those around them, so they can make use of each-other.
<br/>
This has been discussed in one of the web browser threads, and I have so far put pen to paper for the idea once, filling an entire 8.5/11 page (which is quite a good sign!).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the other solution which works beautifully and actually does multi task is DSLinux, which now beats Opera DS hands down with the following:
<br/>
Listening to music using madplay while browsing the web via Links and using nxview (in Nano-X) in order to view various images.
<br/>
All at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
It works beautifully, and I still have over 25 MB of RAM to spare! :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
An NDS solution is more universal, and much more friendly.
<br/>
<br/>
Its a shame Moonshell wasnt designed around multitasking a few things (music+text) mainly.
<br/>
The GBAMP's built in software can do Wave files  + TXT which I always used to use that before I got a passme.

Hehehe, yeah, I'll bet DSLinux does beat Opera DS hands down when it comes to playing music and using nxview while browsing :-)

As for those people who complained that (DS)Linux is too hard to use...learn. Really, Linux is not actually that hard. If you can compile DS homebrew then you can sure as hell learn how to use Linux ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

The term is a swap file, and any attempt at one would destroy any flash media (CF/SD cards) pretty quickly as they can only survive a few hundred thousand writes. Also, just loading another .nds wouldn't be any good as the programs would (and for that matter, would have to) re-init themselves each time. All you'd get is a few different programs' boot screens cycling, that is assuming you managed to modify them to not destroy your swapping code.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
