I thought the instructions were quite clear.

Flash an SNES rom to your flashcart, and run the .nds file. (With wireless multiboot, because you've already got the SNES rom on your cart)

Obviously, if you have no way to raw write just the SNES rom onto your cart, you're screwed for now. From the way he has this set up right now, I'm guessing it's probably only temporary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is also easier...  and is also the method described in the readme with the newest version.  By the way, this emulator is awesome!  I really like to see such great speed and (on games that work) good graphics and sound.

Is it using GBA gamma control on the Nintendo DS? My tests indicate that the DS's gamma is closer to that of the Game Boy Player or an emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
If you use MS-DOS copy, make sure to use the /b switch (<span style="font-weight: bold">/b</span> not <span style="font-weight: bold">b/</span>, tatsui), or it'll stop working at the first 0x1A byte, which indicated end-of-file for text files in MS-DOS 1.0.

It was taken down, because of the same guy who snatched a domain for pocketSNES long ago, and made a fake site for it. This particular person decided to snatch a domain for snesDS, and put up another site for it.

Since then, he's taken it down, so hopefully....

I was thinking of getting a flashcart for some homebrew games, apps, and whatnot, and I think this seals the deal. What product(s) do I need so that I can run this SNES emulator as well as homebrew GBA roms and apps?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
You need:
<br/>
<br/>
-A DS
<br/>
-A GBA flashcart with either
<br/>
 (a) its own standalone cart flasher
<br/>
 (b) a GBA and compatible software (would come with the cart)
<br/>
-Some way of making your DS boot off the GBA slot, either
<br/>
 (a) PassMe
<br/>
 (b) WiFiMe
<br/>
 (c) FlashMe
<br/>
<br/>
A Neo Flash kit would cover the 2nd and 3rd, but you have to supply your own DS :)
<br/>
<br/>
The WiFiMe option would require you to have a compatible Wireless NIC installed (look at <a class="postlink" href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">this</a> page for a good list of cards -- I would recommend a PCI card over a USB adapter.  I don't know off hand if the USB adapters work).
<br/>
<br/>
The FlashMe option would require you to use either the PassMe of WiFiMe to upgrade your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The PassMe option is just plain annoying if you ask me.  A great little gadget, but klunky.
<br/>
<br/>
As for choosing a flash cart, I can only say that I like my Flash2Advance, and I've heard good things about the EZ Flash Advance carts, but definately do some research first, then shop for prices.  Some sites will bleed you dry, others have fair pricing.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

From what I've tried, you can add Pocky and Rocky (although it has some slight sound problems) and strangely, the game Brandish! to that list (although for some reason when you aren't moving it's a bit flickery).  I say strangely because I wasn't actually expecting this game to work at all. :P
<br/>
<br/>
And Soulblazer works pretty well to a point, then it crashes...I think it might be a sound problem since there are some really crazy weird things going on there with that game and sound.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
On second thought, Brandish doesn't quite work...it seems that something is not right...I know those chests aren't supposed to be empty, and when I go down a level it's quite messed up.  Oh well, heh.  That's what I get for doing just a quick check. ^_^<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by The 9th Sage on Fri Jul 08, 2005 2:41 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I started a game of Earthbound earlier today, and it worked fine for me with audio set to Stereo. I played all the way up until after Ness gets his photo taken for the first time, then I saved. The game never froze on me like you've mentioned above.

Of course, there are graphical problems in most battles, (the wrong tiles get loaded for the YOU WIN! text, and often the HP values) but other than that I didn't have a problem. You did make sure the version of Earthbound you're using is the one in the Superdat included with the emulator?

True. And only in those black rings is rain shown; the rain is probably in the wrong/bottom layer?

Plus, one can see that when Link walks on a stair case, his body remains fully shown, even though it shouldn't. (Part of the stair case should be covering his body.) That is also apparent in Prince Of Persia (E), in the intro (when doing nothing), when Jafar walks towards the princess and his body is seen in front of the pillars in the foreground.

Super NES has only three BG layers, but each tile has a priority bit that allows it to be pushed farther down in the stack. GBA and Nintendo DS have four BG layers and no priority bit. Thus if two or three layers in a Super NES game both use the priority bit, then the display can't be virtualized onto the GBA 2D core. Likewise, games that use subtractive blending for shadows won't work because the GBA 2D core doesn't support subtractive blending.

<br/>
With the version from the eighth?  Hm....I wonder what my problem was, I had it randomly freeze with the sound still playing (then eventually crash)  on me a few times, at least it seemed random (now that I've tried to play more, I think my so called sound crash was probably just a random freeze).  I never even played past the first part, with Pokey and your dog in tow because it eventually kept crashing on me.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I have a bad ROM or something?  It is verified as good in NSRT though, and I've had no problems with it from what I've played on my PC.  Maybe I just need to clean my cartridge or something. O_o;;

Seems to be working better now, using most current version of SnesDS.  Maybe it was my cart needing cleaning or something.  I suppose a flash cart might be sensitive to something like that.

(PSP)The Games are boring ( except for Lumins ) no friggin replay on those things, the funny thing is, with less than half the power of the PSP the DS blows it out of the water. sure the PSP is pretty, but seeing Super Mario WORLD in full frame rate with sound on, unlike the PSP where you have to push the freakin thing to 333Mhz without sound just to get a playable game....

Mm, well, that's ignoring the fact that the DS SNES emulator in question is full of obscenely optimized hand-written ARM that was originally intended to run on a GBA. The SNES9X PSP ports are rather quick jobs with, to my knowledge, little or no hand-optimized MIPS routines.

I think it's just to do with the actual gameplay since I flashed a save well past that and it crashed as soon as the game tried to load the level, after the initial map screen.

The crashes are random.
<br/>
Play it again, and maybe you'll get through. I got about half way through the game before I tried a different game and lost my save, so I know it's possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm assuming the random crashes are sound related, because in all of the games they happen in for me, there's always no sound playing when it crashes. (Ex: Mario games after a level, Earthbound after a battle ends, etc.)

I've noticed the other problems people have mentioned (the pillars in the castle not being where they should, black sky, random crashes exiting ghost houses, etc) but nobody's mentioned anything about the bosses.  
<br/>
<br/>
When I get to the end of a castle, I'm lucky if I can tell where Mario is.  All over the screen, there's just a jumble of random tiles, either no sprite or garbled graphics for the boss, and usually Mario is just a garbled sprite jumping around like an idiot hoping he hits something and doesn't die.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the US version of the ROM, and the checksum is OK, so I would have to wonder what I'm doing wrong if indeed I AM the only person with these problems.

Sorry, can't help with that either.  But I can tell you that if you flash your DS and have a GBA Flash Cart, then it's as easy as setting up to play a rom on your GBA, you just flash a DS rom and plug it into your DS instead.  And all that should be explained in your flash cart's documentiation (usually).

A big culprit of this seems to be Soul Blazer for some reason....although, in the emulator sound is a bit funky on this game, so maybe it's doing something odd.

dont get excited or anything it only shows the inital splash screen, at a guess i would recon it has a similar problem to nester ds where it runs for a few seconds then crashes with an overflow but it just so happens that these two games show a splash screen before it happens.

download the bins version and compile them with this bat file

copy /b arm9.bin + smw.smc snes9.bin

is it to do with the sound? one thing ive noticed is all these splash screen lack the "ting" noise that my other roms have whereas these are silent but have sound straight after which kinda looks like the crash is arm7/sound related and the arm9 code works...just an idea</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It turns out that my theory was correct/on the right track.  snesds does indeed work when the sound is disabled. there are other issues though however meaning that compatability is still worse than the proper version, i am informed however this is due to the lack of patches in the roms.  Soon my gbamp friends we should be playing snesds but you'll have to be patient and wait for it.

snesDs is now kinda broken on the m3 now the cf reading is implemented(due to all the issues you've always known)  it might be a better idea to check the rom for implanted smc's before checking whether it has  cf reading capability and trying that method first since as far as im aware theres no way to use them once its detected a cf card.
<br/>
<br/>
in other words check for smc's in rom and if they exist use them regardless of cf ability.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So... please tell me this isn't dead. :-(
<br/>
<br/>
I tried 3 games, not such good results:
<br/>
-F-Zero: Almost perfect except... you can't see the track. Also sound glitches.
<br/>
-Super Mario World: Layer priority problems, sounds a bit odd, otherwise fine.
<br/>
-Tetris Attack: Almost works.
<br/>
<br/>
Tetris Attack is interesting. The game <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> run, but only after it spends about 5 minutes playing all sorts of garbled sound effects. It does this every time a different music track is selected, which leads me to believe it's a simple off-by-one error in either CPU or SPC emulation. Most likely, the game uploads music data 3 or 4 bytes at a time through the SPC700 I/O ports, and waits for some sort of response. Once the music is loaded the SPC program simply plays whatever music and sound effects are selected, waiting for the game to tell it which to play via the same I/O ports, and using that same acknowledgement system.
<br/>
<br/>
My theory here is that something has gone wrong during the process of uploading music to the chip. Since SPC700 has very little RAM, and the game's music is very detailed, they likely only fit one music and the sound effects in at any given time. The sound effects stay resident (there may be some swapping of level-specific sounds, but I digress), and music is uploaded from the CPU each time it needs to be changed.
<br/>
<br/>
What seems to be happening is that the SPC700 is not recieving (or just ignoring) the signal sent by the CPU (through the I/O ports) that tells it to enter music-uploading mode. So when the game starts uploading music, it thinks it's being told to play sound effects, and that it does. Since playing a sound effect takes much longer than writing a byte or two to memory, it takes much longer for the chip to respond (the response doesn't come until the sound effect is done - this may even simply be the I/O regs being zeroed out by the SPC700, which it would naturally do if using them as sound effect numbers), hence, this process takes a very long time. If you listen to the sound effects being played it doesn't sound entirely random; there are repeating patterns, as you would expect of music data.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, after quite a long time, you'll see the Nintendo logo pop up. With a lot of patience, you can try to start a round, however, it simply stays at a black screen (silent) after the garbage sound. :-( You can navigate menus, though. (Oh joy!)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, though I haven't really looked at TA's code, this is how Super Mario World's sound works. Except its music is small enough to all fit in SPC RAM at once. I'm pretty sure the sound code used in both games is nearly identical, albeit TA's being a bit more advanced.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not being able to see the track in a racing game could be one or both of the following: <ul><li>It's mode 7 (rot/scale background). If the rotozoom cut-scenes in Actraiser work, then this isn't the problem. </li><li>It's mode 7 with hblank DMA. (The emulator doesn't yet support hblank DMA.) </li></ul>

<br/>
Layer prio problems are because the Super NES has three layers, but individual tiles can be set to low or high prio, so it's more like six layers (not supported by 2D cores) scrolled in pairs.

Almost. Super Mario World has two SPC700 segments: one for map and one for in-game. Notice how the game pauses ("MARIO START!") when loading a segment.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I noticed the emulator actually doesn't seem to be resetting things properly when restarting the game or loading another. While SMW works great if I start it first, if I load another game, then switch to SMW, it'll have messed up sound or not run at all. By jumping back and forth between games and resetting a few times I can often even get Tetris Attack to run with near-perfect sound (aside from some repeating sound effects and the trumpet blowing flats). In fact I can get it to the title screen nearly every time just by loading it, then resetting. (It only ever did that play-a-lot-of-random-sounds-then-start thing once BTW.) So it seems like things aren't being reset to a perfect SNES-just-turned-on state.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
