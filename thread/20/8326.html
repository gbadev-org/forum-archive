    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">can you boot it to the main menu of the game, but then it crashes?
<br/>
<br/>
because that's a common issue. try sticking different games in your DS slot until you find one that works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does it make a difference what game I have in my NDS port? I'm using FlashMe, not PassMe...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was reading about the same problem with jump super stars in another thread. apparently it does matter what game u have in ur nds slot, even with flashme (which is what those people were using). I have the same problem with jss, but I'm using a GBAMP. Every other demo off of the site, that i tried, works for me except jss too. I tried putting in every one of the 4 ds games i have. None of them worked. So, the following won't make it run.
<br/>
<br/>
Animal Crossing Wild World
<br/>
Super Mario 64 DS
<br/>
Sonic Rush
<br/>
Yoshi Touch &amp; Go
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try some of my friend's games. Maybe they'll work....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
wifitransfer wont get it to load either. i thought that could've been a wmb substitute, but its not really

<br/>

i don't think the E3 demo's were ever supposed to work by loading them as you would homebrew, at least chishm and others were trying to avoid it<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i have a gbamp, but i use WMB for the e3 demos...probably because i'm not on the latest version of the GBAMP firmware...hmm<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
