    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just released version 0.4 over on the ScummVM website.
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know by posting here if there are any problems!
<br/>
<br/>
Changes in this version are:
<br/>
<br/>
- The top screen now shows a zoomed in view of the action, scrolled to the character who's speaking
<br/>
- Large speed increase for Adlib music emulation
<br/>
- Large speed increase for GBAMP CF card loading
<br/>
- Closing the lid now puts the DS in sleep mode
<br/>
- Screens are now the right way round on the latest firmware for the M3 player
<br/>
- Savegames now save in the selected folder rather than the root
<br/>
- Dialog no longer skips when you scroll the screen down as it's playing
<br/>
- The console no longer appears during gameplay by default, toggle it using the Y button.
<br/>
- Implemented screen shake function
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Brilliant, everything is working nicely.
<br/>
<br/>
When pressing the Y button for the dialog, it appears over the bottom screen with a bit of a screen shake, is it meant to be on the bottom screen?
<br/>
<br/>
Is there an actual screen shake function or does it just happen occasionally and you're trying to make out it's on purpose?
<br/>
<br/>
How did you solve the DS sleep mode problems?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#55475 - agentq - Wed Sep 28, 2005 8:31 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a glitch when you switch the console on and off, this is just me being lazy.
<br/>
<br/>
The screen shake effect is used in several SCUMM games, like when the bomb blows up in the Sam &amp; Max intro.  It just makes the screen move up and down.  You can also see it when the Chron-o-john hits the ground in the DOTT intro.  It's pretty subtle.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS sleep mode doesn't use the BIOS sleep function, but my own method. I'm not going to leave my DS for two weeks to test how low power it is, but I have left it for 24 hours with no noticable drain on the battery.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if you're interested, the next thing I'm going to look at is ADPCM decoding for CD Scumm games with CD audio tracks.  This should allow the CD music to play during the game from WAV files (hopefully).  Unfotunately, there isn't enough RAM to do GSM, MP3 or OGG, but ADPCM is really really simple.  Simple enough for me to understand, even, and to write a decompressor in very little code.
<br/>
<br/>
After that I'll be looking at Benieth a Steel Sky and Simon the Sorceror, as well as any other non-Scumm games which may work.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to get some support for M3, and perhaps Supercard, but that depends on the specs becoming public.
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from that, it's pretty much there!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">CD Audio tracks would be pretty cool, are all of the backing tracks that are used in some of the games WAV files?

    <h4>#55494 - agentq - Wed Sep 28, 2005 9:41 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some of the games used CD audio tracks which were played by the original CD version of the game.  ScummVM supports playing these from ripped WAV files.
<br/>
<br/>
BASS and STS will use most of the mods I've done, but much of the graphical speed optimisations will not be used.  I'm hoping that as these games are quite simple, not much optimisation work will be needed.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Broken Sword is a possibility for ScummVM DS, as it's a 640x480 games and will need quite a bit of RAM, which I'm really short of.  Also, scaling it to the DS resolution will make it look poor.

Variable zoom should be pretty easy.  At the moment it zooms such that the gameplay area of the game fills the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
A text viewer should be easy to do, but I'm not really sure it's that useful.  I may be able to use the same code for a help screen though, so it may come in handy that way!

<br/>
Also - an on screen keyboard to edit text fields would be a nice addition.  I should add that.  It would allow you to edit savegame names too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Excellent job on ScummVM DS. I was just wondering, is the native scale on the bottom screen supposed to be off the screen by a few pixes on the roof and the base? I'm just asking because it seems that it scales corretly when pressing Select twice. I've tested it out on a number of games, but it looks most apparent on MI2 (where the bottom commands can barely be seen).

when image is not scaled ( Select ) you can scroll image pressing shoulder button and use the D-pad to scroll the sreens ( the is good to read or press in some small spots!)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://flickr.com/photos/stuffbox" target="_blank">http://flickr.com/photos/stuffbox</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've not read through all 30 pages of this thread so far so if these are known faults, sorry...
<br/>
<br/>
As i only have a 256Mb flashcard I can only fit on a handful of floppy version games rather than the 'talkie' ones. Maniac Mansion, Zak McKracken, MI1 and MI2 all seem to work perfectly albeit the sound seems very low on all of them.
<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't get either Sam and Max or DOTT working though unfortunately, when i went to add DOTT it froze as i clicked choose on "tentacle" (i have all the correct files necessary as listed on the scummvm.org site) and when i tried to add sam and max it shows no game found in that folder.

As for your problem with DOTT and S&amp;M, I'm betting that you added them to a ZIP file you already had.  Recreate the zip in one go with the games you want in there, and it should work fine.

I actually bought my ds FOR your scummvm port inorder to play Day of the Tentacle ( which works great btw ).

<br/>
One feature which would make gameplay easier would be to hold a button and click on the touchscreen to unscale the screen and center it on that area as long as the button is down.
<br/>
The reason is alot of the buttons in the touchscreen are small in scaled mode and often a different option gets accidentally set.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This rules...the speedups are great.  I think things are totally running at full speed in DoTT so far (including the 'smarter, more agressive' intro with the tentacles talking which hasn't run at full speed in any version thus far).  :)  The zoomed view rather rules too...I like watching that thing zip around when people are talking.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is the best homebrew on the DS by far.  Thanks for your hard work on getting this ported over to the DS, I have had tons of fun with this.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a SuperCard, so I can't play the talkies, but most of my games are talkies (I have the disks for Day of the Tentacle, but I also have the CD talkie version of it because I bought a lucas arts treasures set that had a bunch of the old scumm games includes like indianna jones etc...).  I have gotten DOTT to work great with the Super Card (aside from the known issues of not being able to save), but I was thinking, is there any way to not have to go through the "Super Battery" copy-protection on the disk version?  I know they removed it on the CD talkie version.
<br/>
<br/>
I have the book with all of the codes for the disk version, but that sort of defeats the whole "portability" feature, I really don't want to carry the book around with me so I can show people the game (and since I have the Super Card, I can't save it right after the copy protection, it erases the save).
<br/>
<br/>
I tried grabbing the TENTACLE.000 and TENTACLE.001 from the CD talkie version and copying the MONSTER.SOU from the disks to see if that worked, and it kinda worked (it loads the game and it removes the copy protection, but it also removes all speaking and text, so you don't hear them speak in the opening and it never shows any text either).
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm the only one that has this problem, or maybe I just need to wait for the Super Card to be able to run the talkie ones (hopefully ROMMAN will release the necessary code for that to work), but I was wondering if anyone knew a way to fix this?
<br/>

Yeah, but I have the SuperCard so saves don't work (well they work, but as soon as you turn off the DS, the save is deleted) so I can't do that.  I found a patch that they made for the CD talkie version which forced the text to always display (http://m0002.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_day_of_the_tentacle.shtml) and tried to patch the "hacked" copy I made (using TENTACLE.000 and TENTACLE.001 from the CD talkie version and the MONSTER.SOU from the disk version), but it didn't really work out.  Like I posted earlier, that hack removes the protection, but will not display any text and no voices play (even in the opening where they play even on the disk version).  I thought by applying that patch it would force text (that would solve it), but it didn't.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll just have to wait for SuperCard support for the talkie games (or buy a GBAMP :) )  Thanks to everyone for replying with helpful ideas and comments, and thanks again especially to agentq for an awsome program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is a way to save with a Supercard.
<br/>
Its a little bit unhandy but it works...
<br/>
<br/>
You only need a File with the same name (for autoload) as your ScummVm *.nds file and the ending *.sav. But, this file must have enough size for the data and the supercard can't increase the filesize.
<br/>
I create the file under Linux with the command "dd if=/dev/zero of=myscummvm.sav bs=1k count=64" this creates a file called myscummvm.sav with a size of 64kB. I dont know whether this possible under windows...
<br/>
<br/>
Now, when you save your game normaly, scummvm save it in the Supercard Memory. Now you have to turn off and on your DS, go to 'saver' in your SC Menu, select your .sav file and confirm with 'A'. The Memory from your SC is now saved in the .sav File.<br/>_________________<br/>Sorry for my bad English, Im German...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your idea for swapping the screens is interesting.  I've still got to decide on a way to make it not seem confusing though.  Since you have the zoomed in view on the touch screen, you can't touch the normal view to make it scroll as it will be on the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a thought - maybe holding L and D-pad could scroll the top screen, while holidng R and D-pad could scroll the bottom screen?  Holding both L and R while using the D-pad could adjust the zoom level.
<br/>
<br/>
Or does that all sound too complicated?

I know exactly the part you mean.  That bit is the heaviest part of the game I've seen, memory wise, because of the helicopter animation when it swoops down to get the fish. To get past that bit, go to the map screen, save your game, then turn off your DS and load your game.  Now go to the World of Fish and talk to the fishing man and you should be able to get past that section.

I don't think Broken Sword is a possibility for ScummVM DS, as it's a 640x480 games and will need quite a bit of RAM, which I'm really short of.  Also, scaling it to the DS resolution will make it look poor.

<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this forum
<br/>
<br/>
I have been using ScummVm already for some time now and really enjoied it.
<br/>
<br/>
I had this problem that sometime I get corrupted files (scummvm.ini and also dslinux.nds) in the CF card after running scumm.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some bug in the fat routines? I have GBAMP with the latest firmware and I use GBAMP multiboot to start the VM. I have no such problems running dslinux (also opening and writing to files) or any other program, only after running Scummvm.
<br/>
I notice that the beginning of the corrupted files gets filled with nulls.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this seems to happend when starting the program the touch screen does not respond to clicks (this is another bug I get at random).
<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping for an updated version :) the file corruption is really annoing!

If I manage to get some free time and my laptop back, I'll take a look at the source code myself...

So, my question which I'm sure has been asked (sorry!).
<br/>
Does ScummVM DS have some sort of a file size limit for what it runs, or does it load stuff from the cart/CF card only when needed?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, suggestion. There should be a lefty mode, where the abxy buttons could be used for changing mouse mode :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Okay, looks like my question is answered now that I can find the point at which ScummVM DS was released :D
<br/>
<br/>
It appears that, since it can run Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road (voices version), and I know that that game is over 100 MB, it must be able to run reasonably large stuff :)
<br/>
(And I have now proven it to myself by reading more... thank god for the topic split function...)
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll stick with non-talkie stuff, though.
<br/>
Besides, I only have a 128 MB card, because <span style="font-weight: bold">I thought</span> that I needed a CF writer as well... turned out that the "Reader" which I have is simply labelled stupidly.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ScummVM DS on the GBAMP can run Lucasarts games of any size.  This assumes they don't need too much RAM, of course.  Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road talkie is 187Mb.  The cart version can only run games up to 30Mb due to the addressing range of the GBA cart bus.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks AGA, but it seems that others are integrating the driver into Chishm's FAT driver.  When this is done it should be quite easy to get it running, so all I'll need is a couple of people to test that it works.  I'm sure it'll be easy to find those!
<br/>
<br/>
When I'm done updating the code, the M3 and SC should be able to support the same functionality as the GBAMP V2 does now.

(With select resetting the zoom level to one of the two defaults). The reason for this is that there appears to be a spot in Sam&amp;Max where I have to click on something the size of a grain of sand :(
<br/>
(Getting a prize out of the Whack-a-Mole machine.) I imagine that there are spots like that in other games as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Why does ScummVM lack a quit button, to get back to the main menu?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I hope you didn't miss my Lefty-Mode suggestion :)
<br/>
I'll consider fiddling around in an attempt to add that myself, once I have all this sorted... But I know that it would work better if the guy who actually knows his own source code was to do it :)
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing... Using the mouse click stuff is a bit fiddly at times. I think that, when in mouse click mode, the click event should only occur when the stylus is released -- when it is down, it should act as mouse hover. This way, things could be more easily clicked on without losing the currently selected action and having to go through a bunch of pain to go back to it... Would also speed things up and have them feeling less technical. Most DS games have the responses happening when the stylus is lifted, anyway :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

If you are in hover mode, you can hover the mouse around and use d-pad left while the pen is on the screen to perform a left-click.  This should help you not lose the currently selected action.

If it says your games are compressed you might want to try deleting your zip and creating it again, as there are sometimes problems reading a zip file that has had files added or removed from it.

I've noticed that ScummVM has the stylus callibraton way off of some other homebrew apps... A bit too high, and maybe a bit to the left as well. I think someone wrote an accurate touch screen library a while back...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It would also be fantastically handy if I could set key bindings manually... but I don't mean to pressure :)
<br/>

THough I don't know for sure, <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/index.php/Misc/TouchScreen" target="_blank">this</a> is probably rather accurate.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Am I just being crazy or wouldn't it be fairly easy for you to build your own menu?
<br/>
One that runs at full speed and only has the necessary features.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure it'd be easier than to optimise the menu you already have.<br/>_________________<br/>Packin':

Man this is amazing!!! All it really seems to lack so far is a little extra VOLUME! I can hardly hear a thing without head phones and a perfectly silent room even with the volume cranked.

 Also some text is hard to read on the lower screen as it gets cut off in some games, though with such a low res, it's going to be tricky to fix that.

Oh, come on! I wasn't exactly demanding. I showered the guy in praise and I just asked the question.
<br/>
<br/>

Still playing Sam &amp; Max here, got upto the bit with Bumpusville
<br/>
It crashs a few words into the sequence where you see Bump's show.
<br/>
<br/>
Dispite emptying my inventory and turning the sound down to nothing, it still crashs. 
<br/>
(If I disable the sound completely, it dosnt let me load the save game...is that normal?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
