Of course I should make client software for Nintendo DS as well. (If anyone wants to start, I have no problem with that. If more than one people does it independently, then we will find out is multiple program, that doesn't matter. I will work on it when I have time.)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the keys are: On touch screen should be keyboard all printable-ASCII keys, CTRL key, SHIFT key, ENTER key (chr13), BACKSPACE key (chr8).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Since the Nintendo DS has function to connect to Internet, this is just naturally what it needs. This is a telnet program for Nintendo DS. It doesn't follow any other terminal type because Nintendo DS doesn't have big enough display to make a 25rows and 80columns display.
<br/>
<br/>
The files posted are server and client for Windows computers. You can write the server script in VB-script, or you could make a completely new server program if you want. The client program is same function/protocol as the one will be made on Nintendo DS, and can be used to connect to the same servers. The source codes are available for both programs.
<br/>
<br/>
You could possibly make online game with this, chat servers, and some more stuff as well.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, so then to be clear, this is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> actually a telnet client or server for the DS, but a client and server for a Windows computer.
<br/>
<br/>
For the record, DS Linux already includes a telnet client (server as well, I think). But if you would do anything stand-alone on the DS side, it should be a port of PuTTY. I don't know what I would do with a basic telnet client, but an SSH client would be very nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seconded. PuTTY is cross-platform and also my favourite choice of ssh client wherever I go... even works on mobile phones. Have never taken a look at PuTTY sources, so I have no idea how big project it would be to port it - I just hope someone does it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That would be good to make a normal Telnet and SSH program for Nintendo DS, maybe also with custom button configuration (but it needs a 80x25 screen, not 85x24, but it shouldn't be too hard to make the letters slightly smaller to add an extra row, but some door games also require colors to work properly). Then you can connect to <a class="postlink" href="telnet://x-bit.org" target="_blank">X-BIT</a> using Nintendo DS and send/receive messages and play many of those games on there.
<br/>
<br/>
I a still going to work on NitroTerminal anyways, especially since NitroTerminal is well designed for Nintendo DS.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A lot of real dedicated terminals are 80x24. I'd expect a portable program to support terminals 80x24 in size.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
