    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made some hardware to attempt to interface an Atmel AVR microcontroller with the DS mic port for the purpose of transmitting data from an ancient NES controller to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It worked, actually. Problem, though, I accidently ended up later putting too much current into the mic port, now my internal mic in the DS seems to be dead. (Doesnt work in games, but an external mic wired to the mic port works)
<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone does attempt to take on this task as I did, be careful. lol.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
