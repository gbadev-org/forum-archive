You would have a device that you can put 2 cards in, then put that in the slot. When one licenced software start running, you can put a switch which enabled access to the other inserted card, which has unlicensed software in it. If it tries to read that card, it can run unlicensed software from it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How about this:

Make a DS cart which looks like a standard DS cart to the ds, encryption and everything (as you pointed out, it has been cracked for some time now), exept it's a re-writeable ROM (these are called things like 'flash rom').

You could even add a mini SD slot to it or even SD, don't know if you can get the rest of the card small enough.

You are right about if it expects encrypted data and receives unencrypted one, it doesn't work. But my idea is a device you put 2 cards in, then it uses the key used to communicate with the first card to communicate with the DS. It reads unencrypted data from the second card and encrypts it with the first key so it will work.
<br/>
<br/>
Your idea won't work because even though the card communication has been cracked, the RSA hasn't. No, apparently DS cards aren't signed. If they aren't signed, then your idea is very good idea, I like this better than NINJADS. But, how I would implement it is:
<br/>
<br/>
There is a switch on top that says EXECUTE and WRITE. If the switch is set to WRITE, when you turn it on the display will say "Set switch to EXECUTE and turn off DS and turn it back on, then it will work." If you instead press X,Y,UP,UP,SELECT (or another combination), it will open a menu for writing to that card from: GBA slot (CF card, etc), HTTP, FTP, DS Download Play, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
And about NINJADS: If you can get one of those, it should (I don't know if it does) have a feature to autostart if a file such as _AUTO.NDS or _BOOT_MP.NDS exists on the SD card. (so you don't have to go through the menu every time)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I thought that a "NoPass" would have the same function as a PassMe, only due to its use of the DS card encryption, it would work on newer firmware without any need for SRAM or any of that nonsense.
