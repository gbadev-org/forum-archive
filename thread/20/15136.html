    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I"m trying to compose music using Nitro Tracker on my DS. I downloaded some waves on to my SD card but when ever I click the smpl icon nothing is displayed. I can compose using my own samples made with the DS Mic, but there is only so much you can accomplish by yelling "HEY!" into the mic. I'm using Supercard SD, and am brand new to this sort of thing. I wasn't sure if I should have put this in the "newbie" thread or not, but I saw audio and jumped at it. Any help will be greatly appreciated. My sole reason for buying the super card was so that I can have the ability to make music anywhere.<br/>_________________<br/>I"m new, please bare with me...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
