    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently imported the official DS headset/mic from Play-Asia because it was on sale, and so I've been messing around with all the games I have that use the mic: pretty much just Electroplankton and Nintendogs. So I was wondering if there were any homebrew programs that used the mic that I could play around with.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone should make a voice-controlled MP3 player. Just with simple commands like "Play", "Pause", "Next", etc. Then I could turn on my DS, start it up, and put the DS in my pocket with the headset cord coming out, and I wouldn't even have to take it out to change songs! That'd be awesome.<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: DS Lite &amp; Phat (both FlashMe v7), M3 Perfect SD, PassKey 1, Max Media Launcher, SanDisk 1GB SD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
edit: or did you mean voice chat within metroid hunters? yeah, i'm waiting for my friend to get home from sakuracon so that i can play around with that. i'm looking forward to Pokemon diamond/pearl so that we can actually chat WHILE playing.<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: DS Lite &amp; Phat (both FlashMe v7), M3 Perfect SD, PassKey 1, Max Media Launcher, SanDisk 1GB SD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Small Sample, Nitrotracker = high quality

Bigg File, DSO = low quality...

wished it could be visa versa :(<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/blizzds/petition.html" target="_blank">Starcraft DS ?</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My completely uneducated guess - NitroTracker saves the short audio clip in RAM and writes it to the card at its leisure.  DSO writes to the card while it's being recorded to clear the RAM for more data to come in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#125358 - 0xtob - Thu Apr 12, 2007 7:44 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right. I limited the sample length to 12 seconds in NitroTracker to save RAM. The higher quality is because I'm not using the standard libnds mic functions, but modified ones that record at a higher sampling rate and bit rate and use maximum mic gain. Also I disable nearly every ARM7 interrupt while recording in order not to minimize distortion due to missed samples. Example source code for this is in the <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.tobw.net/sk/dssk-1.2-src.zip" target="_blank">DS Sampling Keyboard source code</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
NitroTracker isn't meant to be a voice recorder, but it would be possible to make such an app that streams recorded samples to the card, so the messages can have arbitrary length. Also, since the arm9 is free, it could be used to compress the sample with ADPCM or GSM.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob" target="_blank">http://blog.dev-scene.com/0xtob</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://nitrotracker.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://nitrotracker.tobw.net</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://dsmi.tobw.net" target="_blank">http://dsmi.tobw.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I might have to look into some sort of compression.  Right now, recorded sound in DSO is really bad because of the fact that it has to be slow enough for card writes.  The only problem then would be that I would have to make it play back compressed wav files too. ;P

<br/>
... This might not be a bad idea though.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That completely negates the purpose of even recording them on DSO in the first place.  I want something that is able to play interchangeably on windows/mac/linux and on DS.  Besides, the sound code is not set up to play arbitrary adpcm samples.  It expects a set sample width each time of uncompressed data to play.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DS uses IMA ADPCM - this is also supported in most other operating systems by default. Why not just compress to that (it's fast and easy), and put it in a wav-container? That should be rather interchangeable, yet effective.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
