You gotta plug your own site more, you should have linked to: <a href="http://www.dev-scene.com/Extreme_Onslaught" target="_blank">http://www.dev-scene.com/Extreme_Onslaught</a> :P
<br/>
<br/>
About that game though, I really thing the screens should be reversed. You should be able to tap on the enemies on the bottom screen, to fire bullets towards them, instead of having to guess which direction to fire in. though having the spread-fire shots does make it easier to hit things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought the same, but I guess the stylus could then block your view of a incoming group of enemies.
<br/>
I suck at this game, but it's quite nice visually.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought of this too!
<br/>
I would rather have the D-Pad for moving, Stylus for shooting, L Trigger to bomb and all the action would take place on the top screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I take back what I said.
<br/>
I think it should be displayed on both screens... ;)
<br/>
That gives you the option to tap enemies, or just watch the top-screen like right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, it could be made an option to just put the game screen on the bottom screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the closest thing would be some how getting the source for Grid Wars, probably the closest Geometry Wars clone.  The only problem is that it got shut down :(  But I do have the latest version of the actual app still :D
<br/>
<br/>
And obviously you'd need to tone-down the graphics.  In fact, I'd hate to admit it, but the PSP might actually be a better system for this &gt;_&gt;

Screw that :P DS FTW</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Bottom screen only, minimal use of top screen, imo.

They copywrited the style O_o
<br/>
WTF.
<br/>
<br/>
And it wont be 95 years will it? In those 95 years the copywrite timescale will be expanded AGAIN. 
<br/>
Im getting more and more frustrated over the abuse of copywrites/patents dispite the fact they are wonderfull principles.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ha HA! NICE! someone still has it for download, probably BECAUSE of it being shut down, because it's only since this September ;)
<br/>
<br/>
...not that I need it, I have the game :P
<br/>
<br/>
now... what about the source...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: <span style="font-weight: bold">GREAT NEWS!</span>  The creator of Grid Wars finally replied to my message about the source for Grid Wars that I e-mailed about a week or so ago.
<br/>

The source code is included in the download - the .bmx files.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you turn it into.  beware the copyright laws.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2:...wtf?  Is this the minimal version or something?  It's only the game!  Here, lemme upload my copy... I've put the source files into a folder named "source" for making things easy :P  I also have the settings for the game at Low graphics at 800x600 for people like me running slower PC (667MHz &gt;_&gt; the default settings = MAJOR LAG and difficulty changing the settings)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 3: ok, here it is :D

If anyone needs docs or anything, that is written using BlitzMax and some docs are available at <a href="http://www.blitzwiki.org." target="_blank">www.blitzwiki.org.</a>
<br/>
(Or, of course, with the demo).

Err... obviously :/

Anyway, docs available there :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, I just realized something.  If we were going to do a port of Grid Wars to the DS, we'd probably want to shrink all the graphics down by like half to a third of thier original size, otherwise the screen would be pretty cramped. :P
<br/>
<br/>
If you want, I can covert all the icons and graphics in the "gfx" folder to half, or 1/3...  But I think we need to come to an agreement :P  And someone with the knowledge to be able to even port Grid Wars to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: WHOA what the crap, every time I start a new game (after hitting the 'bomb' button), the game automatically quits and closes the window like 3 seconds later! WTF  Anyone else having this problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know what it was, but the last version of Grid Wars + Source seemed screwy.  I have re-uploaded a version that isn't screwy, so here's the new download link.
