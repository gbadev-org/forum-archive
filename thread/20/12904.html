    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How do I use shortcuts with DS Organize? I want to put DS Organize as my middle button for my M3 Simply and make moonshell a shortcut for DS Organize, since I use DSO more than Moonshell. So how do I do it?!
<br/>
<br/>
And I am wondering, is the sound quality on DS Organize the same as Moonshell? There won't be any difference in sound right?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
How do I take advantage of shortcuts?
<br/>
<br/>
Shortcuts can be placed into any directory on the CF card and point to any file that DSOrganize can load, aside from another shortcut. If you place shortcuts in the Home directory under the DSOrganize Data directory, they will be displayed on the home screen under page three. A shortcut can be created either in DSOrganize itself by creating a new .dss file and editing it, or in any text editor on your PC. The first line of any shortcut must simply contain "dsoshortcut" After that, the shortcut format is flexible, so order is not important and not every field is mandatory. Edit a shortcut like a .ini file, using field=value as the format. Other fields are shown below:
<br/>
<br/>
    * name - The name of the shortcut. This field will show up as the three line description in the browser, or above the shortcut on the home screen.
<br/>
    * file - A complete unix path to the file you want to link to.
<br/>
    * largeicon - A complete unix path to a 50x50 bmp/gif/png/jpg file that will be used as the icon on the homescreen. If this isn't present, DSOrganize will use the default icon for that particular file.
<br/>
    * alternate - Simply place this word on it's own line to make the shortcut load the alternate action for the file pointed to, such as editing a .html or the secondary action on a plugin or executable file.
<br/>
<br/>
In shorter terms, make a file ending with .dss and put it in your Home directory.  The file should contain something like:
<br/>
dsoshortcut
<br/>
name=MoonShell
<br/>
file=/APPS/moonshell.nds (or wherever you keep it)
<br/>
largeicon=/DATA/DSORGANIZE/ICONS/whatevericonname.gif (or leave blank for default)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
