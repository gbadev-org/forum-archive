    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hehe,
<br/>
E3 talks to me!
<br/>
<br/>
And an idiot... not because he dislikes the system, but... touch screen is a battery drain? The DS has battery troubles?
<br/>
Nintendo's been making handhelds since 1987? That's a good thing!
<br/>
DS costs $300?!
<br/>
DS isn't overwhelmed with ports from other consoles!
<br/>
<br/>
Meh, I think it's safe to say he did this looking like an uneducated idiot thing on purpose, to be honest...
<br/>
In fact, it's really obvious with his failure to understand anything...
<br/>
Not a very funny guy, though.
<br/>
I suppose it's somehow a scheme to get me watching these other  Moldytoaster Video things... didn't work :P
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Though, looking at those others, it's about the same boring garbage that tries to be humourously pessimistic but isn't.
<br/>
The computer episode is nearly funny.
<br/>
I stopped watching after that.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone that takes this seriously is nuts, though.
<br/>
Just laugh at how unsuccessful this little... thing... is.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This guy has the worst arguments ever, touch screen = bad battery life, screw yourself, it has a better battery life than psp. Then he starts comparing the gameboy to the ds, what the hell, what a noob. Changing to colour isnt great, what a fucking retard. 
<br/>
Gigaflop, when the hell did they ever refer to ds as to having gigaflops?
<br/>
He comments that you can use a memory stick on the ds, so can DS, its called a flash cart you fuck tard. 
<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much everything he lists wrong with the ds is wrong assuming you have a flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
"With the psp you can replace the batteries" You can do the same with a DS. He also says you cant play DS while its hooked up to the wall, you can do that with a ds.
<br/>
<br/>
He says you can watch movies! You can do that on a ds, ffs now hes going on about music, so can a ds, what a fucking retarted man who doesnt know what hes talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
I only watched half of it but pretty much every point he made was as he said "Garbage", hes a retard who has no idea what hes talking about and rants on like hes in the right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
