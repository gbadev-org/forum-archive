    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now... I've always had good ideas for games, but I've never learned how to code, therefor, I've never been able to make them. I've got a couple of questions. The game I want to make would seem quite complex, so here it is... Alright... how hard would it be to code a 3d, isometric view diablo style game that uses external sources (that way the .nds file isn't massive, and people can find ways to use the game engine and apply their own mods to the game), along with would it be difficult to code a game that has a set up to have a limited amount of gold (if you've got a question on that, just ask, it's a very interesting idea), and how long would it take to learn how to code that?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing this is the wrong forum for this and will probably be deleted, or I'll get yelled at for posting such a stupid question, but I really need to know these things to see if I should bother or try something easier.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i can tell you, none of this can be anwsered in general. there's only one way to find it out for sure: start now. ;^D
<br/>
there might be people posting estimations, but i have experienced, that even if you have the ability to create such things, it still takes "quite some" time to actually do it.
<br/>
<br/>
still, happy creating! :?)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: again, it depends on soooo many factors, that's it's a waste of time to even think about it, imho.
<br/>
starting to learn stuff and actually doing it then will get you a lot further! :^D

good luck!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">unlikely. I mean, if you do it in 3D, things like layering aren't an issue. In 2D however, you do have to mess with layering, which is a whole different ball game.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Again, it's difficult to guage what is "easier" or "difficult" when it comes to programming, it really depends on what you're good at and what you know how to do. Provided you've not started learning to program, I'm certain that you will find any first steps (no matter what they are) much more difficult than anything you program later. 
<br/>
<br/>
So my advice to you is start small, and work your way up to bigger things. I also advise you to start programming on your computer before you attempt DS, as there is much more documentation/books/tutorials.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#157634 - silent_code - Tue May 27, 2008 2:42 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i'm not intending to scare you, but after you master the language (only few of us even more experienced "users" have, yet), there's still a lot to learn on the way!
<br/>
e.g. you will come around things that are syntactically correct, but create bogus behaviour!
<br/>
so, it's not as easy as most people willing to start learning how to program think it is. most of the time, when you think you already know a lot, you sooner or later find out just how *little* you really know. it happens to me all the time and i'm a hobby programmer for more than ... i think eight years. even before that, i had programmed with qbasic on any relative's computer i could get my hands on, but that doesn't really count, i guess. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
when starting out, you simply need to know what you have in front of you. learning  for some months could make you a decent programmer, no doubt, but the sooner you realize that there's always much more to learn, the faster you'll get better. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
finally, i wish you good luck and endurance for your journey you'll face!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thing about me is I tend to understand things, even if I don't know how or what to do with it. I could possibly figure coding out in a very short time because, even though I've never really learned it, I've got a basic understanding of what a command should do or how something works :p In school, I took our graduation test and got advanced on most of it (except writting, but thats because I can't write to a prompt), so I think I'll most likely be able to pull this off. :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It helps if you can think in flowcharts.
<br/>
<br/>
But yes, start simple.
<br/>
Heres a random list that perhapes, maybe you should look at;
<br/>
<br/>
0. Pick a langerage, make a Hello World. (learn basics of setting up and compiling)
<br/>
1. Make pong, or a pong-like game. (learn the ideas behind the graphics).
<br/>
2. Make something with sprites...like a scrolling map. Purhapes use some open source code, learn how to use eternal lib's ect.
<br/>
3. Start playing with 3D.
<br/>
<br/>
Then come back here :)
<br/>
<br/>
oh, and so you dont get bored, try to put your own twist on even the most basic stuff. So when I say "pong" I just mean something like it...a few moving objects,collision detection, a very very basic game.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Speaking of this, what ever happened to the Wolveslayer game and the engine that underlied it?
<br/>
<br/>
I see the source code is still available (with a request that it not be modified for release, unfortunately).  That was a pretty impressive project technically even though the game itself wasn't so hot.  As I recall, Payk said he had plans of turning it into a generic engine that people would have been able to incorporate into their own projects (I'm not sure if he meant as some kind of build-a-game thing or as source code).  That same engine, but with smoother animation for the characters and better collision detection definitely could have been the heart of a great game.
<br/>
<br/>
Just another case of a homebrew that coulda been a contender, I guess.

You can get the sprites use a program called "MPQ Reader" and inside of the diablo folder "patch.mpq" If you want to make it so it can be moded and all, and a "diablo DS" then you'll just want to make a DSQ reader.
