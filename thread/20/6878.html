    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm thinking about buying a nintendo ds (mostly also to play scumm games :) ). Before I buy the corresponding hardware, i was wondering about the following:
<br/>
<br/>
1. on the scummvm website it says that games can be saved to a    "compatible" flash card. Which cards are known to be compatible? I already own a flash advance xtreme 128Mbit card from the gba. 
<br/>
<br/>
2. A larger card would be nice, but since I have a mac it seems I'm restricted to using flash advance. Does anyone know of any other osx supported flash cards?
<br/>
<br/>
3. If a 128Mbit card has two 64Mbit chips,  is it possible to use the full 128Mbit for one game? (i.e. Scummvm)? Never occured to me during gba times :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot!
<br/>

Anything that supports SRAM and booting directly into the cart.

I think the F2A cards should work with <a class="postlink" href="http://if2a.free.fr/" target="_blank">if2a</a>.

<br/>
Yes. It's likely that the card uses the chips in parallel: one 64 Mbit chip for the lower 8 bits of each byte and the other chip for the upper 8 bits.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if scummvm is the reason you want to use homebrew then possibly the gba movie player might be an option for you also since it has native support for scummvm and can play games of anysize and will no doubt be the cheaper option.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The GBA Movie player is the best option to run ScummVM currently, as it allows talkie games and an unlimited amount of saves too.
<br/>
<br/>
Note that currently I don't know whether it'll work with v3, and my guess is that it won't until I've written code to support it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
