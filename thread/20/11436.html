    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is my very first public demo of anything involving the GBA or DS, and it is just a simple test of Rigid Skinning of a mesh with bones. I'm just assuming this is considered Rigid Skinning because each vertex is linked to a certain bone, and are manipulated that way (I've been taking close observations of how Maya did skinning). All matrix calculations were done by manual code, though I'm hoping to figure out the problem I'm having with trying to use the DS's matrix registers (could just be an emulator thing, since I have nothing to get testing on real hardware).
<br/>
<br/>
Everything was entered by hand (bones, vertices, etc), but I hope to learn a bit of Maya scripting so that I could export a model (and maybe animation) in the format I use to be used. I also hope to some day find out how Smooth Skinning works, since Rigid Skinning has it's limits.

EDIT:
<br/>
Just for everyone's information, this works on Dualis and Ideas, but all other emulators don't seem to work with it, plus I am unable to check if it works on actual hardware, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Works with WMB + FlashME Lite just fine. Nice, but too bad it isn't interactive. I like interactive demos :P). Anyhow, the top screen's background is lime green contrary to the screenshots. :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm glad to see that this works on hardware. Perhaps sometime soon I'll go out and buy myself a compatible wireless card so that I may be able to see it on hardware myself.

I didn't even realize the background color was like that. I checked my code, and sure enough, I had set glClearColor to RGB15(0, 31, 0), but in Dualis and Ideas, I guess it decided black was their favorite color.
<br/>
<br/>
This was merely a test to see what it was like to actually have a model deformed using bones to manipulate the vertices, instead of it being static like a Display List. Ever since a few weeks ago, I had no knowledge of 3D programming, not even DirectX, so getting to where I am now has me all excited, and I actually understand it.
<br/>
<br/>
I had no intention of this demo being interactive because, well, I didn't have an idea of what to do at this stage. I think once I start getting models exported from Maya to the format I use, much more can be done, as I hope that I can finally get on with my grand idea  :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
