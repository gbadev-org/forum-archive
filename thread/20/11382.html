    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been doing homebrew and the like on my PSP for almost a year now, and have recently discovered the DS can do similiar things. Can someone help me get set up with how to set up apps, etc, on my DS? I'm also wondering what flash carts are the best. I have a DS Lite. I appreciate your help. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You need a way to run homebrew and a way to store homebrew. Here are your choices in a nutshell.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Running homebrew</span>
<br/>
If you know someone who is currently running DS homebrew, get them install FlashMe for you. If you don't, buy a NoPass(AKA PassMe3).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Storing homebrew</span>
<br/>
A GBAMP CF is the cheapest way to go. You will also need a CompactFlash card to go with your GBAMP CF.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I feell very frustrated, for all of my intellect, to be so unknowledgable about something that I know is so basic. I appreciate you bearing with me. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
NoPass refers to any of the following cards: PassCard 3, SuperKey, MK4-mini, or MAX Media Launcher. Get what you can afford.
<br/>
<br/>
G6 Lite is not compatible with homebrew that reads or writes files that aren't inside the program itself, and the company that makes it <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=104654#104654" target="_blank">hasn't released source or technical documents to help the homebrew community</a>. Other cards can be cheaper and/or more compatible with homebrew. Exactly how important is it that the memory card doesn't stick out? Will you be using the DS to listen to music while jogging with your DS in a trouser pocket?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For being able to run homebrew on your DS Lite, you'll need a NoPass. A NoPass allows the Nintendo DS to run software from the GBA slot in DS mode. You can buy one of those by the name of "Max Media Player/Launcher" for $20 at Best Buy.
<br/>
<br/>
As for storing homebrew, there are many solutions. When I started out, I got a Game Boy Advance Movie Player 2. This is the cheapest solution. It's a device that plugs into the GBA slot and uses a Compact Flash card for data storage. With a alternate firmware that chism made, you can run most homebrew. If you decide you want one of these, you could buy one from lik-sang.com, dspassme.com, or, you could buy mine, as I bought a Supercard SD and don't need my GBAMPV2 anymore (look at the Buy &amp; Sell forum here).
<br/>
<br/>
But, if you want to run almost all homebrew and get in on the new things going on for Linux on DS (DSLinux.org), and something a bit more asthetically pleasing (the GBAMP juts out a lot in the DS, and in the DS Lite, it will look butt ugly) you'll probably want a Supercard. Supercard uses Secure Digital, Compact Flash, Mini-SD, or Micro SD cards, depending on which version you get. I recommend going to the scdev.org marketplace forums and seeing if you can pick up a Supercard there, as that's what I did, and they go for pretty cheap there.
<br/>
<br/>
For you, I wouldn't recommend getting the Game Boy Advance Movie Player because it would look VERY ugly in the DS Lite and jut out a lot. I'd suggest a Supercard SD, Mini-SD, or Supercard Lite which uses a micro-sd card. So, you should check out the scdev.org marketplace forums.
