<br/>
<br/>
does anyone have think about making some king of virtual piano ?
<br/>
or a virtual synthetizer like the old rolands or something like that ?
<br/>
<br/>
i 'm not a developer so may be this will give some idea...
<br/>
i can imagine some kind of midi creator starting from this...<br/>_________________<br/>///et oui, c'est surprise sur prise !!///</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A DS virtual keyboard would be pretty cool. I am actually going to be working on a DS DJ machine that would work similar to 2 turntables or the CDJ machines they have on the market. If my research on DS sound proves rewarding I would be interested in making addon effect boards for the sound app which could included a keyboard, drum machines, synths, equalizers, distortion, etc. Oh, and the DS can do polyphonic sounds. If you played Elecktoplankton then you know this is all possible. The DS can produce some nice sounds.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I think your right about the input. Since the DS can only accept one point at a time, you couldn't play chords. But the program could have a loop feature (similar to FruityLoops, Reason, Rebirth) where you would record one track at a time. When you are finished it would loop through again and you could add other layers or fix things. It could also have a stepper, so you could step through each beat manually and adjust to chords (like the synth on Rebirth). Of course it wouldn' be a full synth, but I think it would be a lot less limiting than you'd think. Since the sounds would be generated by the chip, the songs could be very long and save within the GBA save slots. I know someone got a MOD player working, I'll like to see how that works.

It has a built in synthesizer that you can unlock to create music and save it onto the cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I've never played it, but I hear it's very popular in Japan, and there are several websites where you can download music people have created with it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Man, a synth/drum machine on the DS would be so hot. You could rough out a quick beat on the go, and then download to your computer to fix it up. Hopefully it could be a modular type program. So you could load up different virtual instruments or equipment similar to the way Reason works. So the community could add their own components or skins. That would be tits.
