    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yup, I'm a little behind the news lately.. Datel released a recall notice for the Games N Music because someone thought it would be funny to include inappropriate material.
<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn't hard enough for homebrew to get a positive reputation, make a large distributor of the only real "Homebrew Only" hardware spend a crap load of money to recall a product because of a single game they included with the hardware.  It's probably safe to say they will never support homebrew like they did with the competition for the Games N Music.
<br/>
<br/>
I read this as a warning to all corporate hardware manufacturers to not trust any homebrew developers and don't waste your time or money on promoting homebrew or try to promote them in anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Very disappointing.  Yet another negative blow to the entire homebrew community.  And this one hit a couple of large retailers as well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lynx on Mon Jun 16, 2008 1:33 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Eh?  Does homebrew have a bad reputation?  I suppose it might do in Nintendo's eyes but most people I see (admittedly on homebrew forums) are overwhelmingly posistive.
<br/>
<br/>
What was the inappropriate material anyway? Do you not remember the quiz game that had "Spastic" as one of the derogatory measure of intelligence?  I'm going to side with DiscoStew on this one and blame Datel for not checking things properly.  But then again, if an artist released a song that had 'hidden' messages, is the record company or the artist at fault?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What commercial company is going to be "OK" with adult content in ANY of it's distributed software?  Why would they want that liability?  And make it hidden.. no less?  Please.. I could see it being Datels fault if you started the game and a naked person popped up every time.. shame on them for not even playing the game.. but something that is random, and might not even be seen 90% of the time?  And it's not like it isn't suitable for children, there are adults that also find that type of content offensive.
<br/>
<br/>
What is Datels fault (I guess), is trusting homebrew developers in the first place.  They should have required the source, reviewed it, and compiled the entries distributed manually knowing that the source content was in fact the distributed content.

For you and I, no.  I believe it does from a commercial standpoint.  And when things like this happen, it makes it even worse.  What commercial company is going to want to take the risk that Datel did, and get burned just like they did?

Yes it does, but the fault is of trusting homebrew developers, not for missing hidden screens within a contest entry that they may have never seen.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm wrong, I saw it as a huge opportunity to "showcase" what homebrew developers could do and bring that to the masses.  The product was sold world wide in mainstream retailers, no less.  Not just on the internet were you have to be looking for it.  That takes homebrew to a place I don't think it gets to very often (and now I see why).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Datel products are not sold in stores worldwide and nudity isn't such a big deal in some countries.  Kukulcan's native language isn't english and he may not have known exactly what was going to happen with his game.

<a class="postlink" href="http://us.codejunkies.com/mpds/articles/comp_games/doublons.asp" target="_blank">Doublons</a> is still listed on Datel's site and that picture in their screenshot is <a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS/images/Doublons18.jpg" target="_blank">an angel in a g-string</a>.  The pictures weren't hidden to stop Datel from finding them, the whole point of the game was to reveal pictures.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
