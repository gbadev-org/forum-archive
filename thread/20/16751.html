    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
I downloaded and installed Moonshell on my Micro SD and the NDSTT adapter...
<br/>
I managed to see the jpg picture we are interested to see on the Nintendo, but when I exit the folder and wanna play some of the games presents in the card, I receive an "not support adapter" error.
<br/>
<br/>
If I remove moonshell and only use TTMenu, TTmenu.dat and TTmeny.sys files, then the games are played correctly
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to setup MoonShell only to see JPG and to play games.. but I need serious help...
<br/>
<br/>
Reading the "readme.txt" did not help me too much.
<br/>
Thanks in advance
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">3 things here:
<br/>
<br/>
1) your very close to talking about piracy which is not liked on this forum (I was expecting this thread locked when you first posted)
<br/>
<br/>
2) Once you've looked at your jpeg's the only way to access your normal menu is to reboot your DS, there is no other way to launch the menu system.
<br/>
<br/>
3) If your attempting to use homebrew games and they use libfilesystem / nitroFS then you will have to use a launcher that is upto date and knows about the arguments that need to be passed to an application for libfilesystem to work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">...sorry but what piracy are you talking about?
<br/>
<br/>
When or where did I mention illegal use of software or linked to any piracy site.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you are used to some young guys in this forum using their time to find shortcuts to everything.. I am 47 and have no time for that.
<br/>
I paid good money to buy games to my son....
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to help my son having jpgs of our dog on the DS.. Anyway thanks for the answer, which "is helpful" anyway. I just needed to know if rebooting was necessary all the time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What made me think that you were on about pirated games was the fact that you are unable to run games from moonshell - this normally means that the games are pirated.
<br/>
<br/>
From re-reading your posts, and your comment at the start of your last answer I think I know what your problem may be.  When you installed moonshell on your SD card, did you copy the files over to the SD card, or use the supplied executable to setup your moonshell application correctly.  As moonshell will boot homebrew games, but not if they use nitroFS / libfilesystem as I previously said, for this you will need the homebrew menu that is in the SVN repository for devkitPro.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell (or at least the last version of it that I downloaded) came with a self installing executable wrote in Delphi that requested some information about the DS cart you are using, this is done (i belive) so that the moonshell application can be pre-patched with the correct dldi driver for your cart.  this is then used to boot the game or application nds file.  When exactly do you get the "not support adapter?" error, and what game is it you are trying to run, as I have a felling that you may need to use the homebrew menu application to run those games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Moonshell 1.71 and older can only boot homebrew files on a few specific slot-2 devices, otherwise you'll get the "not support adapter" error.  I <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> Moonshell 2.0 can boot homebrew on more devices, but I'm not really sure.
<br/>
<br/>
Booting homebrew from within other homebrew has always been a rather difficult process, and I've never had 100% success with any method.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

maybe you should try out the homebrewmenu in the devkitPro repository.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think I copied the files.. The self install could not find the drive H which was the sd card.
<br/>
Now I bought another card reader.. and will try again with self installer.
<br/>
<br/>
But I think the issue is "moonshell" itself.
<br/>
I can see jpg, the only thing I cannot do (my son) is playing without rebooting.
