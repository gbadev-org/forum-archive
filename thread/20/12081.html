    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, I am having this problem with my teacher in college, she is explaining to me that Mac Addresses cannot be changed on any network device.
<br/>
<br/>
I rememered, when you dump the Nintendo DS firmware, the Mac Address is stored on the firmware somewhere on line 32. Now, if I was to change this address and then upload the firmware back on to the Nintendo DS, will my mac address be changed? I mean like is there a chip on the DS logic board with the mac address...
<br/>
<br/>
My teacher says that the MAC address is burned in and CANNOT be altered or replaced no matter what. I have seen tutiorials where the MAC address is just stored on a eeprom chip and can be replaced but I would rather have feedback from real people and not from dodgy webpages...
<br/>
<br/>
Am I right or is my teacher right?

Your teacher is partially correct. In many cases, although you can change the reported MAC address in software, the physical address is still burned into a chip on the device and can't be changed.

My teacher mentioned that it is burned in but is it just burned into a eeprom chip? Im pretty sure you could program a eeprom chip and use the same dump format as the nic card so it is readable.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and another thing, I do know how to use a search engine but it is better to get feedback from real people and feedback for my topic.

Then put quotes around "MAC address", since the most common usage of that particular phrase is related to the query.

AKA, software writable.
<br/>
<br/>
Not that I have done any research on the topic at all, but now that you bring up the ralink chipset, isn't the fact that it doesn't retard the data a software "feature"?  Meaning, couldn't any software updatable chipset have new software written that would also make it WMB compatible?  In theory of course, as you would probably have to remove the chip from the card to program (if possible at all) if it isn't onboard flashable.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never noticed the ability to change the mac address on any of my network cards for a pc, but routers have had this option for at least 7 years. in the old days when I first had a cable modem, the cable company would record the mac address of your pc, which the cable guy would plug in and set up. therefore if you plugged another pc into the cable modem or a router that didn't have your mac address, they would block you from having the internet. so you change the router's mac address to the one your computer's net card has, and bewm it'd work fine again. ahh the good ol' days.
<br/>
<br/>
here's a pic from my current router, as you see it has it's own 'default' mac address, it can mimic you pc's address, or a custom one can be inputted. your teacher is dead wrong, good luck convincing them of that.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's funny you should mention that.. As the cablemodem itself would hold onto a MAC address for up to 10 minutes after being unplugged.  So, It didn't need to be recorded by the cable company, people just didn't know they needed to unplug the cablemodem for 10 minutes till the capacitors drained and it lost the MAC.  It would then "learn" the MAC address of the next device connected and all would be well.
<br/>
<br/>
And, since we are taking a walk down memory lane, you could also "borrow" an external IP because by hooking the cablemodem up to your PC, and it gets the MAC address, then unplug it from the PC into a standard HUB (uplink of course) and you could then put another PC on that hub, hardcode an external IP and boyah!  The cablemodem would route the other address as well.. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The quick answer is NO, she is not correct, as the statement is so broad there is no way to know if a wifi chip somewhere in the world has the ability to have a different physical MAC address written to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, the answer could be YES, as for the most part, I'd guess (again, I don't know all of the wifi chips being used) that most are write once devices that allow the manufacturer to write the MAC into the chip and your done.
