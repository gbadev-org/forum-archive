    <h4>#71243 - HyperHacker - Sat Feb 11, 2006 11:51 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just released a nice little <a class="postlink" href="http://hypernova.amarok-shadow.com/programs.php?id=bootgba" target="_blank">app</a>. (For that matter, my first useful DS app.) Since I'm lazy I'll just copy the first bit of the readme here:
<br/>
<br/>
This is a program for your DS that allows you to configure several options of GBA Mode just before you start the game, without having to change your settings in the firmware. It requires PassMe, FlashMe, WifiMe or some other homebrew boot method to be used; see <a href="http://pineight.com/ds/pass/" target="_blank">http://pineight.com/ds/pass/</a> if you don't know what these are.
<br/>
<br/>
Things it can do:
<br/>
-Choose which screen to run the game on right before starting the game (no having to open the options, change it, and reboot).
<br/>
-Turn the backlight on or off before starting the game, without saving the change (so if you turn it off, it'll still be on next time you start up).
<br/>
-Turn the sound amplifier off.
<br/>
-Select from 5 built-in screen borders, or load one from your CF or SD card.
<br/>
-Boot Gameshark Advance, which normally crashes on the DS. (Simply don't insert the GSA until the menu appears.)
<br/>
-Start the game even if the DS does not detect it as a GBA game (eg for cartridges that are misread as Option Paks, or if you just want to stare at the Game Boy logo for some reason).
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, I'm very impressed. This is a useful little thing. Having a coloured border around the game is much nicer than the plain black. Plus it's cool that you can 'hot swap' GBA games, didn't know that was possible. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it works fine on my GBAMP + Flashme'd DS, thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I was almost kinda ticked off when I realized you could hot swap. I'd been stepping through all sorts of code and poking at various registers trying to reset the Gameshark hardware so it would boot up. (Apparently the firmware reads from some unused addresses, confusing it.) Then I realized all I had to do was pull it out and stick it back in again. The firmware freezes if you do this, I guess because it's constantly accessing the cart for some reason. (The app was originally meant to constantly refresh the game info, rather than have it be an option in the menu, but it suffered from the same freezing problem doing this; seems to occurr when the cartridge is removed while it's being read.)
<br/>
<br/>
Of course the best part about hot swapping is you can load an image from your GBAMP/M3/etc and play an actual GBA game. It does freeze if you try to view the file list without the card inserted, not really any way to avoid this.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW the first line of text before the game name shows some debug output. Can anyone who uses various loaders (such as Bafio's wifi transfer) tell me what shows up for "Loader vX", and whether the Return To Menu option works? Also to those who use PassMe and/or M3, does it work well with them? I only have a GBAMP, FlashMe and WMB to test with.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by HyperHacker on Sat Feb 11, 2006 12:19 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Also, V1.01 is up. Just a minor bug fix; it no longer stalls for 20 seconds if you start with a GBAMP/M3/etc, swap carts, and start the game.

Another idea that would solve an issue that people have been asking for nearly since PassMe came out: Could you add support for common GBA flash carts' bankswitching? This would let one put both an NDS loader and GBA native games on the same cart.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Nice, I was just about to post here complaining about that.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be cool if you could make some kind of way of inserting border images into the .NDS file, and make it automatically load the correct one for each game. For example, if I put in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and select Re-read Cartridge, it would automatically look for a border called KINGDOMHEART to use.
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, this is really awesome. Thanks. :)

<br/>
<br/>
Dunno about embedding more images into the .nds (maybe using GBFS) but I like the idea of having a different border for each game. I'll probably add that for the next version.
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples: I can't imagine why people would assume it comes with pirated software. All that's in the zip is the program and a readme. Heck, they'll find out pretty quick if they actually try it. ;-) Using a homebrew game might just confuse people into thinking that it can load GBA multiboot or can't use real carts or other such things. A real, commercial cartridge demonstrates exactly what it does quite nicely.
<br/>
<br/>
Bankswitching I can probably do, but I don't have any flash carts to test with. I can't seem to find much info on how to actually do the switching; anyone know a good page? NDSTech has some nice info on how to write to them, but lacks bankswitch info for most. (Or I'm just blind.)
<br/>

Yup, you're going to have to load all the borders into main RAM before swapping. And don't forget to compress the blank space.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Burton Radons has written a JPEG decoder for the GBA and put it in the public domain. <a class="postlink" href="http://headkaze.webpal.info/" target="_blank">Headspin has adapted it to the DS</a>.

As for GIF, the Unisys patent on LZW data compression expired in Canada (the last relevant jurisdiction) in July 2004, and the gd and giflib projects reintroduced support for LZW GIF at about that time.

I'll check those out, thanks. Still working on fixing those graphic bugs; I suspect it may be a CPU synchronization problem. ARM9 is writing to main RAM while ARM7 is reading from some other part of it, and it seems like this may be blocking the writes even though they have priority.

Oh, the thing doesn't run on my M3.. I'll try running it through the M3 game patcher thingy, but I dunno. usually homebrewn stuff just works.
