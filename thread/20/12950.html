<br/>
I'm working on a hack for Mario Kart DS with another person and we're trying to figure out a way to extract .carc textures from the kiosk demo and put them into the final version of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem, however, is that the course textures in the final version are seperate .CARCs files from the course .CARCs files - in the kiosk version, on the other hand, the course and its texture are in a single .CARC
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have any ideas how I would go about taking a .carc apart? Even info on the file structure would be helpful. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Chishm wrote an extractor a long time ago.  It had a few flaws and was never fixed.  It can decompress the CARCs into NARCs and could also break the NARCs down further however it can't open any NARC that contains folders.  As far as I know he only released one version of it.<br/>_________________<br/>"It is better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than to open it and remove all doubt." ~ Mark Twain</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
