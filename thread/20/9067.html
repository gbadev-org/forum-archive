    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I am about to purchase a DS and I need to know a little more about the mod scene.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to make sure before I purchase any mod hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
How do I make and play backups.
<br/>
<br/>
What are the best features of DS modding. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I hope you guys don't hate me for asking these questions. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HERE we only belive in homebrew,
<br/>
no backups :P
<br/>
<br/>
so if you want to do such things as backup games,
<br/>
and are not interested in homebrew and creation of your Own games,
<br/>
then go to pocket heaven.
<br/>
<br/>
other wise,
<br/>
welcome to gbadev.org's forum :P

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I tend to find a lot of "end users" on Pocket Heaven. Since they are less interested in coding and more interested in playing games (and hence spend longer on them), they tend to come across bugs that rarely show up, and hence are very useful in finding problems. However, fixing problems is better suited to this board.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry guys I wasn't exactly sure on what to expect from my questions. Maybe I wasn't clear but I am still interested in Homebrew for the DS and what it can and can't do.  As well as backing up games and such.

I am thinking of pickup up a DS lite here in Japan, that is why I am so curious.

Hmm...that would be bad.  Would they actually be able to do that (not in the software I wouldn't think, anyway)?  Anyway, I wouldn't probably be worried about it unless a lot of reports of this occur (then I'd probably be thinking it was true).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well if that happens there would be a button combo or something that bypasses this because Nintendo engineers will still want to be able to update DS lites to the latest firmware (either old stock or repairs/refurbs).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Toys R us has em coming. I will make sure I line up nice and early next week.

As for moding I will probably hold off untill it gets more support.
