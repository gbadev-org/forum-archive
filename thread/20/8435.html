<br/>
It is very glad to work with M3SD.
<br/>
<br/>
The version that uses CPU is continued though the transfer rate is slow. (DMA will be corrected one of these days. )
<br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to manage because there are a lot of change items.
<br/>
<br/>
Version0.9 is shipped. (Perhaps, it is only for FlashMe. )
<br/>
<br/>
The PassMe problem and the libmikmod problem are emphatically investigated.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank-you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think playing your music through moonshell and a game at the same it just impossible. Your DS simply cant handle it. I mean games are designed to work with both processing units, so taking even a bit of power would probably make the game run real slow if it even runs at all (I am not a pro here ;)) Adding to this I think moonshell pretty much drains most of the cpu speed already, just compare scrolling through the menu with an MP3 playing and scrolling through the menu wihtout one playing.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I got to say moonshell is a great program and I hope it will keep growing for atleast some time :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, TURITTL.IT will not play, and the panning bugs are still present (though that's probably a bug with libmikmod 3.2.0 beta 2).
<br/>
<br/>
Songs that use all 16 channels at once, while did not tax the CPU before, tax it big time now. I suspect this is because the samples are 16-bit. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, 8-bit samples are no longer corrupted, and loading is still fast, so that's a good thing.
<br/>
<br/>
No matter, when Ficedula gets his ARM7 MikModDS driver up and running, things will use very little CPU power. That's what I'm looking forward to, mostly.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
Here's an example of what I mean. This is what the notes would look like in the pattern:
<br/>
<br/>
C-4 01 64 X00
<br/>
C-5 01 64 .??
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the X00 would pan C-4 to the left speaker. In theory, C-5 should also be panned to the left speaker, despite not having the pan command in there. However, MoonShell's mikmod player will reset C-5 back to the default channel pan (which should also be middle, but since X00 is defined, it should ignore the channel panning default and keep the note panned to the left)
<br/>
<br/>
However, in this next example, the panning IS remembered:
<br/>
<br/>
C-4 01 64 S80
<br/>
C-5 01 64 .??
<br/>
<br/>
C-5 in this example is still panning to the left. However, it is not if sample/instrument panning defaults have been set.
<br/>
<br/>
Sample/Instrument default pans do work, however. This is a good fix but, isn't as dynamic as controlling the panning through the pattern. And the S8x command only has 16 instances, whereas Xxx would have 255 instances, it being hex-based of course.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, IT files that are supposed to keep the channel default panning to middle (when you hit F11 in impulse tracker for instance), will auto pan to mid-left, and mid-right..kinda like how the S3M standard is supposed to do it. The simple fix for that is to use instrument/sample default pans. But, of course, using this method will make the notes auto-pan back to their instrument/sample default panning despite having an Xxx or an S8x command, on the next note.
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno if anyone's kept up, but this is a somewhat complicated bug.. other versions of MikMod don't do this, so I'm kind of confused as to why libmikmod 3.2.0 beta-2 IS doing this. I don't suspect this is something MoonLight can fix, I think it's a mikmod problem. So, to fix it, I think libmikmod 3.2.2 beta should be tried.. I don't know how to compile it to an EXE, nor have the software to do so, so I'm pretty sure I can't test to see if it's the library doing it or not.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway thank you MoonLight, for updates to moonshell. Having a mikmod player on the DS is completely awesome, everyone loves you for it! I'll beta test the memory saver version now.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

It works on mine!  I don't know how important having the newest version of Flashme is as opposed to the most recent version of Chishm's MP firmware, though.  Looks like he updated it 13-01-06 (V2.11).  I'm pretty sure I have that too.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everyone, I'm new ^_^
<br/>
First of all, I wanted to thank Moonlight BIG TIME for making Moonshell and for making it finally compatible with M3SD!
<br/>
You guy absolutely ROCK!
<br/>
I'm here mostly for a particular reason: I cannot make Moonshell work on my ds! Damn!
<br/>
I hope Moonlight or someone else will be able to help me!
<br/>
My problem is:
<br/>
I have a DS with Passkey and M3SD adapter. The SD card is a SanDisk 1GB (the normal, blue one). I downloaded the piczoomtest2 version of moonshell 0.8 SD. I put the BOOT_MP_M3SD.NDS file in my sd card with an .mp3 file and 2 .dpg videos (one encoded by myself, the other one made by falcon).
<br/>
I start my M3, go to the game menu, start the boot_mp_m3sd.nds file. Moonshell starts fine. Select the mp3, it plays fine.
<br/>
BUT
<br/>
when I select one of the videos, the bottom (touch) screen remains active but with backlight off, and the top screen freezes. Pressing buttons has no effect, the whole thing just remains frozen. All I can do is to shut my ds down.
<br/>
I hope you'll be able to help me, many have this working right, I have no idea about why this happens to me.
<br/>
The only "particular" thing is, my M3 has its internal battery dry (the one for SRAM) and is about to be sent back for a replace. Could this be the reason? Does that battery have something to do with mp3 playing and videos not? And the total freeze?
<br/>
thanks for listening, and a heartly greeting to everyone, hope to have a nice stay with all of you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually... you may not even need to do that if you have a DS-specific SD card. I ran a successful test a while ago at swapping entire CF cards in GBAMP while Moonshell was still running. Just go back to the furthest back thing in the directory structure (where you have the choice of IMFS, EXFS, MPCF, etc.) before switching cards.
<br/>
<br/>
I am considering writing a little app to simplify the process of installing Moonshell. Lots of people can be very confused by the number of files in the Moonshell directory, and it would make things easy if there was a nice front-end thing. I am a bit burdened at the moment with another project though, so if anyone else wants to do it go ahead! (I won't mind).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Hm, I can't get this to work with FlashMe v6 and the M3 CF version.  It does work when I use my PassMe.
<br/>
<br/>
I found a minor small bug also.  When you zoom in a picture, then press B to exit out of it.  Then play a DPG video and switch screens so you can show the window it is in.  The zoom percent the picture was on is displayed in the upper right corner.  This bug does not hurt anything, I just thought I would show it to you.

There was a stack overflow that was able to be put on the MP3 plug-in for a long time.
<br/>
However, it is recent to speed-up by CPU acceleration.
<br/>
Trouble was not actualized.
<br/>
<br/>
FinalBeta2(mshl08fb2) works if my guess is correct. It worries.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Ah, that makes sense...if LibMad was eating memory it shouldn't have been, that would be a big problem.

This version does work for me, using the M3 Compact Flash version and Flashme v6, or a PassMe.  Thank you very much MoonLight.  :)

You're right. I've been <span style="font-style: italic">trying</span> to find bugs, and I haven't found anything except the ImageZoom percentage bug that someone mentioned before. Well, and OGG files don't have a progress indicator. Neither of those really affect anything.
<br/>
<br/>
And, the window position setting hasn't been added. MoonShell did say he was going to add it, didn't he?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Man, it's like you read my mind! I was going to request being able to go past 100% volume (DS isn't very loud), and here I see it's already been done! Image zooming is sweet too, and you even fixed that little annoying problem where you could accidentally change the music mode when moving the window (by clicking MusicNext when you meant to click the title bar). In fact since it pops up right at the bottom, I don't even need to move it. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
I did have some problems with the documentation, though. First off, look at the bottom of MoonShell08.eng.txt... you forgot to translate the newest updates! :-o The other thing is in readme.txt (which doesn't show up correctly as my system isn't in Japanese), I see this line near the beginning:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">??????? ??FlashMe????????????????B????????K?{????B

<br/>
<br/>
GBA Movie Player??t?@?[??????????????NDS??g????????????A???B</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
In the English version, the word 'crashme' doesn't show up. What's it doing here? O_o
<br/>
<br/>
Also if anyone else had the problems I did trying to replace the background image, here's what I found. The image must be 8-bit colour. With 24-bit, you get an error with a lot of garbage and "64KB" in it. (The garbage being what should be Japanese text... it'd show up properly if you used Japanese as the default code page, but you have to reboot to change that. :-() With 16-bit, it works but the image won't actually show, just a message about not supporting 16-bit. (Weird: The message says "64KB", and I'm assuming this means the image has to be 64KB or less. But a 16-bit image is 96KB, and it didn't cause a problem...)
<br/>
<br/>
Also if you get an error with "NDSROM" in it, it means _BOOT_MP.nds is missing.
<br/>
<br/>
