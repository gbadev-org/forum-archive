    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
to start off, I have nearly no C experiance nor have I done any NDScoding, but I was looking through my files and came across the Rosetta stone explorer Japanese.
<br/>
I was wondering if it would be possible to read (the audio is mpeg1 playable by Winamp, pictures are simple Jpeg) the data of the ISO and make a GBAMP (or any other nds device that can read larger amount of data) .nds file that works like the Rosetta stone explorer on PC.
<br/>
Since I don't really have any coding experiance it would probably be to hard for me, but maybe someone feels like it may be nice too, or is up for a challenge :).
<br/>
Since I am interested in learning a bit of C I would be stupid enough to give it a try myself :), because maybe noone here has the Rosetta stone Explorer CD (but any of the Rosetta stone explorers will do).
<br/>
<br/>
*The rosetta stone explorer is a small cd with a bunch of simple vocab/phrase sets that you have to learn (try googling if you don't know it).
<br/>
**Maybe there is a good free alternative for using this commercial CD?
<br/>
