    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, recently some homebrew releases using the wifi/multiplayer functionality have been released but these releases are very few. All these games require there own workstation based servers written quickly for the game. 
<br/>
<br/>
I had an idea but I've only the smallest amount of knowledge on how to actually achieve it.
<br/>
<br/>
We need a Plug-In based multi-game multi-protocol server - allowing ANY ds developer to create a multiplayer game.. connect to a local server *if we create more then one interlinked server* Support for games/applications at a centeral location.
<br/>
<br/>
Chat/Scores/downloads/news/whatever in a single location...

They already exist.  This could just make things easier for some games, since you would only have to write a client and may not need to write a server.  It's impossible for one server to support every type of game but at least it could save coders time.  It would be cool if all games shared the same or linked chat servers.  A system like xbox live would be nice, one that shows the last game you played and most played games etc.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not easy to get homebrew coders to agree on everything though and many people like to code their own servers.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dunno, the idea of making a centralized score and maybe match making server has been going round my head for at least a year. But making the server serve others games, I dunno. If we have a standard server which would support all games using plugins, it wouldn't mean the game's plugins are great, they could also be rushed. Thus rendering the score server instable, in many cases.
<br/>
<br/>
Chat and stuff could easily be localized on 1 central server, but I think games need their own server, but then these games wouldn't need their own chat system and such, so that's a good idea. I'd love to start code this 'centralized' part, but unfortunately I have way to less time.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

   &lt;Lick&gt;   MrShlee, what would you say of a DS version of the catalog?
<br/>
   &lt;MrShlee&gt;   huh
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   JaJa_, i know DSO is cool, but I think is too closed source on it
<br/>
   &lt;MrShlee&gt;   That would be pretty cool
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   MrShlee: like DSO homebrew database, but active
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   =)
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   and with a screenshot preview
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   heh
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   yes, DSO is pretty closed
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   and user submitted reviews!
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   lol
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   AND RATING
<br/>
   &lt;MrShlee&gt;   if worse comes to worse.. keep 4 versions of each game on the server.. so its compatabily with each cart
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   AND RESUME- DOWNLOAD
<br/>
   &lt;MrShlee&gt;   updated versions..
<br/>
   &lt;MrShlee&gt;   and shit
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   omg
<br/>
   &lt;MrShlee&gt;   its possible..highly possible
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   DevSceneCatalog is born
<br/>
   &lt;MrShlee&gt;   Just a large project
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   yes
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   I could code the PHP side
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   do it in small bits
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   actually both sides i can code
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   first get the chat server
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   but i have so many projects right now
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   then the basic catalog
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   then integrate the two
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   then advance the catalog
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   oooo, and we could do user pages too
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   like most played and stuff
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   i think that was mentioned in the thread
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   highscore
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   =)
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   o and if there's a cheater, we life-ban him
<br/>
   &lt;MrShlee&gt;   This is were it starts to get advanced..
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   and then the DS explodes
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   just flag them as a cheat
<br/>
   &lt;Lick&gt;   so he has no hands
<br/>
   &lt;JaJa_&gt;   rofl

    <h4>#99939 - Mrshlee - Thu Aug 24, 2006 8:23 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want basic : What you really need is an ubersmall library to include in the arm7 to connect to irc and allow ingame communication.
<br/>
<br/>
The irc relay protocol is too slow to use as a server.
<br/>
Using it as a middle man to connect gamers is great
<br/>
<br/>
but then your still stuck without a server.. and thats the point of my thread.
<br/>
<br/>
EG: dsdoom needs an actual game server though which currently doesn't run on a ds and you need to manually start the server each time you want to play a multiplayer game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We would need a server to handle the handshaking.. the IM and the server itself. 
<br/>
<br/>
each game would need its own server.. even if not very powerful, each game/server would be seperate threads.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea starts simple but gets advanced pretty fast :|<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's going to be easier to write the lobbying application (with all the features we described (catalog, chat, news)) than to actually write a all-games-protocol-enabled server.
<br/>
We're better off thinking of a way to lobby the gamers from our application to a server already hosted by one of the gamers.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most DS Wifi games are played as peer-to-peer, not a server/client model.

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> connects/logs-in to <span style="font-weight: bold">server</span>.
