Hmmm...does Darkfader's firmware dumper (that writes to compact flash) work for the DS Lite?  I don't have one yet, so I can't try it.  I may be able to get one for a very good price within a couple of weeks though and I'll definitely at least try to dump the firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">quick question, is the way the lite changes the brightness via thr firmware menus, or some kind of switch on the hardware?
<br/>
would it be possible to put lite firmware on a regular ds and make use of the brightness settings? (I'm aware the brightness is limited by the quality of the ds screens)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a hardware setting, so it won't work on older DS.  I'm curious if newer games will have a brightness setting, so you don't have to reboot but I doubt it.  Shouldn't need to change the brightness very often.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, there is one game I know of that has a brightness adjustment menu.  Has nothing to do with the DS Lite though...Viewtiful Joe has three light settings...one normal, one off, and one inbetween.  I guess that means that you could do that to an extent with a normal DS, your 'normal' setting would probably just be far brighter.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
