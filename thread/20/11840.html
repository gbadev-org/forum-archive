    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My DSlite broke recently, in a bad way. You know the common issue with the hinge on this model cracking when you open or close the DS? Well, it skipped the whole cracking phase and broke off entirely. Now I have a DS that works, but whose top screen threatens to fall off at any moment. Needless to say, I need to redeem my 1 year warrently and send it in to nintento to be repaired.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I flashed it to aid in my homebrew development, and I think they will kind of notice when the health and warning screen doesn\'t show up. I need to flash the original DSlite firmware back onto the machine before I send it back. It should be the same process as flashing the flashed version on, yes? Can someone point me to the file that will let me restore the original lite firmware? Thanks a bunch.

PS: Because of this, my DS development will be down for a few weeks. Darn.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

OK then, stealth version it is... for now. If there is a way, someone please let me know. I am trying to stay on good terms with them you  know...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did a tiny bit of research on my own on dumping the DS's firmware, but all I found was the function that Pepsiman added to DSLinux, which only dumps to CF (no SD or variants) and only allows you to dump the firmware, not restore it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be interested in finding a way to dump my personal firmware before flashing for just such an occasion, but it would be useless if it's impossible to rewrite it.  I'd rather not use PPFlash, which is probably the main option left.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll watch this thread to see if another solution pops up.
<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, as Devil_Spawn said, using NoFlashMe on a DSLite will create some bugs (I believe related to Pictochat) that would be easily noticeable.  Best to install FlashMe_stealth and hope they don't hold the button combo upon bootup.  I haven't heard of anybody who was denied replacement or repair because of FlashMe, so I'd say your chances are pretty good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I may have shot myself in the foot. I told them (when I sent it) first that the right hinge was messed up, which will be obvious anyway when they try to open it. I also mentioned that the firmware had been \"altered\" obviously by a friend, and asked if they would kindly fix it for me. Of course the very worst that can happen is they send it back un-fixed and I have to buy a new one, but who knows.
<br/>
<br/>
Are these places that flash DS equipment licensed to do so?

<br/>
For flashcarts that don't have write support under DSLinux, you could either:
<br/>
<br/>
A. Make a build with NFS support and mount a writable NFS share (semi tested, should work)
<br/>
<br/>
B. Copy the firmware contents to SRAM 64K at a time and join them together afterwards (if the cart has sram)
<br/>
<br/>
C. Make a build with netcat and fire it down a socket that way
<br/>
<br/>
D. + many more methods</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How to unflash a DS Lite ?
<br/>
Easy, but need lot of things :
<br/>
<br/>
Ds-Link
<br/>
Neoflash MK4-Mini
<br/>
DS Lite + Flasme
<br/>
DS Lite + Original Firmware
<br/>
Firmware tool from DS-Link Staff
<br/>
PC + MicroSD Reader
<br/>
<br/>
1) use MK4-Mini to start the DS-Link on the DS Lite with an original firmware
<br/>
2) use the Firmware tool to dump the firmware
<br/>
3) rename the firmware with your computer FWBK.bin to FW.bin (or someting like that, read the readme...)
<br/>
4) restore this firmware with the same tool but on the DS Lite with flashme...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
