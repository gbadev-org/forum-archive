depends on your personal taste and what you watch(animation or real).

I will take "256x144" @ 9frames as i like the video to be not that blocky.

<br/>
i just converted a 10MB mpeg of F-Zero from E3 a couple of years ago
<br/>
settings i put in avi2dmv were:
<br/>
128x96 resolution, 30fps, quantize x4.00
<br/>
<br/>
the video was a little flickery, and some of those blocks from such a low res, but it looked like it stayed at 30fps the whole way through
<br/>
<br/>
then decided to try the same but at 256x192 resolution...
<br/>
unfortunately it froze, but i'm still impressed

in the dmvenc tool the max framerates are also outdated:

But i must say, and im sure ill speak for al the members of this forum, im a very impressed, u manage to bring so many updates in such little time and the updates that you make are also very useful, whith the movie playing at the topscreen and increased fps, im certain i will never use the old gbamp software again (-_-)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lukaso on Wed Aug 31, 2005 6:03 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Now it'd be nice to have the source to this and have dvm support in ffmpeg so's I could rip my veggie tales videos directly from dvd (for my daughter).

Hi

Well, either you make the global.ini unreadable which is not proable or the bat is not finding the programs. Try to download again the latest zip and unzip it without changing the directory structure.

Hi
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to encode an wmv file and it went alright with no errors. But when I put it in the CF card and run it on the DS only the first image appears. The sound is ok but it gets stuck on the first frame or second.
<br/>
<br/>
Same thing happened to you?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Well same thing happened when I converted an MPEG (that I had previously converted) with more frames per second.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm converting the same wmv as before, but with the "normal" frames per second. I'll re-edit in a short while.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: Well it plays the sound well as before, but the picture goes twice as fast. So its no good. I'm not sure but I think the wmv videos are not standartly encoded, I mean, there are a lot of "dirty" wmvs. But I can be wrong. Going to try some more wmvs, if there's any success I'll post it here.

It seems that video suffers from bad colours saturation. Maybe it's because you use YUV 4:1:1 , not 4:2:0 (like in MPEG2) ? Last time I converted some of my homemade videos, and resulting video was almost black &amp; white.

oh sorry I thought you have more than one CF cards.

you should really look in ebay or at pawn shops for cheap CF cards.

I found one(32MB...better than nothing) in a thrown-away broken digicam.

maybe Mighty Max is able to release a version of his GBAMP multiboot-programm which is able to boot moonshell and emus at the same time.

I really don't know what you want to tell me(us)?

You mean perhaps that sound and video are out of sync?

Or that there are some freezes in your converted videos?
<br/>
<br/>
When you mean the short freezes:
<br/>
I got them too several times and didn't know why till I realized that the conversion-software doesn't like it when I run too many other apps at the same time.I guess I have too less RAM(256).

i am experiencing framedrops in all of my videos. It usually occurs with : 14 fps at 192х144  
<br/>
Some of the files i encoded were 100mb+
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it just hangs for a few seconds...Sometimes it hangs at the start en never continues(the music does play correct, the player doesnt crash or anything)

Ill try to encode with no other programs running... (i thought i already did that the first time), and in the taskmanager ill set the convertor property to 'above normal'

I had some problems with changing the colors, the "global.ini" has 2 bugs:

- You have to remove the ";" before the variables

Yes, but with quantize set to 4, the videos look bad :(

THere's already a lack of colour in the dmv video, and if you also set quantize to 4 they become even less colorful.

the multicoloured artefacts also appear to b more visible in x4.0, actually the video itself is a bit more pixelated and blockier too

<br/>
because the files were so small, it was difficult to tell which was smoother, but in the end i think i noticed some motion that was in x1.0 that was skipped out in x4.0
<br/>
<br/>
i'm gonna say that it depends on how big your file is. i've noticed that a large video runs smoother at high quantize, but if your running a smaller file leave the quantize at 1.0</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yeah, it supports 3 file systems: MPCF (movie player compact flash) GBFS (game boy file system(?)) and IMFS (implant file system). moonshell includes the tools for creating the imfs which is kinda like a zip...in windows etc you see only the one file, but it contains several files inside it

It works in normal flash carts and supercard, though it seems that dmv dont start on them (surely on superdcard, not sure about flash card)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I converted the same video to 256x192 8fps amd 192x144 16 fps both with quantize 4x and both look good :) I suggest to view the 192x144 in the lower screen so it will fit better ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Those wounds which are showed now on his site are def. not car crash injuries.These are carpetknife cuts done by himself.I guess he(if it's even him on the photos) suffers from a self-injurying(sp?) sickness.I saw similar photos when I studied psychologie.You can see already healed (horizontal)cuts on his arm under the fresh (vertical) cuts.

With MP3 you can cheat on the equalizer because MP3 is a sub-band/transform codec, and you can scale the individual sub-bands. Winamp's graphic EQ does this.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This is because MoonShell expects the memory to be filled with 00s, but Darkain's loader doesn't do it. It is caused a bug in both programs. I had this problem when writing the new firmware for GBAMP, but I managed to fix it. This is why it takes 3 seconds to boot the new GBAMP firmware hack.

The new firmware does start MoonShell. I have made sure that MoonShell works.

I would advise you to use libnds from now on, and the latest version of DevKitPro. NDSlib is no longer being worked on. If you want help getting the new GBAMP Ver2 firmware features in to MoonShell, I can do that. The only problem is that MoonShell doesn't compile properly on my setup, due to the old libraries being used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believe they were 22050Hz, which the new version of MoonShell is supposed to support, so I will try that.

<br/>
The bitrate was 64kbps, so I'm sure that's not the problem..they should work now.

Now alls I have to worry about is the fact that directories with many files in it at once will not play, and actually crash moonshell.

<br/>
The size of the maximum file is remarkably limited because of the sample data.

Another topic. As for MoonShell, only multi boot cannot be done, and firmware V1 of GBAMP operates.
<br/>
<br/>
betatestはいくつかの既知のバグがあります。
<br/>
少なくともPCMは不良です。
<br/>
//IMFS/にサンプルデータが入っています。
<br/>
DMV再生に'はげしいクリックノイズ'以外のバグがあったら試してみて下さい。
<br/>
サンプルデータのせいで、最大ファイルサイズが著しく制限されます。

この問題は正式版では解除されます。

I have that problem. Setting the audio to Mono fixes that problem, but the video is still black and distorted.

<br/>
ふぅむ。
<br/>
<br/>
ベンチマ?あ、死んだってさ。ま、しゃーないね。眠いし後で書こう。
<br/>
<br/>
実家。死んでる。実感湧かないなぁ。硬いけど。
<br/>
256x192pixel/32frameの展開描画時間。テストははるのあしおとのトレイラームービーだから元々相当重い（場面展開が速い）データ。
<br/>
<br/>
compress type / 32frame decode time(ms) / 無圧縮サイズ対圧縮サイズ比
<br/>
無圧縮 4880ms 1:1
<br/>
zlib 4027ms 1:0.457
<br/>
bzip2 9565ms 1:0.434
<br/>
lzss 3790ms 1:0.542
<br/>
<br/>
bzip2は遅いなと思っていたけど、まさかここまで違うとは。
<br/>
lzssより無圧縮のほうが遅いのはつまりCFの読み込み時間が相当違うってことかぁ。
<br/>
というか、さすが任天堂様のBIOSコードだけあってlzss展開が速い。さすが。
<br/>
んー。zlibでも256x192pixel/8frameは間に合うんだから、後はユーザ選択がいいのかな。bzip2はDMVでは使い道が無いから外そう。
<br/>
<br/>
無圧縮の重さを見ていると、先にCFリードをなんとかした方が近道な気もするけど、とはいえ既にDMAやろうとして挫折（理由不明）してるし。う～～～ん。近いうちもっかいトライ。まずはCFリードの非DMAベンチマークから。
<br/>
<br/>
で。どうやら水曜日に田舎に行く模様。腐らないのかね。虫沸いたらやだよ。綺麗なまま埋めてあげたいけど?。忙しいから仕方ないのか。うー。
<br/>

今日明日は昨日と比べたら暑くならないらしい。よかったよかった。ひとしきり愛でて満足したので帰って寝よう。</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So far as I know, it sounds like only the beta releases have this optimised video, so I guess they probably didn't change the FPS listed in the program since it isn't out of beta yet, and it sounds like he's still very much working on getting the FPS limit even higher.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is not possible to correspond because I do not have M3.

ARM7 takes charge of ADPCM codec.

Now i tried the update u gave for the final beta, u encoded a clip with the updated dmvenc and it seemed to run well. After some time, about 20 sec, the screen turns blue or green. The sound still continues and u can still fast forward or rewind, but the screens stays green. when u cancell the movie and try a new one it doesnt work and moonshell hangs.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I guess that it is 'Buffer underrun error'.

I was not able to reproduce the situation though it was regrettable.

The frame did not drop to issinoho.

Therefore, trouble did not occur.

Infantile Paralysiser just wanted to warn us all not to run suspicious romloader.nds, which appeared in the Net not so long ago. romloader.nds in fact is a trojan, like Trojan.PSPBrick. If you're stupid enough to run it on yours DS, it erases portions of DS firmware, and thus brickyfies your DS. Hopefully, if you installed FlashMe before that, you can try to start in Recovery mode (A+B+Select+Start during boot) and restore firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Kir on Fri Oct 07, 2005 2:10 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

The lip synch is *slightly* out, but only very slightly and if you use the seek bar it seems to rectify itself. Not bad enough to bother me.
<br/>
<br/>
What is more troublesome is the size of the files. A render at that quality of a 70Mb AVI results in a 120Mb DMV file. It would be lovely to get that down a tad.
<br/>
<br/>
I would agree though, the picture quality is brilliant.

A video decoder running at full screen 24fps has to decode 256*192*24 = 1,179,648 signal points per second in addition to the audio. It's difficult to get a decoder optimized that far, especially given that MPEG-4 video (DivX/XviD) is more computationally complex than MPEG-1 video.

cut&amp;paste from my reply.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;It doesn't correspond because SuperCard is not owned. 
<br/>
&gt;Moreover, specifications were not found.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The point is certainly a correct answer. 
<br/>
The MD5 calculation is slow. The MD5 falsification is easy.

..shell/global.ini ProtectCrashMe=x

This will be added. I think that I will make this 'ON' by default.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
