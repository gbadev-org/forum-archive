    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if the DS is capable of streaming MP3 data fast enough off the GBAMP and decoding it for playback fast enough to use your DS as an MP3 player.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious because I don't have a job right now, which means (a) I don't have enough money to replace my 7 year old *original* Creative NOMAD.  We're talking version 1.0 here.  And (b) I have enough free time to look into making an MP3 player.  Not that I think I'd be smart enough to actually do it, but it would be something to do in my spare time.
<br/>
<br/>
But instead of wasting my time if it won't work (or has already been done, maybe?) I thought I'd give a quick post and see what the pros say.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've put it on my GBAMP, man talk about fast!  I doubt I'll be going back now.  If only it would read text, and support .gb, .gba and .nes (with supporting emulators) then there'd be no point in using original firmware anymore IMO.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess I meant "in the same way the GBAMP works originally".  You know, all you have to do is put goomba.gba on the root directory and you can put your .gb files anywhere and just run them.  It's a LOT easier than using a rom builder to cram all your files together.  Especially when you want to add or remove just one game.
<br/>
<br/>
But regardless, I hear that snesDS should work with Moonshell, but so far I haven't had any luck.  When I build the ROM, I get a .ds.gba file which, of course, won't work because it's treated as a GBA file.  But if I change the extention to .nds to load, I get a white screen which tells me that the file probably needs a proper loader prepended to it to get it to work.  Or so I assume.  I'm gonna keep trying, but if anyone has the solution handy I won't be opposed to taking the easy way out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It shouldn't be hard to make a "plugin" for moonshell to start nesds when an NES file is run..as long as you configure where nesds IS.
<br/>
<br/>
Though it'd be better if say, nesDS had an "exit" function.
<br/>
<br/>
snesDS is in the process of being modified..that, or chishm's firmware is..to allow snesDS to be loaded in memory addresses that would allow it to function normally on the GBAMP..like if it were run through wmb. Well, him or Gladius is doing that. Can't remember who.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, needless to say, people are working.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be nice if there were a bunch of "Christmas" releases where everything (including home brewn wifi) were all released as Christmas gifts.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
