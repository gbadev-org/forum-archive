    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, so a lot of people don't know how to get it to work. I admit, I was the same way. My wireless router would not pick anything up.
<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, I still have my wireless card that I use WifiMe (the Ralink chipset ones) for. It's gone unused..but now I have a reason to have it. To use these awesome homebrewn apps with... Here's how I did it:
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the gigabyte Ralink softap drivers (look for the link, I don't have it handy).. then I specially configured Windows to use it so it wouldn't conflict with my home network.
<br/>
<br/>
1. After installing the soft ap drivers for the card do this:
<br/>
<br/>
-Go to Network Connections (in WinXP)
<br/>
-Right click on the card, and select "properties"
<br/>
-Double Click on Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and use these settings:
<br/>
<br/>
( )Obtain an IP address automatically
<br/>
(*)Use the following IP address:
<br/>
IP Address: 192.168.2.1
<br/>
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
<br/>
Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1
<br/>
<br/>
( ) Obtain DNS server address automatically
<br/>
(*) Use the following DNS server addresses:
<br/>
Preferred DNS Sever: 192.168.2.1
<br/>
Alternate DNS Server: 192.168.2.2
<br/>
<br/>
-Configure the Gigabyte console to your desired settings. DO NOT use WEP.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Run your wireless app of choice.
<br/>
-Run the batch files that either the file transfer program use, or the DS Keyboard app uses.
<br/>
-Turn your DS on, and run the corresponding NDS file for whichever app you wish to use
<br/>
[For DS Key program]
<br/>
Click "Connect to an AP" then "Search for an AP".. Find the wireless card that you're using, you could have called the SSID anything in its configuration, no big deal though. Skip the DS Transfer Program part that's next
<br/>
[For DS Transfer Program]
<br/>
-Click "Config and Connect to an AP"
<br/>
-Click "Search for an AP"
<br/>
<br/>
[Continuing on...]
<br/>
-Click on your AP, and click "Accept"
<br/>
-When it asks for the IP addresses and such, put these settings in:
<br/>
<br/>
TCP/IP: Static IP
<br/>
IP Address: 192.168.2.100
<br/>
Gateway: 192.168.2.1
<br/>
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
<br/>
DNS 1: 192.168.2.1
<br/>
DNS 2: 0.0.0.0 (it's not really that important)
<br/>
<br/>
-Click Connect
<br/>
-It should say "Connected!"
<br/>
<br/>
The next options are for the DS Keyboard app:
<br/>
-Click the "UDP Test" option
<br/>
-Click Accept when it asks you for the port number (9501 should be fine, it's not conflicting with anything)
<br/>
-Click the Test Send IP number "Edit" option, and set it to 192.168.2.1
<br/>
-Start pushing buttons, and look inside the console window where you ran the batch file, it should start showing activities when you push some buttons on the DS. pretty freakin' sweet :)
<br/>
<br/>
These options are for the DS Transfer app:
<br/>
-Click the "File Transfer" option that you chose.
<br/>
-Select your directory with the Java console window that you want to transfer files from.. Don't go over 128 files.
<br/>
-Make sure SRV IP matches your wireless card's IP address, which in this case, would be 192.168.2.1
<br/>
<br/>
Voila. Hopefully this will make things clearer for those of you who have Ralink cards that you're not using. :) I like this method better than going through my wireless router..mostly because I actually got this method to work. :P
<br/>
<br/>
lol. Have fun.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
