    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wanted to test my wireless setup here in anticipation of the Wii, but I've never actually gotten any of the DS's Nintendo WiFi games (difficult as that may be to believe ;) ).  Before I run out and get one, anyone know if any of the official demos have used Nintendo WiFi? Like maybe the Tetris demos or something? I've tried the March of the Minis and Clubhouse Games demos, and they didn't appear to have any online capabilities.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can get the wifi_lib_test from SgStair's website. It includes a war-driving application and you'll probably be able to connect or something.

I'm working on a Wifi Configurator that is similar to ElHobito's project, but his wasn't finished and he abandoned it, I guess.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if you are homebrew-capable, then in that case there are a number of programs that you could use to check online connectivity. Well, assuming you aren't using the Wi-Fi Connector in it's stock configuration.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
