    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently purchased my NDS a Supercard CF and two CF cards(1 gig and 512).  I am loving playing my NDS, NES , GBA roms and so I thought I would try out moonshell and I have had no luck.  Every post I read says its great but I havent gotten a good video to work yet.   Is there a tutorial written? a FAQ?  I think it would be great to list all the needed information for converting in one spot.  I cant figure out how to get dvd files(i can get the files off the dvds but dont know what to do with the VOB files) and I have tried some divx files(video is good but sound is always gets off) to work.  What are the best settings.  Somebody please help........I have been making videos for my Cell phone that work fine(sound stays with video) and I know the DS is better than my phone

What you need to do is convert those VOB and DivX files. DivX files are coming out with no sound because the sound format has to be Mp2. I use a converter called Xilisoft Video converter to convert my video files to .wmv although I did need to change the audio format to mp2. Moonshell DPGenc can encode video files that are Mpeg, avi or wmv although they need to have mp2 audio or lower.<br/>_________________<br/>White DS --- Supercard SD --- Passcard ---

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you got MoonShell to work with audio-only (.mp3, .ogg, and .s3m) files yet?
<br/>
<br/>
As for the MP2 issue, you can use VirtualDub to separate out video and audio of any .avi file. (Do NOT use .wmv if you value freedom of software.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks guys for the help.  Maybe if I am more specific you can get me from start to finish.

Yes, moonshell has worked fine with my audio(I wish I could program though, a nice GUI on the touch screen would be cool) and I have had limited success with my video
<br/>
<br/>
DIVX:  I get a good, not great, video with audio that starts in sync and then gets ahead by about a second.  I would like to use VirtualDub to fix this as one of you suggested since I already use it when I do DVD stuff. What do I do when I seperate the audio and video?  Do I join them again as a different format?
<br/>
<br/>
VOB:  I have used DVDDecryter and created a single VOB of a movie but the moonshell encoder give me an error if I use that file(something about time)What format should I change it to and with what program(if I can use VirtualDub for this too that would be great).

Thanks again for the help, maybe oneday I'll be able to lend some info</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
