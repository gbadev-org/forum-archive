Its true you cant here it in noisy areas like trains and such, but that's not a loudness issue, that mores to do with the ambient noise of the surrounding area overwealming your ears.
<br/>
<br/>
Good headphones is whats needed really.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Incidently, does such a thing as wireless earphones exist?

Always thought they would be perfect for listening to the DS on the go, but I have a hard time finding anything suitable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. Cheap
<br/>
2. Compact
<br/>
3. Loud

Pick two.

Why not just use a pair of headphones, most people around you in a public setting will not likely appreciate you playing a game very loudly.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure of your intent for having a small loud sound system, but here is something that might work for you.

You know...this reminds me of those 3rd Party speaker attatchments for the original GB (I mean the toaster sized one) that made the sound stupidly loud, to where if you wanted  you could out power anything else in the room.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
