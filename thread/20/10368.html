    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made a small Tetris clone called Suomitetris DS.
<br/>
<br/>
It's my first NDS game and i made it to practice C++. Suomitetris DS has no new ideas and it is just a simple Tetris clone but i hope you'll like it anyway.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice game, looks and feels really good! And I really like the animation/sound for disappearing lines. The touch screen controls are a nice addition.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the source code looks very clean and is well-documented, which makes it a good example for learners.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally only missed key repetition, i.e. when I keep the D-Pad pressed to the right, the brick should move one unit to the right, pause for one tick, and then movefurther until it reaches the border / an obstacle. Also, I would like to be able to customize the controls to make it feel more like Tetris DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I think it's a nice homebrew game, especially for a first release. So, keep it up!

<br/>
1. I would not have the tiles instantly zap down into position when you touch the, erm "go down button". I would have it just go really fast.

<br/>
2. I would like to have the option of turning the tetris piece the other way.

3.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for all the feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is new and hopefully better version:
<br/>
<br/>
Version 1.1
<br/>
Controls are now customizable
<br/>
Added auto repeat for moving left/right and soft drop
<br/>
There are now two rotate buttons: clockwise and counter clockwise rotate

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Tetris clone" and "Tetrisesque" seem to be OK as long as the game's title itself doesn't sound too much like "Tetris". (Yes, I plan to rename TOD as of the next release.)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Gameplay is much improved. I'm looking through the source code.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT^2: 87,000 on my first try of this build.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I noticed is that all the pieces except O seem to start out one space to the right of where they "should" according to my intuition.
<br/>
<br/>
Based on what I have read of the source code, your game uses the older memoryless randomizer instead of the newer "bag" randomizer that generates a random permutation of all 7 pieces at once before repeating any. It's a valid game design decision; I just wanted to mention that I noticed it. From GameLevel.cpp:123:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">BrickType brickType = (BrickType) (rand() % 7); // brickType = 0...6</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
I saw no provision for a hold piece or ghost piece. That was intended, right?
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if there were a sound for moving the piece sideways. This would give the autorepeat a bit more feedback, allowing for faster, more secure play.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
I liked the customizable controls. Good move.
<br/>
<br/>
I *do* have some input on the high score screen, however.
<br/>
<br/>
- I think the key that you are touching should light up a different color, so you have visual feedback that you are depressing it.
<br/>
<br/>
-The font for the high scores should be darker in my opinion. The current background makes the score hard to read.
<br/>
<br/>
The backgrounds throughout the game, however, are actually very nice.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whoa, I had a different save on SRAM when got to the high score screen, and suomitetris read part of it and displayed garbage for high scores, heh.  You might want to have a sort of save signature that is written so a suomitetris save can be identified form a different game's save.
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that the click sound that occurs when a tetrimineo (sp?) hits the floor is slightly off. Not really imperative, but slightly annoying in my opinion. 
<br/>
<br/>
Saving custom controls to SRAM would be neat as well.
