    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Any one intrested in making a new mp3 player for the ds.
<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas:
<br/>
<br/>
TOP SCREEN:
<br/>
<br/>
Now playing
<br/>
Album art (if possible)
<br/>
Artist , track etc
<br/>
<br/>
BOTTOM SCREEN
<br/>
<br/>
Navigation through artists, albums, titles etc. With touch screen.
<br/>
Volume control.
<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas. The player built in to moonshell is good but a app just for music (mp3 ogg etc) would be great with navigation like ipods.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

have it look like ipod with the scroll wheel of the ipod on the touch screen and the screen of the ipod on the top screen or you could put a whole ipod sideways on the touchscreen leaving the top blank or for another menu of somesort</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been thinking about this for a while now too. If only I knew how to code. The DS really needs a more robust MP3 player app. Playlists, album art, EQ, ect.. would all be awesome. Even something along the lines of a Winamp port would be more than good enough. I'm actually really surprised no one has tackled this yet. Moonshell is great and all, but a dedicated MP3 player app with more features is desperately needed for the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

just searching pPod (for ppc i said palm my mistake not that it matters) 
<br/>
i can not only find pics of this but actual downloads so id say a noncommercial homebrew app would be safe either way its just a suggestion
<br/>
<br/>
speaking of pocket pc and/or palm they ran on arm processors whats stopping there apps to be ran on a ds with either modification or a virtual enviroment running the palm os or something of that sort</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well then i guess we'll have to make a touch square or something. Anything touched based would work, it doesnt necceserialy have to be a wheel as the ds screen is larger then that and im sure someone could come up with a good touch based interface</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i believe your right but creative is busy battling them over the interface(nested file munus)regardless if that is a ridiculas suit in my opinion
<br/>
 apple deals with comercial threats before non and they have there hands full right now
<br/>
plus the most important part is even if they have a patent on the click wheel 
<br/>
they have filed for a patent but the haven't gotten it  on patent number 20060026535
<br/>
which is a "mode-based graphical user interfaces for touch sensitive input devices", which generates and operates virtual GUI control elements depending on where the user touches the screen."
<br/>
<br/>
this pending patent my friends is a virtual click wheel  and exactly what we would want which we can still do at this time</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
this is also a good possibility as long is the skin was well done and not an after thought it could look and function decent</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
