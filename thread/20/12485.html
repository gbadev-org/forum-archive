Seems like it is better than the Conways Game Of Life port. But I have absolutely no right to compare since they are different. If anyone still have the homebrew, can you kindly upload it? I really want to try it. I can't find it anywhere and the site given in the link is gone. Thanks in advance.<br/>_________________<br/>One Piece is the best manga/anime I've ever read or watched.

This DSlife was made by DynamicStability.. a guy who left the scene awhile ago..
<br/>
<br/>
I used to run WhatAliceFound.net.. now turned into Dev-Scene.com so I'll look for a back-up of the release he made.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

That's funny, usually it is the other way round: When something is in
<br/>
the 'wild' (the internet) it will always be retrievable.
<br/>
<br/>
Even my very first assembler program I wrote on the 8-Bit Atari
<br/>
in 6502-Assembler 1987 is still available in the <a class="postlink" href="http://gury.atari8.info/details_games/1137.htm" target="_blank">internet</a>. 
<br/>
Coincidentally, it was ... a two player version of the Game of Life
<br/>
(including a typo, I was young, and online dictionaries not yet
<br/>
invented).
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest you try again to search, perhaps variing the name (or use
<br/>
the very exact name, whatever).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are plenty of "Game of Life" programs based on <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's model</a>.
