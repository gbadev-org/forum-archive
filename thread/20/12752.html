    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Noticed this in the <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbanew.htm" target="_blank">No$GBA changelog</a>:
<br/>
- nds/video/help: added note on unknown tvoutcnt register (nds9 port 4000070h)
<br/>
- nds/sio/help: added chapter on (absent) link port (with new bits like ckup)
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea what this is supposed to mean? The free version has no help file, and the full version's (available on the site) and GBATek don't mention any TV Out Control. Also, link port?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you guys all seen the stuff about how the DS supposedly outputs a signal that RF antennas on TVs can pick up and display as video.  I've seen a number of pictures from different people who've tried it and gotten actual recognizable images from the DS screens.  This was all quite a long time ago, like around when the DS came out and there doesn't seem to be anything new about it.  Maybe it was all a hoax, but that was never proven from anything I've seen.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Picking up DS video signals on a TV is real, I did it myself. It helps to use a GBA game, since when both screens are on you get a jumbled mix of them. I didn't manage to get a decent picture (unstable, fuzzy, no colour) but it worked. You just put it near the antenna and tune around.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
