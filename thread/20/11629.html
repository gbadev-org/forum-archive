I have wondered why nobody made a serious, standalone, WiFi configuration app (especially since all homebrew WiFi programs use the WFC data now). But I guess nobody wants to be the one that puts out the software that writes a large amount of information to the firmware, for obvious reasons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cause we at DS-Scene want to make a preview of your app

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Question.
<br/>
<br/>
My wireless internet connection has a different MAC address then my Nintendo DS Lite's. I've checked the Lite's MAC address at the wifi options when I put Lost Magic in it.
<br/>
<br/>
Does these MAC addresses need to be the same, in order to make Beup work? (0.3Final)
<br/>
Thanx in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MAC addresses are (or should be) unique for each device. You can't change the DS' MAC address anyway (not that I know of).

You should only worry about it if you're setting up a MAC whitelist in your wireless settings.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This little pa lib program that everyone keeps mentioning is El Hobito's "Wifi Setup Test".
<br/>
<a href="http://elhobito.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://elhobito.blogspot.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It does try to imitate Nintendo's Wifi Connection Setup look.
<br/>
<br/>
However, this program (last time I checked) can't edit settings, it can view them though... It was also made in the time the Wifi Lib didn't have tcp.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#125050 - HyperHacker - Wed Apr 11, 2007 12:45 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Something I've been pondering is a Wifi Connection Test program, similar to Xbox 360's. It would connect and download the test file from Nintendo's servers just as official games do, but give detailed information every step of the way, telling you what it's doing and how it's going. This would be useful to figure out why the heck you can't get a connection to the server when Nintendo's error codes only tell you things like "try manual IPs" or (my personal favourite) "incorrect WEP key" even though you are connected to the hotspot and it's listed as unencrypted.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course if you do that you may as well toss in a simple wifi setup app. No need to clone Nintendo's graphics (may not even be legal), as long as it can do all the same things (and maybe more, like copying between slots/files).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
