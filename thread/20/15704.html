    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, like It says, is that possible? I used to use rudolphs GBA save Backup tool to get the save off of it and hack it through that, but it seems like rudolphs seems to now be corrupting the save files I extract instead (although, this might  just be DSO 3.1's handy work as the past.. eh.. 5 programs I've put on my SD card have become corrupt by it, so I've started using DS Dos to auto patch). So what I was wondering if it was possible to make the slot 1 device put codes into the slot 2 processor/into the ram (which ever one gets the codes), and then boots the slot 2 device (as I know there are many programs that actually launch the slot 2 games from it) is that actually possible to do? and if it is, how long would it take for me to learn how to code (if its not already out there)?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

That's the same register used for sleeping, so it triggers lots of hardware magic.
<br/>
<br/>
The main trouble though, is that this boots into the GBA BIOS, complete with logo. And, like any ordinary GBA, it boots out of slot-2, not RAM--nevermind if it was cleared or not. (Though it will attempt/fail to multiboot, try it!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But wouldn't there be a way to boot a game like you boot slot 2 devices, by using a passme like thing that would convince the DS that its still/was always in slot 1 function, thus leaving everything that was in there, in there?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

Well, you could stay in DS mode, but GBA games aren't going to work then. Otherwise, you're stuck rebooting into GBA mode where you have a clean slate, and the game runs as normal. The switch is completely automatic, so there's not really an "in between"--at least none I've ever heard of.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would that be possible? lol (i'm guessing so, because isn't that kinda what the GBA backup tool does?)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

Yes, you can rewrite the flash from homebrew code. But that doesn't work on games without save, nor does it let you cheat at aspects of the game that the save doesn't cover. Even on games with save, good luck figuring out how to change parts of the save without triggering the code that erases damaged saves.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You would be better off writing analysis software that runs on the PC.

Most people are quite afraid of encryption/checksums.  I suspect it is either a textbook solution with default values (like the ADOM save files) or a custom checksum that is ultimately weak cryptographically speaking.  The goal is to prevent corruption, so I doubt the code does anything wildly tricky.  Furthermore, the code that checks for corruption and the code that writes a valid checksum are undoubtedly different, so all you need is some sort of code that forces the corruption check to pass.  At that point you should be able to resave and have a valid checksum (no guarantees; you might need to change something to force recalculation of the checksums).  I do not think this would be a hard problem to solve given a large enough pool of valid checksums, and a lot of time.

If you know how they are computed, then yes. But it can prove difficult to discern how they are computed without dumping and disassembling the game, the discussion of which is discouraged on the domain gbadev.org.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

With enough valid data, checksum pairs you should be able to derive the formula used.  You end up with a different formula that give the same results.  The trick is that you need data points that vary only slightly so that you can see how the checksum changes.  If you have a crypto background (industry pro, studied it, hobby) then the task should be relatively trivial, although it will be time consuming if you are collecting your own data points.  If you have a CS background, you can refer to documentation and the project will be even more time consuming.  If you have neither, you still might be able to pull it off, but it will require even more time.  You'll probably need some technical data about the game, like the hex codes for items, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
My advice, go find some gameshark codes and/or technical information on the game.  Someone must have performed a technical analysis of this game by now.  This will be a lot easier and a lot less time consuming.  Unless, of course, you find the notion of doing things all on your own intriguing.  For what it's worth, there is good chance tepples is right and they are using basic CRC or something of that nature.

<br/>
Yes, but if you are looking casually edit characters / game data, that is not going to happen with a hex editor.  You are basically looking at creating an application that loads the save game data, allows you to modify the data, and then corrects the checksum.  (I've seen some of these for various games.)
<br/>
<br/>
The alternative is, you make a calculator program (or maybe setup a spreadsheet) and manually enter data, get the checksum and then update it.  When games protect save game data, it prevents casually changing things.  Somebody needs to put a lot of work in to make it easy for everyone, and often that does not happen.  Even if it does, it usually does not not happen right away.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the save game data may be shadowed.  Ie, there are two copies of save file on the cart.  This way, if one fails the game can load the other.  If save game shadowing is going on I suspect you need to update both copies of the data, but that would depend on the game.  There may be other special data protection features.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know the EXACT location of items in the .sav file as they are set up exactly the same as OB64 (which as I stated earlier, I made hacks for with GS). The item values are set up as following: xxxx zzzz xxxx zzzz (or roughly as such. xxxx being the item number, zzzz being the current number of the items, or in reverse, I'm not good at memory of set up because I don't have the data hanging in front of me). So in order to find the checksum, I would first dump the data (not even gonna ask how :p I know what happens to people that ask questions...), then could I just look at the hex and find it? And, wouldn't it be somewhere near either the section of hex that writes the save, or would it be with the reading of the save file? (I just have to say, normally I would dump the save and the rom and use visual boy advance to use the gameshark feature, and delete the rom after I have completed, but first off, I wantto stop doing the illegal process of running the rom, and I want to be able to modify the saves anywhere at any time)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Basically it is a dull process of changing values one by one (by increments of one) and looking at checksums until you can figure out the pattern.  I'd use google and gamefaqs to find as much info as you can before you start down this long and dreary road.  I'd also read the articles present and possibly look for your own.
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind once you can edit items and correct the checksum, you may not be able to edit stats, etc.  It all depends on how they combine the data.  Some area may not be included in the checksum.
<br/>
<br/>
My real personal opinion... FFTA is not very hard.  Just make some assassins, maybe put white magic on them and win, but it's your time, not mine.  (Ninjas with double attack can also clean up the field fast.)
