<br/>
<br/>
It's a new program, there's bound to be problems with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are things to make sure of:
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure server.exe is running
<br/>
Make sure you are not using WEP on your wifi network
<br/>
Make sure you are directing the destination IP to the right computer, your computer with the server running
<br/>
<br/>
There are many factors to consider..If you got the past Wifi programs working, setting this up is a breeze.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

My problem was the FIRST IP address you enter when you are setting up is suppose to be your DSs IP.  After you connect it asks for a destination IP that's your computer's IP.

And to those with garbled screens, you need to press A or B to update it. As for M3, I haven't known of anyone trying it on that, so it may be an issue with M3. Can anyone say they have 100% working on M3?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The reason behind this is probably because your wireless router itself is probably set to a limit of say, 150 DHCP clients..or something of the sort.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll usually give my DS an IP address of 192.168.1.105 whereas my computer is 192.168.1.101

Button config?s sent from PC to DS:

The PC app config having a list of exe?s &amp; Button config?s for each. When it detects you are focused on any app in the list, then it passes the corresponding button configuration set to the DS (weather automatically or by asking for your permission - with say hold Left Trigger to bypass this). For example if a media player is focused on and is in the list the DS remaps L &amp; R become FF &amp; Rewind, A becomes Play/Pause, B Stop, Left &amp; Right D-Pad skip tracks, etc

Microphone connection to PC, for dictation &amp; voice control (all done via external PC programs probably)

w00t that was my prob  i feel so stupid  just to be fancy im nowhere near my laptop now   huh this thing isnt showing my periods punctuation and all that
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Back to the laptop, PointyRemote wasn't sending outputting any of the punctionation I entered in that sentence...is anyone else having this problem or is it just me?  Anyway, now that I've got it working, this is pretty neat.  I see a lot of potential in something like this.  Even at this early stage it'd be good for keeping tabs on a download or a video that you are reencoding (MoonShell perhaps?).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is odd. The new version at least works as a .ds.gba (previously stopped at waiting for Arm7 init). The screen however still gives just the green garbage at the top of the screen, but the "text to send" function works. I keep wondering if this is related to the screen resolution or refresh rate in some way. Anyone got any advice..?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The update speed is very fast (almost 4 fps) and I can almost stream my videos to the ds! There are no color bugs and I can do almost anything with this! The fact that I can rapidly switch between the two screen makes it very faster to navigate!

thank you Pointless!!!!!!!!!!

Are you talking about 0.000011a? In terms of speed, it's scarcely better than the first version for me. 2fps, max, and only at low screen resolutions (&lt; 640x480). I suppose it's just my crappy computer...
<br/>
<br/>
While on the subject, I wonder how long it'll be before someone makes an actual video streaming app? Using MoonLight's DPGenc server-side and DPGdec client-side might work well for video streaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
also, i've added zoom control
<br/>
with x and y you'll change the magnitude (in your ds)
<br/>
to update it on the server, so it can be used, tap the touch screen in GRAL mode
<br/>
just try it
<br/>
i think that now it's a usable program
<br/>
if you are having problems or smthing, join me at irc, i'll be in here for the night:
