    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I'm looking for a programmer that experienced in making Nintendo DS homebrew, to code an Alarm Clock Application/Puzzle game. It is a freeware project so, I can't promise money, maybe not even glory.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea of the game builds on the concept of Puzzle Clock. It is supposed to function as an alarm clock application. In order to turn off the ringing you must solve a series of random puzzles. Once your brain gets engaged in some such mental activity it is much harder to go back to sleep. You get waken up much more efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
For now, since I just want to make a proof of concept, only one sort of puzzles will be coded, just simple arithmetic BrainAge kind of puzzles. If we get the project off the ground we will add other puzzles.
<br/>
<br/>
It should be relatively easy to code. I am a programmer myself, just not experienced with Nintendo DS homebrew. I have the skeleton of the code written in pseudo code. You can find the pseudo code, state diagram of the game and most of the graphics over here.

I am making the graphics, 80% of it is already done.

Your design document looks interesting. But in my estimation, that might get annoying, especially if someone else has to turn off your alarm clock after you have awoken naturally and left the floor. What I did in my third and fourth years of university was put the alarm on the other side of the room, so that the cognition involved in leaving bed made the rest of my brain wake up.

Do you know the Allegro library or any other graphics API on PCs?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Waking up early is annoying. :-) The idea is to make this silly little thing that might be interested for some time. When it gets boring you could always switch back to old methods of waking up.

I had some experience with SDL but not much. I don't know what would be a good way of proceeding in developing this. That's why I'm looking for help.
<br/>
<br/>
Would you care to help?
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, thanks for interest and comment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS has a volume slider and power button/slider.

I don't think it will work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
