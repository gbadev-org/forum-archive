Hexen DS

Heretic DS

WiFi Chat

DS2Win

I can't imagine that these don't work, and I know I'm doing everything right, so what's the deal?  I've just been copying them to the flash card instead of using the M3 program to flash them to the card.  Would that be the problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

IIRC, Hexen and Heretic are just weird because of how the M3 sets up stuff like the power...PepsiMan's M3 Loader helped fix at least one of those up a bit, can't remember which one ^_^;;.  WiFi Chat I haven't tried (yet) but DS2Win should work...I was just using it the other day.  Did you try the ds.gba version?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is there any way to bring my firmware back to whatever version it shipped with?  I noticed stuff didn't start hanging until I updated it.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the ds.gba file, I haven't tried that with DS2Win yet, but I'll try that in a sec, I'm attempting to get SCUMMVM to work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe you did a mistake or something when copyng the files to your M3 o maybe you use a SD version that its not fully compatable</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope, I've got CF.  Compiling Hexen isn't working anyway, so that's the main problem with that game, but the rest I'm really just not sure of.  Am I supposed to run the stuff through NDS mode or GBA mode?
<br/>
<br/>
Raziel, can you do me a quick favor and write a quick step by step for one of those applications just so that I can figure out how to do it right, or at least know that something is broken?  It would be of great help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Remember that M3 has a 'feature' that allows you to load the files in 2 different ways: Pressing START and pressing A
<br/>
<br/>
Some nds files only work when you press START rather than A, so try that as well :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Interesting...
<br/>
<br/>
Wifi chat works now, although I can't connect to the server, it still starts up.  Heretic and Hexen are a no go though.  Could someone get on aim and send me their .gba or .nds file (that works) so I can try it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heh, good stuff, thank for the link waru.  That definitely got Heretic to work for sure, but the actual game is bugged to hell and back.  The looking just doesn't work (up,down,up,down repeatedly).  Anyone have this problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
