    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, Im very new to the DS and know very little about programming. So please assume I know absolutly nothing when making your responses..
<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to know is;
<br/>
<br/>
Is it already, or could it be possible, to integrate my DS stylus input with my PC so that I can use it as a very cheap alternative to a proper graphics pad?
<br/>
<br/>
Im sure ill have some more questions to follow on, but ill just keep it to that one for now.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers in advance guys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It supports converting your DS to a Gamepad, but im not sure about the fact if you can customise DS buttons for the PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you have to hack your DS to do the above? 
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking, If your PC could intercept the signal coming from a Pictochat conversation... then normal user could just download software to make their PC's communicate with the existing pictochat software.. ?? Would this be possible?
<br/>
<br/>
Ideally I am looking for a solution wherby ppl dont have to pull apart their DS's..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The only time you need to "pull apart" your ds if you wish to use home brew *without* a launcher device. 
<br/>
And even then you only have to do it once.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Relating to my original querey, Does anyone know if the upcoming Opera browser will enable users to input data via their stylus.. Ultimatly I want to create a web site that can be interacted with via ppls DS's without them having to get too funky with flashing or anything... 
<br/>
<br/>
Surely there plenty of people who are considering the possibilities of using DS's with websites.. anyone know of any projects regarding this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You also need a GBA card. Currently we recommend a CF adapter (GBAMP, SuperCard, or M3) unless you own a lot of SD cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's hardly even "pulling it apart"... you just remove the battery cover and a sticker and jam something in a hole.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

if you have a ds lite,
<br/>
you don't even have to remove a sticker lol...
<br/>
just unscrew 1 screw then put a metal point in :)
<br/>
<br/>
(p.s. i thought it strange when i flashed my ds because i used a paper clip and it NEVER turned off throughout the hole contact process and from the looks of it the hole seems to be sided with plastic protecting it from going anywhere else inside the hole :|... maybe nintendo realized people were having problems installing flashme, and they wanted to fix that... maybe nintendo does support homebrew community more then we think :)... maybe they get game developers from communities caused by things that bring nintendo programming to all :D... or maybe im just losing it...

However, it would supprise me at all if some of the designers of the hardware supported it, and thus made slight changes ;)

Javascript is very certainly supported....the web is a bit too heavily reliant on it for it not to be ;)
<br/>
And you can also expect basic forms to work.
<br/>
Beyond that, probably nothing...but if your good at makeing sites, thats enough for interactivity.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
