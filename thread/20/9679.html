<br/>
2. Is it hard to write such thing (comparing with snes emulator)?

<br/>
Anything is possible, look at Mac Classic on the PSP.
<br/>
It's just a question of speed (it takes 2 hours to boot IIRC).
<br/>
As for Starcraft2 and the other games you listed they would porbably never run at an acceptable speed.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A PC emulator is very possible, we just need to find someone who is willing to write one from scratch.
<br/>
An 8088 cpu core written in C could probably emulate 4.77mhz giving you an XT, further optimizations could get you a 6mhz 286 but probably not higher.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if you need to be an x86 expert to write one or not, maybe just a datasheet and lots of coffee will do.

As for macintosh, I did manage to compile minivmac but stopped working on it for some reason.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So games like heretic and hexen does run on a 286?

<br/>
Allthough, even that might not work.
<br/>
<br/>
But still...a generic dos/pc emulation even at a very low speed opens up an insane amount of old games.
<br/>
<br/>
Its just a mater of someone skilled with the time and willpower to do it. And those are in short supply.
<br/>
Heck, even easier things like Nes,Snes,Commadore emulation seem to be on perminate hold at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although, I can see some of them making good ports. Especially Alone in the Dark.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, so you port DOS. That's not too exciting...all you can really do is "DIR" "MKDIR" etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh...you want to run DOS programs also? Well, turns out they each would need to be ported as well, since the DS cannot run x86 compiled code natively.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want to port the apps, basically your only choice is to emulate everything, or almost everything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
SNESEmul is a Super-NES emulator. Maybe the original version was coded on the MS-DOS platform, but it's not an MS-DOS emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
DosBox is an MS-DOS emulator, on the other hand.
<br/>
<br/>
To put it simply. The old version of SNESEmul (Which you say was a MS-DOS program) could be, theoretically, run under DosBox.
<br/>
<br/>
SNESEmul is a SNES emulator. Which means it can ONLY run SNES roms.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone's still mad about getting MS-DOS to run on the DS, then they can try porting DosBox, although that's never worked before.
<br/>
<br/>
You could also try porting Bochs and running DOS on that. Which might work better, or might not. It would probably be hell-of-a slow though...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
