Thank you for making such a good program. I use moonshell to play lots of music and movies now. The DS has become a very powerfull device with moonshell. I was asking about using VBR in the DPG program to make smaller files. Is this possible? Also, maybe an option for widescreen (16:9) video so the output is 256*144.

You have to fiddle with the command line but it works.

Anyone notice in coloured blocks in video?

I mainly get red blocks on bright yellow areas in my videos.

Like the fire at the beginning of the intro to Full Metal Alchemist.
<br/>
This wasn't present in 06p3.

<br/>
<br/>
As for red blocks, I got them too in the intro to Bleach (with fire and such). However, I got them when using TMPGEnc and the Moonshell Encoder (MPlayer). I suspect then its the decoder and not the encoding causing it.
<br/>

<br/>
To Moonlight?:
<br/>
<br/>
When decoding video with bright yellow colour, sometimes red squares appear. Maybe an error with the YUV decoding?

Small note to everyone... as tranlators are a bit crap, when I'm writing something for Moonlight to read I am using very basic and oversimplified language, as for example using 'it' to refer to a previously declared subject will just confuse a Japanese translation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This shows it's not the encodes, but the decoding.

So something has changed between the versions to make this occur.

I have an idea:

Dpgenc.exe has Japanese (and English) texts.
<br/>
Can you make dpgenc.exe more international by adding the ability to translate the texts by adding:

<br/>
dpgenc.lang (simple txt file)
<br/>
<br/>
Source MediaFile=Source MediaFile
<br/>
more settings=more settings
<br/>
Sound options=Sound options

etc.

Can you also rename the Readme files:

Readme_jap.txt

Readme_rus.txt

so... dont hit me for asking this... this is a Compact Flash version not the SD version of the M3?

You could try checking the CF card format... FAT16 (FAT) is a safe bet. Supposed to be fine with FAT32 but who knows  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But it's not like it wont load at all, it gets to that screen and hangs there. It's a 256 lexar card it runs 4x DMA and everything why wouldn't it be FAT16? That dosn't make much sense. I guess I'll have to wait till I get a new CF card, darn.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Oh just reread the post FAT16 is FAT? Alright I'll formate it again and try on FAT again.

<br/>
Alright I put it on FAT and it still dosn't work. This is the screen I get:

It just hangs on that screen forever, do you guys get that screen(the bottom one is just white? I just copy the BOOT file right into the card should I use the GAME manager or anything? Also the BOOT file is 918KBs is that the size it should be because I think there must be something missing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wonder if it's possible (or too hard to develop) to use compression method, but I don't mean using any available codecs, but creating a new one with low memory usage and CPU power. 
<br/>
<br/>
XviD / DivX uses smart way to "compress" video (it's not actually compressing, but loosing data that you can not see).

Video files gets so huge you know. I'm not the one to say if it's worth it.

I'm not sure how you can compare the M3 decoder and the Moonshell player... M3 is (even for animation) one of the worst things I've ever used for video... the MPG output I've had with Moonshell looks pretty damn nice to me... I'll upload two nice examples...
<br/>

Animation :

<br/>
<br/>
note that the latter has audio sync problems, but this is not moonshell... the original file got broke when I used VirtualDub to cut the start off to encode (didn't like the VBR MP3 track).
<br/>
<br/>
I've made even better examples using TMPGEnc but the point is to show the Moonshell stuff working here  :)

Dead Like Me: Great quality in the begining but right before the "black and white" it gets worse and sound issue starts like you said.

It works a little now. On the bottomscreen the menu is very slowly drawn (20 seconds or so), and on the upperscreen text is flashing by until the menu is fully drawn.
<br/>
After that everything freezes. So I can see the menu but I can't use the program.
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest checking the differences between a flashme'd DS and a ds that uses passkey/passme. But I'm sure you'll know better.

Thanks for everything up till now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah the Dead Like Me episode you made is the best I've seen so far since the Lost episode, even though Lost had some wierd stuff going on in the picture you could clearly see it was great quality..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having huge issues even getting something look that good myself...
<br/>
<br/>
Using TMPGEnc 3.0 but cant seem to find any good settings.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit</span>
<br/>
Video: XVID 624x352 23.98fps [Stream 00]
<br/>
Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 129Kbps [Stream 01]
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thats what I'm starting from mostly..
<br/>
<br/>
So its 256x144 I'm shooting for...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">bit rate of 150 to 185. never encode at 256*192 or your get massive lag, one setting lower works well - if the ratio is set to 1*1 it'll zoom to fit the screen on the DS. If its widescreen you want 256*144. When you drop it into the Moonshell encoder, make sure you uncheck the encode option (so it uses the video you made).
<br/>
<br/>
I just encoded that OP video in M3 to test...  52mb for 5min video! And the audio made my ears bleed (well not really bleed). However, I agree the image looks nicer - but much more jumpy.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
if its widescreen, you can push the bitrate up a bit. Makes it real nice  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

&gt;Moonshell, it has something to do with the passkey. As I posted before I was haveing problems running this(hangs at "loaded") but now that I flashed my DS it works perfectly. Hope that helps some.
<br/>
<br/>
It is very good advice.
<br/>
However, I have only DS that is FlashMe.
<br/>
It is considerably very good information. Thank you.

Thanks by your test result. I concentrates on the problem of the interrupt processing.
<br/>
There are some methods of evading the problem.
<br/>
I try those combinations.

<br/>
<br/>
The DPG player thins out processing if synchronization is not in time.
<br/>
<br/>
If the delay is 100ms or less. Full pixel is converted in YUV-&gt;RGB.
<br/>
If the delay is 200ms or less, the 1/2 pixel is converted in YUV-&gt;RGB.
<br/>
If the delay is 300ms or less, the 1/4 pixel is converted in YUV-&gt;RGB.
<br/>
If the delay is 300ms or more, the transform is skipped.
<br/>
When the GOP signal is found, all units of GOP (12 frames) are thrown away if the delay is 300ms or more.
<br/>
<br/>
It is normal operation that maintains the frame rate.
<br/>
<br/>
Another. There is an audio video synchronous problem.
<br/>
It is felt that the video is delayed about one second every ten minutes regardless of the bit rate.
<br/>
<br/>
It investigates continuously.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Finally, please let me confirm it.

The DPG player uses DTCM of the mechanism like to ITCM.

Can DPG be reproduced by this?

I'm sorry when misunderstanding it.
<br/>
<br/>
This update doesn't have the change in dpgenc. (Only DPGPlugin changed. )
<br/>
<br/>
Dpgenc is encoded by the automatic operation. A detailed setting for the image quality improvement cannot be done.
<br/>
An external encoder such as TMPGEnc can be used to set it more in detail.
<br/>
However, the knowledge of mpeg is necessary for manual setting.
<br/>
<br/>
Please point it out when my interpretation is wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#65911 - tssf - Fri Jan 06, 2006 7:53 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I can tell, DPG is a sort of proprietary format. In that it will take a M1V movie stream, convert the audio to GSM, then multiplex them together. If that's the case, dpgenc.exe will be the only "encoder" for the "DPG" format. However, any MPEG encoder should be able to handle M1V. It also has the option to re-encode to work with DPG specific modes.
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, A movie I want to convert is only 15fps, yet since MPG requires me to use 30, the DPG player has to play it back at 30fps, which of course causes slow down.
<br/>
<br/>
It's too bad there isn't an option to "skip" every other frame (unless there is one, and I'm just missing it)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
