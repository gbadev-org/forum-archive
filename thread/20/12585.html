I have a few ideas but I REALLY do not want to eff up the main board or the bottom screen.

What do you think? Got any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is what I said.
<br/>
<br/>
What I am wanting to know is  how to "fix" that. The way I see it there are three(3) ways the main board can see the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
1. The Ribbon contains a closed circuit. (This would be the easiest and least expensive.)
<br/>
<br/>
2. The main board can detect the power draw. (LCD, LEDs Etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
3. There is a micro controller in the top assembly that tells the main board "I am here". (Most expensive, most complicated, least likely.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except for DS homebrew that doesn't make much use of the other screen (which might be because it was ported from the GBA for the benefit of SLOT-1 card owners). Meteos and Tetris DS are the same way; in several of their modes, hiding the top screen does not hurt the player.
<br/>
<br/>
It might be possible to fool the power chip with a resistor or two across the right pins of the video cable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well said. I was indeed planing on using it for GBA and some DS Games (Club House Games, Tetris, Etc). I Imagen when we have some kind of connectivity with the Wii it will come in handy then as well. I have a SP without a screen and have used it quiet often (GBAPlayer controller, P2 on Dr Mario w/wireless links, eReader, etc)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Replacement is not an option. The unit is from launch (as in MP:H Demo). And the top screen is completely effed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is a sound idea. However, I WANT to make this work. If for no other reason than I can.
<br/>
<br/>
Working on a few ideas at the moment. Will post my findings when finished.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
