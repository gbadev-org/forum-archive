Supposively Nintendo started sending a gift letter to everyone who signed in on WIFI one day this week, and the letter somehow got screwed up and it's a glitch item.  I didn't get it and am curious.  Yeah, I guess I'm the only person who didn't get his game ruined by nintendo and really wants to...

Some people have been saying that it makes invisible walls, and I'm curious about makeing invisible walls to make an invisible maze in my town if possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds interesting. Maybe a design bug in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any idea why my AC:WW freezes when I got thu the yellow gate? *ohh, I hate the mole after this happens*

Interesting, perhaps this glitch can be harnessed for the good of Animal Crossing players everywhere.  :P<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
From a general user perspective.
<br/>
Check other Animal Crossing user websites - it is covered extensively there.
<br/>
----
<br/>
&gt; Some people have been saying that it makes invisible walls, and I'm curious about makeing invisible walls to make an invisible maze in my town if possible.
<br/>
That is incorrect.
<br/>
<br/>
If dropped in the outside world map, it creates a standard "red tulip" plant.
<br/>
Regular users are impressed because they can drop it almost anywhere (on concrete). Map Editor users could already do that.
<br/>
<br/>
If dropped inside a house, it leaves an invisible item - which prevents you from placing or moving furnature there. You can walk right throught it - it is not a wall. Try the "invisible chair" item in the map editor instead.
<br/>
----
<br/>
If you have homebrew or Action Replay hardware, use the AnimalMap map editor.
<br/>
If you place a "Terrain" / "Flowers (planted)" / "red tulips" item on your World Map - it is exactly the same.
<br/>
The map editor doesn't support placing those items inside a house or inside your inventory - because it doesn't make sense (other than to hilight the bug)

<br/>
BTW: the 16-bit item code for the terrain red tulip is $0000.
<br/>
For programmers out there - that's good advice to never have 0000 or FFFF interpreted as a valid code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bet that's the problem. The programmers forgot that item 0 was valid, and simply did an if-not-zero check to see if anything was there or not (if(!Map[...])). Hence the game thinks there's nothing there.
<br/>
<br/>
Be interesting to see how Nintendo fixes this, though. The only way I can think of would be to run code on your DS which edits the save file. After the PSO incident, they're not likely to have left a backdoor which can download and run code from WFC (unless it's signed code, perhaps). Only other method I can imagine, if it's even possible, is a WMB app which does the same (can WMB apps access the DS card?) - if so, users will be required to have a compatible card. (The Nintendo USB adapter is probably compatible, but if they release an app which can do WMB through it, people are likely to be able to hack/reverse engineer it to boot their own demos, which they generally don't want.)
<br/>
<br/>
Or of course they could release a fix in the form of a DS card (if card swapping is possible), or have people send in their game, but that'd cost money.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&gt; are red tulips already implemented in the original game
<br/>
Yes
<br/>
&gt; and only obtainable by WFC (or trainers)
<br/>
Yes, for the *magic* version of the red tulip that you can keep in your inventory.
<br/>
There are many other 'red tulips' that are accessed in the regular game (plant some seeds, pick a tulip plant, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  or are they added with the WFC download?
<br/>
The WFC download is passing a 16-bit value for the item (along with a letter that can contain text). It is interpreted by the game.
<br/>
Some people call it a 'hacked' item, but that's misleading since there is no code to hack (you can't fit much into 16-bits these days ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe a bug:
<br/>
<br/>
Once there was something going on with touch screen. 
<br/>
When I came out from friends house it moved with stylus but then stopped. Touch screen was no more workng... not any area of it. 
<br/>
The cross pad was working, so I directed my character in the house. 
<br/>
When I was in and tried to move my character with stylus, the same happened. So I did go out and test again. 
<br/>
Eventually there was only one thing in my mind.. to save and quit. That helped. 
<br/>
No more animal crossing in my ds screens and no more power in my ds. No need to touch the screen anymore.
