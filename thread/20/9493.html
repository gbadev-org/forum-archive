    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's great, are you planning on adding a crouching action?  When one of those bees goes buzzing by the character's head, my reflex was to push the down button to attempt to crouch, but I got stung because you haven't implemented it yet :(  Also, there is a part where you have to slide under a vertical line of blocks while you're standing on a short platform.  In my opinion, it's too easy to fall off the platform when you're sliding.  I'm guessing that you did that on purpose to put the difficulty up, but could you make the platform just a little longer or something?  :p

Overall, it's a great game so far.  Have you considered licensing the engine to a commercial developer?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Played it for a while, and it's sweet. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to find you could change direction of your slide move (while performing one).
<br/>
When I tried it out some more, I noticed that changing the direction of your slide move usually does not really change the direction, but only which way the hero faces.... thus being able to slide away from enemies and shoot at them at the same time. Nice.
<br/>
When the hero is sliding beneath the wall, changing the direction of the slide move does change the direction of the movement as well. I guess that it's more convenient that way (platform wise), but did you mean it to happen like that?
<br/>
I thought it was funny that when performing a slide, and shooting the regular shots, you're actually moving at the same speed as the shot... as if you push it forward. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a little confused why you can choose "no weapon" as a weapon though.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and sometimes (when the hero is not well enough positioned I guess), the slide move doesn't let the hero cross holes, but he falls in them. Not too annoying, but I guess when the levels are longer, this could get irritating.
<br/>
<br/>
Cool that you've got two backgrounds, by the way. It's nice to see someone taking effort to let the mountains move a bit faster than the sky.
<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it looks pretty sleak, and I'm totally digging it. Thus the long reply. ;) Great job. The debugging screen was fun to watch, by the way. I can tell by that how you've implemented most things, which was nice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wanted to change hero direction when you are sliding in the "tunnels", havn't thought anything about changing direction when you are not on it

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While playing the game, I realized that if someone wanted to hold run and jump (like mario type running jumping...etc) that its hard with your control setup...
<br/>
<br/>
You should make B:run, A:jump, and X:fire...
<br/>
<br/>
That way, its easier to hold down run and jump whenever you want and even if you want fire at the same time..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can see where the insperation came from - Megaman was one of my favourite games as a kid.

One tiny little thing - the jump animation frames could do with being a little bit more exaggerated - a bit like Megaman looked like he'd been kicked up the arse each time he jumped.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This game really feels nice. I instantly felt like I was playing a Mega Man title.  Great job on both programming and artwork! These little animations like the dustclouds when you land after jumping from a high platform show that a lot of attention was paid to details and this really paid off.
<br/>
<br/>
I would prefer B as the jump button and A as the fire button though, so it's easier to jump while running. No other criticism so far :-)

In the past it was like you say, but when i tried it on hardware it wasn't really good to shoot with A button.
