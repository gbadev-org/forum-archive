Whats Ventrilo.
<br/>
i use dsaim or use my ds as a phone if i need to talk to somone.
<br/>
or i just use my cell phone since i have to be near a wifi area in order to use thouse.<br/>_________________<br/>The wind blows, The moon howels, But atlas we must turn to the GOD BOX!

From the looks of this, it is also an encrypted stream. Having to do real time decryption on the DS is probably not going to go too well with a high-speed application like VoIP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I see no reason why not. You could try running the Apple II version of VisiCalc in PomDS, if nothing else.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

2Mbps best-case? Really?
<br/>
I could be misunderstanding exactly what you mean here, but, well this just doesn't seem right.
<br/>
<br/>
Lets say my internet service is a guaranteed 2Mbps, if I have a wireless router running at 2Mbps, doesn't mean I will actually get 2Mbps on my computer.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, why do transfer speeds from DSFTP to a local computer cap out at around ~100KB/s? (which is less than 1Mbps)

<br/>
Eh, fair enough.
<br/>
<br/>
You know, maybe if someone made a "mic over wifi" application that allowed the use of the DS mic as a PC mic, (and added some DS2Key like implementation) you could run Ventrillo in the background on your PC, but still talk through your DS. (Only on your own network of course.)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

<br/>
That is a limitation of dswifi and/or the DS's radio. With proper hardware, you should be getting very close to whatever your ISP's speed is when using WiFi. There is some overhead involved, but not that much. If you are getting substantially lower speeds than you should on your wireless clients, then something is setup wrong or you have poor hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at Ventrilo's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ventrilo.com/setup.php#Client_Network_Requirements" target="_blank">Client Requirements</a> we can see that each voice stream consumes 3 KBps of data (including your outbound stream) with the default GSM codec (which can be dropped to decrease bandwidth use at the loss of clarity).
<br/>
<br/>
So assuming we can get a sustained 100 KBps from the DS as you demonstrated (though I have personally never gotten over 80 KBps), you could easily pull enough data to handle ~30 people in the channel. You would likely run out of RAM and CPU cycles before you ever got that far, so again, bandwidth is certainly not a limiting issue here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
