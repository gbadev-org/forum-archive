This will definitely allow non-flashers to test our games, which means more publicity of the DS scene!

Non-Flashed DS's check for an "RSA" signature before accepting downloadables. Homebrew does not contain that RSA signature yet. I'm not sure if it will ever be supported, but who knows? Someone might crack it.
<br/>
<br/>
But as of now, that wont work :(<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What you want cannot currently be done (sending apps) because of the RSA signature. 
<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that there could be a flaw with a second stage loader that could cause the creation of Wifime2, but noone has yet looked into this since there's no need.

<br/>
DS 2 DS transfer with homebrew isnt possible yet btw, there needs to be an access point in between.

And the official DS Demos sent from a Ralink card dont work on DSLites because of some header they check or something. So it wouldnt work as well. Not with DSLites anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you go from DS mode to GBA mode, the GBA tries to run code from the GBA cart. AFAIK, there is no way to make it start code from anywhere else.

<br/>
That's NDS mode, not GBA mode. In older firmware versions, the starting addresses of the arm7 and arm9 were contained outside of the RSA checked area, which means that they could be changed and the RSA signature would still be valid. In newer firmware, this glitch has been corrected, that's why wifime doesn't work on new DS's.
<br/>
<br/>
Now WMB on the other hand, is a completely different thing. The reason you can't download homebrew to non-flashme'd DS's, is because they check the RSA signature of the file. Nintendo's files are signed, but homebrew is not and can't be, unless;
<br/>
<br/>
1. Someone breaks into the Nintendo headquarters and steals the private RSA key.
<br/>
2. Someone has access to a supercomputer and lets it chew on the problem for a couple of weeks, or months, or years.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason no games work with the Windows WMB and the DS Lite is, as dualscreenman said, a minor timing error or protocol change.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#95281 - HyperHacker - Fri Jul 28, 2006 4:15 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FYI, an RSA signature is essentially a hash of the file, encrypted using <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsa" target="_blank">RSA</a>. The idea is that this hash will be a different number for every possible input. (Technically if you try enough different files you will get two with the same hash... but that's like quintillions of files.) This hash is sent along with the program itself. The firmware checks the program, calculates the hash itself, and only runs the program if it matches the one stored in the header.
<br/>
Now here's the kicker - the hash is essentially encrypted with backwards RSA. Anybody can take the public key and use it to decrypt the message and read the hash - the firmware itself has to do this to verify it. But to encrypt a message that can be decrypted with this key, you need to use a different key (the 'private key'). Only Nintendo has this and the chances of someone cracking it are not good. That means unless you somehow obtain the private key (don't count on it), you can't modify the stored hash, which means you can't modify the program. Similarly, you can't make a whole new program because you won't be able to encrypt its hash.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, FlashMe gets around this by just not checking the signature at all. WifiMe exploits a design flaw in that you could change parts of the header - including the start address - that aren't included in the hash, and thus the file would still be accepted; it adds some small code (there's only room for maybe 25 instructions) to put ARM9 in a loop and send ARM7 to the GBA slot. And the cards aren't signed, hence things like PassMe and NoPass.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think you realize how many different combinations are. Seriously. The millions of years might me an exageration, but I wouldn't be surprised if it took thousands of years for an average pc to crack a 1024 bits key. 
<br/>
I'm not entirely sure about this, but the way I understand it, for every extra bit, it takes twice as long to crack it. So you need 2 years to crack a 64 bit key, then you need 4 to crack a 65 bit key. And 8 for 66 bits, etc... (well, if this is rigth, then i guess the million years thing wasn't an exageration)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The start address in the header is included in the hash, which is why WifiMe doesn't work with recent firmware.

The WMB protocol sends the header twice, and the DS only performs the signature check on one copy of the header.

WifiMe modifies the header which is not signature checked.

I'm currently doing the second-stage protocol investigations on sm64ds, which indeed does the same as sonic rush. (And important, a game i own, so i can do researches)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm running 3 different ways to get to a result:
<br/>
 - checking how the arm7 handles incoming packages
<br/>
 - checking how the arm7&lt;-&gt;arm9 communication works and if there are some non-checked attributes
<br/>
 - checking the protocol captured via the ralink<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
