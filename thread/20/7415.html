    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm quite new to portable gaming. I got a DS + warioware and advance wars and I bought the metroid demo off ebay. 
<br/>
I was quite dissapointed with the demo because sometimes lines went right across the screen while jumping.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I went on a search for information on these lines. I tried google but that just came up with a lot of junk... 
<br/>
So, I searched for some DS forums. I found the information here that these lines were probably interlace lines. In my searches though I found a post by someone saying that they could be removed by adjusting some things under the battery cover. 
<br/>
I adjusted those and magically the lines dissappeared. 
<br/>
<br/>
Recently I bought kirby and castlevania. But with kirby I'm seeing some different 
<br/>
lines. They only appear across the object though, not across the whole screen.
<br/>
For example, there is an electric whip that moves in a circle. Small lines go across it as it moves. 
<br/>
The lines aren't in any videos I've seen.
<br/>
<br/>
So, are these lines interlace lines instead of the other ones? Or are they both interlace lines? 
<br/>
<br/>
I would ask this at the forum where I found that post but I don't know what forum it is... Sorry :(.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since you've already messed with the system internals, it's hard to say if those lines you're seeing in Kirby should be there or not.
<br/>
<br/>
In any Nintendo handheld, you're likely to notice a subtle interlacing effect when things blink or during vertical scrolling. That's because the LCD scanlines are actually blinking in an alternate pattern. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's a trick to reduce the ghosting effect on LCD screens, and I believe it's patented to Nintendo (the PSP, as example, has a much more noticeable ghosting).
<br/>
<br/>
Now, denepding on the contrast of your screen, the image being displayed and the movement, the interlacing effect can become noticeable or not. You noticed the lines in Metroid during vertical movement, what is normal, but I never actually noticed them until I got Castlevania and Megaman X4. those are the only two games where I can notice the lines at some moments, but it never gets offensive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Specifically, it draws odd lines slightly too dark and even lines slightly too light and then alternates per frame.

Is it really Nintendo's patent? My 1999 laptop's LCD had a similar effect, although it alternated per pixel (in a checkerboard pattern) instead of per scanline.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, I just found out that the original gba also has this control. It actually controls the flicker, not the interlace lines. 
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/095/095982p1.html" target="_blank">http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/095/095982p1.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Back in the early days of the GBA the users thought that it was a contrast adjustor. 
<br/>
IGN reported that a badly adjust one could reduce the life of the LCD:
<br/>
<br/>
"A positive and negative voltage controls Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). The "contrast control" that you are referring to is actually a flicker control. The adjustment is used to synchronize the positive and negative voltages. If these voltages are out of adjustment then the LCD will no longer respond correctly. The result will be an excess charge built up in the liquid crystal and permanently damage the LCD. The excessive charge gives the appearance of a brighter screen because the liquid crystal is not reacting properly to the voltages applied. When the adjustment of the voltages is correct the changing polarities will not allow a charge to build up, which prolongs the LCD life.
<br/>
<br/>
This adjustment is set by the manufacturer or must be performed by a qualified Nintendo Technician using proper equipment (Proper lighting, special tools, test equipment and software). Adjusting the flicker without the proper tools and lighting will put the voltages out of sync and may cause damage to the unit."
<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is, is a flicker free display a properly adjusted one?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
i think that means dont mess with it. there will always be a small amount of flicker in certain things. i notice it especially in darkain's multinds loader - the background alternates light/dark lines, which really shows off the flicker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I used those dials and managed to get rid of the annoying interference. I used Mario Kart for testing.
<br/>
<br/>
Those dials are for adjusting the flickering (stated by Nintendo). Of course they will affect your screen contrast (screen comes grey if "wrong" setting is set), but not for the LEDs brightness, bummer.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Now I can see big interlace like lines in fast moving dark objects (like in the thunderbolt (black efect) in Mario Kart when your character magically squeezes to a little mini-me). Anyone seeing any similar like this with unmodified DS/modified DS? Or is that the way N gets the ghost efect away?.. I can't remember seeing this before I did change flicker settings.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

It is very hard to show the flicker/interlacing in video. I did my best. I hope you understand what is happening there.
<br/>
<br/>
Interlacing on objects. NOT on the backround!
<br/>
There is interlacing when an object is flickering fast. Loot at closely at the video.
