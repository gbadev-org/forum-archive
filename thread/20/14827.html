    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Was there something on the website that needed to get installed, like a plug-in, and required that Firefox be closed to finished the installation? From your post, it looks like you didn't close it, only that it continually asks.
<br/>
<br/>
Either that, or you got some virus, of which you should go download a free anti-virus program to clean it up.
<br/>
<br/>
If it is an internal error with Firefox itself, would reinstalling it help?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
if you really need to read *that* tuto, maybe just printing it on paper (or temporarily using another browser) could help... 
<br/>
I'd try to disable flashplayers and javascript execution otherwise.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if your running microsoft windows, and firefox wants to restart because it's just installed a patch, try exiting all processes named "Firefox.exe" with the taskmanager (ctrl+alt+del).

I used to have that problem for some reason.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My Firefox was crashing a lot after the last couple of updates, but it seems a lot better since I cleared the data (Tools|Clear Private Data...). Maybe there was something old in there it no longer liked.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
