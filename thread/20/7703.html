<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a packet sniffer handy to investigate this so I figure i'd check if anyone here knew off hand.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyhow know what UDP/TCP port that this game *may* possibly be listening to? All i need is really to send a request and verify that the ds is trying to connect online.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

this still don't help me cuz it's by ip and the darned ds seems to always pick up a different ip each time... hostname appears to recognize as NintendoDS according to my dhcp server. but i can't seem to get to the ds by that name.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yeah but i wanted to reach the ds without having to become dependant on a specific type of configuration on the wfc settings.
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately if that's my only choice i'll probably do that. I might consider redirecting the dns in order to get this to work. but even then, there's some shortcomings.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">do you know what port mkds is listening to? I can't get it to recognize my router....so maybe if i used port forwarding or triggering i could get it to work.  I don't really know what to do though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
