    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if it was possible to get demo roms, where to find them, if it was legal (if its not, then I won't be needing the where to find them, now would I?), and if it can run on a games N' music card.
<br/>
<br/>
I loved the metroid prime hunters demo, but can't find a rom of it. like I said I was just wondering if anyone knew where to find it, if that's alright?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there a way to replace the games n' music firmware with another cards firmware, or something of that sort (such as modded firmware that allowed bigger than 4mb games to run)?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes its legal. One way you can get them is from the dsorganize homebrew database. I also remember when i was trying to setup my router to be used as a ds download station i found a website with only demo roms. Search google for a digg on making a ds download station or something like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It sounded like 11X meant illegal,(no matter if they're 'legal' backups)
<br/>
official ROMS of official games.
<br/>
<br/>
And you can't replace the GnM firmware with another card's fw.(Mainly because R4 code can't access the GnM microSD filesystem)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, the Games N' Music card can only run files that are 4 mb and below (unless using DS organize, which then its probably only 6mb or below), the card crashes if its anything larger, which is how they prevent the use of commercial roms (given the fact that most are as large in memory as a DS card)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm also interested in hacking the card's firmware, to get rid of that damn logo. But is it even rewriteable?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well it has to have a portion of some kind of rewriteable memory if they ever plan on releasing new versions so I'm guessing there would most likely be some on there.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):
