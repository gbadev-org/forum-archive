By 'best' I mean in terms of functionality, ease of use, general polish, etc?
<br/>
<br/>
I think I'd have to go for DSOrganize as it meets all of the above criteria. Moonshell is great in terms of functionality but is a pig to setup and use, so -10 points to that. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The application still looks realy bad, but all the features in it makes it an awesome package!
<br/>
<br/>
second place: Beup.. Too bad it doesn't work with t-mobile hotspots :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Moonshell, this is by far the best and most useful homebrew of them all, it plays movies, mp3s views txt, images etc. and is a useful .nds launcher. And it looks good to.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

OK. Are you insane? DSOrganize has the best sleek &amp; professional look that is tightly following the beup's new one. Whoa ... I can't understand people who want to get a epileptic seizure immediatelly upon turning on the DS. :/
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, my vote goes for DSOrganize &amp; DSLinux. They offer virtually everything one would need (except MSN, that's why we use beup ;) ) and are done really well. I also use WiFi_Lib_Test for wardriving, but that's it (I didn't count the homebrew games here).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That reminds me, I forgot about DS2Key which, I believe, uses the same Lib for its Wardriving option.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For selecting what I want to run...the M3 just has it's own menu built into it to select what to run doesn't it?  What's the differnce?  If I had an M3...i'd stil use moonshell for what I use it for now.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: You know..isn't there problems starting hombrew from moonshell on the M3...I guess I woudlen't be able to even if i wanted:-P  Oh well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
