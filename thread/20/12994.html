    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I understand that this forum had a GBA hearts competition that resulted in quite a few good Hearts implementations on GBA. The problem is that I have an M3 Simply, so I will need an NDS-native game of Hearts to be able to play it.
<br/>
<br/>
What I was wondering is if anyone was planning on making a Hearts game for the NDS, or porting one of the better GBA ones?<br/>_________________<br/>Linux Kernel Hacker since '01

You can grab a copy of The Reality Game here(<a class="postlink" href="http://www.atouchofwar.com/RealityGame.php" target="_blank">http://www.atouchofwar.com/RealityGame.php</a>), and play any card game you want.  There's no rule enforcement of any kind, just a table with cards, and you can play it online(not that anyone does :)).
<br/>
<br/>
As for Rook, I just did a search, hadn't heard of it before.  It seems simple enough, I could add a new deck to the game if you want.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh right, AI.  Didn't think of that, my game is meant mainly for multiplayer or solitaire games.
<br/>
<br/>
As for tcg's, the problem is the shear amount of graphics involved.  I was talking with a friend about it once a few months back, and we were thinking it might be possible to set up some kind of dynamic download system, where every game you download the graphics for your deck.  The other more obvious option, would be to add filesystem support and store decks locally, but that requires all players have the same files installed.  The other problem is the game is currently sprite based, so it's limited to 128 items on the table, but that's not too hard to work around.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I will certainly look into the Reality game, though Dood77 is right about the AI being required (unless three other human opponents who knew the rules were online).
<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the source for GBAHearts and it is pretty easy to understand. I would imagine it wouldn't be too difficult for someone to rewrite the platform-specific stuff and maybe add a simple current score display to the top DS screen. I unfortunately don't have too much DS experience so I don't think I'd be able to do it myself..<br/>_________________<br/>Linux Kernel Hacker since '01
