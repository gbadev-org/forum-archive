    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone think that it's possible to write a program for DS that uses the Skype protocol? This would probably be very useful, since you can now use Skype to call phones in the US and Canada for free for the rest of the year. Who knows? Maybe it could stay free forever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Skype uses a mix of SIP/P2P protocols and since there's no public dev. library for it yet, you can't do it. On the other hand, there are tons of similar VoIP providers, a lot of them offering free calls to most of the world (e.g. Gizmo Project: <a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/learnmore-allcallsfree.html" target="_blank">http://www.gizmoproject.com/learnmore-allcallsfree.html</a> - it's not fake, I can call myself, it works, despite the fact that URL looks like a spamsite).

But the problem with Gizmo is that the other people you call have to be signed up for Gizmo. Are there anymore programs like Gizmo that have free  calling without having other people register?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Voipbuster offers Free* calls to certain destinations
<br/>
<br/>
*Free, as long as you have credits in your account, oh and by the way, the credits expire every 120 days, so essentially you have to pay a fee every 4 months (I think minimum is 10EUR).

So pretty cheap, but not free -- TANSTAAFL</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think a VOIP client would be very feasable.  Even easier would be for it to send the audio to the PC for compression/decompression, but I think compression on the DS is perfectly doable too (Metroid does it, as others have mentioned).
<br/>
<br/>
But there are more cool projects out there than people with the skills to do them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
