    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While i was playing around with my ds lite after finally
<br/>
getting homebrew to work i found out that if you boot
<br/>
a ds with a gba flash cart and at the gba bios(Game Boy Advance..Nintendo
<br/>
streaming letters) pull out the flash cart and stick it back in and it will reset the ds! scratching my head i  tryed it with a regular gba game
<br/>
 and it didnt do that!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This has been brought in the past somewhat.  My Supercard resets both my DS and GBA, while my Flash2Advance Ultra only resets the GBA when it's reinserted.  Well wait, I haven't tested resinserting the F2AU into my DS when in GBA mode, only in DS mode.  Either way, it's not just you that's having this problem.

It makes it difficult to use some homebrew that requires pak-swapping, like Chishm's Sendsave program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
