<br/>
<br/>
The puppy craze that launched amid much excitement before Christmas, is back to treat owners to a special bash at GAME on Oxford Street on the 14th &amp; 15th April from 12-6pm. 
<br/>
<br/>
Touring the country from 14th April to 14th May 2006, the tour will give Nintendo fans the chance to meet up with other Nintendogs owners, swap tips, toys and share training secrets. Could these be the Crufts champions of the future? 
<br/>
<br/>
Party-goers will be able to let their puppies play with each other via the in-built wireless connection on the Nintendo DS and most importantly, meet the legendary Mr Miyamoto?s very own Dalmatian Nintendog. But rules do apply - visitors must heed that no bottom sniffing, growling or ankle biting is allowed in the presence of gaming royalty! 
<br/>
<br/>
The Dalmatian is a rare, sought after breed, which many owners find hard to unlock within the game. After playing with Mr Miyamoto?s Dalmatian, a Dalmatian puppy will be unlocked for that Nintendog owner to take home and play, adding another breed to their litter. 
<br/>
<br/>
And the fun doesn?t stop there! Owners have the exciting opportunity to be the first to test out brand new games such as Tetris DS, Super Princess Peach and Pok?mon Link. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Nintendo Bark Mode Celebration Tour kicks off at video game retail store, GAME on London?s famous Oxford Street over Easter weekend on 14th April.

Oh yes that would be great, since M?ller is where I'm standing most often indecissive which game to buy... it would help a lot.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's no "M?ller" where I live. And I've never heard about a store with a name like that before. And I do live in Germany. Why not just Wal*Mart or something?
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">(From the M?ller Website: "Im Umkreis von 100 km um den ausgew?hlten Ort 'Hamburg' konnten leider keine M?ller-Filialen gefunden werden. Wir bitten um Ihr Verst?ndnis.")</span>

That game is called "<a class="postlink" href="http://img428.imageshack.us/img428/8956/trose7ne.jpg" target="_blank">Pok?mon Tros?</a>" in Japan and "Pok?mon Trozei!" in America. And no, "Pok?mon Link!" is not the "UK name" but the European(!) name of it...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
