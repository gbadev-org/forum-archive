    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using Readmore for quite a while now, and it's pretty good, but I find it has some issues that irritate me.  (it tends to cut off the first letter of a new chapter, for whatever reason)
<br/>
development on it seems pretty stalled
<br/>
<br/>
the default text reader for the R4/M3 is pretty weaksauce
<br/>
<br/>
I've looked at a few of the other announced readers, and I'm just wondering if other folks who've tried a few of them have any opinions on which is the best?
<br/>
<br/>
All i really need is something has the text on both screens,  oriented brain-age style, wraps words intelligently, and can save 1 bookmark</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It doesn't help you if you don't have one of their cards and I doubt you'd buy one just for the text reading function, but the text reader included in the MediaPlay-Extend on G6 and M3 flash carts still seems like the best one to me.
<br/>
<br/>
It's too bad that app couldn't be hacked to work on other cards.  It's just a branch of some old Moonshell version, but it has quite a lot of changes and is quite excellent in my opinion.  It's one of the main things I keep my G6 Lite around for, in fact.

I've actually got a m3 lite perfect, but to be honest, like a tard, I've never tried it's built in ebook reader.  I actually tend to not spend as much time goofing around with it because of the extra 2 seconds it takes to load it, vs just the slot1 card
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll check out dslibris as well.  I stumbled across it last night when looking at the moon books project</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the download at sourceforge doesn't seem to work (keeps timing out for me) and the ones at moon  books aren't numbered properly, it would seem)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
