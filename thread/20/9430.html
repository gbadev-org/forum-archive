Things that work:

-Connects via DS WFC preferences (only...)
<br/>
-Connect to specified server
<br/>
-Join/part channels
<br/>
-Send messages to channels (kind of required...)

-CTCP ACTIONs (/me)

-Quit (...)

-Onscreen keyboard for entry

Things that probably don't work:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm. It suddenly occurs to me that how to use it isn't that obvious if you haven't been connecting the damn thing hundreds of times while debugging it.
<br/>
<br/>
1) Boot the NDS
<br/>
2) Enter a server name using the keyboard - there's one filled in that will almost <span style="font-style: italic">certainly</span> not work on your network ;) erase it with backspace. Hit enter/return when done.
<br/>
3) Enter a nick. Hit enter/return when done.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully it will be connecting now: it may take a while, but once the server finishes sending you sign up messages, press Join, type in a channel name (#whatever), then enter/return to complete again.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you're in channels, shoulder buttons to switch between them. Probably have to use them even to get to the channel once you've joined it, anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awesome :)
<br/>
<br/>
I like it a lot, it's nice and handy.  Connects to my router perfectly, but here is my request.  
<br/>
First of all, are you using the latest touch screen code?  I think there was an update recently (maybe a month ago?) that had a updated touch screen code that tended to work better with the weird DSes that had problems.  I try to touch "n" and it types "f" (for some strange reason).  This makes it extremely hard to...chat.  If you could try to find the latest touch screen code and use that that would be great, as apps that have used the latest have been responding better for me.
<br/>
My second suggestion- is there any way you could make a mode where I can move and select keys with the d-pad?  I know that kind of defeats the purpose of the touch screen, but you can select letters like that in pictochat as well, and it comes in handy quite a bit.  Just give me a little selector box around the key to let me know which key I'm on and press A to enter it, you get the point.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, great job, and I hope you implement the features I suggested!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#81762 - ficedula - Mon May 01, 2006 10:32 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, I'm using the latest libnds - 20060410, I think. I had some issues on my screen too, so it's tweaked to work on mine ... not sure what more to do with the touchscreen, it's being a bit of a bitch. Is there some recommended code anywhere for converting touch-&gt;pixel coordinates; the libnds code still seems to return "raw" touchscreen values, not pixel values?
<br/>
<br/>
I will be doing some extra text input stuff at some point; still deciding how that will work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, cool.  After messing around with it a little more, I noticed that if you quickly tap instead of press on the key it will register more accurately.  Also, I went into irc.rizon.net #sylphirc as "dafatkid2", and then went in the same channel as "dafatkid3" on my PC, and I was able to send and receive messages, but I noticed that when I exited from mIRC on my PC, the DS client froze and I was unable to do anything and had to shut it off.  Any ideas about what's happening?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still no messages from the server; I was suddenly in #anime even though I never specified that channel.

<br/>
v0.02 changes:
<br/>
-Recompiled with (definitely!) latest libnds, may or may not help touchscreen calibration. Not sure whether v0.01 was actually compiled with latest libnds or not now; I had two versions floating around.
<br/>
-Fix crashing when Quit message received
<br/>
-Add notifications for users joining/leaving channels
<br/>
-Ability to read config from CF card (anything supported by Chism's library)
<br/>
<br/>
To edit the config, copy the sylphirc/ folder onto a CF card and boot SylphIRC with the CF card inserted. Any files it can't find on the card, it'll use the internal version of instead. (Don't put any files in the root - it only looks inside the /sylphirc/ folder)
<br/>
<br/>
Files you can edit:
<br/>
border1.stex, font.bin: Not written any specs for these yet...
<br/>
memo.sly: Layout for the top screen
<br/>
KeybL.sly: Lowercase keyboard definition
<br/>
KeybH.sly: Uppercase keyboard definition
<br/>
sylphirc.cfg: First line in this file is the default server to connect to; not added any other preferences yet.
<br/>
<br/>
(Note: if you don't see the line "SylphCF: Init data plugin" in the text you get on initial bootup, it means Chism's driver hasn't found the CF card, try again. It does scroll away a bit quickly though, sorry!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you join a channel, it won't focus on that channel's messages straight away. Use the shoulder buttons to flip between windows: the channel you have just joined should be one of them.

When you join a channel, it won't focus on that channel's messages straight away. Use the shoulder buttons to flip between windows: the channel you have just joined should be one of them.
<br/>
<br/>
If you hadn't tried that, it would also explain why sending messages didn't work, since it sends to whatever channel window is active.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Oh, I see! This program is so cool. Here are some things I think would be nice in the future:
<br/>
<br/>
1: Saving favorite servers/channel names, and maybe making it so you can choose a server and a channel to connect to on start-up.
<br/>
<br/>
2: Better keyboard calibration. There was a huge improvement in version 2, but it is still not that great. I can't really actually have a conversation with people yet. 
<br/>
<br/>
3: Better stability. I don't know how you would fix it, but everytime I go on IRC, I can only stay on for about 5 minutes until it stops recieving messages, and then eventually freezes. Maybe it's just my setup though.
<br/>
<br/>
4: Ability to do commands, like /kick. Unless there is a way to do them that I don't know about. I was impressed with the /me button though, that thing is pretty handy.
<br/>
<br/>
5: More ways to connect to an AP. I know this one is obvious, but might as well mention it. If you could get something going like in DSRemote, you would be able to jump right onto IRC anytime you come across a wireless router without WEP encryption.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is already one of my favorite homebrew apps for DS so far, but if you could get those 5 things, this thing would be really awesome. I probably wouldn't even need my computer for IRC anymore. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, here's one more thing that isn't really important, just an idea: You could have a few buttons that type common messages, like "hello," "see ya," "haha," etc. And the user can specify what those buttons will type for them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most stuff will come at some point, but this last, you <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> sort of do already, provided you have a CF card to save your config onto. Take a look at the keyboard layout files in the zip package for v0.02; you can define your own keyboard buttons and say what text they trigger. Normally each keyboard button only types one letter, of course, but I think it would work if you bound a button to a phrase.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
v0.03 changes:
<br/>
-Fixed PING/VERSION CTCPs
<br/>
-Added ability to control keyboard/enter text using D-pad/A (scroll message windows with X/B now instead)
<br/>
-Press SELECT to flip screens
<br/>
-Scrolling text boxes (eg. list of nicks in channels)
<br/>
-Fix QUIT messages
<br/>
-Clip textboxes properly when text is too long
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The keyboard-via-DPad works OK-ish but if you find any odd bits where the arrows don't select the controls you want, it's because the DS is working it out dynamically; since you can change the keyboard layout to move or resize the keys, it can't hardcode which key to move to next and search for a good one to choose.
<br/>
<br/>
Since it copes with long nick lists now - hopefully! - that might sort out one or two problems cause by the nick list overflowing off the edge of the screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wait..does the folder need to be copyed over? or just the DS file?

I am still stuck without a compact flash reader/writer, so I have been sending stuff wirelessly.

Thus I just copyed the DS file itself.

It worked well when started with WMB but I get graphic corruption if I launch it from M3 CF menu.  You probably need to clear VRAM to fix that.  It's great being able to use the d-pad instead of stylus, all homebrew apps with keyboards should have that feature.

<br/>
<br/>
v0.04 changes:
<br/>
-Fixed Shift/Capslock hanging program
<br/>
-Clear VRAM on load, may solve M3 graphics corruption
<br/>
-Add Kick command/button
<br/>
-Specify default nickname &amp; channel in config file
<br/>
-Set message window on top screen explicitly
<br/>
-New text input method: flip screens &amp; touch words to put them in buffer
<br/>
<br/>
The last change should hopefully make text input a bit quicker, you can bring the message window/nick list down to the touchscreen &amp; touch any word on the screen to add it to the buffer.
<br/>
<br/>
The config file &amp; keyboard layouts have changed slightly in this version again, so if anybody did actually have their own versions, they'll need replacing/editing before using 0.04.

um its just a guess,

but when you type a channel,

its suppost to be the server...

you can use something like

I'm doing something wrong with this config business, but I don't know what it could be.  I've got the SylphIRC folder with all the files in it at the root of my SD card.  The .cfg has my server/nick/channel all set, and I haven't touched the rest of the files.  I've tried naming the folder both SylphIRC and sylphirc, as well as including just the changed .cfg file or all of the files.  No luck so far, it keeps gleefully ignoring my settings.

once it's working its cool... except for something that relies text so much the keyboard makes me want to smash things. very very frustrating.

 a server/channel playlist would be cool, and the keyboard thing being tightened up :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">right, i've been using this a lot now and have a few suggestions.
<br/>
the text display needs to be bigger. it needs to use the whole top screen with out a frame and without the info at the top and bottom. just full screen type. be nice to move the keyboard down further on the bottom screen and have what you're typing in get a bit more space. hold select or something to get the channel info and stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
that's what i think.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i know whats wrong with the keybourd, i think the sensitivities off. if you jabb at the screen a little firmly the right keys get pressed. we need a little sensitivity slider or something. same with draw isnt it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
