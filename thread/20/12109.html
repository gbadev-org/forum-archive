<br/>
Sudoku.
<br/>
Everyone loves it.
<br/>
Everyone Plays it.
<br/>
...
<br/>
It's been done before.
<br/>
<br/>
There's at least 3 commercial versions of Sudoku out for the NDS already.
<br/>
Unfortunately, I didn't know this (that'll teach me for not researching first!), and started to make my own.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't really mind the fact that I've made my own (saved myself a few bucks), but what really annoys me is that one of the big idea's I had for mine I now find out has been implemented in Brain Age!
<br/>
<br/>
What I was planning on doing was implementing Gesture Recognition (ie, recognizing a character from a single-stroke handwritten symbol).
<br/>
<br/>
I have already written a proof-of-concept application that shows I can do it, but is anyone interested in me doing it for the DS, or will I just cop a lot of "You're ripping off Brain Age!"?
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see the proof-of-concept, have a look at <a class="postlink" href="http://jt0.org/projects/?id=gestures" target="_blank">http://jt0.org/projects/?id=gestures</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of if I take the time to implement it, I think I want to eventually bundle Sudoku (and the 36,000+ puzzles I have) with my Spider Solitaire Game then add an online component where-by scores can be submitted, and (in the case of Sudoku) new puzzles downloaded.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS &amp; Dominos :: <a class="postlink" href="http://dsdominos.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">DS Dominos</a></span>

Oh Well, looks like I'm beating a dead-horse. No worries, I'm still up for the challenge of writing a solver and porting my Gesture Recognition code :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS &amp; Dominos :: <a class="postlink" href="http://dsdominos.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">DS Dominos</a></span>

Now theres an idea, downloading sudoku's and submitting high scores on the DS. It would be amazing...<br/>_________________<br/>White DS --- Supercard SD --- Passcard ---

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One of the main reasons behind the download/upload system for the Sudoku game was that it would add an extra element to it.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be easy enough to make a random-generator (with a bit of work), but given the amount of unique puzzles that are available on the net, and the ones that I can generate myself, and upload to my server - It means that you could punch in the number of a 'hard' puzzle and see if you could beat a top-score listed on the site...
<br/>
<br/>
But, that'd be quite a ways down the track, I haven't used any WiFi code on the DS yet, and besides, I haven't finished the Sudoku game itself!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo DS &amp; Dominos :: <a class="postlink" href="http://dsdominos.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">DS Dominos</a></span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How about ones with different board sizes (like the 6x6s in <span style="font-style: italic">Sudoku for Kids</span> and the overlapping 9x9s in some of the more challenging ones), region shapes (see <span style="font-style: italic">Snakes on a Sudoku</span> to see what I mean), and symbol sets?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The current Sudoku homebrews releases seem rushed and unpolished and some just seem to have issues.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS is the perfect format for Sudoku tho.
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to play a Sudoku clone with the functionality to play extra maps.. Just include the quality of the game..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>
