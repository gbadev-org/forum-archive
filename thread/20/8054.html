    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to ask if anyone has ever released something that works like an alarm clock, but instead of playing the alarm sound it would play the mp3 file louder and louder just like the alarm clock from DS firmware does.
<br/>
<br/>
That would be a great option for making you get up and start the new day with your favourite song.<br/>_________________<br/>Regards,

Haha, I would prefer this to the regular DS alarm...I find that it's not as effective for me anymore, but Crazy Frog...that's always annoying.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Set the dial to, I dunno, 6 or so (versus the normal setting of 2 out of 10, which is enough to be audible through the wall)

I wonder if that Crazy Frog voice have been stolen from the Formula video clip. It did exist way before Crazy Frog. It has 100% the same voice. *In that video there is Formula car and there plays that frog voice backround and that clip is several years old*<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The saddest thing is that the whole Crazy Frog thing is all based on stealing other people's work. Axel F theme, which is a great song, was brutally murdered by this sick child of modern pop culture. I just love to see people saying they like Crazy Frog, because the music is fine. I'd like to hit them all with a big hammer...<br/>_________________<br/>Regards,

I knew that there is already such an app out there.

I haven't played around with it yet but I think it doesn't support mp3 but wav....could be wrong though.

It was recorded something like 8 years ago or so on a LAN party, the guy was actually trying to simulate a 2 stroke moped or Saab V4. He recorded it on his PC and changed the pitch on it a bit. Somehow it escaped onto the big internet, and the rest is as you know history.<br/>_________________<br/>I probably suck, my not is a programmer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
