I've an idea. And that is:
<br/>
<br/>
An development program for the ds, running on the ds itself. An c/cpp compiler for/on the ds with an ide of course. Or something like that. So you haven't the problem from switching from pc to ds and back anymore.

It's a simple question, I know, with not so simple answers. A lot of ppl seem to want their DS to replace their PC. Barring any armageddon scenerio (that's another forum) I think the PC does just fine as a PC.

I had the same idea a long while ago, a compiler running on DS. I didn't come up with this idea for the same reason as you... Well, I had a NAND card(DS-X), so swapping microSD cards wasn't bugging me back then. The reason in my case was so I could develop my homebrew when somebody was on the main desktop computer I use for development. And also for when on the go.(Which wasn't very often, however.) A DS compiler would be a port of devkitARM to DS, most likely. But, IMO, porting that would be <span style="text-decoration: underline">a lot</span> of work, and most of the time it wouldn't get much use. So a lot of work, with hardly any payoff, equals hardly anybody even trying to do it. One of the things that would be difficult, is the processes. GNU has multiple processes running, sequentially, I think. But still, that would be difficult to get working on DS. GNU normally uses IPC pipes for the processes communicating. However, files can be used instead, optionally. And there's probably many other obstacles also.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i think a port of devkitARM is the most likely thing but everything must be 1 program or 1 program with plugins like moonshell so a multitasking lib must do the trick. so the main .nds can emulated the IPC pipes or something like that.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://imetal.nl/" target="_blank">Website / Blog</a>

Given that you already need a rather decent PC / Mac for program compilation, the NDS seems too restriced to me - at least for a fully fledged gcc + tools (make etc.) port.

A simple visual scripting IDE would be far more likely.

<br/>
I don't know if gcc comes with DSLinux, but I remember somebody tried running devkitARM Linux, and got errors. I don't remember what those errors were though.
<br/>
<br/>
This wouldn't work very well for a compiler on DS when on the go, host computer(s) turned off,  or if you don't have Wifi, but: How bout a sort of Devkitpro "server"?(I said Devkitpro because perhaps devkitARM, PPC, and others could be used as well)
<br/>
The host program on the computer would compile any programs sent to it. If compiling succeeds, it will send back the compiled binary to the client, along with the console output from make. And if it fails, it will send back the compiling errors to the client.
<br/>
The client would send the program's source code, and data files and such, to the host when the user wants to compile. It would then receive console output from the host, and it would receive the compiled binary.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course it would be better to compile directly on DS, but this method would be far easier than a devkitARM port.(Not that this server software would be easy to make - it would be much easier than a devkitARM port however, most likely.)
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about making this software, but for Wii. Of course you'd need a USB keyboard so you could type properly... If you'd be stuck with just the Wiimote, well, that would a pain. Don't worry - if I do start this project for Wii, I'll probably attempt to make a version for DS, also. No guarantees about an real graphical IDE though...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Imho, C has already a quite small set of keywords. (What was it? 30 something?

The problem is, you need to key in variable names and a lot of constant literals.  BF strikes me as the perfect language for a DS tool chain.  It is a write only language and I think you would only need a few buttons.
