    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can't access with 2 NDS over one AP at the same time !
<br/>
<br/>
The 1st NDS connect correctly, but with the 2.NDS i get an Error (80340).
<br/>
The 2 NDS are connected to my Router with different MAC-Adresses. (MAC-Filter is disabled)
<br/>
I also tried to connect 2nd DS to my 2nd AP with the same result.
<br/>
It also doesnt matter which one of my DS is the 1st oder 2nd...
<br/>
<br/>
Error-Discription seems not to be very helpful saying something about firewall !?
<br/>
Do i have to open another port for 2nd DS ? And if YES... which one ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regards
<br/>

If that were the case, then you couldn't have multiple computers behind the same router, and NAT would be useless. It uses the MAC address (which is attached to every packet) to know where to send the packets.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually it IS useless if the local ports are the same on both machine and NAT has no way to identify to which connection the incoming packets belong.
<br/>
<br/>
i.e.:
<br/>
<br/>
A "Port A &lt;-&gt; Port B" packet comes in, the NAT knows that this combination was last used from PC #1 , so it translates it to PC #1
<br/>
A "Port A &lt;-&gt; Port C" packet comes in, Nat knows PC #2 used it, so it sends to PC #2
<br/>
PC #2 opens a connection "Port A &lt;-&gt; Port B", 
<br/>
Now there are 2 choices:
<br/>
1. NAT remembers this and gives all packets of this type the target = PC #2. PC #1 loses its connection.
<br/>
2. NAT refuses this new connection, PC #2 can not connect, PC #1 still operates this connection.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Problem solved !
<br/>
<br/>
There is an option called "Allow WLAN-Clients to communicate" in my AP.
<br/>
If I check this all is working fine !
<br/>
<br/>
My Router is a FRITZBOX 7050 WLAN FON ! (very common in Germany)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thx... for your help !
