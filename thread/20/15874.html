If you want to use the official browser, go buy it. AfaIk, you must use the RAM extension pak in order to browse the web.
<br/>
<br/>
I can not recommend any homebrew browser, though.

Yes because most homebrews take less memory? Opera is still, after all, programmed by people.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm not saying I have the know-how to do it, but I'm sure there's ways homebrews can squeeze the same functionality into less memory by giving up aesthetics.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; <span style="font-style: italic">This is not directed towards any specific person, but to a group of people. Weather you think you belong to that group or not is up to you. I DON'T CARE.</span> &lt;-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;SUBTEXT_MESSAGE&gt; I'm sure about something else. Some people wouldn't like it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see how homebrew developers are "better" or more capable than commercial developers... I mean, DO we have a homebrew browser that's on par with Opera for the NDS? No-oh?
<br/>
That should speak for itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Official developers should not be underestimated - in any case. It's beyond me how anyone could even do that?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that it's impossible to create a very usable homebrew web browser for the NDS, maybe even a "better" one then Opera's, just that I'm not aware of anybody, who actually managed to do it, yet (even though some have tried and most have failed), because it's quite a task.
<br/>
<br/>
... And I still don't get web browsing on the NDS in general - sorry!
<br/>
<br/>
My opinion:
<br/>
<br/>
People "living" in the damn net (that's why they <span style="font-weight: bold">have</span> to have a mobile browser with them <span style="font-style: italic">all the time</span>) should get a net book instead of a gaming console and stop complaining.
<br/>
<br/>
And who needs flash on a mobile device these days? Does the iPhone have flash? No. ("Users want it, experts don't think it's necessary." &lt;- I guess you know on whose side I am.)
<br/>
It's quite powerful, (at least it seems to be - I haven't even <span style="font-weight: bold">touched</span> one, yet - don't misunderstand me, it's nothing I am actually <span style="font-style: italic">missing</span> in my life), but it doesn't have flash? How can that be? Oh, I know: HTML is for making websites! Flash is for making entertainment content and maybe even small visual enhancements. Ok.
<br/>
But websites made entirely in flash? Thank you very much, but: No.
<br/>
<br/>
Anything that does not display in a text browser is excluding disabled people, especially blind ones (you know, they can still use that finger monitor thing and people with bad eyes can switch the HTML style to something that makes it easier to read for them etc. etc.), and thus is anything but a colorful <span style="font-weight: bold">failure</span> to me.
<br/>
<br/>
What's else in flash besides movie and music streaming clients that isn't in the FAILED cathegory I just mentioned? Ah, flash GAMES!
<br/>
Web games on a (probably underpowered - for this task) handheld gaming console... <span style="font-style: italic">right</span>!?
<br/>
<br/>
I realize that there are some web based games out there, that don't have a handheld equivalent, but then: Who cares? Play your browser games in a BROWSER ... on a PC or Mac. Or make a request in the forum and see if anyone <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> care to port it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, what's left that would <span style="font-weight: bold">require</span> flash on a handheld? No, I really want to know this time! Please share your thoughts!
<br/>
<br/>
Until net books get even (??) smaller, I don't think our friendly neighbourhood "web victims" will get fully pleased.

@ whatevas:
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the know-how to judge you (I'm not a judge - I neither don't even want to be one, nor do I want to behave like one {that was a very strange ... sentence - I believe}), but I guess, if you don't have the know-how, then you probably shouldn't make <span style="font-style: italic">statements</span> (in contrast to assumptions or suggestions), that <span style="font-weight: bold">require</span> know-how.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Text browsers should not be compared to graphical ones, in terms of memory consumption. You know, Opera has <span style="font-style: italic">images</span> and all. That needs memory.
<br/>
<br/>
What makes you think that "most homebrew takes less memory"? Can you elaborate? You know, this is beyond logic for me. No really, I don't see <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> logic in that statement.
<br/>
<br/>
And it's: one homebrew, two homebrew, lot of homebrew, always homebrew.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">silent_code:
<br/>
<br/>
My statement is implicitly influenced by other commercial vs open-source (such as homebrews) that I'd came across before.
<br/>
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
Microsoft IE vs Mozilla FireFox
<br/>
Microsoft Office vs Open Office
<br/>
Adobe Acrobat vs Foxit
<br/>
<br/>
All of which the latter tends to perform more efficiently.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason behind this is that commercial programs tend to have more features that are not necessary which end up bogging down the performance speed.
<br/>
<br/>
Open-source programs tend to stay focussed on the only task it needs to do and that's all it's going to do, saving memory from not having the extra features.
<br/>
<br/>
I've never used the Opera on DS to see if it does have junk features, and was jumping to conclusions. So sure, you win, sue me.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, if you spent the time to type out a wall of text to question mine and others' replies, then you do care. I hate it when people try to act indifferent after making a comment on forums; if you didn't care, you wouldn't have replied.
<br/>
<br/>
So yes, I am very irritated by your post -- hence the response -- as were you after reading the posts above you, clearly.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by whatevas on Fri Aug 01, 2008 3:59 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I mean by that, is that everyone can do what they want and I don't care. If somebody feels directly insulted by my previous post, then I don't care... Beause that post was directed against people I am fed up with (in the current context, not in general).
<br/>
<br/>
BUT: I try to inform people as good as I can, so that we all can learn from each other. I was kind of specific to what I don't give a darn about, which doesn't mean I don't care about anything. That's a false assumption.
<br/>
<br/>
When I get annoyed by some recurring topics, I sometimes write a more lenghly post and pack a lot of stuff into it. Yeah. It's not that common, though.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, regarding the last sentence, I just meant that it didn't touch me in any way what you wrote, I just wanted to get these things off my mind. That's why I wrote "I don't care" - could be misleading though.
<br/>
<br/>
As I made clear, I don't care (I just used that word the gazilionth time ;^D ), so I won't sue you. ;^p
<br/>
<br/>
I think that expressing my point of view in a way that would be clear to everybody is quite hard in this case. I'm sorry about that.
<br/>
But I don't think I am acting anything near indifferent. That may just be your interpretation.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I request we don't speculate about wheather I do or I don't care... that's a waste of time.
<br/>
<br/>
I still fail to see how your assumptions apply to NDS homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
