    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well....
<br/>
<br/>
have's:
<br/>
-a DS with R4
<br/>
-friends with DS with R4
<br/>
-tried out many homebrews
<br/>
-somewhat experience in C
<br/>
-somewhat experience in sockets with C(smtp client)
<br/>
-an idea.. XDDD
<br/>
<br/>
dont have's:
<br/>
-knowledge in DS coding 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My idea is to make a filetransfer homebrew between DSs, where you can offer a file and someone else can get it....
<br/>
This homebrew should include an filebrowser with some capabilities like directory as well as file creating/moving/removing/renaming....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The things I wish to know...
<br/>
-how to make a DS connect with another DS(like simple multiplayer gaming)
<br/>
-how to make a DS be able to send a file to another DS
<br/>
<br/>
and...
<br/>
<br/>
if its possible to make this homebrew "download &amp; play"-able...
<br/>
...I think its not possible, because to be able to write to the flash card(or whatever) the DS must me booted through the R4 for example...
<br/>
and therefor you should not be able to download &amp; play this homebrew...
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any help/corrections ^^
<br/>
<br/>
(ok...trying the whole thing out using an AP first could be better...but its not what Im really aiming at...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, homebrew hasn't gotten as far as DS to DS networking yet. You can connect a DS to an AP via dswifi lib.

Here is your best bet for information:

Very slow (3-4kB/s). But this is not a limitation by the lib, but by the method i am using to transfer right now: Send single Request, wait for answer, send next request. The wait takes the most time as i am waiting for all ack's also, so i am taking at least 4 vblanks/512 Bytes :p
<br/>
<br/>
This was done to test memory usage/problems. When using multiple 512 Byte requests before waiting for completion, this speed should increase alot.
<br/>
<br/>
:edit: after measuring now, it are 4889.6 Bytes/sec. Not as slow as i had guessed it ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Mighty Max on Mon Oct 29, 2007 11:09 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
