<br/>
<br/>
now, i hear that i can't flash a ds lite because it will brick it. If i get a Max Media Launcher, will i not have to flash my DS?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
now the main question: do homebrews work just as well on the DS lite as they do on the DS? 
<br/>
<br/>
thanks...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Signs point to yes, but on tetrisconcept.com they're saying that its more sensitive +Control Pad causes too many accidental presses of Up.

As long as your SL1 shorting tool doesn't touch the side of the SL1 hole closest to the GBA slot, no bricking will happen.

You can use MAX Media Launcher (or any other NoPass) to boot DS homebrew from the GBA slot. See the NoPass sticky in DS Flash Equipment.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
