Just get rid of WMBFront, I know its nice and everything. For some reason I havent been able to make WMBFront to work after the last time I format my Laptop. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just execute WMB as normal (I cant remember the code, but it was something like wmb.exe -data Filename.nds (where Filename.nds is the file thats under the Data Folder)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i tried that already. first i tried to open it without front, dident open, so i tried opening it through command prompt, it wouldent work properly when i put the file like you sugested or any other way, the only way it got half way through was on my old 98's MSDOS program. it only got to the part when it said device find failed or somthing like that. so i tried wmbfront on my XP and it only got to the same place so i dont think it will ever work unless i can figure out how. when i instaled the custom driver it doesent instal properly. what do i do?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, it should be a Ralink card with certain chipset, and no USB sticks. 
<br/>
<br/>
If youre not using that certain chipset, then youre out of luck. And no, routers cant help you out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are you 100% sure your card has a RT2500 and is PCI or PCMCIA and is listed here? <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well actully the only usb stick compatible with NDS is the Nintendo WIFI connection with a Ralink RT2500 Chipset or something else. I'm trying to write the WMB driver for a Ralink USB 2500 chipset. If I can do this then I'll post it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Ralink chipset should be found inside a PCI card (for desktop computers) or a PCMCIA card (for laptop computers). Look for a card with an antenna sticking out of it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
