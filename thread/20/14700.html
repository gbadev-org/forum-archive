    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I want to learn how to make apps and such for the ds lite, but all the tuturials sound like jarbal... I have experience in coding C++, but i need an in depth tutrial that teaches me how to code most of the tuturial just throw a huge section of code and barley explain it. Is there a more in depth tutorial or is someone willing to give me some in depth training?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is GREATLY appreciated.<br/>_________________<br/>Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are a lot of similarities between the DS and GBA. Learning one will make it dead easy to learn the new stuff.
<br/>
When you think about it, there aren't a lot of major differences - more memory, more speed, more buttons, 3D hardware.

More CPUs, more screens, really, just more of everything. Take 2 GBAs, tape them together, add some 3D hardware and upgrade the memory/processors and you have a DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

lol, that's a good way to put it.

But yes, learn that, in fact forget the DS for a few [programming] days and master the GBA spec!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Indeed, that is the reason. Move your projects to a directory on the root of your hard drive. For instance, mine are in C:\DATA\.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...or fix the bugs in your makefiles. But yeah, I leave most of my projects in c:\msys\home\[username] myself, just because it's easier - spaces in file/diectory names are just more common on windows than other systems ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
