    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure if anyone else has done this (I looked around and could only find -&gt;FAT dumpers), but I've written an EEPROM backup tool that, unlike existing solutions, dumps the contents via WiFi over a raw TCP/IP connection to a specified host.  This is useful for those who only own a slot-1 card and wish to transfer the saved games from their existing carts to their backup device.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you can find source and a compiled binary here: <a class="postlink" href="http://frodo.dyn.gno.org/~brettk/savsender" target="_blank">http://frodo.dyn.gno.org/~brettk/savsender</a>

<br/>
It's pretty raw, but I've tested it with a few type-2 and type-3 carts, and it seems to work.  I've tested with the following games:
<br/>
<br/>
Super Mario 64 DS
<br/>
Brain Age
<br/>
Mario and Luigi - Partners in Time
<br/>
Tetris DS
<br/>
Mario Kart DS
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I haven't had a chance to play all those games to verify the EEPROM contents transfered correctly, but an initial check seemed to indicate it all worked successfully.
<br/>
<br/>
Note, on the server side, you'll need something that will just listen on a given port and dump the received data to a file.  I've used netcat via cygwin on a Windows box, but anything similar will work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know, no one else has done something like this, so you are the first to use Wifi for save transfers.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I'm having trouble getting it to work.  The main issue is that I'm really not sure how to use netcat.  I have nc.exe available, so should I launch it with something like this?
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">nc.exe -l -p 5000 &gt; file.sav</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
My config file consists of 
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">192.168.1.123
<br/>
5000</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Where 192.168.1.123 is the IP of my computer, and my router has already been instructed to forward all traffic on port 5000 to that IP.  It gets past connecting to the AP and reading the save file and resolving to the host, but it freezes up at "connecting to server", and after a minute it displays "Error!"
<br/>
I have already allowed nc.exe to act as a server in my firewall config.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there something blatantly obvious that I'm doing wrong?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not that I can see... I assume the host and port are identified correctly in the application (just want to make sure there's no bug in the config file parsing)? If so, then I can only guess that it's an issue with your firewall rules, either on the receiving box itself (if you have the Windows firewall enabled, make sure it's configured to allow port 5000 inbound), or in the WiFi router.
<br/>
<br/>
Note, both the firewall and the router should have some useful logging available, so perhaps you can see if the connection attempts are being blocked somewhere.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think it's my router, as I use the same port for DSHobro and it connects to the server application correctly.  I've also used a homebrew wifiloader that used netcat to <span style="font-style: italic">send</span> the data to the DS over wifi, and it worked.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Honestly, I have no idea what could be going wrong.  The fact that it gets to connecting to the server implies that the host name resolved properly and the connection to the AP is correctly established.  At that point, what's failing is the connect() call, and the only thing I can figure is an issue with connectivity from the DS to the desktop machine, or a bug in wifilib... unfortunately, I can rule out neither. :(
<br/>
<br/>
However, I have updated savsender as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Slows down upload rate.  Hopefully this reduces failures during transmission.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Fixes reading config files with DOS line endings.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Reports the resolved IP before calling connect().
<br/>
<br/>
That last modification might shed some light onto what's going on... though, I'm not confident.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't those tools require some kind of slot-2 storage device?  After all, the only reason I wrote this thing in the first place was because my extremely old Flash Advance slot-2 card seems to have a dead battery (the contents of the SRAM were zeroed after I ran Eepinator).

It freezes at the end (is there supposed to be a confirmation message?) but my test.sav file is 262,144 bytes long, so I'm assuming it worked.  I'll test the validity of it versus REINmoon later on.

Ahh, yeah, the line-endings may have been it, then (although it shouldn't have resolved the hostname, in that case...).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awesome program, I have wanted something like this for along time. I tested it on my R4 by backing up my New Super Mario Brothers save from my official cart. Then padded it to 512K and tested it using a rom which worked great.

<br/>
For anyone who might be trying this on Linux I used the following commands
<br/>
<br/>
netcat -l -p 3333 &gt; test.sav      #I randomly chose port 3333 when making the config file
<br/>
dd if=/dev/zero of=test2.sav bs=448K count=1
<br/>
cat test.sav test2.sav &gt; final.sav

the dd command may need changed if your game has a save with a size other then 64K

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post a link to where I made a full guide (I'll ask the mods) but here's a quote of it:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Up until now, <a class="postlink" href="http://mdxonline.dyndns.org/archives/2006/09/reinmoon_ver06.shtml" target="_blank">REINMOON </a>and <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12848" target="_blank">EEPINATOR </a>have been the most widely used tools used to backup savegames from original DS cartridges.  However, REINMOON requires a supported slot-2 device, and while EEPINATOR could theoretically be used on a slot-1 device through cart-swapping, this fails on most slot-1 devices.  The R4 and M3 Simply do not reinitalize the FAT filesystem until the DS is power cycled, which means that the save file cannot be written to the filesystem, while the DS-Xtreme simply reboots the entire DS upon reinsertion.
<br/>
<br/>
However, this is now changing due to a new program that transfers the save file wirelessly to your computer.  This program is called <span style="font-weight: bold">SavSender</span>.  Currently it only backs up original game saves and does not restore them.
<br/>
<br/>
The method proposed in this guide, which uses NetCat, is confirmed to work on Windows Vista.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline">What You Need</span></span>
<br/>
1.  A homebrew device capable of DLDI (read-only is fine)
<br/>
2.  The actual SavSender program itself.  Download the DS binary from <a href="http://frodo.dyn.gno.org/~brettk/savsender" target="_blank">http://frodo.dyn.gno.org/~brettk/savsender</a>
<br/>
3.  Netcat - Netcat is a "Swiss Army Knife" utility for reading and writing data across a network.  Originating on the UNIX operating system, it has been ported to Windows.  Download it from <a href="http://www.vulnwatch.org/netcat/" target="_blank">http://www.vulnwatch.org/netcat/</a> and copy or move the <span style="font-weight: bold">nc.exe</span> program to your working folder.
<br/>
4.  knowledge of the command-line and how to navigate through directories using the "cd" command.
<br/>
5.  A DS game cartridge
<br/>
6.  Your DS must already work with other wireless homebrew apps.
<br/>
--See <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10320" target="_blank">this GBAdev thread</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-xtra.com/Common_Homebrew_Wifi_Problems" target="_blank">this DS-X wiki article</a> if you need help with this step
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline">How to do it</span></span>
<br/>
1.  Ensure that file extensions are visible by default.  In Windows Explorer, go to Tools - Folder Options - "View" tab - uncheck "hide extensions for known filetyes"
<br/>
2.  Patch savsender.nds with the correct DLDI patch for your device and place it on your media card
<br/>
3.  On the root of your media card, create a "DATA" folder if not already present.  In this folder, create a "SETTINGS" folder.  
<br/>
4.  In this "SETTINGS" folder, create a new text document called "savsender.conf" and open it with Notepad.
<br/>
5.  press Start - Run - type "CMD" and hit Enter - type "IPCONFIG /all" and ht Enter
<br/>
6.  In the savsender.conf file, enter the IP address that ipconfig tells you, press Enter, and type the port number you wish to use.  A sample config file may look like this:
<br/>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">192.168.1.123
<br/>
5000</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
7.  Open your router's settings page and find the section for Port Forwarding.  Create a new setting that forwards all traffic on the designated port (in my example, 5000) to your computer's IP address (in my example, 192.168.1.123)
<br/>
8.  Open a command prompt and navigate to the location where nc.exe is.  If you don't know how to do this, do the following:
<br/>
--8.1.  Put nc.exe on your desktop
<br/>
--8.2.  press Start - Run - type "cmd" and hit Enter
<br/>
--8.3.  type "cd desktop" and hit Enter
<br/>
9.  type the following command:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">nc.exe -l -p 1234 &gt; savefile.sav</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
(note that that is a lowercase L, not a number one) where 1234 is the port number you specified in savsender.conf (in my example, 5000) and "savefile.sav" is the name of the file you wish to save as.  If your firewall asks you to allow traffic by the program, accept it.  Leave this window running even though it looks like it's doing nothing.
<br/>
10.  Put your microSD card in your slot-1 device and boot it up.  
<br/>
11.  It will ask you to insert your game card and press A, so swap to the official DS cartridge and press A.
<br/>
12.  It will automatically detect the save file and send it over Wifi to your computer.  Once it says "Done!" you may turn off your DS.  
<br/>
13.  Go to the command prompt window that has netcat running and press CTRL+C to kill it if necessary before typing "exit" and hitting Enter.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The way I made it work is like this:
<br/>
<br/>
First, make sure that your your DS can work properly with wifi homebrews like Beup or DSOrganize's IRC.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, know your computer's IP address (which is set by your wireless router). Put this in the config file. For example, my Linksys gave my computer 192.168.1.100 as the IP address. 
<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, disable firewall in Windows and router. I don't know if you must do port forwarding, but I used my already forwarded port for WC3: TFT (6112) as the port #.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Still wont work. How do I know what port to use because that is the only thing I can think of left as a problem. Internet/IRC in DSO works.
<br/>
<br/>
It's always the same damn thing to. Connects to AP. I put in the game cart I'm using (Pokemon Pearl) and it read the save type (type 3 Flash 2Mbit) and reads the amount of data (256KB/262144bytes) then it says

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I've just released version 1.1 of savsender on my website.  This version supports writing the EEPROM, in addition to the regular dumping functions.  I've tested this with both MKDS, SM64, and Brain Age, and it seems to work properly.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I've fixed the config file parsing so it'll deal with whitespace at the start and end of config lines.  This should make Mac users happy, as it will now handle any line-ending style, as well as extra spaces, etc.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the update!  Could you give us an example of how to use netcat with the new uploading functionality?  I can still backup my save files fine, but the only game I'm willing to sacrifice the save file of is this game called Brain Boost Beta Wave (type 1, EEPROM 512 bytes), and I can't seem to get it to work correctly, so I don't want to test Mario Kart DS until I can verify that it works for another game.

I'm using the command
<br/>
nc.exe -w 1 192.168.1.125 5000 &lt; savefile.sav

Where 192.168.1.125 is the IP address of my DS and 5000 is the port specified in my config file.  Am I using the wrong syntax?  I see the following message:

I can dump the save file to my computer fine using "nc.exe -l -p 5000 &gt; savefile.sav" so I'm guessing I'm using the wrong netcat command, since the connection appears to be good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks, I just tested v1.1 and was able to restore my New Super Mario Bros save.
<br/>
<br/>
On funny thing happened thought. When I backed up the save with the original release of savsender it gave me a 64K file which was a over dump but I did not notice since I had to add extra padding to run it on my R4.
<br/>
<br/>
I found that out when I cut away the padding so it was 64K again and tried to restore it and lost what was on the cart. After re-dumping with v1.1 I found out the correct size was 8K so cut my original save even further and got it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story if anyone got a over dump with the old version the backups are not junk they can be fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
Also a suggestion for other new people to this program you should add instructions to put in the original game cart right before it prompts for dump or restore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the original version was built against an older version of the libnds EEPROM code, and also performed it's own EEPROM type detection.  It suffices to say this code was broken. :)  The result was overdumps, no support for 512K EEPROMs, etc.  The latest builds incorporate much better EEPROM read/write code, which corrects these problems.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the directions, I'm just linking to dantheman's tutorial, now.  He's done a good job of capturing the directions (including your suggestion), so why duplicate the effort?  Translation:  I'm very lazy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just want to inform you that I've wrote a savsender client for XP called savreceiver.
<br/>
<br/>
To turn it in English, edit savsender.ini and replace Fran?ais by English.
<br/>
<br/>
It download automaitaclly the save file from savsender and make a file compatible with any linker (actually M3Simply/R4 and DSLink but others will be added in few days)
<br/>
<br/>
Actual version is 0.1b.

And yes copy the sav format onto your memory. Depending on what type of device you have you might need to convert it first though.
