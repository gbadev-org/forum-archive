    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
ok, using a nopass device allow to run homebrew programs from a flash card. Than I see two advantages of flashing the bios:
<br/>
1) disable the health screen (if wished)
<br/>
2) reanimate a bricked DS (correct?)
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the "difficulty" to hold the shorcut on SL1 to succesfull flash the bios I wonder how it is possible that a malicious program is able to destroy the bios?
<br/>
If a malicuos tool is able to destroy the bios even if there is no shorten on the SL1 I would use FlashMe to "protect" my NDSL (or better: to recover from that). But why isn't it possible to flash the bios with FlashMe without the shorten SL1?
<br/>
<br/>
Are the first bytes in the bios the difference? FlashMe contains recovery code, original Bios not? These bytes are protected by the SL1 and the rest of the bios could be overwritten without shorten SL1?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your comment!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's pretty much it.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, it's not "difficult" to hold a properly made bridging tool onto SL1 for twelve seconds.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That's why I used the "".  But you must agree that is is very difficult for the software ... :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
