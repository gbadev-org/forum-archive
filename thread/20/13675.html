As you all know there?s been a loooong delay since my last update on here, and I apologise profusely! What?s my excuse? It?s mostly due to a new relationship (awwwww) and a few holidays I?ve taken, but it?s also because I lost my password for this site ;p
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the good news I still fully intend to complete this project - the bad is I find myself with less and less time to do it  I have a lovely new R4 homebrew card to do the job with too and I?m eager to try it out, just need to work in a few hours a week of project time to do it in ;p In the mean time I think I shall neaten up the existing source code again for another release, hopefully in a state where its fully working on the DS hardware. Then I shall just try to squeeze in as much development time as I can and see how it goes? if anyone at anytime wants to grab the source code so far and run with their own RTS engine feel free, I fully encourage it!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure it said you were banned? Hmm, you are not in the banned list. Perhaps it was an error. I suggest trying again. 
<br/>
<br/>
99% of the site is run by myself and its all paid for by me. The Moddz Network also has a Wiki for anyone and wordpress blogs for all developers! We also host developers on a one to one basis for anyone that contacts us.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the kind words as we are the number 1 most updated site on the web for homebrew news. And if you have any problems feel free to contact me personally via any IM proggies (profile on site), email, contact script, or forum topic on Moddz.
