    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, a huge thanks to <span style="font-weight: bold">LS5</span> for making this awesome process. Video on the DS is now truly worthwhile.
<br/>
<br/>
For those of us that use BatchDPG, I think we should post all the settings we use during the transcoding/encoding steps. I would love to have a solid group of settings, but I honestly don't really know what I'm doing. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will share what I HAVE learned.
<br/>
<br/>
Go into the moonshell directory (shell), open up global.ini and modify these settings:
<br/>
Dithering=0
<br/>
GOPSkip=0
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently just encoding Xvids, haven't had a need to transcode anything yet. Would it make sense to transcode to a certain format before going to DPG?
<br/>
<br/>
My settings for dpg encode are:
<br/>
FPS: 15
<br/>
Width: 256
<br/>
Height: 192
<br/>
Audio bitrate: 64
<br/>
Video Bitrate: 352
<br/>
Max Video:352
<br/>
Mono
<br/>
<br/>
I hope there are better settings that this!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Video compressions are generally lossy, so if you take a video compressed in Format X, it's already lost some quality. In the conversion to DPG it will lose some more. So it makes no sense to convert it to Format Y and lose even more quality beforehand. If the encoder doesn't understand Format X, and Format Y is lossless, then sure, go ahead. Otherwise you're just wasting CPU power.
<br/>
<br/>
(Side note: This is why audio encoding programs warn you about encoding from MP3 or OGG to one of these, as these are lossy formats.)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh okay. I should have drawn some parallels to audio transcoding, I'm fairly well-versed with that. What would you say is the best framerate? I'm around 16 right now, I tried 24 and the video froze after a few seconds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
