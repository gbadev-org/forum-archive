    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Found an interview with Sgstair. Evidently he is pretty close to getting WiFi on DS working and seems like he should be finished soon. This has been on the net for a week, I'm surprised no one has posted anything.

Ninendo showed a demo at the E3 which was exactly that. I cannot remember what it was called, but users were able to use the demo DSs like an IM client with voice over IP. Supposedly this isn't coming out, only an internal test demo. The prez of Nintendo said they decided against voice chat in games because they wanted to prevent any "forward content" which I assume means people cursing in games, etc. But the technology exists, so we know it can work.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i recon the best way to do this would be to port skype, i believe you can download the api for it and theres loads of documentation for it hell, someone should get a team together and make it an official one that would kick ass!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">skype? nah. The best app to port would be an open source one, some sort of SIP and IAX client. Skype is closed source, and now its owned by ebay, I doubt its going to improve a huge amount. You would also need to talk to skype, as theres no info on the voice encryption/codec side, so no ports to anything is possible (AFAIK)

I might try contacting them to see whether it might be possible to do an official version of it on the ds.  The problem with using another opensource version is that no-one uses them which would be fine for talking to people on gbadev but you wont be able to talk to your friends.

That demo was not being transmitted by a DS Download Station, as far as I know.  Those are the only demos that can be captured, and I think all of those were captured.  (Unless by "captured" you meant "broke the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000383044065/" target="_blank">DS restraining fixture</a>, stole the DS cart, reverse engineered the code, and shared the results."

Nintendo DS implementation of 802.11b is limited to 2 Mbps, and after overhead you can probably squeeze only 1.2 Mbps, but that's still good enough for MPEG-1 video provided the ARM9 is up to the task.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Erm, I think you misunderstood my point. How does the official Wi-Fi library stop someone from doing a homebrewn implementation of WPA? Unless the 802.11b implementation is all done in hardware, I dont see why WPA can't be added in the software side if someone writes it.
<br/>
I dont think my wireless router magically had WPA support built in that was suddenly enabled with a firmware upgrade a year after it came out.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a quick search on google turned up this page:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.open1x.org/" target="_blank">http://www.open1x.org/</a>
<br/>
Aside from the OpenSSL stuff, which I didn't dare to look at, their WPA code looks pretty clean and straightforward. (Although I did only look at the WPA stuff, and I really don't have any experience with the implementation of 802.11 at all.)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that someone should implement WPA, I'm just saying that it looks quite possible to do, and that the DS would support more than just WEP if someone implemented it, which was what I was replying to. Unless the RSA stuff in the DS is used for WEP, then WPA shouldn't be that much more of a hit on processor time than WEP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We cannot say when someone will step up to the plate and write the code for users to run homebrew on a 2.0 using this exploit, but we will definitely have our ears (and email boxes) open and be sure to let you know as soon as we do." </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Many streams use the MP3 format, so if the DS is technically capable of playing MP3 files, there is no reason it shouldn't be able to stream them. The only difference (unless I'm mistaken) is that you are getting the source data from the internet instead of the CF card. It isn't like you have to have the whole song in memory at the same time, that's why it's called <span style="font-weight: bold">streaming.</span><br/>_________________<br/>If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, why the heck do you care?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was actually replying to tepples on the previous page (4) in regards to streaming MPG.  I don't think the RAM could handle a player AND the file buffer.  Not saying it isn't doable, it just wouldn't be all that great.  I have NO doubt that wireless sound streams would be fine, though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I figured it might be useful to have the DivX there as well as WMV.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I don't think DivX qualifies as an "open" format - though less restrictive than WMV for sure.
<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with open formats (say ogm, or XviD) is they're not always widely adopted by the public, whereas most computers are guaranteed to be able to play WMV, and the rest should be able to manage DivX or some other variant.

Rudimentary IP layer has been created... so now just TCP is required to make a proper demo. Should be soon. (Yes, I know I could just as easily demo with UDP or whatnot, but I'm committed to bringing TCP, mainly because I remember the gamecube situation where for the longest time the only public code was UDP without ARP.)
<br/>
Maybe it should be noted that the percentages on my list are to initial completion, until I have something to show for it.
<br/>
I will very likely make the source code public on initial release, but please stay tuned as I'm not going to drop this project and will release a much more polished version not much later. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

You could use it for chatting, looking stuff up or the thing im most interested in, remote monitoring.

I would like a GiFt GUI on the DS so i can keep an eye on my daemon.

Also things like kismet would be nice.

It would make the DS a cheap monitoring/control solution for PC's (VNC).

Often im in my lounge and want to know what my GiFt daemon is doing, but i have to go upstairs. Streaming music would be nice too (although i use moonshell)

You could...  but it's not quite the same as a remote control for playing back a library of a couple of thousand losslessly encoded songs through a decent hi-fi :)

I've been having a play with the iTunes SDK, and it seems a bit slow to iterate through the music database, but other than that, it looks quite do-able...

But my question wasn't if someone likes to do it but if it is possible ;)
<br/>
I mean: How to begin? Sending a file via WMB, but is the DS able to connect to a WLAN card with Wifime driver installed? Or you have to flash something like a loader onto your card that starts and supports connecting with a "normal" WLAN network.<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah I did some Python Programming with iTunes, too. AS you said it's a bit slow to alter Library Data of 20 GByte of MP3's. But simple navigation and information displaying are more than easy to do.

Sure, why not. I'll bet far more progress has been made in the DS homebrew scene than the PSP one anyway, despite the hurdles that using nonstandard media entails.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the DS was over $100 cheaper. If I hadn't already wanted it for Animal Crossing, I would have chosen it over the PSP for that reason alone.
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/derail&gt;

Again a binary update (version 0.2 [wifi_lib_test.nds]) (Additionally, you can download a program to test UDP with, [udp_Test.zip] - program listens on port 8888 and responds to incoming datagrams.) (Additionally, source for the udp_test program that should be able to be compiled on linux/unix/macosx systems is available here too: [udp_test.c])
<br/>
I will now privately release a compiled version of the lib, and the source of the test project to people who can use them. Reason for the private release is that not everything is done yet.
<br/>
Things that are done and working nicely are: AP listing, association, and UDP...
<br/>
Things that are not complete and are still being worked on are: IP fragmentation, TCP, DNS, and DHCP
<br/>
If you *still* want a copy of the lib binary and test project source, let me know on IRC, or send me an email. This is NOT for everyone, and I will not be providing tech support on this release. The test project is very much geared towards development, you will have to modify bits of the makefile to make it work on your machine (paths &amp; lib inclusion mainly). So, use at your own risk of misunderstanding. I think it's pretty clear, but that's just me.
<br/>
And yes, progress is moving pretty slowly at the moment... This is due to several factors, not the least of which is that I have a real job now (AC:WW is also in that list tho..). </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
