    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Be very careful with the power slider and the volume slider. They are very fragile. Do not use force. The L/R buttons jump out easily and their springs are hard to find once they jumped out (I know what I'm takling about :-) Whatever you do, be careful!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I don't see any cracks or stickers etc except for the SL1 sticker.
<br/>
Oh and my ds lite has a snapped power button, you should be carefull too...<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
