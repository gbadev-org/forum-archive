If you know which version this is, could you do a LE Royal skin?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it was v.2 or 3. Basically it was just a glossy version of the default. Now in version 4 and 5, it is only glossy, so you could say that this <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> a Royale version.

<br/>
Go through <a class="postlink" href="http://lunaelement.net/" target="_blank">http://lunaelement.net/</a> . If you can find me the exact version you are thinking about, I will port it. I suggest you just give v.5 a try though. It's the best version IMO.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

first: yeah, sort of, but in v5 there is still a color gradient, it looks a bit odd to me, in the royal version was no or only a slight gradient...
<br/>
<br/>
second: I like much about it (buttons, selected colors, start menu etc.), but i don't like the title bars (although deactivated ones look cool) and the vista minimize/maximize/close buttons... Anyway I will keep it for a while, maybe I'll get used to it... good porting work btw.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Haha. Yeah, it always takes me a while to get used to each new version. V.5 is the best though. Actually it's the first version that I haven't had to mod for myself. I think he is done with the theme now though, the next one will be for Vista.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
