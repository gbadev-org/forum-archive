    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to have any program access the Filesystem on both a DLDI device (like a Games n' Music or any other slot-1) and a GBAMP at the same time?  The GBAMP has better read speeds and is better for movies, but I only want to insert it when I need it.  It would be nice if there were a version of MoonShell that could access both slots, for music on the microSD (slot-1) and movies on the slot-2 (GBAMP CF).  Not sure if it's possible, or if it'd ever be implemented in MoonShell, but it's an idea.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what I remember, a program can access both slot-1 and slot-2 provided that the slot-2 device is already supported under the pre-DLDI libfat, which would include the GBAMP.  I don't think Moonshell supports this however, as it only accesses one device at a time.

However, would it work if you simply placed two copies of the Moonshell.nds file on your microSD card, patching each one with a different DLDI file?  In theory, this would let you launch Moonshell from the GnM and have it access just the GBAMP CF card, but I cannot test this myself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
