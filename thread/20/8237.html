The aim of this project is to allow the setup of wifi in homebrew apps as simple and as standard as possible.  This should help speed up development time for wifi enabled homebrew.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was getting rather tired of place holders, i cant really go much further with the project till the wifi lib matures a little more so i figured id work on the interface.  Everything you see there works but theres still lots of work to do.  When its done i might comment out the actual "app" and release it simply as a prettier wifi test so that other home brewers can use the same setup and share the same settings between homebrew apps just like the offical one.  
<br/>
<br/>
Theres one thing i'd really like to know, is someone gonna work on saving it to the firmware?  if not, how practical is using the sram save?  At the mo i'm intending on saving it using chishm's driver and maybe collaborate with bafio there on a standard (i was gonna use xml).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Personally i didnt particulary want to mess with the offical settings, but as for reading them i believe sgtstair has considered that as there is some commented out code in the wifi lib referring to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would be pretty cool if sgstair's library could read the Nintendo WFC settings.

awesome! thanks for that i shall have it so the firmware settings become the default.  I wont have much time to work on it today since i have a job interview tomorrow and as such will be preparing it.  I think i'll get those firmware settings in with the 3 profiles and fix a few issues with the scroll bar, that shouldnt be too hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i'll have the four profiles up today hopefully and if i decide to do a release i might not have the fourth one saving at first (esentially storing it only in memory) but i will need cf writing eventually due to lots of "other" information i'll need saving later but im putting that part of it on the backburner for now.

Maybe I'm a bit dumb, but why the FIFO? 
<br/>
Anyway, no problem, I'll post them tomorrow, I haven't got it here... I use SSID to see where to connect to, and try to connect to the different available networks. Anyway, you'll see it's really a rather simple approach.

complete with scrolling in buttons just like the real one!
<br/>
<br/>
search for ap works pretty similar to the way it does now, you search for an access point, then it brings up the ip address config stuff and connects. May eventually be used for ad hoc. 
<br/>
<br/>
use nintendo wifi settings will connect straight away using which ever one of the profiles works.
<br/>
<br/>
view nintendo wifi settings will bring up the screens from the first post (minus edit buttons) and also allow you to test the connections should you have a problem connecting.

Finally the arm 9 code is really small, put it before you access the wifi data:

Now, I'm not sure this is the way it's supposed to be done, but this far has been working perfectly to me.

Thanks to bafio, i've now implemented using  the firmware settings.  Here you can view the 3 different profiles stored on the ds.  I've alter the erase settings button to now show test settings.

That's actually right :) I've nor been coding C language for a long time, but that would make sense, and also possibly to see that included in the standard libnds with the other firmware settings. I like the idea of having an unified/standard way to enter the settings for homebrew, and DHCP will also make things a lot easyer for end users...

That's nice to know, actually one of the things that most stop me from using wifi programs is having to enter the settings all the time. Have you thought of saving to config file for the other settings? On the other side the firmware is the best place, since you have no problems of compatibility there (flash cards and so on). I hope to see it in Ds2Win soon : ) 
<br/>
[OFFTOPIC]
<br/>
By the way, great app! Any chances of seeing the source code or the protocol it uses?
<br/>
I think it could be possible to create a Java server for that so it could be Win/Mac/Linux etc to ds :) I have already the screen transfered to the dschat program as a JPG image (I had the same idea about a vnc like app but than I saw you are already developing one :) Do you use ACK between screenshots? oh well, I guess some Ethereal could help :)

thats basically what i've done in this one and i added a parameter "enabled" so it knows whether the profile exists or not.  I'm actually getting quite excited by my own project..lol.  Didnt expect i'd get so far in such a short time considering how much of a dsdev/c noob i am.  
<br/>
<br/>
The last major thing i have left now before i can release a preview is the ap search screen and the manual setup part, then its just bug fixing and moving it out of the main method.
<br/>
<br/>
if this lib were perfect all a homebrewer would need to have wifi in his program would be to call useWifi() (or something similar) and that would be it.  This program would sort out all the necessary setup and initialisation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll probably release the source once I get bored of the project. The protocol isn't much of anything, I just send the jpeg's in blocks of 1000 bytes with a couple of bytes in the beginning for packetnumber and blocknumber. There is some framework in place for packetloss and things like that, but I haven't tested over the net yet, so it doesn't use ACK or anything like that yet. I decided to keep it to Windows because it uses a lot of Windows API (including for taking the screenshot), and I don't have java experience or any other OS to test with.
<br/>
<br/>
As for saving to the firmware, if that's what you're suggesting, that scares me. I don't want to mess my or anyone else's DS up. But once I read the WiFi code, the other options will probably be minimal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

woo onscreen keyboard time!  anyway i've remade the previous settings viewer now and have made it larger with the dhcp and dns settings (they were missing before) and so it now longer displays zeros.  Theres been significant changes under the hood and its comming along.

All thats left now is to finish the manual setup part and the search screen.    The rest cant really be done until the new wifi lib is out but i might release a preview inorder to get some feedback.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This sounds really cool. Eventually, once you are confident with writing to the firmware, I think that would be best as well. Do you intend to write them to an .ini file on the CF/SD/flashcart instead?
<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, I would hope that this application could be integrated into FlashMe or the new DS firmware project. That way all games, be it commercial or homebrew, would use the same settings and they could be modified without need of a game in the DS at all. Truely universal is a good thing in my book.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it's also possible that the homebrew WiFi could eventually surpass the standard DS WiFi with features like WPA encryption. But then we'd still need to turn that off to play regular DS games. Do you think it's worth it?
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, great project. I'm sure there are plenty of cool projects that this will help.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

security,  though i can see little reason why you'd really need to change them anyway since if you were away from home you'd most likely play mario kart etc at least once.  There is a manual  setup too that may eventually write to the cf/sd slot but that'll come later.

<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the hardwork of mullusk the killer bug preventing me from continuing with the app has now been fixed! woo so now i can continue.  
<br/>
<br/>
heres a question i was asked which may clear somethings up for anyone thats interested.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
1. Will it be possible to change and view the Wifisettigs from the NDS and save the changes?</span>
<br/>
      Probably not in the first release but this is planned, personally i dont want to mess with writing it to the firmware so i'm waiting for someone else to release code for that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">2. Will it be useable by the gbamp ?</span>
<br/>
Yes, i own both a gbamp and an m3
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">3. When do you think will you realese it. </span>
<br/>
Soon i hope. it is based on pa_lib and bugs in it have prevented wifi from working up till now.  I may release a preview soon but as you know its all about the source code and this will come later.  
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully when this is finished implementing wifi in homebrew apps will be as simple as calling startWifi() so developers can concentrate on more important things!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
it now supports (in theory, i have no real way to test) up to 64 access points.
<br/>
<br/>
You can select the access point you wish to connect to with the stylus by either double tapping or by selecting it and pressing connect.
<br/>
<br/>
The selected ap will highlight with a nice translucent sprite over the top to show which one is selected.
<br/>
<br/>
Sypherce has inadvertantly made me realise that my makefiles are a mess and wont allow me to import other assets such as sound etc... (Mollusk do you plan to integrate it? if so i wont bother messing with the make files)

i've fixed a few other general issues too but there wont be a new version till i implement the manual configuration (and hence allow the ap search to be usefull).
