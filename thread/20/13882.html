    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I bricked my old phat somehow.
<br/>
<br/>
It's been opened before etc etc so all warrenty is dead.
<br/>
<br/>
It's got the classic symptoms - wont turn on, charging light goes on for a second then turns off, if you hit the power button as soon as you plug it in the green light goes on for a second and the speakers pop.
<br/>
<br/>
I've heard you can just solder over the fuses? Any images to help me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've blown two fuses now (returned the first one got the second one, blew it and fixed it) on my phat.
<br/>
These are the sorts of images you wanna be looking at:

<br/>
<br/>
So open it up and find the two fuses, then stick a multimeter over them to find out which one isn't working. To test that you've got the right one short out the broken fuse (I used some foil) whilst holding in the battery and pressing the power button :-)
<br/>
If you can hold it just right you ought to be able to turn your DS on. If so, just stick a blob of solder over the fuse and the two places on the board that it touches. Reassemble DS, play some games :-D
<br/>
<br/>
I blew both DSs whilst using my gbamp and running it from the mains. So now I'm very careful not to use my DS whilst it's plugged into the mains, plus I'm now a fuse short so there's even more reason not to tempt blowing it again!
<br/>
<br/>
Go for it - it's not hard to do.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Those are images for the lite, but I'm assuming the phat can't be too different.
<br/>
<br/>
OK, say I don't have quick access to a multimeter - is it really nessesary? Can't I just try shorting one with foil, if it doesn't work then try the other?
<br/>
<br/>
Also - if the fuse managed to blow in the 1st place - and if it's just soldered up... Will the next weakest component just die, if it happens again? I don't know if it only applies to power-heavy things but I've heard fuses are there to protect from fire, do I have to worry at all?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
