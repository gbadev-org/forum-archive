I have tried hitting all the search engines with all sorts of combinations of words but all I get is hundreds of programs offering to do various calculations for me.
<br/>
<br/>
What I am looking for is a free download of a suitable bitmap picture of a calculator, so that I can use that as a base for a specific application.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think Alt + Print Screen will only capture the active window.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Now all I've got to do is to learn how to manipulate bitmaps, modify them, change the sizes, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
But, hey, isn't that why we do all this inellectual, learning stuff !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MS paint is great for manipulating images at the pixel level.  Graphics Gale also works great.  For global changes, I think the GIMP is pretty fantastic.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have also downloaded Usenti, which is supposed to be pretty good. At the moment, I am still trying to work my way through these apps.
<br/>
<br/>
At face value, they seem pretty good at bit manipulation but I'm having trouble in cropping. Maybe I need to convert back to jpg and use a photo editor as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When I was working with the GBA, I usually used Usenti solely for palette editing and exporting to *.c format, using other graphics tools for most other functions like adding text and resizing/cropping, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
