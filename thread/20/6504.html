    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I released 0.1 of dsHeretic.  Goto <a class="postlink" href="http://heretic.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://heretic.drunkencoders.com</a> to download it.  The controls are not ideal yet, but I will be working on that.  See the included readme file for instructions.

<br/>
[EDIT]
<br/>
I had to update the batch file.  It was not properly running gbfs since that file would be in the tools directory.  Therefore, it would not make hereticfs.wad.  If your dsHeretic.ds.gba file is small after running "make hereticfs" (should be bigger than the wad) you are having this problem.  Try downloading again, or move gbfs.exe out of the tools directory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just been playing on DSHeretic this is truly amazing stuff, had to unzip the GBFS.zip to the same dir as all the other files, to get the make_hereticfs.bat working , otherwise it gave me a file with out my wad included.

Yes, my DS is Flashed with FlashME, and I use a EZF Advance 256Mbit gba-flashcart ( <a href="http://shop.01media.com/sv/root/images/products/ezf256fullset.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>). dsHeretic runs just fine. (I don't even own a Passme).

It'd seem it's not compatible with FlashMe's loading process, although I booted it just fine using WiFiMe (the 'PassMe simulator' aspect of it, not the WiFi WMB aspect of it...to be clear)...maybe it's something like how SnesDS for awhile was imcompatible with PassMe...just the other way around.

<br/>
No you don't, might want to watch yourself in a mirror :) .  You tilt your whole head backwards at your neck joint, resulting in your face pointing upwards, and the back of your head pointing downl your whole head shifts back slightly. When I play games I am more comfortable with control schemes that reflect the underlying movements that result in the look upwards. When you use a mouse (or the stylus) you don't lift it up, you push it forward. The plane of movement for mouse and stylus is in a horizontal plane not a vertical one. (well not quite if you tilt your ds towards you).
<br/>
<br/>
I can understand people using the current control method, but the reason many games have inverse mouse is for that reason exactly. PLUS, after playing sm64ds, and being used to a 'mouselook' with the thumb strap working in exactly the way i describe, it seems a bit weird. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is also one reason i can't get into the metroid demo. No inverse mouse option.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, after you said this I thought maybe it's something similar to what I've encountered trying to run official demos from a flash cart (not using a loader).  It seems like wether they it worked or not was affected by what game I had inserted into my DS (or maybe this was just with the PassMe).

At any rate, changing games didn't change anything...what version of FlashMe are you using?  I'm using the most current, and running an X-ROM cartridge.

Okay, now you've confused me. You're now mentioning what game is in the PassMe?? 
<br/>
<br/>
My DS's bios is flashed with what I understand to be the latest release (I have not seen a new one available) so that I can run unsigned code without a PassMe direct from a gba flashcart.

Do you have a PassMe inserted too? If do, remove it, you don't need it to be there if you have a flashed bios.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, that problem is with the Golden Sun Team (GST) releases, which have been nuked from Pocket Heaven in favor of verbatim dumps. The verbatim dumps need only to be patched to load assets from GBA ROM rather than from the DS card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Although FAT was primarilay a save type patcher for carts, I think it's not impossible to think of an app that will patch an entire ROM to access from a GBA cart rather than DS card. It might actually be complex enough that each ROM needs to be hand-patched by a professional coder. So there may always be a need for groups like Golden Sun to apply the patches. My guess is that it's a simple matter of changing all memory location references from DS card to GBA ROM, but it's probably a lot more complex than that.

Uh, well, if anything it could be that the fact that it is not a straight NDS file is screwing it up...you could try removing the loader, then you'll have an NDS with the GBFS stuff appended on to it.
<br/>
<br/>
To remove the loader, try using David Rorex's PME2NDS (on anything recent it like this it should remove the loader just fine)...can't find a link, I didn't see one in the NDS section of his website.  It says his website got hacked awhile back, it probably just hasnt' been put back up yet. Stupid hackers.
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I'm not planning on buying a supercard but I am rather curious as to wether this works or not.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#50377 - jmva16 - Tue Aug 09, 2005 12:41 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">About compatibility:
<br/>
I have an EFA 512 and wifime.  This is the only method I have used to test running dsHeretic.  The way I understand it (which is probably not all correct), wifime and passme work exactly the same.  They get the DS running in DS mode starting at the beginning of the GBA rom.  The .ds.gba file then has a loader at the beginning that loads the arm7 and arm9 code into internal memory, and starts them running that code.  Therefore, wifime and passme should work interchangeably.  However, nobody has posted any successes with passme, and no failures with wifime.  Is this true?
<br/>
<br/>
Flashme I understand less.  Originally, I thought it just allowed you to run unsigned wifi code.  Therefore, the code and data would have to be less than 4MB to run.  This is why I wrote it could not be used in the readme.  Many people have gotten flashme to work.  I guess that it also allows you to run DS code starting at the beginning of the GBA rom.  If so, this mode should work exactly like wifime and passme.  There have been mixed success and failure using this mode.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe gbamp can only load a 4MB .nds file (no loader) into internal memory and start the arms running.  This is why I wrote that this would not work.  Nobody has challenged this belief, so I guess it is true.
<br/>
<br/>
Supercard evidently requires that the file be named .nds as it assumes .gba files are for GBA mode.  I do not know if this means it can load .ds.gba type files with the loader and access data from the card like a GBA cart, or if it can only run 4MB .nda (no loader) files like I think the gbamp works.
<br/>
<br/>
If my assumptions are correct, wifime, passme, and flashme with a gba cart should all work good, and flashme wifi (no gba cart), gbamp, and supercard will not work.
<br/>
My questions are thus:
<br/>
Are my assumptions correct?
<br/>
Has anybody had wifime fail?
<br/>
Has anybody had passme work?
<br/>
What would be the difference between wifime, passme, and flashme with a gba cart?
<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, in the next revision, I have put some debug info that will write on the lower screen when dsHeretic boots.  It will be overwritten by the graphics if it boots correctly, but give us some idea of what is happening if it does not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For people having troubles, did you unpack the tools.zip file, and are you sure that the batch file has produced a valid file for the nds? Maybe you have to check that.

For people having a supercard, and a wifime/passme/flashme, you need to rename *.ds.gba to .nds (just rename, you need the loader), because if the extension is .gba, the supercard will launch it in gba mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's problem I was having, the cbfs.zip file needs to be unzipped into the dsHeretic 0-1 folder. Easily misread/not seen in the readme file.

A good sign is that the 'dsheretic.ds.gba' file is 5227kb in size, not 207kb which is what I was getting when the cbfs.zip wasn't extracted.

Nah I have the supercard in question and heretic works fine with metroid demo in the DS slot and flashme (also passme).... Actually every NDS homebrew I have tried (have been checking heaps out in the last few days) works fine with the supercard...

Regarding GBA compatability, there are a few roms which don't work, less problems however than I have encountered with the XG2Turbo 2005 (neoflash)..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If i use wifime (wmb -data wifime), the game boot correctly like in the first release.
<br/>
<br/>
The controls are smooth, it's a great improvment, thanks for adding leftie controls too i really appreciate that.
<br/>
Sound effects are great, the gamma setting is a good thing and i think it works better than in hexen.
<br/>
It run fast in full screen, displaying the map slow down a bit, but it's easy to hit select to freeze it, maybe refreshing the map less frequently will speed up.
<br/>
<br/>
edit : i played it more, and it seems when i touch the screen slowly , the controls are less responsive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believe its down to the way the supercard currently handles saves etc.

<br/>
after renaming the resulting gba to nds... it starts, and show title screen and credits in an infinite loop. Then push a button, and hungs in init graphics as a lot of people.
<br/>
As I've readed, some people playing starting the DS in wifi mode it seems working... maybe with passme? but for some reason, it doesn't work with SC + flashme.

I could try some other things if you want.

<br/>
I know on the SC it uses the DS cart to save data so perhaps it will work with a DS cart with a larger save slot

I've had no success with warioware,zookeeper,or metroid

It sound like you are having the same problem that look and the rest are.  I do not know why some DS have this problem.  I have been working with look to solve this.  When we get it, it will probably work for you too.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have not had a lot of time to work on it lately, but I will sent you a new test build soon :) Thanks for your help.
<br/>
<br/>
Raziel:
<br/>
I think it would work if you replaced a current level in the wad with your custom level.  I have not tested this at all though.  I think I saw somebody post success with running a custom level in one of my Heretic threads on this forum.  I want to add a way of accessing custom levels, but that will hopefully come a little later.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I tried the latest shareware wad from ID software and it hangs on the title with a distorted looking image there. Take your time fixing it, don't burn out your enthusiasm all at once.

<br/>
  Added touch controls for switching weapons, using inventory, and flying up and down.

  Added optional music support.

  Smoothed out touch screen look a little.
<br/>
  Slowed down the framerate on the automap so it is more reasonable to leave it on all the time.

I may be wrong, but I don't think Heretic not working for you has to do with your cart.  I believe you are having the same issue many others are.  Heretic seems to work for some and not for others.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">jmva16: well the flash card was the only thing I could think of. Other than that we should all have identical DS hardware, so it doesn't make much sense. I have noticed in the tests I've done that my DS wont load any homebrew rom over 128Mb. Even though the code is fine, if I append a small file bringing the total size to say 129Mb, it won't work. I figured it was an issue with the card, cause I should be able to use the whole 256Mb (I have a 512Mb card). Also, I couldn't get the gbfs_find_first_file function to work at all. In the demos I've done I have had to manually set the memory address. I figured this might also have something to do with it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Its rather upseting too, because I was planning on doing a Doom source port for DS. Seeing as I can't even get a working ROM of heretic/hexen to run on my DS, I'm rather skeptical about starting my own port. If there is any way I can help (testing code, etc.) I would be more than happy to do my part. let me know if you resolve the issue, thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
El Hobito: I didn't just make that up. I did buy the original game when it came out and have since lost the disc. I wouldn't bother making up a story like that as it sounds too suspect to begin with.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you can't get this to work try setting the DS startup mode to auto rather than manual.

1) Boot into the DS menu.

<br/>
4) Choose the top option
<br/>
<br/>
5) Set to auto and reboot

I've tested in manual mode and auto and it only works in auto

<br/>
because he hasnt set the power control register.
<br/>
<br/>
Is heretic still being made? its been a while since i've heard anything.  How awesome would net play be?  i believe there was a doom port that used the netcode from quake world which would allow for internet play since obviously heretic's own code wont handle it</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
But i do know that heretic can run on m3. I saw some screenshots. In fact I think it could only run with m3 original firmware ( i tried 04, 06, 08, 09, 10 and nothing...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes it did, the black screen bug where homebrew wouldnt load without the line (similar to)
<br/>
powerON(POWER_ALL); 
<br/>
<br/>
was introduced in the later firmware revisons and in doing so causes the screens to be the wrong way round. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a thought, I couldnt get it to run on SuperCard until I used passme (flashme it wouldnt go) and dont M3/G6 both have a method of specially loading stuff that doesnt have the power state set? (IIRC its holding start or something while turning the DS with M3 in it on, while G6 you can use the button on the cart itself)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">unlikely.  Is it still underdevelopment? if not can you release the sourcecode?  I would fix hexen myself but its built with such an outdated devkit that i can't be bothered</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
