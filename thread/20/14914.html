    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently shut down my router because I had trouble getting online. 
<br/>
My router is set to change channels automatically to find the best signal.
<br/>
<br/>
My router decided to use channel 1.
<br/>
<br/>
I went on DSAim and it would not detect my network.
<br/>
I then used the wifi lib I believe it's called, the network tester with wardriving and connect to ap.
<br/>
Still no detected signal. I did have ssid broadcast on because I found the signal with my laptop, but still not the ds.
<br/>
<br/>
I then decided to play with the channels and I found out that DSAim, Wifi lib, and DSWeather(all other programs probably too) don't work with channels 1-3. 
<br/>
Once I went to channel 4 DSAim found the ssid on its network seeker thing.
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to use channel five from now on.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know why this is?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. DS Browser (Opera) found my network with channels 1-3, this is very weird.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Huh. That's a bit odd. I could understand channels 12-14 not working, but not the first three... Maybe the channels ids are the wrong way round, if y'know what I mean?
<br/>
eg channel 1 = 14, 2 = 13...14 = 1 etc?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From my personal experience, channel 2 works the best for my DS Phat.  With my router's default of 6, all homebrew worked fine except for DSLinux, which would only connect sometimes.  I changed to 10 since I heard that one usually works, and then I could connect instantly in DSLinux but not at all with any other wifi homebrew.  I tried channel 1 but everything got screwed up then, so I switched to 2 and all has been fine ever since.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I though that hombrew had a problem with 1-3, just like wuschmaster said.
<br/>
<br/>
I know the chanell ids are not mixed up because I tracked the channel changes with my computer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
