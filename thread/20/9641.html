DS can handel it for sure (demonstrated by an unoptimised homebrew that did flash4 in an ok speed).
<br/>
<br/>
But porting flash is a big project, especialy for actionscript and such.
<br/>
<br/>
Remember, Opera isnt even makeing the DS browser from scratch.
<br/>
Their porting opera mini.
<br/>
Which is likely why it needs a massive 10MB extra ram.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for Japanese, it's not a question of whether it'll allow you to visit Japanese pages (trying to do that would be pretty stupid) rather than whether it'll be able to display the text. I imagine the answers to #2 and #3 will be the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You mean like the huge disclaimer thats on every non-cracked DS?
<br/>
Or the one that bogs down most gamecube games too?
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo isnt concerned about putting annoying disclaimers up, even if they dont have too.

AFAIK you only need to read that when installing the plug-in. If Opera DS happens to support Flash, it's likely to be built-in and not auto-installed when you first try to load Flash content, and thus such disclaimers would probably be in the manual or something.
<br/>
<br/>
But I doubt it'll feature Flash. It's very CPU intensive, and it's easy to stumble upon a flash movie which uses loads of RAM. At most, they could implement Flash Lite, which is used in some cell phones. I know little about that one, but I don't think it can reproduce standard flash content, only lite-targeted stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's very unlikely that it's optional. However, it's very likely that someone may eventually come up with a way to make a "backup" of the DS Browser use the Supercard's RAM (or the equivalent in the M3) as its memory expansion.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That way it can concentrateing on being a pure flash program.

And the browser can be a browser.
