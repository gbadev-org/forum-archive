    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
has anyone seen that the source to the classic game 'Homeworld' is available? I honestly can't remember the specs required for the game (it came out '99?) but I reckon it'd be pretty cool if someone were to do a port of this ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
I do remember that there was pretty much nothing on screen for most of the game (the space ships were tiny) so...err, at least the poly count wouldn't be a problem!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">they've been out for quite some time!
<br/>
<br/>
i remember seeing them on the rdn (relic developer network - or something), along with all the file specs and tools and stuff. i actually downloaded them, but never had a look at them... :^D
<br/>
<br/>
that's been some years now, i think. well, pardon me in the case i have mixed up something, but i'm quite sure...
<br/>
also i never played hw, i guess that was the reason i never got into decompressing the archive. :^p
<br/>
<br/>
would be a nice game for the ds (i *have* seen some demos and videos and all, though).
<br/>
<br/>
err, sorry for the lame and lengthy post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that those are the minimum system requirements. If you don?t want the game to chug like a Yugo, I?d suggest something with a little more speed. Like your neighbourhood speed dealer, for instance.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Nope, but let?s be realistic (if only for a very brief moment): the graphics will be uglier than a baboon?s ass without 3d acceleration. Actually, they won?t be that bad but a baboon?s ass is pretty damn ugly. Suffice it to say, you will want a 3d accelerator while playing Homeworld.
<br/>
<br/>
3.3.3 - Which graphics APIs will Homeworld use? Homeworld can be played using either Direct3D or OpenGL as the renderer. And that?s it. There is no Glide support.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

actually, that game sounds interresting! i really like dow (&lt;= starcraft for me) and coh (still don't own a copy of that game - damn, it's about time!), so i might aswell like hw! i'm not much into space sim, though, that's what kept me away from it for soooo long. but it's the goddamn first fully 3d rts! silly me!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you shouldn't compare CISC vs RISC frequencies in such way</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">but know that homeworld does (taken from the faq) a lot of audio dsp, too. it should be run on at least a 300 mhz machine, though. take that out and you have a bit more cpu cycles available.
<br/>
<br/>
also, it used quite highly tessalated meshes (for that period), with up to 5 lod levels.
<br/>
given, that the file formats are well documented, aswell there's all the sources available, one could make a mesh stripper (ha, ha!) that would strip out high level lods. that way some cpu power was needed for vertex processing. remember, vertex processing was a cpu task back then, before T&amp;L - that is done by dedicated hw on the nds!
<br/>
<br/>
i think it's pretty much possible to do it!
<br/>
<br/>
i have to get a demo of that game! the official site doesn't have one... :^C</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
