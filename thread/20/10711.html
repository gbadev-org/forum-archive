    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all. I was ... reading some NFO's when I saw that there was a dump of the Ninja Media Launcher, which is only 1Mbit. Since the cart can boot stuff from the GBA slot as a NoPass, and is only 128KB, I decided to "back it up" and send it over WMB to see if it can boot my Supercard on an unflashed system.
<br/>
<br/>
Sadly enough, it didn't. It worked on my flashed DS, though. Why doesn't it work? Since it looks like it has a secure area(and appears to be "official"), and can be booted from DS slot, why can't it be sent over WMB? 
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it's a little piraty for this forum, but it's not sponsored by Nintendo(and is even helping Nintendo loose money) so I though it would be okay?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What you described has already been tried with other NoPass cards, unsuccessfully. DS Download Play and DS Game Card have completely separate security: DS Game Card uses a symmetric key (and was cracked when the keys were pulled out of the BIOS), but DS Download Play uses public/private keypair.
<br/>
<br/>
A successful WiFiMe2 project will start by completely documenting the protocol that one or more commercial games use for the second stage of their boot processes.

I don't know anything about that stuff, but I guess it does go into the right slot. (Probably not much of a chance, though).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

No, it is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> possible. The 'NoPass' carts have a FPGA(or ASIC, not sure, but basically the same I guess) + FlashROM on them, the passme1/2 have only a simple CPLD. It just can't be done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
