    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You mean a way to backup firmware stored settings, such as configuration 1, 2, and 3, along with the Nintendo WiFi Connection ID so that you can move it to a different DS (such as a DSLite) or possibly even clone WFCIDs?
<br/>
<br/>
I am unaware of such tool, but I'll be interested if someone else replies here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think they want to have the same exact WiFi settings for two different DSs.  This method will erase the settings after it transfers it to another DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Impossible, as the DS can't sign an executable that changes based on user data. The sending DS would have to send a signed .nds file followed by the (unsigned) WFC data. The .nds running on the receiving DS would receive the WFC data over Ni-Fi and write it to the firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Please?

I'd benefit from it since currently switching from my flashed DSPhat to my bro's nonflashed DSLite requires sending the wfcid.

<br/>
I dont want to send the id every time my bro decides to play ACWW or MKDS online without having him purchase his own gamecard...

Time, actually. 
<br/>
<br/>
My parents have some sort of invisible "money spent in certain ammount of time" rule. He got a DSLite this month, now he has to wait so his "spending limit" gets reset to whatever it was. 
<br/>
<br/>
Its sad, really. But hey, Download Play is the roxxors! :P

Edit: Well that, and the fact that he's 10.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
