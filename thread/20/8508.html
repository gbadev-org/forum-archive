Voice chat before and after matches, not during.  This is what I wanted!  Some way of communicating with your opponents.  Post-pwnage trash-talking and friend-code exchange.
<br/>
<br/>
YES!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I read your topic title, I was afraid that this would end up like Unreal Tournament often does.
<br/>
<br/>
Now... I wonder if the DS's microphone can actually record voices properly...
<br/>

Kind of a strange picture to have on the left of that article, eh? It's about a year old now! And it doesn't look like that!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Also the fact that the headphone/mic ports on both DS Lite and DS are identical in their arrangement makes that theory very likely.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I don't think you can buy these in US, since they're a French product (I think), and besides, they look very crappy.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Speaking of that mic jack... does it still do the exact same thing as a regular mic jack? (For lack of a better term. I'm sleepy, all right?)
<br/>
<br/>
I've always been wondering about attaching a nice microphone to the DS in order to record stuff. Its built in one isn't bad, but I'm sure better sound is quite possible.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be convenient if I could just perform a bit of wire surgery between a microphone and a DS headset...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
