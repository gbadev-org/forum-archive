It looks to work similarly to the 'ppflash' tool.

<br/>
The primary purpose is to receive uploaded NDS-images via parallel port connection, additionally it's containing bootmenu and setup screens similar to the original firmware. The user interface is having less cryptic symbols and should be alltogether faster and easier to use. Important Information about Whatever is supported (but it can be disabled). The setup contains a couple of additional options like automatic daylight saving time adjustment.
<br/>
The bootmenu allows to boot normal NDS and GBA carts, it does additionally allow to boot NDS-images (or older PassMe-images) from flashcards in GBA slot. Furthermore, benefits of asm coding, the nocash firmware occupies less than 32KBytes, allowing to store (and boot) smaller NDS-images in the unused portion of the firmware memory (about 224KBytes), the zero-filled region between cart header and secure area, at 200h..3FFFh, is automatically excluded, so the image may be slightly bigger than the available free memory space.

Unlike the original firmware, the current version cannot boot via WLAN. Help or hardware would be welcome (I am having only one NDS, and my PC doesn't have WLAN, so I cannot test any WLAN transfers right now).

It looks like he is using the keypad to transfer the NDS images. (A,B,Sel,Start,Right,Left,Up,Down) is a nice 8 bits, the transfer speed would only be limited by how fast you can read the keypad, and the speed of the parallel port</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
