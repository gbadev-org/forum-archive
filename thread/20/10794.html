    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've noticed my dslite doesnt work unless something is pressing on the inside of slot-1 (towards from the screen) so something is either not connected that should be, or connected that shouldnt. I cant open it yet, I havent got a tri-screwdriver.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone suggest what the problem might be? what is there behind the cart slot that could be shorting?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
