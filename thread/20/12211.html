    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, so I understand that you aren't supposed to include data and that the graphics should be in .bin format. You are supposed to put them in a data folder as .bin and the devkitPro makefile will convert them and have it display on the screen right? So what is the best way to convert a bmp of png into .bin. The tool used most is gfx2gba right, but doesn't it only conver to .h?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wintermute has been working on making git truly multi-platform; we've also added extra options for transparent color/palette entries and the ability to read the flags from a file. They may need a few more tweaks, but here is where you can find the current binary, source, and a demo project. More official releases will follow later.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Unfortunately the links there seem to be down. Anyone know anything about the multi platform version? I've tried compiling git from source without much luck, it needs some stuff that isn't defined anywhere. The missing BOOL, TRUE I could guess at ;) but COLORREF and RGB? Are these Windows things?.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, COLORREF ref is a DWORD (unsigned long) value. Windows stores colours in BGR, so a COLORREF is 0x00bbggrr. RGB is a macro which takes normal R,G,B values as parameters and shifts them into a COLORREF, e.g. 
<br/>
<br/>
COLORREF windows_red = RGB(255,0,0);

I changed the naming scheme a bit and apparently forgot to update the older links. For more up-to-date stuff, go <a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/projects.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
