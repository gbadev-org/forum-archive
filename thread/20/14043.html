    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, as you can tell from the fact I joined a matter of minutes ago, I'm completely new.
<br/>
<br/>
And after recently discovering I could use my DS for homebrew, I'm really curious what would be the best way to go about doing it. Like, best soft / hardware for it, recommended, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it's the wrong forum, it looked like an off-topic type thing for DS and I didn't see much of a help-ish forum.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if it helps, I have a black DS Lite I purchased in June this year.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cheapest method:  Datel Games n' Music ($20 to $35 at local stores like Wal Mart and Best Buy, comes with 128MB microSD and USB reader)
<br/>
<br/>
Higher quality method:  R4DS or M3 DS Simply (~$45 online only, doesn't come with microSD)
<br/>
<br/>
2 Slot method: NoPass/PassCard and M3, SuperCard, or GBAMP (Online only, you need the pass device to use anything that goes in slot 2)
<br/>
<br/>
Some good software that works on all of the above:
<br/>
<br/>
MoonShell (audio/video player, image viewer, text reader)
<br/>
DSOrganize (organizer, calendar, scribble pad, IRC, and simple Web browser, also has homebrew downloader and file browser/booter)
<br/>
nesDS (NES emulator)
<br/>
SNEmulDS (SNES emulator)
<br/>
Lameboy (GB and GBC emulator)
<br/>
Quake DS (Quake 1 for DS)
<br/>
DS Doom (Doom for DS)
<br/>
Wolfenstein 3d DS (Wolfenstein 3d for DS)
<br/>
Colors! 1.05 (drawing app with pressure sensitivity)
<br/>
DSAIM (AOL Instant Messenger client)
<br/>
<br/>
Note that anything that uses WiFi <span style="font-style: italic">may</span> not work correctly on your DS.  Newer DS Lite's have a different WiFi chip or something, and it's not as compatible as the older, well supported original DS'es (also called DS Phat sometimes).  My friend has a DS Lite with the new chip, he found that setting his router to channel 10 and using wifi software compiled with WiFi lib .3.2 or something like that made it work better.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, thanks. Seen a lot of stuff about the M3 DS Simply, will probably end up getting that. There a place you're recommend to get it? Or just Google search it?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've seen a lot of stuff about this "FlashMe" thing. What is it, is it worth doing, etc.?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what do you mean by "anything that uses WiFi". Do you mean that any of the games I'd have on the SD wont work on WiFi? Or that even the official games wont work, as well as the Download and Play and Pictochat type stuff?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for asking what is probably a lot of stupid and obvious questions...But thanks for those who help. =]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As for where to buy an M3DS Simply, I have no idea.  I own only a Games n' Music (purchased in-store at Best Buy) and a GBAMP CF (purchased on Ebay).
<br/>
<br/>
About FlashMe, it's a replacement firmware.  It's actually just a modified normal firmware, when the DS boots up, FlashMe will check SLOT-2 for DS mode applications and boot them.  This eliminates the need for a PassMe or NoPass device (when using a Slot-2 (GBA Slot) device, normally you need a device in Slot-1 that transfers program execution to Slot-2, because the DS cannot natively execute DS files from that slot).  You're getting a Slot-1 device, so FlashMe isn't really that important.  The only thing it might do is protect your DS against the very few DS bricking apps out there (FlashMe has a recovery mode), but then again, installing FlashMe involves shorting out a terminal, voiding your warranty, and possibly bricking your DS if you don't do it right.  I haven't flashed mine, I have a Games n' Music which can work as a NoPass.
<br/>
<br/>
About WiFi, new DS Lites have a different WiFi chip than old DS Phats (original DS'es).  The old homebrew WiFi library won't work with the new chip.  The WiFi library itself has been updated to support these chips, but not all homebrew programs that use the WiFi library have been updated with the new version.  This means that any homebrew program written with the old library won't support WiFi.  IT WILL NOT affect official games, and WiFi configuration works as usual.  It will only affect homebrew.  If you can't get WiFi to work on an application that should be compatible, try setting your router to channel 10 (it helped my friend's DS Lite).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Read all the topics in the <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=13" target="_blank">Retailer Feedback forum</a> to see which stores 1. carry the device and 2. are trustworthy.

<br/>
<br/>
Another question: Do you want to run only programs that run in DS mode, or do you also want to run programs designed for the DS's GBA compatibility mode?

Neither recent versions of FlashMe (7 or later) nor use of the M3 DS Simply should affect PictoChat, DS Download Play, local multiplayer in commercial DS games, or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in commercial DS games. But don't try putting commercial DS games on the M3 DS Simply; keep using Game Cards for those.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
