    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I didn't really fix the scratches, but I completely hid them.
<br/>
<br/>
I happened to have a big chunk of left-over transparent plastic from a model, (poly styrene or something?)  which I cut with an exacto-knife and it is now lodged perfectly within the gap between the touch screen and the casing.
<br/>
<br/>
So, for anyone else with a bit of left-over clear plastic from a model and a scratched touch screen that makes a horrible scraping noise, try that!
<br/>
<br/>
Be very generous when you cut the plastic though; I have it sliding around a bit with a big gap on the side... be careful when you judge how much goes under the casing. Leave a notch in the corner to pry it off with, or you can do what I did and hope to be able to pry it off with a bit of adhesive when it's time to get a new one.
<br/>
<br/>
Also be careful when shoving it under the casing -- you have to carefully aim it, bit by bit, underneath the case (but without scraping the screen).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So there you go: $1 screen cover that does not bubble, does not seem to hinder performance (works perfectly in Mario 64... which needs some pretty good response), and fits snugly without adhesive. Also stops junk from getting stuck under the screen so you don't need to clean it all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It made me happy, anyway! Also, the scratches are not only inaudible, but they also seem to be much less visible!
<br/>
Of course, the screen is a tiny bit blurred, but it pays off. I quite like not being worried about poking the screen a bit too hard or making contact with it with anything other than the stylus.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I was TRYING to be as careful as possible and couldn't achieve it.
<br/>
I mean, how could you beat WarioWare without making a single scratch?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Unfortunately, my screen was scratched for two reasons:
<br/>
1. Nintendo failed to make note in the manual of the design flaw involving junk getting stuck under the casing between the touch screen which then pops out at random intervals. (Must be removed with a brush). They mentioned this on their web site, though.
<br/>
2. I recieved an imperfect stylus. This stylus, unfortunately, was found to be scratchy moments after trying out WarioWare.
<br/>
<br/>
While the guys at Nintendo are willing to replace the thing, I am a bit hesitant to, due to me then needing to buy a cart that has SRAM and reprogramming my PassMe... which will be a pain.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
