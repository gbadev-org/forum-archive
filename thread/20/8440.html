    <h4>#64280 - Mr. Picklesworth - Tue Dec 20, 2005 11:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you, almighty One!
<br/>
<br/>
The menu is excellent now.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll test some CD music once I get this card cleaned up...
<br/>
Wait... never mind. Monkey Island 1 is using ogg. Ah well...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a little Scumm-related question:
<br/>
Is there a utility anywhere to split a game's monster.sou file into chunks? I realize that such a task would be quite fiddly, but it's worth dreaming about. (Since a 512 MB CF card costs money).
<br/>
<br/>
Darkflame: Sam &amp; Max runs slowly... just play it without voices and it should be fine. It's still a great game :) It's really weird how slow it is... Day of the Tentacle is a newer game, and it runs much faster.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About my problems with touch responsiveness: That only occured when I had the screen scaled down. Now that it's easier to move it around, I don't think I'll be bothered anymore :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A suggestion: I'm not sure if this has been done or not because I haven't played with this version for very long... I think that when the top screen view focuses on a talking character, it should make sure to be able to see all of that character's caption.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I haven't noticed Sam &amp; Max being much slower with voices than without.  Perhaps it's something to do with the speed of the CF card in use?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure there's a way to split the monster.sou file.  I'm not sure anyone would have written a tool since this wouldn't be a problem on many other platforms.

Would you like to give a little how-to for dummies like me?
<br/>
<br/>
I have tracks 1 to 24 all converted to Wav, with Microsoft ADPCM at 22kHz Stereo. They all have the same name as their .ogg counterparts except for the file extension.
<br/>
<br/>
Running it through ScummVM on the PC does not return any error messages, but I do not hear any sound... there appears to be a tiny bit of something in the background, but it sounds nothing like my sound files...
<br/>
<br/>
So, how did you convert yours? Is there some kind of magical naming convention that I must follow, or did I do it completely wrong?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They will have to be mono rather than stereo files. Also, Microsoft ADPCM is different to IMA ADPCM, and won't work.  I wouldn't use ScummVM under Windows as a test, as I have written my own audio player for this which is entirely different to how it is done on Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you have your mono files, just stick them in the folder with the game data and see what happens.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a brief walkthrough on the ScummVM DS website on how to convert the files using a free utility called Cdex.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Used CDex and ripped directly from my Monkey Island Madness CD too correct format specified by AgentQ in readme.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if tracknames is correct though since the PC version tracks starts at track1 not track2 as CDex names it (so manually name edit might be needed).
<br/>
<br/>
Can't actually test whats right or if it's working since ScummVM 0.5 don't work on Supercard SD yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can confirm that.
<br/>
It actually seems to skip to random-seeming points in the audio track whenever I enter a new place... it seems to stop when I enter some areas... quite erratic actually, but it's the same bits of audio every time.
<br/>

Perhaps there is some kind of marker in the file that the format removes?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I doubt that. I've fiddled around with the audio track on the Loom CD a while back, and by shifiting its position on the CD, incorrect audio was played (duh!), but for the same amount of time as was usual.
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: The game Loom has hardcoded the starting position of all the pieces of speech and such and also how long a piece needs to be played. Note that the starting position is taken from the start of the entire CD instead of from the start of the actual audio track (thus moving the audio track on the CD gave the results mentioned above).
<br/>
This also means that there was no marker in the audio track itself to begin with, so there is none needed later on.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how ScummVM handles a ripped audio-track, but if it didn't change the determination of the starting position, it could be that you'd need to prepend the audio track with "nothing" worth exactly as much in bytes as the start of the Loom CD till the start of the audio track.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It has SC CF, M3(i think) and SC SD, i looked at the files and compared them with his current 0.5 source and i think he might be able to use them together. I tried to compile with the new changes but i couldnt get it to compile even without putting in the new changes so i eventually gave up. Maybe someone else will have more luck with this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

agentq (or anyone) do you have any solution? Here's what I do step by step:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Copy over a folder called 'monkey1' containing the Monkey Island 1 files (not zipped up).
<br/>
2. Copy over ScummVM.nds into the root directory of my CF card.

3. Boot up my SuperCard in DS mode and run the ScummVM.nds
<br/>
4. The top screen says "Found CF Reader! Switched to configuration scummvm.ini", nothing appears to happen. No button combination changes anything.
<br/>
5. I check the CF card again with my CF reader, there is no scummvm.ini file on the CF card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have thought about putting a touch screen calibration step inside ScummVM.  If the calibration in the bios is doing something we're unaware of, this should make the touch screen readings accurate.  ScummVM could save these settings so they wouldn't need to be done on every boot.
<br/>
<br/>
The RAM limitations I'm seeing are probably not an oversight on Nintendo's part.  On an official game, many game assets would be accessed directly from ROM, something not possible with ScummVM as it isn't written to support this.  Most computers have a disk for assets and need to load everything into RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, Doom ran fine on the GBA with only minor limitations, and the GBA has only 256Kb of RAM.  The same game required 4Mb when it was on the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, on a CF card, things start to look very much like the PC and it would be impossible to use assets directly from the card anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the other games, I've been working on BASS for a few days and it's looking very good.  There was a nasty bug in the engine though that has been a big problem for me, but I think it's sorted.
<br/>
<br/>
Opium: I'm really confused as to why it doesn't work for you, especially since other people with the M3 say it's ok.  It could be to do with the format of your card.  I've only been using FAT16 here, so maybe you should try copying all your files off, formatting your card with FAT16, then putting them back.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, perhaps the M3 firmware version could be an issue?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The amount of errors in Sam &amp; Max has increased quite a lot.

Its still playable (sound syncing is much better), but the save screen crashs more often, and some areas seem to crash at random occasionaly.

Also, I am noticed, when it "crashs" now it dosnt freeze, but resets back to the Scumm game select menu.

Odd really, because theres no exit button to do this :D

The errors seem to all be "Out of Ram", and I am gueseing they have increased because the newer version of the program is slightly bigger.

Any way to make it smaller?

Maybe by loading certain parts of ScummDS only when needed? (eg, is the keyboard kept loaded?

This is quite interesting, as I'm playing the game now and have gone through from beginning till the point where I am (just about to go to Frog Stone) without a single crash. I never had to empty my inventory or turn sound of or anything. I just don't have the subs enabled (purely talkie). I wonder if anyone can comment on why crashes would be hit-or-miss?<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

Darkflame: If you were to play Sam &amp; Max a lot in one session, you would most likely see more errors as memory would become fragmented.  The amount needed will vary quite a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
The resetting behaviour could be due to some reset code I put in but never got to work properly.  Since the Scumm games cannot quit without a memory leak, and there is no way to properly reset the DS, I don't see a way to return to the game menu.
<br/>
<br/>
As loading code when needed is not really an option, I can only try to squeeze the runtime data a bit more.  The keyboard data is only around 8Kb and so won't make any difference.  I reckon it needs about 200-300Kb to work properly.  There has got to be a way, but I haven't found anything I can sqeeze yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, I was in Conroy Bumpus' house when he was singing with Trixie and Bruno, and there was voice and all, but when it came to the song, the subs came on and no talkies. I don't recall whether there WAS a recorded version of the song or not. Anyone?
<br/>

So far, the only bugs I've seen are infrequent tiny black rectangular bars in DoTT and slowdown in Sam n' Max. I'm on M3's version e13, by the way. I wonder if that makes a difference.<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

Apologies in advance for using this thread to ask a few newb-questions, but I didn't think they warranted a new thread. I'm a total beginner to all things homebrew, but I'm so impressed/excited at the prospect of being able to play LucasArts games on my DS that I'm just about to buy all the required stuff. Is this everything I need?:

<br/>
GBA Movie Player
<br/>
Integral CompactFlash Card 64MB
<br/>
PassMe2
<br/>
NintendoDS (UK silver with MarioKart)
<br/>
<br/>
Or do I have to buy a GBA flash advance card in addition to the above (they're quite expensive)? Sorry again for abusing the thread in such a selfish way! Super-grateful for any helpful advice. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, this didn't warrant a post at all, because I'm pretty sure there is a stickied FAQ with your question on it.

I'll help you, though:
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you have the list of components right. However, you can't use a GBAMP with PassMe2, because PassMe2 requires SRAM (which GBAMP lacks). First, you should check to make sure whether you have the old firmware, which PassMe1 is compatible with. If you can use PassMe1, stick with the GBAMP. If you do, in fact, need PassMe2, you will need to get a cart that has SRAM. The two CF adapters that have SRAM are Supercard and M3. You do not need an additional game cart.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Thanks for replying. I checked my DS serial number against <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dspassme.com/dstrackerlist.shtml" target="_blank">this list</a> and I think I have old firmware, despite having bought my DS a couple of weeks ago (it's a silver DS, United Kingdom, serial number NEF107****3). Hopefully that means I can use the GBAMP with PassMe. But perhaps I should take my queries to the DS Flash Equipment forum (which I just discovered!).</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by luminoth on Tue Dec 27, 2005 10:18 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

When you click Add Game you will be able to browse the directories on the CF to choose the one with the game in it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks Agentq and Dudu, I got it working last night by just copying the games over and then renaming the scummvm.ds.gba file to scummvm.nds and then launching that and picking the folders that have the game files in them.
<br/>
<br/>
I put 2 games on my DS, the talkie version of DOTT and then Monkey Island 2.  I loaded DOTT and it worked great.  I got past the super battery plans part just to make sure it wasn't going to goof up on the verification part like my disk version did (it went right past it, I knew it would, just thought I'd check).  I then saved and used the new keyboard (great addition Agentq, it works perfectly).
<br/>
<br/>
Then I turned off and on the DS to load Monkey Island, that seemed to work ok, I had to pass some copy protection screen, but I just entered whatever and it worked and let me into the game.  I played just enough to make sure it worked and then turned off the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
The next time I turned on the DS to show my wife (she wants to play DOTT, she saw me play it but she's never played it before), the scummvm file was reverted to a .ds.gba extension.  I haven't had a chance to go back and rename it .nds, but will try that tonight (I expect it will start working after I do that).
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had problems with this file reverting to the original extension?  I don't know why it would (I would have guessed that maybe the saving in DOTT rewrote the file to .ds.gba, but I did that before I loaded Monkey Island 2, and it was only after I played Monkey Island 2 that it renamed).  Maybe it's just a fluke, I want to go home and rename the file and see if I can recreate the problem to find out what is causing it to revert, but I just didn't have a chance to yet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I never ran the builddata batch file at all, I just copied over the included ScummVM.nds code, and every time I would save, it would erase the ScummVM.nds and replace it with a file named ScummCMCode.ds.gba, but the file would be 0k.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I fixed it by running the builddata batch file (with no scummdata.zip file in there, just running it by itself) and taking the outputed file, renaming it to extension .nds, and then copying that file along with the ScummVMCode.ds.gba file that is 1,320KB into the same directory.

I had an idea lastnight which may be total bull - but I'm gonna voice it anyway  :P
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guesing the memory gets eaten up by large image files and audio tracks - so how about a on-the-fly image compression system? When a call is made to load an image, the image is converted to a smaller format - one thats scaled to the 256*192 screen, at 16bit (or 8bit if the source is already) and uses whatever image format would be small in memory. It way well inscreas load times quite a bit, but its an idea...

<br/>
As soon as i can help the agent find a good source for SD i will reply but im kinda of a n00b on this subject.
<br/>
and another thing that can be fixed until the 30 meg rule is broken is saving capability im sure alot of us are tired of using the QVC method on the SD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

 if it did that though wouldnt there be a delay? it would load a bit stop then load a bit more, but it doesnt it loads rather smoothly.  It could well be possible that the loading is done all internally, so therefore the address space of the gba port would be irrelevant.  Also it writes to the cf card when saving to sram surely would it cause it to mess up if it disabled the ram if it doesnt all i can say i'm amazined such a hacky method works so well.

Hm...there was some talk, on the chinese M3 website apparently, of them putting into place a system of directly reading games from the compact flash and caching files in the built in RAM....I'd think this would require access to both the CF and RAM at the same time since it'd be pretty bad if the game froze up while some file was being transfered to RAM...if this was something that wasn't possible I don't know why they would be talking about doing this.
<br/>
<br/>
But who knows...I guess I'm just hoping (wishful thinking ^_^)that you can use the CF and the RAM at the same time somehow since it would enhance some DS homebrew like ScummVM DS since it sounds like it's hitting some limitations on the RAM of the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope you have to get the source of moonshell, take out the fat driver put it into the source of scummvm.
<br/>
<br/>
Critical_Impact: 
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I couldnt get it either at first, I needed to add the following lines into disc_io.h just below the header #includes:
<br/>
<br/>
#ifdef __cplusplus
<br/>
extern "C" {
<br/>
#endif
<br/>
<br/>
And the following lines just before the final #endif
<br/>
<br/>
#ifdef __cplusplus
<br/>
}
<br/>
#endif 
<br/>
<br/>
If you still cant get it to work ill give you a link - but im a bit dubious because I dont want people to download an unofficial version (its not my app) and a version thats not tested.
<br/>
<br/>
Im getting some echo on the voices in sam n max im going to try a slightly different version of the moonshell source.

also i had to edit the makefile from this:

SFILES		:=	$(foreach dir,$(SOURCES),$(notdir $(wildcard $(dir)/*.s)))

to this to include the scsd.s file

bear in mind this is the arm9 makefile.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just some quick questions about scaling/zooming views...
<br/>
<br/>
What difference do "Fullscreen mode" and "Aspect ratio correction" make when you check them off?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there any way to make the 'zoomed view' show at 1:1? What I'd like is to have the touch screen in its 'squished' complete view, and the other screen scrolling around as usual, but without it being all pixelated from being zoomed-in slightly... it doesn't seem to zoom all the way out, is all.
<br/>
<br/>
My last question is just out of curiosity: What was the original resolution of Monkey Island I + II, and, was it intended to be viewed with square pixels..? The graphics seem to look better-proportionned on 'squished' mode, despite all the missing pixels... is it my imagination, or was there actually a time when the standard computer screen resolution didn't use square pixels?

Usually the ones getting blank screen are those who use passme. Once you flash the ds all the problems go away. This is what we (at a spanish forum) tested. Maybe you have other problems and I can't help you with them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, it works fairly well using the zip method. The other version (native SD) works perfect, but I don't know how to save.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

no it doesnt work perfectly alot of people are experiancing just a blank screen. to save i think you must use the QVC method</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Usually the ones getting blank screen are those who use passme. Once you flash the ds all the problems go away. This is what we (at a spanish forum) tested. Maybe you have other problems and I can't help you with them.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

People who are getting black screens see if this version works better. Im sorry that im not able to do much about this - I really cant get those black screens, I was hoping it was just a PassMe thing but apparently not.

For me everything works fine on the SD except for saving (which when I get more time I might look into)

No sure, but DS has 4Megabyte ov RAM, Scumm-engine is about 1,3Megabyte, so that leaves 2,7 Megabyte of ram (MAX) for game to use.

It is probably even less memory free for the game to use, I'm not 100% sure.<br/>_________________<br/>Pure White DS w. Flashme v7

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I took the source code to 0.5 and modified it myself. Now I can load folders and play on an M3SD. If anyone wants the file I can email it to them. I do have some questions.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Touchscreen is off, as others have reported in this thread. Where can I find code that fixes this so I can implement it as others have?
<br/>
2. Sounds/Voices play great (Day of the Tentacle Talkie) but they are slighty garbled. Is this normal behaviour? Any solutions? Is it related to reading speed of SD (because I doubt it is DMA).
<br/>
3. Has anyone implemented M3SD write calls (I didn't find any in moonshell) and if not, where would I start in figuring them out?
<br/>
4. AgentQ, have you done any work supporting M3SD or have you mainly worked on the scummvm nds backend? I wonder because I'd like to help to get the next version working on the M3SD.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#72677 - agentq - Mon Feb 20, 2006 10:56 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi VanillaIcee,
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't done any work to support SD cards, as I don't have a reader myself (well, I have a Mk3 but it seems like it's not the greatest piece of kit on the planet), and I'm not going to even try doing this blind, I don't have the slightest chance of success.
<br/>
<br/>
However, if you, linus, cory1942, or anyone else gets chishm's FAT driver working on the M3CF/M3SD I will of course stick it in the next version of ScummVM DS.  The changes should be limited to the FAT driver, I would have thought.  Good luck with that!
<br/>
<br/>
If the sounds sound garbled, the first thing I would check is that the FAT driver is not writing to WAIT_CR.  Comment those lines out if it is.  The GBAMP driver doesn't use DMA and is plenty fast enough for talkies.  If the card speed is the issue you will hear a glitch as a sentance starts to play - the whole sentance is read into RAM and played from there.
<br/>
<br/>
The code to fix the touch screen is in the latest libnds.  Linking with that will use whatever method it has, although ScummVM does contain code to ignore the first frame the pen is held on, to avoid some dodgy debouncing I was getting.  This shouldn't interfere with the new code though.  I'm going to have a go at that sometime this week for the new version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Okay, so I've got the M3SD reading... that wasn't too hard given that most of the work was done already. I'll put some work into getting the SD writing, but it goes beyond my area of expertise given that I have not done much hardware/register programming
<br/>
<br/>
I updated to the latest libnds but I'm not sure if it fixed anything. I'll take a look at your code and see what the issue may be. If anyone else wants to share their "fixes" I can test them out.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't wait for the new version. If you want me to test it and add changes I've made to the fat driver just pm... assuming that I get somewhere on the driver</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">agentq, is the next version going to incorporate 0.8.2?
<br/>
<br/>
Also what is the likelihood of supporting mp3 and ogg? I'm apologize if this has been talked about before but this is the only active thread currently on ScummVM. Have you done work to incorporate libmad and libvorbis/libogg? I know very little about programming for two processors, but I believe only the ARM7 can access sound and can possibly handle the entire decoding of the mp3 itself. I think I would like to work on this a little, assuming it isn't something already solved by you or someone else.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, do you think optimizations could allow Full Throttle/The Dig/COMI to fit in the memory space of the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi VanillaIcee,
<br/>
<br/>
The next version will be based on the current CVS version of ScummVM.
<br/>
<br/>
There are many problems with supporting MP3/OGG. There is very little system RAM available for the extra library and sound buffers if it was to be handled on the ARM9 as well as very little CPU time available, and I wouldn't want Sam &amp; Max to stop working if I added this feature.
<br/>
<br/>
For the ARM7, there is also the issue of whether the ARM7's executable RAM space will hold the compressor, and I'm currently using some of it's relocatable RAM on the ARM9 to help with the OPL chip emulation, which leaves the ARM7 with very little.  There is also the issue of how the data could be passed to the ARM7 as it would be tricky to add this into the code without changing large parts of the ScummVM codebase.  We also don't know if the ARM7 is fast enough to handle the decoding.
<br/>
<br/>
There is an arm optimised version of libtremor which may help here if we go with OGG files, while I don't think libmad has a similar feature.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to give it a go, please let me know how you get on!  I might give it a go at some point, probably trying the ARM9 approach first to see how well things go.
<br/>
<br/>
As for Full Throttle, I freed up some RAM in the latest version and tried Full Throttle again, but it ran out of memory before displaying anything at all, so I don't think there's any chance we'll get it to run.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#73131 - VanillaIcee - Thu Feb 23, 2006 4:40 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks. So I will take a jump at it, working on getting it to run on the ARM7 first because a) it has direct hardware access, b) it is a different approach than you are taking so we may be able to learn from each other and c) assuming I got it optimized it might be easier to compile it with the OPL code or other sound code.
<br/>
<br/>
I know very little about sound chips or the way ScummVM handles sound, but if I am using libmad to handle the mp3 I assume they don't have to go through the OPL chip if I write specific NDS calls. In fact, I'm assuming that the OPL chip is simply to handle soundblaster compatible sound code already in the ScummVM (is this the case?). If so, then a true sound engine specific to the NDS could be written with libnds (just as ScummVM supports Quicktime, Core Audio, and other sound engines on other platforms like Mac OS X). This is within my ability to code because there are many examples out there, although I won't get started for a week or so (in the meanwhile I will read up on NDS sound ).
<br/>
<br/>
Actually I will just go through all of your code instead of asking so many stupid questions because honestly I have no idea how you are handling sound =) But if I've said something stupid, just correct me as I have limited knowledge of the NDS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#73218 - VanillaIcee - Thu Feb 23, 2006 11:06 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">true dat =) I think there may be a limitation in processing power. I believe though I've read that an ARM7 at 33MHz can handle MP3 decoding real-time, so assuming not much else is running on that processor it may be possible. Although there are other resource limitations that may hinder the effort.
<br/>
<br/>
I may just look into FLAC, assuming it is not processor intensive. This would be similar compressing to a zip and save between 30-50%. Now in version 0.4 when we ran a zip, it was loaded into the M3's internal memory making it very quick. Do you think that a zip that wasn't loaded into memory but instead was run off the media card could be decompressed on the fly fast enough? Because that also saved quite a bit of space for my sample game, DOTT.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Do you have an idea/estimate of how much memory and processor percentage/cycles are taken up by ScummVM, either just the graphics layer or the current code that plays the uncompressed music?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>    
</div>
<div class="post">
    <h4>#73284 - agentq - Fri Feb 24, 2006 10:55 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would be hard to say whether the ARM7 could handle MP3 in realtime.  Because the ARM7 has very little memory of it's own, it would probably have to store buffers and/or the source data in main memory, which would cause some amount of contention with the ARM9, slowing it down.  How much effect this would have I don't know, but it's definately something to consider.  Of course, it would also depend on the bitrate and sample rate of the MP3.  Anyone know what rates are used?
<br/>
<br/>
The ZIPs used in 0.4 were not compressed, so they're not really a measure of much.  I used them because it's a handy way of getting lots of files into one, complete with all the filename information, so that I could simulate a disc based file system which ScummVM expects.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure about this, but I think the speech in ScummVM is already compressed using an ADPCM variant.  This would mean that FLAC wouldn't make the files any smaller than they are already, surely?
<br/>
<br/>
The current CPU usage for ScummVM is quite low for the graphics side of things.  Only Sam &amp; Max stretches the available processing time, and it has several points where it slows down, so it's going over 100% of CPU.  So any increase there would cause further problems.  All the other games are fairly light though, and sit somewhere between 50% and 75% most of the time.  Most of this CPU usage is down to the slow OPL emulator (for the Adlib MIDI music) which has some hacks in it to speed it up, but still is very heavy.  If you can get it to run any faster, it would free up CPU time for decompressing speech.
<br/>
<br/>
As for memory usage, I have managed to free a fair bit of RAM in the next version,  so my current test case (talking to the fisherman in the World of Fish) leaves 1Mb available, which is tons, but I am aware that my test case is not the most memory that the game can use.  How much headroom I actually have is not really known.  I wouldn't want to use much more than 400Kb or so more RAM before starting to worry that Sam &amp; Max could crash. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what you're referring to by uncompressed music.  The MIDI audio that many of the games use is tiny and probably wouldn't be worth compressing.  The CD audio I implemented in v0.5 is IMA-ADPCM compressed, which gives 2:1 compression with a little loss in quality.  Decompressing this is incredibly cheap, certainly cheaper than playing the MIDI music and was also implemented in just a few K of code.  See cdaudio.cpp in the source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sure the ARM7 at 33MHz can handle MP3 decoding realtime even without assembly code, however, the big issue will be the contention with the ARM9 and their shared resources and this just might make it very difficult or impossible like you've said. I'll just try to get libmad running on the ARM7 by itself, taking a look at moonshell for inspiration =) If I can get past that step as easily as I hope then I'll take a look at the tough integration with ScummVM. I'll also add libflac to your scummvm so I get familiar with the code and nintendo ds before I tackle the harder mp3 issue. That shouldn't be a problem because it is not resource intensive.
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, when I ran 0.4 I had created a compressed ZIP archive of DOTT and it ran fine. So if you were using zlib to handle the zip file it seemed to be handling the decompression in my case.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, not sure about the ADPCM compression used by default, but I do know that most games shrink when FLAC is run so the format LucasArts distributed them as in DOTT,SAMNMAX, etc. is not the smallest it can be, whether already compressed or not. I didn't realize you had implemented IMA-ADPCM for cd-audio which is awesome, although I can think of only Monkey 1 that can use it. Of course you wouldn't compress midi... it's already tiny! I'll check out your source this weekend. Like I said, I will just add on FLAC for fun, since it is already supported in ScummVM but it produces about the same compression as IMA-ADPCM, uses very little processing power, and is lossless, and can be used for the entire monster.sou.
<br/>
<br/>
So did you write the OPL emulator from scratch or modify the emulator included with ScummVM? Very nice either way. I'll take a look to see if I can speed it up, but I doubt I could do any better than you unless you have some suggestions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The open source Helix decoder can decode a 44.1KHz, 2 channel, 128Kbps mp3 on an ARM7TDMI at 26MHz and a 48.0KHz, 2 channel, 320Kbps mp3 at 30MHz meaning that I was rightthat the Nintendo DS sub-processor can handle the load.
<br/>
<br/>
It also uses 13k Bytes of ROM which is no problem no matter where I put it and 24k of RAM which will totally fit in the private RAM of the ARM7. I can start out just putting them both together because I believe the private ram is 64k (someone correct me if I'm wrong).
<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I'll put work into it... if I produce anything I'll release it as a plugin to moonshell as well as an addition to the scummvm source (I assume converting the libmad calls already it the basic souce will not be that hard to convert this library... if that's not the case I'll have to put some work into understanding the scummvm audio system) , which will mean that it might not stutter when using the GUI and playing an MP3 like it currently does.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is true, I am working to make it an official port, although I'm not really sure how that would benefit it.  It would still be just me working on it.  One of the main benefits for me is that anyone who changed the ScummVM source and broke the DS version would have to fix it!  I have also had positive responses to the suggestion that they add in a feature that would help ports know where the speaking person is (like the zoomed view on the top screen).
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, don't expect everything to work perfect as soon as it becomes official, progress will probably be at the same pace!  In fact, progress will probably be slowed for a while while I fix all the nasty code that I wouldn't want in ScummVM CVS.
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples, SCUMM can output a MIDI stream which perhaps could be made to work with a wavetable synth, because the original games supported General MIDI music.  This would be a great fit for the DS hardware although the purists would still want to have the Adlib mode.  Unfortunately, I don't know of a homebrew MIDI synth.  If someone was to write one though, I would be very interested!
<br/>
<br/>
VanillaIcee, Helix does look good.  The stats on their website that show the performance assume zero wait-state memory, and I assume that ARM7 access to main RAM is far from that fast, so we're not going to get that sort of performance.  Although we have the benefit that we're not doing 44Khz stereo, but something a lot less.  I'll be interested to hear how you're progressing with that.  It's definately a good idea to start with a project separate to ScummVM so that you can get it working.  The ScummVM codebase will just confuse the issue otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure a compressed ZIP archive doesn't work in ScummVM.  I even put a check in there that spits out an error message if the ZIP is compressed.  I don't use ZLib but a simple reader I wrote myself, see ZipReader.cpp.
<br/>
<br/>
I use the OPL emulator in ScummVM.  It uses this on the PC too, since sound cards don't contain these old chips any more.  I just made a few small changes that made it a lot faster, basically using the on-chip RAM to avoid cache thrashing.  It's quite a poor solution really, anything you can find to speed that code up is much appreciated.

I haven't played with FLAC, but if it works that might be an easy solution.  I may play a bit with that if it's a quick job.

<br/>
HtheB, I've answered this question about a million times, but just for you, I'll answer it again.  M3SD and SCSD support will work if and when someone adds support to the FAT driver for these devices.  That someone won't be me, although VanillaIcee and linus are working on it.

Yes, good point. Everything is going to be far from that fast, but both SD and CF reading should definately be fast enough for our purpose, especially since these games aren't moving so much data and were written to run from CD. So it should be fast enough to decode real-time mp3 data from media card, but then again I'll have to test that. Of course I wish the Nintendo DS had more memory, as that seems to be the biggest limitation. God, COMI on the DS would be amazing.

Hmm, I will take a look at in sometime but its really not my expertise (really, the only programming I'm good at and get paid for is object oriented desktop development, not chip emulation =P or hardware access). I'm sure however we could optimize its memory usage and localization in the future.

Okay, my priorities are the following:
<br/>
0. Get M3SD writing to SD card for ScummVM
<br/>
1. Get Helix MP3 working on ARM7
<br/>
2. Merge MP3 code with ScummVM. This may be difficult but with your help, assuming step 2 goes well, it should be possible.
<br/>
3. Get FLAC working, since its very processor unintensive and is supported by ScummVM base code with no modifications... ideally on ARM7 processor since that is underutilized</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, there could be a adlib emulation and another output device, just like on desktop platforms you can choose the audio (on a mac you get a bunch of choices).
<br/>
<br/>
This other output device I guess could be timidity, which is what moonshell is using. Someone might explore using it with ScummVM, although I can't see what the advantage would be now. I'd rather focus on optimizing the current emulation code, and then offer other options.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Someone could create a GUS patch/soundfont of an adlib synth, and you wouldn't need to emulate it. Problem solved there.
<br/>
<br/>
Now to get the MIDI synth working. lol. Unfortunately, MoonShell's MIDI plugin needs a lot of work. There's someone who's toying with fixing it, but all he's done so far is add back in pitch bend support. Hopefully he'll get it playing to the point of being acceptable though. If that's the case, I hope he addes SSEQ playback through general midi support as well. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
All MoonLight did with that plugin is port Timidity, though. I wonder if someone else could port it, albeit, better than MoonLight. Ah well.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, so I've been playing with ScummVM DS a bit now and I've noticed a couple things. First, I'd like to make a request. When you press Start and it goes to the menu, would it be possible to automatically choose Resume if you press start again (like most pause menus)? It's a little annoying to have to try and click the button each time (especially when it doesn't always seem to work on the first click). Speaking of which, does anyone else have trouble with the touchscreen? I know the touchscreen on the DS isn't the most precise thing, but is there any way to possibly improve this? And it's unfortunate that it can't run at full speed, but I suppose that's unavoidable with the DS's hardware limitations. One curiosity is that there are a few times in Sam and Max where my cursor will change on its own without any input from me (and usually it's at times where I need it to be the same like going through the Tunnel of Love for instance). I'm not really sure why this keeps happening, but I thought it worth mentioning to see if anyone else had seen it. All in all, I still am enjoying it for the chance to play classic games like these on the DS. It works quite well for these kinds of games.

Did you have a look at it agentq ? :)

<br/>
I converted it to AMI ADPCM 11025 Hz ( in 22050 it's 34MB since the game file only may be 30 MB max I had to choose 11025 ) , maybe that's the reason he's reading  it in the wrong sections ?

Cause the first thing on the track is the selection screen , so that one is correct. But at the selection screen he doens't stop playing he just conitnues.

Then when you go on he skips to another location wich is faulty trying to play the intro sequence.
