    <h4>#81830 - Harglowe - Tue May 02, 2006 11:14 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yesterday I flashed my DS with the latest firmware from <a href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a> (albeit the alternative one (so I keep my healthwarning-message etc)) and put moonshell v0.9 on my mini SD-card (which I use with my M3).
<br/>
<br/>
I booted up my DS, activated Moonshell, saw that it worked and shut off my DS again.
<br/>
<br/>
After that I tried to run Moonshell again, but my screens just go blank.
<br/>
<br/>
I then used the guide:

<br/>
<br/>
to install Moonshell version 1.1, but still the same result.
<br/>
<br/>
What am I doing wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is really appreciated as I am fairly new to 'modifying' my DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still blank screens.

Could it be that the M3 Adapter Mini SD Version isn't fully compatible, or am I doing something very wrong here?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Put in one mp3 file, which works just fine.

Double check the installer...are you SURE you are running the M3 Mini-SD specific version of MoonShell?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
There actually IS a MiniSD specific Moonshell version, or is there a specific option I should activate when installing Moonshell?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok - got Version 0.2+9 working.
<br/>
<br/>
Still some things that puzzle me though.
<br/>
<br/>
When I copy a specific mp3 to my SD card, then use that SD card in my M3 and activate my DS, I can play the mp3 without any problems.
<br/>
<br/>
When I decide to delete that mp3 and put another in it's place, my DS seems convinced that I still have the old mp3 and NOT the new one.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words: is there any way to add and remove mp3's or dpg's without first having to reformat the SDcard?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is again appreciated</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, wait, that's for the 'slim' version...maybe that's not the same thing.  Sorry about that.  It confuses me that they apparently have a mini version and a slim version. &gt;_&lt;<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Look the right version from About window in MoonShell.
<br/>
Is the version really 0.2+9 ? ..and don't count on Readme files.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
