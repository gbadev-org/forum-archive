    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>
I knew I had a problem with touch screen accuracy on homebrew, but now that I've tested Win2DS, I'm alittle bit scared.
<br/>
Touch screen is calibrated and it works well on commercial games (games such Kirby or something) runs and controls really great.
<br/>
<br/>
But when using moonshell or other homebrew apps (such as Win2DS), touchscreen is a mess.
<br/>
<br/>
There's a shot of what the mouse pointer drawed when I slided the stylus over the four edges of my touchscreen (using Win2DS):

<br/>
<br/>
And a friend of mine worked well on same computer.
<br/>
I'm using supercard SD and flashme v6. I've searched a bit for the problem but I didn't find answer.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for all.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I know there are some posts about similar things, but the screen is well calibrated and it's not because of the protector.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it's somewhat common knowledge that after flashing your firmware, the calibration is shot for homebrew but still works fine for commercial games. i don't think anybody knows why this is, but recalibrate it and see if that helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the latest version (unless there's been an update this month) and it works fine except that occasionally I get hits way far off from where I actually touched. This is visible in all homebrew I try, even my own, but not in commercial games. (In Moonshell windows occasionally jump around when moving them, in Txtwriter one keyboard key sometimes acts as another, and in my own draw-pixels-wherever-the-screen-is-touched program, pixels appear in random places every now and then.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
