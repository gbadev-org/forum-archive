<br/>
<br/>
With the Rumble Pack installed, the Nintendo DS will offer user feedback so that players can feel bumps and nudges as the ball ricochets on the screen. No word on if past game have and future games will incorporate support for the rumble pack.
<br/>
<br/>
We'll have more details on Metroid Prime Pinball and its Rumble Pack as they're made available.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

The only DS homebrew solution that doesn't need a GBA flash cart in the DS is WiFiMe, right?  Because it will be great to be able to use the rumble pack in homebrew games (once someone figures out how to control it).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS tends to tolerate swapping cartridges if it's in sleep mode when it happens and it's not needing anything off the original cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
So a homebrew app could load all its assets to EWRAM, then put up a big notice to close the screen, change the cart, and open.
<br/>
<br/>
Closing the screen isn't strictly necessary from a programming standpoint for putting the unit in sleep mode, as I understand it, but it's a pretty explicit mechanism for the player to indicate 'standby' and 'resume'.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Would a motor and its weight disc fit in the GBA cart slot? They didn't for any of the GBC games that had a vibrator.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Remember, a gba game needed some room for a rom, and in most cases, some form of save chip, (be it flash, eeprom, or sram.), and likely some hardware for the rumble motor itself.  Also, a motor doesn't strictly need some weighted rumble discs to rumble.  In fact, the rumble motor inside of gamecube controllers doesn't have any such weighted discs.  Instead, it seems the motor is purposely put off balance, by doing less windings around one of the winding coils. (ther is usually 3 or more coils in a motor.)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the pak might lilely still be designed in such a way that it still fits in the case.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could see other potential option packs be possible, like a tilt sensor pack, or a solar sensor pack.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The add on paks for GB/GBA always stuck out of the gameboy (like the tilt pinball, the kurby that rumbled, etc.). Except this is a DS game, so the GBA cart would only be the rumble, no ROM, no RAM, no battery. So I imagine it will fit snug in the cart port. We'll see.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well guys, I have had one of the DS-GBA Rumble Paks on my hands, they look like normal-sized GBA Carts, but they have inside some circuitry (is it said in English?) and a rather big flat brushless not-rotating vibration motor.
<br/>
<br/>
A bit weak, but pretty cool to play with Metroid Pinball :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
