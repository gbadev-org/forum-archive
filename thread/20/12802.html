    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dude, this was answered in your other topic.  No it is not possible to switch to DS mode from GBA mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
You are going to have to spend some money to use DS homebrew.  There is no way around it, unless you want to delve deep into soldering or other hardware mods.  Your attempts to modify WifiMe/WMB to run from your router will most likely be fruitless as you don't seem to know a thing about how it works in the first place, let alone how to modify it.  Therefore, the best solution would be to spend the $20-$25 for a NoPass device.  Then you'll be able to load 1 DS application at a time onto your GBA flash cart.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Imagine a simple door. You look at the door and you see a button. You press the button and the door opens, you go through.
<br/>
Now you look back, the door closes. There is no button on this side of the door to open it again. You will have to die and respawn back.
<br/>
<br/>
Short answer: GBA software cannot utilize the DS hardware, or even put itself in a mode where it can. There is no such operation.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
