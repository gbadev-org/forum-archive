    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey. what's the best?
<br/>
I would prefer magic key 2 because I noticed that both m3 and g6 use the same conversion software of gbamp. I have the GBAMP so it'd be useless (moonshell rocks)
<br/>
Do u think i better buy magic key 2 (only 40 $) if i wanna play only ds roms?
<br/>
I'll keep my good gbamp for homebrew, mp3 and video (dmv :)

Let's speak about them ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't recommend the Magic Key 2/3 until its out and there are some solid reviews. First off, I got a Magic Key 1 and it definately could be better. It sticks out pretty far from the DS, so I cant leave it on in the case. It also requires a GBA cart to boot, even though it has CF/SD memory. And the NeoFlash that is packed with it is pretty slow to transfer from PC. It is a cheap solution though, and they may fix some of the software issues with the flash loader. I would say to wait until all they need devices come out (MK2/3, G6, M3) and then make a decision.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">anyway neoflash havent say if mk2 supports clean dump yet.
<br/>
<br/>
And it's not clear if it can boot ds roms w/o a gba flash card. 
<br/>
If it was required, would gbamp be good?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
