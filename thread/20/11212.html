    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I want to get a game published for the DS one day. Before I start devloping my game and asking technical questions I wanted to find out what all it takes to get published for the DS. Some questions I have are
<br/>
<br/>
-Should I make a whole game then present it to publishers or just present a demo
<br/>
-How do I get my game to publishers
<br/>
-About how much money should I expect
<br/>
-Do publishers have extreemly high standards
<br/>
<br/>
Really I want to know about all the steps involved in getting a game published for the DS. I was hoping you guys know of a good website that can answer all of my questions.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Erm, I don't think you can get a homebrew game published...
<br/>
<br/>
NDS games have to be developed under license of Nintendo...
<br/>
<br/>
What you can do is write some demos and try to get employed by a company that develops NDS games. Getting your own personal title published, however, is extremely unlikely to happen.
<br/>
<br/>
With the PC there is a developing indy game scene that relies on internet-based distribution models and the like.
<br/>
<br/>
DS games, however, have to be produced under license and a lone developer is unlikely to be able to afford one of these...
<br/>
<br/>
For hints on getting into the games industry I seem to recall that Gamasutra provides some useful info...
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest I'd recommend getting comfortable with developing for the DS before trying to get published. Given the current state of the games industry, publishers are often unwilling to take major risks and thus any demo you produce has to be very impressive or fall into a easily milkable market category (Sports games, anyone?) to have a hope.
<br/>
<br/>
Ones first steps in NDS development, however, are unlikely to be enough to woo a publisher...
<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend that you first develop the skills and then, once comfortable with the platform, attempt to follow-up on getting published...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

I seem to recall they haven't been ultra-friendly to people doing that kind of thing in the past, since it is reverse engineering...

But since then, <span style="font-style: italic">Sega v. Accolade</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Lexmark v. Static Control</span> have affirmed defenses allowing third parties to make <span style="font-style: italic">and sell</span> interoperable products. (The Tengen case, <span style="font-style: italic">Atari Games v. Nintendo</span>, doesn't apply unless you defraud the US Copyright Office to get plans in an attempt to shortcut the reverse engineering process.)

<br/>
<br/>
Another thing: Do not develop anything exclusively for ds.gba if you ever want to get published. The official DS and PSP kits are much more like libfat on a GBA Movie Player than like GBFS in a ds.gba.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, thanks for that Tepples. I had a vague memory of that from an old column in Dr. Dobbs' Source Journal, but that was from a 1996 issue or something and it's long disappeared now :-) Since I couldn't remember the details, though, I didn't want to go posting potential crap...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
