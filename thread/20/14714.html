    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, wow, I have currently gone through several ds coding tuts and even a few gba tuts(including tonc). But, I just don't know what it is maybe I'm just a slow learner lol. I have background c/c++ knowladge its just all a little confusing.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I was just wondering if anyone who knows the basics of ds coding had some sparre time, and could maybe get on aim or msn whenever they have the time to teach me the basics of ds coding...
<br/>
<br/>
All I realy need to know is the basics, I'm sure I could learn the more advanced stuff if someone taught me the basics. All this reading isn't helping me at all i think i just need some human instruction, plus the best way to learn is to teach so maybe whoever's will help me will get a little better at coding too.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be very greatful for anyone willing to help me even if you not that experience i only need to learn the basics.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you are getting less responses from an AIM request than a general help request for the main reason that such a request is much more personal. It's almost like the difference between asking someone to buy you a tin of paint and asking them to accept the responsibility of ensuring your living room gets painted!
<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest to continue with the tonc tutorials and just getting used to the hardware. Maybe the problem you're having is translating this all into a game, as there are more docs on how to perform particular tasks but not the development of a game or engine(maybe).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well this forum isn't much different to chat, it's much more comfortable plus allows for asynchronous communication. Where are you stuck? State your goals for now and you will either get your answer in here or the appropriate person IM you ... but stating more about your problem (more specifically) will get you both forms of help quicker.
<br/>
<br/>
I know this stage can be very daunting as it feels like there's a cloud over your development, just hang in there!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats exactly what it feels like... For me the hardest thing right now is just learnig the basics, I understand the termology but in all the tuturials its thrown at you so quickly it doesnt give you anytime to actualy LEARN it. It just says this code does this, and this one that but theirs no detail or explanation especialy after the starting part of the tutorial because they start throwing 3 paragraphs of code at you with no explanation except oh yeah it makes the little sprite thingy move YAY. Do you see the problem i'm having here.<br/>_________________<br/>Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, that's why I started writing tutorials myself on my site (many moons ago). Unfortunately you can't cater for everyone so there are things that my site did well on and many things it didn't.
<br/>
<br/>
Think of your problem being one of dependencies, such that a game's completion <span style="font-weight: bold">depends</span> on various tasks, and each task has a skill dependency. Unfortunately these skills are interdependent, so it is [often] difficult to learn one skill without relying on another.
<br/>
<br/>
Then on top of this the GBA/DS requires much more just to get off the ground, so even a simple "hello world" application [technically] requires you to have some sort of library to print your text, the font resources and either a little understanding of using the hardware or an API to interface with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, so back to finding your solution; first I'd [again] say hang in there! So what tutorials are you going through now? It sounds like you may be following the tonc tutorials, so continue with those until you're comfortable with loading sprites and graphics ... after that I would suggest making a simple application where you are moving a block within a room.
<br/>
<br/>
In general you are only creating environments and worlds, so create a simple room ... just think 1979 style - a block is a person, and people move in grids ^_^ Once you have a world to work with, you can then begin to create algorithms and see them work inside of it (which is why I suggest creating little worlds first).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, maybe if you pm me, i'll be able to help you a bit.
<br/>
well, be warned, i'm still waiting for the phone company to enable telephone and broadband inet at home (it's two months now and they told me i'll have to wait another two weeks)... means for you: i'm a slow responder. usually when i'm at my parents office (like right now - dial-up-kay-yay!) or anywhere else, i'll answer pretty much everything i can find (mails, this forum etc.), so i tend to write in bursts. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
well, long story short: if you can live with waiting a week (sometimes only days), i'll answer your questions regarding terminology and other basics as good as i can. should give you a little better start than on your own. simply pm me your questions (it's best you get to the point and write rather short messages, i'm good at getting lost!). starting now. :^)
<br/>
<br/>
ps: i'm not all knowing... :^| but i've got some experience with the nds. ... and i have already given private programming lessons. ;^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
