From other related posts I've read, I don't think the DS has the capabilities of being in a constantly awake mode to gather packets (please correct me if I'm wrong). I probably have no idea what I'm talking about, as I've never played around with WEP crackers.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is 4 MB of RAM on the DS enough to power such an app?<br/>_________________<br/>FW4 White DS with FlashMe v7

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lack of processing power, lack of RAM, limited battery life, and limited wifi hardware speed are all reasons you probably won't see this done any time soon. Maybe if you could work around the last issue, you could log the packets and do the job on a PC later.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
