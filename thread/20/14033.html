    <h4>#138965 - OOPMan - Fri Aug 31, 2007 9:30 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all, I was just wondering whether anyone could tell me if the follow concept is sound. Keep in mind, everything outlined below is <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Hypothetical</span></span> -&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the hypothetical situation...
<br/>
<br/>
I have a wireless router that supports WEP/WPA. Alas, the DS can not connect to this router. However, the PSP can.
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possible, in theory, to write a piece of software for the PSP that would act as a "thunking" layer to the wireless router for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
In other words, the software in question would connect to the internet via the wireless router and then wait for the DS to attempt to communicate with it (The PSP). Upon recieving data from the DS (Which would see the PSP as a standard WEP access point) it would think send data through to the actual router which would send it outwards into the wide internet.
<br/>
<br/>
In essence, the idea would be to use the PSP as a NAT-layer for the DS...
<br/>
<br/>
So...how far out of the realm of plausability is this? :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it hinges on whether the wireless chip in the PSP can be made to present itself as a WEP wireless access point to the DS. Possibly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">As far as <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> know</span> it's *possible* as long as the PSP has a sophisticated custom application, basically emulating some kind of gateway, which sends all it's packets as if it had 2 wifi connections at a time - sending the right packets to the right thing...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">From what <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> understand</span>, if it's able to send data on the right frequency - an 'emulated' access point could be made.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that is asking a lot.  Not only will you need to make the PSP act as an AP, you'll have to make the PSP act as a wireless client as well and on top of all that do some kind of NAT as well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is some <span style="font-style: italic">serious</span> misinformation bouncing around in this topic...
<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is, a wireless device can only be in one mode at a time. It can't connect to the AP and simultaneously act as a secondary AP for the DS to connect to, it just isn't possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft has an experimental project called VirtualWiFi, which allows one device to connect to multiple networks at the same time, but it does that by rapidly switching between them on demand. It doesn't make a constant connection to them all, so it would be no use for routing Internet traffic over.
<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, even if you connected to the Internet via USB on the PSP, the PSP's hardware still doesn't support operating in master mode to connect to the DS. The best you will get on the PSP is Ad-Hoc, and the DS's can't get online through Ad-Hoc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is not true.
<br/>
<br/>
A wlan system can implement the state machine as defined in 802.11 for stations and accespoints on the same machine. Actually Ad-Hoc Mode  (IBSS) is a very similiar principle, where each station implements a subset of AP functions as well as the usual station functions.
<br/>
<br/>
The only real limitation is that one receiver/transmitter hardware can only be present at one channel at a time, but the number of (I)BSS on one channel is not directly limited by the protocol. (alltho limited by the  physical capacity until collisions break the channel)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
