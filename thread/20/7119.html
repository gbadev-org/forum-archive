    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Metroid Prime Hunters has been in development for a 
<br/>
really long time. This simple fact has a lot of gamers
<br/>
in a frenzy of eagerness to try it out, especially
<br/>
since the new online method of playing games
<br/>
with the DS will soon be launched.
<br/>
<br/>
I simply can't think of another online DS game that holds
<br/>
as much promise.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That thing will really be great.

You have got to be kidding. Standard single player is a must for this game, even with online multiplayer.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, is that still on the cards or have they gone for a multiplayer only game?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So many good games coming, starting in late November, it's amazing.
<br/>
If Nintendogs and Advance Wars didn't sell the system, that flood of nice stuff sure will.
<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait for Metroid, Viewtiful Joe, Mario Kart... I'm likely to try out and perhaps later purchase Animal Crossing, Sims 2 (assuming it doesn't stray too close to being story-driven... which it seems to be doing... a right shame), and American Sk8land (though the title of that one stops me from EVER wanting to purchase it).

I enormously doubt that they went multiplayer only, because they were very close to release. It would be a wast of time and money, and it would be exercising incredibly bad logic.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

you've misinterpreted me the keyword there was "standard" they originally said the single player would be various missions and that it would be linear.  In otherwords generic single player and to me not worthy of the name metroid (which is famed for its very non-linear play).  This has since changed judging by the video from pax.  The singleplayer side is indeed very metroid with all the adventureing you'd expect with visors 'n all.  It still wont be quite non linear though i think but loads better than i feared.  So yes single player has as much emphasis as multi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't worry about the single player. They recently demoed it at PAX, and it's looking good.
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a video here, not sure where it's from originally, but it actually shows single player, and the graphics are probably considerably better than you're expecting.

<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, about the movie from PAX, the game looks a lot better than the demo that came with the DS. There're a lot more effects on the screen, and the tuxtures look a lot more sharper, and less muddy. Not to mention the online play should be a blast.

Hehe. The games on the TI-83 are quite impressive. There is one that I am really amazed by, called Gemini. It is a first person shooter with textured walls and a game engine similar in play style to wolfenstein. This is running on a Z80 with no graphics acceleration.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>
