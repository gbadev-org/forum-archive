    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on finally releasing the source for DSAIM pretty soon.  I've created a sourceforge project space for it, and the code is already up on the sourceforge CVS.  I will zip the source files and also post those probably this weekend for anyone who is interested.  
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can help me fix some of the bugs.
<br/>
Also, the code may be ugly, but thats my style!

Oh, and if you like DSAIM and want to make any donation (not to me), I am taking donations for the Arthritis Foundation and running in their annual 5k race.  <a class="postlink" href="https://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=179055&amp;lis=0&amp;kntae179055=A37483783AF54BA9AF651D7B270D7FDA&amp;supId=156738017" target="_blank">https://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=179055&amp;lis=0&amp;kntae179055=A37483783AF54BA9AF651D7B270D7FDA&amp;supId=156738017</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just wanted to let you know, thanks a bunch.  I don't know if I can donate, but I'll see if I can.  Thank you for your hard work enabling us to get on AIM with our DS's; you cannot imagine how handy it is and how many people have been wowed by it.  Thank you, and hopefully someone can help clean it up and improve it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
