    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you're blowing bubbles in your cornflakes on that one.  The DS has trouble emulating a Megadrive/Genesis at full speed so considering the Amiga used funky custom chipsets as well it's very unlikely, although there is a working ST emulator.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually take a look at jEnesisDS, it runs at a pretty awesome speed for most games, the problem lies in sound, because of the chip(s) it used.

I don't know much about Amiga though, so your guess is as good/better than mine.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">don't forget the use of unusual and high (when compared to the ds) screen resolutions. Most Amiga emulators won't even run on lower end pc's never mind with sound etc. If a 1mhz 64kb C64 can't be emulated very well, then a 12mhz 2-8mb Amiga wont be.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, according to wikipedia, a Genesis/Megadrive has a 7MHz M68K and so does the Amiga 500.  I don't think that matters much though considering the amount of custom chipsets the Amiga also used.  TBH I'm just guessing the Amiga emulation is trickier as I seem to remember most Genesis emulators running a whole lot better than UAE.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
