    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">actually you have to build a bit of a hardware hack but it can be done, some cell phones come with a specialy built cable and the ability to use the phone as a "modem". using this you can find a way to connect that to the dserial and prolly find a way to get that to work, though i would think you would also need a homebrew app to tie it all together. possible yes, tedious yes, worth it, dont think so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Except, even with the DSerial, the USB port is a device, not host.. It would be equal to connecting a USB keyboard with the Cell Phone.  You'd have to go with a device that has a serial port (if that even exists on a cell phone) or create a host port for the DS, which would require external power.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some mobile phones, especially "smart" phones running Windows Mobile, have <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go" target="_blank">USB On The Go</a>, which allows a single product to act as both host and peripheral. This way, the user can attach a mini-keyboard and type out messages.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only way I can think of is to connect to the phone's modem with a computer, and then use a wireless router (attatched to the same computer) for the DS to attatch to. Any other way doesn't seem too possible, short of a special slot1 bluetooth adapter for homebrew, and I really don't see anyone going through that sort of trouble...
