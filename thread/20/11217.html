    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a thought I had. With ARDS you could potentially modify a game's multi-cart multiplayer code, such that after receiving some data from the other DS, it executes that data as code. Then just send such a packet using a WMB-like program and there you have it. :-) (Can't find a hole? Start digging...)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except for the incompatibility with new firmware. In WiFiMe2, you hijack an official game's (signed) loader to send your own (unsigned) code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

ah, i didn't think of that. when people say 'wifime2' i always assume that it will have the same result as 'wifime' -- that is, booting from a gba cart. this 'wifime2' method seems a little more complex (need a action replay, and a copy of a certain game), but it has the advantage that you might be able to install flashme without needing a flashcart, and from that point, you can just use regular WMB.exe to send your homebrews.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, if the code you hacked were designed for online play (eg hack the "connection test" in NWFC setup), then you'd gain a second advantage: standard TCP/IP (or UDP), allowing you to use any router or wireless card to send the program.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also the ability to grab the most recent FlashMe build off of a server directly.<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word. No space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, an action replay for DS will allow for WifiMe2, and somebody with some dedicated time.

Though, considering the complexity for the requirements (action replay DS, certain game the hack was made for, wireless hardware), you might aswell might be better off buying a NoPass or a real DS flashcart like DS-X maybe.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
