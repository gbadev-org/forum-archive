I hope a programmer passes by and wants to pick up the idea, i'd love to play this game on the DS. I'd then like to join the programmer and do the level graphics and gui graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope somebody is interested.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by badname on Mon Sep 26, 2005 7:34 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What you're suggesting sounds a lot like Jump super stars, but you're better off going with an original idea. Only because the licensing for this idea would be a nightmare. If you are really set on that kind of idea with non-original characters, then the DS probably isn't a good platform. There are many fan game-based forums out there for easy-to-make-game programs (like Game Maker) that would probably be more appropriate..
<br/>
<br/>
Most people on here would probably flame you for asking, heh.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">exept for the license thing I'm loving the idea.
<br/>
E.Hondo against Simon Belmont...now that would kick ass for sure
<br/>
anyways....when you just rip the sprites from "old" games(via emu for example) I'm pretty sure capcom and co would sue your butt to hell and back.
<br/>
and paying for all those licenses would make you a poor man.
<br/>
But you could search for "Free" nonpopular character sprites(done by homebrewers),ask them gently if it's possible to use their works and create something like the "Clash of the Homebrewn".
<br/>
That would be surely a great addition to DS-homebrew scene(there isn't a homebrew fighter for DS yet).
<br/>
<br/>
good luck!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thats a really cool idea. A friend of mine was working on a similar fighting game (with literally ever character from every game ever) but it never got finished. The idea of smash brothers with all the classic NES/SNES era characters sounds awesome. Nice job with the mockup, it helps a lot in getting the idea across.
<br/>
<br/>
   Dont worry about the copyright issues. Though some high profile indie games have been C&amp;Ded (cease and desist), most projects slip through the cracks. Look at Beats of Rage, which has been ported to multiple platforms (PC, Dreamcast, PS2, GP32, etc.). This game uses graphics blatently ripped from SNK games and level design from SEGAs Streets of Rage. No problem. Also, a quick look at either NewGrounds or EbamsWorld will show you tons of unlicensed indie content. 99% of these games dont even get noticed by the major companies. Even if they did send you a C&amp;D, you can just take it off the web and thats it. You will still be able to play your own game, and thats what its all about right?
<br/>
<br/>
   Anyway, I think its an awesome idea and I would be interested in helping you with programming. We would just need to rip all the graphics from the respective games and integrate them into a custom engine for the DS. I started doing this with Metal Slug as a test (using java) and I was able to get the character running, jumping and shooting in about 2 hours. Its really not that difficult. I am a pretty busy guy, so I can't guarentee anything, but I can definately help.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to make a clone of Super Smash Bros., the key is to provide a scripting system so that people can create their own characters. Then you release the game with a whole bunch of pre-1900 fairy-tale characters such as Gretel, Pinocchio, and the like (watch the <span style="font-style: italic">Shrek</span> films for inspiration but don't copy Disney or DreamWorks character designs too closely), and then have a separate project providing the copyrighted characters.

You should NOT implant a starship(*looks at your mock-up*) in a fighter.
