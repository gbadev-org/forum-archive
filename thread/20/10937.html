The only problem is that it only has the offline tracks and none of the beta ones.  I REALLY don't like using roms if I don't have to, so I would prefer to not dump my own and edit that.
<br/>
<br/>
Now it'd be REALLY great if the track list could have the working beta tracks and all the normal race tracks that aren't normally online.  I don't care about the battle courses.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure how it works, but I dont think I use the rom on Mario Kart, on the M3, I load the rom, and it uses my Mario Kart DS (Gamecart) savefile.

Either way, you can get the beta tracks by editing with a hex editor. 
<br/>
<br/>
What to edit, thats for homework, because I really dont know. Look around, it has been posted here though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
