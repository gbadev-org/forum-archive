<br/>
Oddly, I remember discussing with a friend months ago, when ninty confirmed a DS Zelda was on the way, about using the touch screen for boomerang control. Turns out much like what we were expecting.
<br/>
<br/>
I just found the in-dungeon graphics very poor, at least in the trailler. The outdoor areas looked much better (that scene in a field with a tree looked almost like a real-time 3D version of Minish Cap visual style), but the trailler dungeon looks made out of cubes with bland overly-tiled textures and no attemp at portraing some basic lighting and mood found in Minish Cap.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, I'm at a loss for words here. Except maybe "what the hell?". The video refuses to play, but by the sounds of it it's another case of "let's take some gimmicky new idea and apply it to Zelda so people will buy it even if it flops". Guiding characters and weapons with a stylus... OK, and how do we press buttons on both sides of the system while doing this with only 2 hands? And again with the cel shading. What is it with Nintendo and just plain refusing to push their systems' graphic abilities anywhere close to capacity? Are their graphic artists just overworked or lazy or what? The only real advantage cel shading provides over spoogetastic realistic graphics is being able to have really nice special effects, and Wind Waker was a very nice demonstration of how to not use this advantage. (It had a few nice ones, but most of them were just eww.)
<br/>
<br/>
OK I guess this sounds like your ordinary "wah wah cel shading sux" rant, so let's ignore that for now. WW's cel shading was the smallest reason out of quite a few I didn't like the game. Above it were poor level design (way too much sailing, "puzzles" based purely on luck, total lack of suspense), bad controls (like what the hell was with that music system requiring precise timing), and some of the dumber features of the game engine (Link's suddenly lost the ability to swim for more than a minute, wtf?). This looks like it's going to be WW on two screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Prove me wrong, please. I loved Zelda, Link to the Past, and Link's Awakening, Ocarina of Time practically made me orgasm, and Majora's Mask wasn't all that bad (and all the others, I have yet to obtain a copy of). WW was the first Zelda game I didn't enjoy. Hopefully it can be the last too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You're right, I should hold off making an opinion until I've seen more... I just really really don't like Cel-shaded Zelda. It looks nice in some cases, but it just doesn't fit the feel the games create. (And IMO, WW didn't implement it so well.) And by the look of it it looks like it's going to be a lot like WW, which as I stated, I really didn't enjoy.
<br/>
How does the drawing-things-while-playing work anyway? Do you like stop to draw something, or just use the stylus instead of the d-pad, or something weird? I guess if they could make a 'guide the character using the stylus' mechanism that doesn't suck (and I'm sure they could) you could use the d-pad as A/B/X/Y, so you can write with your right hand. Interesting idea there...
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly though, I'd love an OoT port. I've been meaning to play through it again, but I don't often play console games, simply because I have to set everything up, sit in a few specific not-very-comfortable positions (I need a recliner &lt;_&lt;), etc. A portable version would be just the push I need to actually do it.
<br/>
<br/>
And even though it'll never happen, DS having the expansion (GBA) slot, cheap medium, and wifi makes it perfect to release all the 64DD stuff they never released on N64. Oh, if only...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Geez, so much cell-shading hate. You're putting down the game too much just because it might look cartooney. If it bothers you so much, how could you stand A Link To The Past?
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I suppose you managed to watch the vieo already, since it's avaliable in at least 3 different formats all over the web, but I'll describe
<br/>
<br/>
The game looks a lot like Minish Cap, but using 3D graphics instead of 2D (but again, Minish Cap is a bit based on WW). It uses a top down perspective, slightly tilted down (much like Trace Memory/Another Code), and Link moves around like in any 2D Zelda, without need to lock-on nor camera adjustements.
<br/>
<br/>
It looks like Navi acts as a cursor, and she goes wherever you touch the screen. You can control Link himself like this, again in a way that resembles Trace Memory/Another Code.
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you simply tap nearby enemies with the stylus to attack, so there's no need to use any buttons at all in stylus control mode (and a d-pad+buttons seems totally possible). Seems that it's possible to switching items, opening the inventory and acessing the map all using the touch screen, so they're working into making it possible to play the whole thing without having to switch to the buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward this game, if only because the preliminar touch controls show lots of potential, if done right. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's being done by the WW team, so WW haters run away in disgust as they want. At least their director openly admited WW was flawed in interviews, admiting their own mistakes. That's one step into correcting problems and creating a better product.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This looks good.
<br/>
I like the graphics in here. They managed to make something that stands out a bit without straining the system's limited hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm excited, now!
<br/>
<br/>
I was looking forward to something sort of like the N64 version, though. Oh, well...
<br/>
Further reason why they should have done the full 3d thing with Mario64 DS layout is because, as said earlier, the bottom scren Should Not be used for pretty graphics. It doesn't look quite as nice as the top one anyway, and for many people, it has many marks from the stylus, so it looks even less crisp. Since they have heavy stylus use, the gameplay may encounter problems when the player can't see what they are doing.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides... this looks like a perspective view camera, does it not?
<br/>
So why can't they have all the Diabloish stuff going on with the map on the bottom screen, while drawing all the fancy 3d stuff on the top?
<br/>
Doesn't make sense to me...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Woohoo! Passable :)
<br/>
Heh... I couldn't find anything worse, oddly enough. Anyway, you probably get my point. We've all seen what happens with games that push their platform too hard.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
60 Frames / Second and sharp, smooth, unachieving graphics are far superior to 20 FPS jagged, mucky, and relatively spectacular (but realistically awful) graphics.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

For making absolutely no sense, I'm surprised how common this argument is. LTTP was a SNES game. It had a top-down view and the characters were 16x16 pixels. Most of the graphics were in fact very detailed, and quite realistic for a SNES game. The only thing that really looked like WW at all was Link, and he was just too small to notice it. Compared to WW, where Link is a large 3D model, and the game is running on a Gamecube, it's quite a difference. A SNES game that looks like it's running on a SNES is fine. A Gamecube game that looks like it's running on a SNES (save for being 3D) is different. Cel shading works in 2D and in silly games. Zelda doesn't have that 'silly' feeling to it.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I didn't think LTTP looked even remotely similar to WW. It's actually pretty realistic for a SNES game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think when people say that they are more refering to the enemys and such were all cartoon like.

eg. Gannon was a Pig.

The main good news about this game, imo, is that they fixed the main problem with Wind Waker; The long borring sailing bits.

I find this great, wheres the bitching about 4 swords??? was that not a GC game with SNES gfx, yet no biching about that, you know if you want things to just look good, just stick with the movie scene, I prefer to PLAY my games, and the only thing that was a hassle with WW was the long boat rides, but that just goes to show u that u need to pay attention in the games to get that warping song, other then that it had everything zelda was,  Puzzles, annoying enemies, secrets, twisting plot, and some mediocre comedy to it.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

i didn't mind the long boat rides too much...gives you a couple of minutes for a toilet break or to get some food without pausing

i kinda said it in my last post, but in regards to WW, although the graphics were cartoony, the actual game engine and effects they could pull off with it were very nice, and i don't think many would have been possible with a more demanding graphics style

<br/>
either way, i'll be getting the game no matter how it plays...after all, its not how good it looks, but how good it plays (looks sometimes help tho)

I'm pretty sure Master Quest was the add-on.  All it was ever supposed to be I think was a remix of the game.

<br/>
<br/>
Although, actually, it is possible they originally planned to 'remix' the overworld too, in a Zelda 1 Second Quest kind of way like they did with the dungeons.  Anyway, no way of knowing for sure now at this point. :)  Also, since I"m talking about it, I'd guess that if it was possible to load a new 'quest data' for the game like that, that maybe that's why that so called 'beta quest' code exists.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Exactly. The N64 version looked awesome, the early screenshots and videos were just HOLY CRAP, and then they did a complete 180. That was probably the biggest problem, really.

Are you kidding? The original SMW looks like crap compared to what some hacks have:

These hacks use 4BPP graphics rather than the 3BPP Nintendo used. True that means using more ROM space, but I doubt they couldn't have squeezed it in. There's also plenty of Super Mario Bros hacks that have way better graphics than the original without having any effect on ROM size, memory consumption or game performance. Nintendo just used really simple graphics for no apparent reason. And they do this almost every time!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1. Theyre not doing anything without a reason... thats no japanese philosophie its western.
<br/>
2. There 2 kinds of ways to immerse in a game. One is through "reality" graphics, that btw arent like reality whatsoever, and physic simulations, those arent like reality neither. The hardware is simply not powerful enough, best thing they can do is still comic-like.
<br/>
The second one is through your imagination and phantasie, which is quite powerful because it is nearly limitless. But today where the kids of the 80s and 90s grew up and gave the flame of "read 3 books at all" to the next gen, a couple of people dont even understand the pure concept of high detailed graphics in your head and not on the screen anymore.
<br/>
I wont say that neither the one nor the other ist the better way.
<br/>
It is simply not possible to compare those ways on the same level.
<br/>
As Hitchcock said, "...nothing is as scary a a closed door." You can have all the finest textures and physics you want in your imagination.
<br/>
It was enough to you when you where young and played with action dolls or matchbox cars... those arent "realistic" in anyway but you loved them because they became real in your head.
<br/>
If better and better effects are needed to let you slip into a game universe you should think about where you are going...<br/>_________________<br/>Marine, we need you to head to the depths of the compound to rescue a scientist that is being held hostage by Satan and his manyfold minions.

Here's your pistol and eight rounds of ammunition. Good luck.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Less polygons, at least in WW's case.

Does it?  I can't say noticed, if it does.  What I did notice was the positive aspects of the game's art style, such as the smooth detailed animation. ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, Id say those hacks look mostly worse :-/
<br/>
If you havnt got the colours to do smooth gradients, dont try is what I say :p
<br/>
And so what if people can make the background ripple..theres plenty of rippling in mario, Nintendo knew how to do it, but they didnt do it for the background because it was pointless.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo wanted a smooth consistant style for Mario World, and they did it.
<br/>
None of those hacks help the game.
<br/>
<br/>
If Nintendo built a game from the ground up to have more detail, they would do it with a style in mind; aka Yoshi's island.

umm...I don't think I believe this.
<br/>
The edges in TWW where very very smooth.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, low polygons are highlighted even worse in cellshadeing because you get a Jared gradient of light/dark rather then a smooth one.

Mario World was a release day game, it probably was an extreamly tight squeeze already.
<br/>
Remember, in these days space was always a premium.
<br/>
<br/>
You can look to stuff like Yoshi's Island to see more advanced nintendo platforming graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo push graphics all the time for their systems specs.
<br/>
What they dont push is realism.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
