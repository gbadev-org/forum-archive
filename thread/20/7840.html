    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My new DS's touchscreen is very inaccurate, but only for homebrew. If I load up a drawing app, such as flipbook, and draw around the edges of the screen, the box that I get on the screen is smaller than the screen. The edges of the drawn box are about 1 cm from the screen's edges.... I did not have this problem with my first DS. Is there anything I can do to fix this? (touchscreen calibration in the DS's system settings doesn't help)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i think you have to wait for a newer version of this homebrew.
<br/>
If its possible, test it on a other DS, perhaps its becaus of your ds!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The current homebrew implementation of the touchscreen code does not work with screen protectors. Try to remove it. It should work.
