    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just a thought, but if a suitable WiFi hotspot isn't available it would be nice if 'net access (via DSLinux, Opera, etc) could be gained via a mobile phone. Interfacing it to the DS would presumably be a problem, but how about the software interface side of things, would that be difficult to achive?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's good, so I guess all we now need is for someone enterprising and smart to create some kind of generic interface, perhaps with a separate adaptor for the more popular mobile phones? (that way only one interface will need be made with a cheap adaptor each of the various mobile phones).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm surprised that nothing has yet been developed for bluetooth and mobile phones, or is that because most DS owners rely on WiFi hotspots?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nothing has been developed for bluetooth, because bluetooth adaptors with serial interfaces are still pretty dang expensive. I found one for $60, the rest are over $150. Sure, there are USB ones for much cheaper, but then you have to add the complexity of interfacing USB with the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using the DSCart as a Serial Interface one can do all sorts of crazy things. Like a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2006/07/10/smile-for-the-ds-lite-camera/" target="_blank">Camara</a>, for instance. 
<br/>
<br/>
You could also have some other external functions, such as a USB Adapter, an Ethernet port, or anything you can get your hands, some skill and a solder to do. 
<br/>
<br/>
Natrium42 was/is developing a Serial Interface that goes on the DSCart and can be used for stuff that has/n't been developed (For the record, I havent checked his site since I last saw the thread here)[/url]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But the DS can't even do blue, let alone Bluetooth. Even Brain Age fails it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
