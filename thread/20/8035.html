<br/>
<br/>
I've been recently trying to find a decent video codec for my DS to watch my music clips. I tried dpgtest for DS and Meteo for GBA, but they just make the console lock up when I try to launch them.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know of any good free homebrew codecs I can use?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think, maybe, thats not quite right. I don't understand the laws all that well, but I know that writing an MPEG4 decoder is not against the law in any country. Maybe selling it without having the legal requirements yes, but not free and opensource.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i dont beleive it cost anything to decode mpeg4 but it does infringe when you write a codec that encodes using them iirc.  at least thats why the divx codec is free but you have to pay to make divx (same with winamp pro for example and mp3s).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm pretty sure its for sale... I think Majesco bought their codec for the GBA videos!

They fit Shrek 2 on one cart O_O

<br/>
Also they fit Shrek + Shark Tale on one cart!!!

But I suspect bank switching on that one... I'm tempted to buy them and find out how small they compressed those movies...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The law defining patent infringement in the United States and other parties to the major patent treaties doesn't have a blanket exemption for non-commercial use or distribution.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The method of decoding MPEG4 is not a problem - its only a problem if you use existing code that the patent covers. As far as I know, things like VLC were created from the ground up with original code. Although I don't really know enough to back anything up - I'd say that if all the companies mentioned on their Partners page are involved with the project then there is legality here... do you think IBM would be involved with a project thats illegal? AT&amp;T? I doubt it.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this actually has nothing at all to do with what was mentioned. Creating an MPEG4 decoder in a similar way to Moonshell DPG files shouldn't actually be very hard. The core decoder libs should compile almost right away for ARM with small changes. I wish I was better at coding, I'd do it my self... best I did was get it 75% there but in the end the more complex parts that needed tweaking defeated me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You claim that patent encumbrance propagates only by copying. This is true of copyrights but <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> of patents. A patent on an invention prohibits the use of that invention by third parties even if the other party independently invents the same invention.

Last time someone tried to compile an MPEG-4 decoder from source code on a Nintendo handheld platform, it got literally two frames per second.

<br/>
Contrary to popular belief, MPEG-4 is far from open. If more than 50 thousand people download your decoder, you need to pay $0.25 per download. Oh, and there is a vague $0.02 fee per <span style="font-weight: bold">hour</span> of content/software usage, that is so absurd there aren't proper ways to charge for it.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone should try writing a VP3 decoder. That's fully open-source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In terms of rate/distortion curve (neglecting computational complexity), H.264 (also called MPEG-4 Part 10 or AVC) is currently the best standardized codec, and the best open source codec is Theora.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
