    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lately, my DS Lite just sat on the shelf, collecting dust (no interesting games in the past month), but now that Pokemon is out, I decided to use it again.
<br/>
But unfortunately, I saw a lot of dust got caught between the white and transparent plastic. Before buying a tri-wing screwdriver, I want to ask:
<br/>
<br/>
If I open the DS up, can I separate the transparent plastic from the white plastic in order to clean them? Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hope this bit of info helps..<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.

<br/>
Right. Out of Adhesive or lock in, I'd say Lock in. If it was adhesive, you'd probably be able to see blobs of it, looking through the top layer of clear plastic, between the layers. Kinda hard to explain.
<br/>
<br/>
I remember someone else enquired about this a while ago too. Can't find the post though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's definitely lock-in. I had to get my DS Lite replaced (and lo and behold, Nintendo sends me the crappiest Lite ever), and the outer plastic cover is pretty loose on the new one. I could literally just jam something between it and easily get any loose dirt/dust out of there. It easily snaps back into place, but a relatively unused DS Lite might not snap out so easily.<br/>_________________<br/>Butt Monkeys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
