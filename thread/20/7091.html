    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Man, I really could slap Dark Fader for releasing his "virus" thingy. I know this was my first post, but everyone has a first time and I'm just not the talker kind of guy. I find it really sad that you are suspecting me of this, but on the other hand I understand this fear. Perhaps some of you know me from IRC, we once had a lively discussion about this virus-thing and I am strongly against it, even against using it on pirates and I sort of feared that a thing like this would happen.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how I can assure you that this is for real other than begging you to trust me and to ask yourself why the hell I would make a thing like that up. Would I spend hours to design a fake screenshot and homepage? So please, if anyone tried this, please post a message confirming that this is virus-free so that no one is afraid of downloading this anymore. It's really a funny program - not only for me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
Make the keyboard fit 100% width of the DS screen instead of having margins on the right and left edges. More/bigger keys.
<br/>
<br/>
Fix touching between two keys causing a nasty sound since it can't decide which key to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Multi sample memory and selection menu on the top screen. Record up to say 5 samples and use arrow keys to toggle between them.
<br/>
<br/>
Fun settings/effects to mess with that affect the sound. Ex: Pitch slider using touch screen, oscillation/envelope/cut off/pitch knobs like on synths,
<br/>
reverb/chorus effects, anything else you can think of. I would be the last person that would know anything about actually implementing any of these though.
<br/>
<br/>
Demo button! (Plays a catchy tune a la Casio keyboards)
<br/>
<br/>
Possibly a TB303 emulator or drum machine?
<br/>
<br/>
Built-in high quality samples of real instruments.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Chuckster: Thanks for all the cool suggestions! I think I can do some of the tings you mentioned.
<br/>
<br/>
Making the keyboard broader would be a bit hard since I display it using tiles which fixes me to a key width divisible by eight pixels. I was thinking about displaying two keyboards above each other, so you can play four octaves. Then, I would perhaps use the first octave to pich the sample down.
<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking of including pre-made samples, but I don't know where to get freely distributable ones. I don't know how legitimate it is to just rip them from XMs. Any hints?
<br/>
<br/>
I will work on input stability. The jumping between two notes will decrease when I sacrifice the sliding feature, but I kind of like it, so I think I'll see what I can do.
<br/>
<br/>
And effects would be cool! I never thought of that. Stuff like echo and lowpass should also be easy to implement.
<br/>
<br/>
So thanks again for the great feedback, expect a new release soon!

JaJa: Yes, I store the sound in a buffer. The different notes are just different frequencies at which the sound is played back. You don't even need to modify the sound since you can give the DS your desired playback rate directly. This makes it very easy and efficient.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
For some reason the recording sound a little glitchy, and having seen this kind of thing before it sounds as if you're not disabling iterrupts while recording your sound.  Since reading the mic is very timing dependant, this may well make it sound cleaner.
<br/>
<br/>
Although it could well be just the poor mic in the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps there could be a feature to trim the start and end of the sample, so you can record stuff and trim silence from the beginning.
<br/>
<br/>
Great job though!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Hey, thanks very much, especially for your suggestions!
<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in improving the microphone quality. In the beginning I had serious static in the recorded sound but I somehow (really, I don't know what I changed) fixed this.
<br/>
I am currently not disabling any interrupts when recording, unless libnds does this implicitly, but I don't think so. Which interrupts do you mean specifically? I think everything that stays on the arm9 should be fine, since the arm7 does the recording. On the arm7, I have the timer0 interrupt that is called on every sample and the vblank that is used to handle input. I tried disabling vblank when recording, but the quality of the sound did not change, so I think the vblank is no threat to timing.
<br/>
Or did I miss something, perhaps other interrupts? Do you know a demo program with better recording quality?
<br/>
<br/>
I will definitely try to do silence cropping, that's a cool idea. I just have to think of a way to detect the beginning of the actual sound in the messy output from the mic.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are the frequency values arbitary or are they from a particular source?

<br/>
No, I just picked random numbers and they turned out to be note frequencies :-). No, just kidding. There is in fact a pattern, but it may be hard to spot if you don't know about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Say you have a sample of some instrument playing a C-0. If you want to pitch it one octave higher, you have to double the playback frequency. And the logical cosequence is, since an octave has twelve notes (halfnotes included), that you can pitch it by one note by multiplying it by the twelvth root of two (2^(1/12)). So, it you have a note, and you pitch it up by twelve notes, you multiply it by [2^(1/12)]^12=2. Got it?
<br/>
<br/>
That's the way note frequency tables are calculated. So, the numbers in the note table are powers of the original note frequency with the fractional part cut off (a little skew doesn't matter).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Cheers. Once i knew what i was looking for i found a table on google with the lower frequencies.

How comes you code ARM7 code compiles on devkitpro 16a, but doublec's doesn't?
<br/>
<br/>
I found the value in the microphone demo, but it doesn't compile, so that's a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to change the freqencies in your app anyway. I prefer the lower spectrum end.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Do you mind if i use some (*most*) of the code?

I just need to remove the keyboard code and change the backgrounds and it's pretty much done. Will support 4 "voices" and unaltered "voice".

<br/>
The pattern that you go on to describe is called <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament" target="_blank">equal temperament</a>, and it's not the only way to tune an instrument. First, there was <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation" target="_blank">just intonation</a>, based on integer ratios of frequencies (such as 3/2 for a fifth and 5/4 for a major third), but it produced dissonant <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_interval" target="_blank">wolf intervals</a> between some pairs of scale degrees, especially in keys other than the one that the instrument was tuned for. Later improvements led to meantone temperament and then equal temperament, which were compromises that spread tuning error over all the intervals. But nowadays, computers can switch tunings based on the root of the current chord, as used by Wendy Carlos on <span style="font-style: italic">Beauty in the Beast</span> (1986). But most consumer synthesizers don't bother with this, and they continue to tune everything in equal temperament, leaving the minor third a bit flat of just and the major third a bit sharp of just.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well, my code compiles because I rewrote doublec's code using the microphone functions which are now built into libnds. I first tried porting doublec's code but ended up with messy code that did nothing.

<br/>
The program is GPL, so of course I don't mind if you use the code in your own project as long as you release the source youself.
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote my own little image converter that I will eventually release. But it's really not that much/complicated code. About the image dimensions: There are two backgrounds that each fill their respecive screen and the keyboard is 28x5 tiles.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It works on my M3 CF with firmware E15 and E16.  It doesn't display as intended though, for one thing it has a purple background but if I hadn't tried it with WMB, I wouldn't know it was an error.
