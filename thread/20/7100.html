You must have a Homebrew capable NDS (GBA cart and FlashMe or similar), and a Nintendogs game cartridge.
<br/>
<br/>
The Trainer runs on the NDS and edits the game save from the game cart (run trainer, tweek attributes, run game)

No. It deletes only the save data, not everything on the game cart.
<br/>
<br/>
If you'd want to use it as a flash cart, you'd be limited to 2Mbit = 0.25Mbyte (the size that is normally available for the savegame of Nintendogs) worth of programs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can do a heck of a lot in 256 kilobytes. For instance, Tetanus On Drugs is only 160 kilobytes. Heck, Super Mario Bros. is only 40 kilobytes.

<br/>
To each-his-own. When you get tired of walking the dog looking for rare items, you may want to try the Trainer (cheating on the game, but saving so much of your valuable time).
<br/>
If you have a game-save backup utility or an SRAM GBA cart, you can backup your old data so it is safe.
<br/>
<br/>
Check the item list ~100 objects and ~64 collars/hats -- you probably missed the really cool ones. Very tempting isn't it ;-&gt;
<br/>

<br/>
re: using game-save flash for code (unlikely)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: This thread is about a specific homebrew app (for Nintendogs owners). It runs like all the other homebrew apps. Nothing special
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But can you use some bug in the game's save data handling to buffer-overflow the game code and start homebrew code that way? 
<br/>
Possible, but IMHO unlikely. Would require disassembling and analyzing the Nintendogs code itself (which I haven't done). There is a chance you could find an exploit, but considering the save data is data not code it is probably very unlikely you will find a truely useful "exploit"
<br/>
However we don't need to find yet another way to launch homebrew. We already have PassMe, WifiMe and FlashMe to kickstart the launch of a GBA cart.
<br/>
The initial setup of a "Homebrew NDS" can be complicated (and not inexpensive). Finding an exploit in any game would be a great achievement - however of little interest (and way off topic) for those people that already have a homebrew NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't run homebrew code, but have another NDS gamesave program, please post or email me details. A PC version may be written, but it can't work without hardware that will save NDS game-saves.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Considering that TIFF headers are data not code it is probably very unlikely that PSP crackers would find a truly useful exploit in the 2.0 firmware. But then someone went and made Hello World for 2.0 firmware, and within less than a week, there was a downgrader for the PSP to load 1.5 on a 2.0 machine. (Six days later, son? released PSP firmware 2.01, which fixes a few buffer overflows in the photo app.)

On a red DS? The more ways there are to start FlashMe, the better.

And besides, won't any cheap SPI adapter let a PC program read and write Nintendo DS save hardware, which uses SPI at the physical layer?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If you have any suggestions for improvements - please let me know (post here or send email)

IMHO: There isn't much more you can do with the game save (perhaps adjust the moods, walking speed/endurance etc - but that's stuff you should do yourself by playing with the virtual dog).

I noticed that after I had posted my free (homebrew) app. Otherwise I would have picked a more distinctive name.

Looks like a game save restore (ALA "action replay"). If someone gets one, a review would be appreciated

The Trainer does extra-careful (over anal) checking before starting. It turns out the backup copy isn't always a perfect mirror.

No, that's not the problem.
<br/>
It is a more technical problem, unrelated to your cheating habits ;-&gt;
<br/>
Background: The Nintendogs save has room for two full copies of the data. Sometimes they are exactly the same, sometimes they aren't -- it appears to be random. I don't know the exact logic the game uses, so my check is overly safe.
<br/>
Please send me your backup and I'll make the program more flexible.

Nice one DSPet, havent tried them myself but being one of the first DS trainers (and even beating the commercial one to market) it is quite sweet what you can do to your dogz. All I need to do is make a way to convert a DS save back to a compressed save and etool should be able to restore the hacked save (it does a backup of the entire save wrather than just part of the data) - although I have had one report of a NDogs save being too large to fit compressed (Im guessing the voice commands it saves wind up taking alot of space and cant be too well compressed)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

&gt; Savegame editor != Trainer.
<br/>
Generally true.
<br/>
This app is a Dog Trainer (in the english sense of the word - what it does) implemented as a game save editor (in the geeky sense of the phrase - how it does it)

You can debate whether the Geeky definition of "Trainer" applies in this case (since the NDS doesn't have true background processes) -- but that would be a waste of time ;-&gt;
<br/>
[BTW: the commercial game that calls itself the Nintendogs Dog Trainer is a game save restorer]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The good news is, I was able to import my two dogs to my girlfriend's Nintendogs cart using only one cart. I shuffled around the cart and GBAMP between two DSes to get it right! Glad I remembered to back up my save right before handing over the game :)

I figured out how to use this trainer with an Action Replay.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if this is already known, but yeah here's how:
<br/>
<br/>
Start off just like the Animal Crossing trainer by backing up your game, decompressing it. Now, take the decompressed file and change the file type from .DUC to .DSS, load it into the trainer, do whatever you want to do, Final Save, change the file type from .DSS back to .DUC, compress, restore, done! :)<br/>_________________<br/>TEMP SIG SPACE LOL.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">BTW: you don't have to rename the file, just type in "*.DUC" to the filename open dialog, then pick the DUC save.
<br/>
Un-Compress and Re-compress as described in the AC:WW page <a href="http://www.aibohack.com/nds/arhelp.htm" target="_blank">http://www.aibohack.com/nds/arhelp.htm</a>
<br/>
(Backup, uncompress -- edit -- then compress and restore)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How does this work exactly? Is it just a GBA cart and a form of PassMe2?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
