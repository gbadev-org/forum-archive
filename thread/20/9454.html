    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As posted in another thread, I managed to get Moonshell version 0.2+9 (Moonshell111_full) working on my DS with my M3 Mini SD version.
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen a few threads that mention there is either a 
<br/>
- specific Moonshell version for the M3 Mini SD version, or
<br/>
- I should install Moonshell with certain specific options for use with the M3 Mini SD version
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a specific version I should use?
<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that Moonshell version 0.2+9 is actually the right version, as I got it to work, although not completely to my satisfaction.
<br/>
<br/>
After using the setup for Moonshel111_full (called version 0.2+9 in the readme) I copied an episode of Smallville to my mini SD card (in .dpg format) as well as 2 mp3-files.
<br/>
<br/>
I can play all of these three files without any problems and with VERY good quality.
<br/>
So far, I was happy.
<br/>
<br/>
When I decide to erase the two mp3 files (using my cardreader) and put two other mp3 files on the mini SD card, my DS still shows the 'old' two mp3 files, and does NOT show the new ones.
<br/>
<br/>
The only way I can get it to accept new files, so far, is to reformat my mini SD card, reinstall Moonshell, and copy new files to my mini SD card.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't imagine that it is supposed to work like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone shed some light on what I am doing wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
Any help is greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm sorry, that was apparently for the 'slim' M3 SD version.  I guess they are different?  I use the CF version anyway, so I'm not totally sure.

Yah, the Readme is probably just way outdated.  I've noticed that on other MoonShell releases.  Check MoonShell's about window for the real version number.

Sounds like some kind of a problem with the filesystem on your SD card.  I assume you are using something on your PC to write to the card?  One thing you could try to make certain all the file is being written is to (with recentish XP versions anyway) right click on the little icon that appears in the task bar with the green arrow on it.  Should appear when you insert the SD reader into your computer (assuming it's USB and it probably is).  Then choose 'Safely Remove Hardware' and let the computer remove it, then take it out of the reader.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it'd be MoonShell screwing it up as MoonShell isn't writing anything to the SD card so it shouldn't be messing with the filesystem.  Do you have another SD card or card reader you could try?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

v1.2 final beta2 works just fine. Just run it with START button and not with A.
<br/>
<br/>
v1.11 has old Readme files. The latest release has up to date readme file (in english).
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if the video playback is much better in v1.11 than with the latest v1.2 RC2?<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
