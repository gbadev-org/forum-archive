    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, I must express my thanks to the developer of this great program. It's extremely simple to use and fast working. Now I can finally backup all of my games in case any gets lost or somehow lose their save data.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the problem I'm having. I'm trying to dump my Pokemon Diamond save from my actual game and it seems to be only dumping the backup (secondary) save. For those who don't already know, Pokemon Diamond/Pearl saves two saves just in case the primary save gets corrupt in any way. That way, it can use the last save it has backed up to restore the game.
<br/>
<br/>
When I initiate the dumping of the save, it immediately tells me it's sending a Type 3 file with the size of 262144 bytes. My friend, however, is able to extract a Type 3 file with the size of 524288 bytes.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using NetCat for Windows as the server and v1.1a of SavSender. I'm using this on an R4 v1.11 with a 1GB Kingston Japanese made Micro SD card. I've exhausted many different options with no avail. I've come to believe it's the actual game itself. It MIGHT be the version of SavSender although I can't be sure. I don't know what exactly is telling the game to extract the backup rather than the primary save.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any help or knows how to get in contact with the developer of SavSender (trust me.. I've looked high and low) it would be immensely appreciated. I just want to know why it's doing what it's doing and possibly a way to fix it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The developer, here. :)  Sorry, I've been out of the DS dev scene for a while, mainly because I left my DS and R4 in the seat pocket of an airplane. :(
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, TBH, I have no idea why SavSender would be doing that.  I'm making use of EEPROM reading code that someone else wrote, and to be quite frank, I have no idea how or why it works the way it does.  Sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I do try to keep up with the comments on the SavSender page, so that's the first route if you have a question (and if you get really lucky, someone else might have an answer for ya :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah! Thanks a lot for the reply! I came back here not expecting anything new but I'm glad you did.
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to test the hell out of this to figure out what exactly is the problem. I still think it's the game itself for some reason. When a friend comes over with his copy of the game, I'll test it out and post the info here (not that it matters). I mean, it's frustrating that everyone else's seems to work fine yet mine does this but I can just save twice, dump the save, and convert to 512KB and it works.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, sorry about your loss. I know exactly how discouraging that is. I lost $100 and my $300 camera in July but I think losing a DS is worse, especially if you develop on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
