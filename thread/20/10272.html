    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How can something be less complicated than Go? :P
<br/>
Go is undoubtedly the simplest game I have ever played, which is why it's so incredible that it has all that strategy involved. (The first time I played, I was afraid that I was missing some really important rules, but I wasn't!).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, looks like this would be a fine port!
<br/>
If you are interested in learning DS programming and already have some experience with other stuff, I would recommend you grab a copy of PALib and try it yourself!
<br/>
It's a good starting project because there isn't much there to taunt the developer into messing with graphics for the whole time.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't even really need palib; you can just use the touch screen, filled with consolePrintf '+' characters for the grid of 19x19 intersections, and then add O and X for the two players. But you may really need to make a wireless mode because Go AI is still in its infancy.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before there was the DS I had an idea that I tought was just a dream that will never come true. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was wishing Settlers for the Game Boy Advance. 
<br/>
Time pass and then came the DS and this same idea came to in my mind again, but after watching/seeing what games companies make for the DS I had to loose the hope to get that awesome game for DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now few days ago I read that Settlers II is coming for DS, I tought that it must be some homebrew game, but no! It's from BlueByte, wohoo! I hope it's as playable as with PC. I hope the game is not turn based, so maybe it's time critical like the PC version.
<br/>
<br/>
Settlers has always been my favorite game. No newer games has exited me so much. The best versions in my opinnion were 1, 2, 3 and 4.. and are still.
<br/>
<br/>
If it's true that it's working game, then I must plug the charger to my DS while playing as it will take hours. I wonder what my gf will say. Maybe she will give me some [s]head[/s] sweet while I'm playing, or something. ;)<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
