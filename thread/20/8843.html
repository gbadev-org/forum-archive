With some help from a friend I've finally discovered why WEP wasn't working in my lib! Needless to say, WEP will be correctly working in the next release. Speaking of next releases, I'm nearly complete with DNS and TCP, so I'm going to try to release something in 2 days (that's Saturday) with DNS, TCP, WEP, and maybe even DHCP (depends on how little time I waste being lazy). There are some other more subtle improvements coming in this release too, I'm sure you'll all appreciate it :)
<br/>
Also, since this friend has been working on reverse engineering the wifi chipset further than I have, I'll be integrating a number of his findings into my documentation soon, which will give some insight into some of the presently undocumented hardware and will clarify a number of areas that are presently somewhat documented. Keep watching for updates, though, idling in #dswifi on EFnet is a better way to know instantly when I have actually released something ;)

Nah, not really if you posted that as a response to the school wifi post I made. 
<br/>
<br/>
They force DHCP, which means I just cant assign my IP since it might already be taken, however I tried forcing it to my laptops and it seemed to work for a few secs before dropping. 
<br/>
<br/>
I dont think the school net uses captive portals, because i dont need to see any webpage or anything, I just select the AP and thats it. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of APs, my laptop sees 1 access point called "UTM", however, the DS goes crazy and sees around 20, all named UTM, some with high signal an others with near-zero, or zero. I usually select the highest signal one, but whats up with that? I dont think the school has 20 routers (2, maybe 4, but 20?) so any idea?

Yes, in this case the school *does* have 20 :)

Mainly because my system sniffs unique APs rather than just showing seperate networks :)

my system presently just sniffs the beacons and doesn't combine APs, so you see all of them.

Sheesh, there are still people who think the wifi sniffer was part of ds2key? (-sigh-)

<br/>
and, it picks up DSes connected to WFC? well, it'll pick up a DS hosting a game, and it'll pick up a Nintendo USB stick, but I seriously doubt it'll pick up a DS connected to WFC.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Regarding NDS as AP...
<br/>
<br/>
When a NDS connects to the AP, does it turn into an AP named after the AP it was connected to?
<br/>
<br/>
(If NDS1 connects to UTM, will NDS2 see it as UTM as well?)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Stephen, I cant belive people think DS2Key (or PointyRemote) made the AP sniffer :P
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I guess everything explains itself now, there are probably several APs at my campus spread all around, and the DS picks up <span style="font-weight: bold">Laptops</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">other devices</span> (such as the NDS or PSP) as APs. 
<br/>
<br/>
The reason for the bolding, is because I dont belive there are 20 Nintendo DS and/or PSPs in my school. (So far I've seen 4 NDS and 0 PSPs, and out of those 4 NDS, one is mine, another is a friend's who never turns it on, and the other 2 could be picked up as APs)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, it does pick up pictochatting DSs (regardless of what it looks like, one of the DSs *is* hosting the game)
<br/>
<br/>
No, when a NDS connects to an AP, it does not turn into an AP (the only thing my sniffer is picking up is beacons, which are only sent by a station attempting to have other stations connect to it)
<br/>
<br/>
the DS will pick up a laptop or other device if: the laptop is configured to use an ad-hoc network and has been sending beacons. (some network cards do this even when they are connected to an AP, very odd)
<br/>
<br/>
however, the system as is will *not* pick up any devices connected to an AP as being one of those APs, it will *only* pick up devices that are acting as an AP, in transmitting beacons.
<br/>
(well, actually the 802.11 standard does allow for devices connected to an AP to send beacons for that AP too, hmm - I'll check my code on that one though because I don't think it will pick up the other devices as APs.)

As usual, if it doesn't work, prepend a loader.... I'm not sure why the ndstool loader screws up so bad for so many people :(

Ok, well - In case you hadn't noticed I haven't released an updated lib yet. As it stands, I spent too much time doing other things, and am pretty well booked for the next few days as well. I have made a lot of progress, but I'm not ready to release it yet, so well, hang around and it'll be ready before long (next weekend perhaps? Agh! I'm setting deadlines again -_-)
