A media dock for the DS that accepts your own cards! It's also much cheaper. This looks much better than the HDD.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The page does not contain the word "Launcher", so where do you infer that? I'm guessing that this product is a MAX Media Launcher and Memory Stick reader in one, for people who have realized that there really isn't **** for commercial games or UMD movies on PSP. But if it works by itself, and can boot homebrew from the Memory Stick without the presence of a MAX Media Player, then it's the equivalent of MK4mini.

It's too bad that unlike in a Best Buy store, bestbuy.com doesn't let me turn the box around.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

You do not need the HDD. Bestbuy just has their description messed up. I think they meant to say like the HDD or an alternative to. If you want more clarity on it visit the offical page on the datel website here: <a href="http://us.codejunkies.com/shop/product.asp...&amp;l=1&amp;ProdID=750" target="_blank">http://us.codejunkies.com/shop/product.asp...&amp;l=1&amp;ProdID=750</a>
<br/>
Also, the 'memory cards' are just CF cards. Up to 8 gigs can be used. It's basically a DS cart version of the HDD.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It sounds to me like it's <span style="font-style: italic">compatible</span> with the HD. "Media Player Browser" could refer to the file browser on the card, since it's a browser that plays media. I'm assuming it can also copy to and from the HD.
<br/>
<br/>
If it really is just a memory stick reader that still requires the HD, then 60 bucks is ridiculous. But then the HD was also priced around $ridiculous, so...<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How much would a NoPass, a GBAMP, and a 4 GB Microdrive cost separately? I see Microdrive alone for $150. In addition, Datel's product is made so that it wraps around SLOT-2 of a DS much as a PassKey2 wraps around SLOT-1.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I missed the link in the DSLinux thread, and so was going by images on the Datel website.

It's certainly interesting.

I'd much prefer to have a MAX Media Launcher and a GBAMP though, rather than that thing sticking out of the top of the DS.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Are there two complete different devices with the same name? One going into Slot-1 and one into Slot-2 ?

The CF holder is really nice, but it won't boot up for me...  I get the Datel splash screen, and then a white screen afterwards.  If I use the passcart with my SuperCard CF, it boots directly into the Supercard browser no problem.

I will try changing the folder setup on the CF card and see if I can get the Datel browser to work.<br/>_________________<br/>Go Go Gadget NDS!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
