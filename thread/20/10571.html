    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey there. I just flashed my DS Lite and now I want to get started putting music and movies on it. I am, however, a bit overwhelmed by all the alternatives and possibilities. So I was wondering if one of you could fill me in on what to do.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a DS lite and an M3 mini SD with a 1gb Kingston mini.
<br/>
Right now there's nothing installed on the M3.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a Neon Genesis Evangelion (Japanese series) DVD box, and it'd seem cool to have that on my Lite. Now, is this possible?
<br/>
<br/>
- What size is one DVD with about 150 minutes worth of movie when it's transformed into whatever the best format is?
<br/>
- What do I use extract the movie from my DVD and transform it into the right format? Would it be possible to include subtitles to my episode files?
<br/>
- And lastly, what do I use to play this (and other media)? As I understand it now, Moonshell is pretty much the best music player around, right?  Is it best for video's too, though?
<br/>
<br/>
As you might have gathered, I know absolutely nothing about video and all that's related to anything besides just watching it. So if you don't feel like getting me started, at least let me know if what I want is possible. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, 
<br/>
Ciao</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure exactly how big the file would be, but by my estimate, it'd probably be &lt; 500 MB.  This is just a guess, don't hold me to it.
<br/>
<br/>
You're probably going to want to convert the files into dpg format, since that is what Moonshell plays.  IMHO DSOrganize is a better music player since it doesn't have problems with skipping as much, but they both are pretty much equal.
<br/>
<br/>
DVD ripping might be considered piracy so I'd have to get clearance before I can explain that, but remember, google is your friend.  For converting movie files to dpg, use <a class="postlink" href="http://ls5.cydonianknight.com/?Download" target="_blank">BatchDPG</a>, or if that doesn't work out, use <a class="postlink" href="http://home.att.ne.jp/blue/moonlight/moonshell10_dpgtools.zip" target="_blank">Moonshell DPG Tools</a>.  You should probably encode at ~15 fps for optimal quality.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you have any other questions!<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by spacepirate on Sat Jul 29, 2006 2:21 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You say 15fps is optimal? Would it matter if whether or not I run skins on moonshell, to make it smoother? I get the feeling skins really make moonshell run slower... Not that 15fps is bad, not at all in fact,  but I wonder whether it's the Lite or the software that makes it optimal...
<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DSOrganize can't play the OGG files I have on my CF card. They skip like mad.

<br/>
It depends. First you'll need a plane ticket to Canada, one of the few countries that still lacks an equivalent to the DMCA (Title 17 US Code section 1201). In fact, the candidate DMCA that has been proposed in Canada makes an explicit exemption for uses that do not infringe copyright, and it doesn't appear to cover devices as strictly as the US law does.
<br/>
<br/>
When converting video to DPG:
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Bit rate:</span> 192 kbps video and 64 kbps audio
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Frame rate:</span> You want a frame rate that has a nice ratio compared to the original source. Film in most cinema systems runs at 24 fps, so go half that (12 fps) if you're transcoding from a source that was originally film. NTSC video runs at 30 fps, so go half that (15 fps) if you're transcoding from footage shot with a video camera or from footage produced using a video game system (e.g. the so-called "Tetris Japan Finals" videos).

The <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9484" target="_blank">rule</a> against discussion of backups appears to apply only to discussion of backups of full commercial <span style="font-weight: bold">games</span>.

The settings I use are:

<br/>
Bitrate: 256
<br/>
Width: 224

FPS: Auto (it's proly 19)

It looks great and runs fine. MUCH better than DPGEnc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About the DVD ripping, it didn't even come to my mind that ripping your own dvd's would be illegal... I always figured that it's only the possible sharing of ripped files that would make the word "ripping" sound so illegal, not the process itself...
<br/>
<br/>
But then again, it's hard to keep track of what may and may not be done with your own stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Aye, it's a worrying state of affairs.
<br/>
Next gen media (HD-DVD and Blu-ray) will include DRM and due to the DCMA we won't be allowed to reverse engineer it.
<br/>
<br/>
This means you'll need to buy several copies of the same movie.
<br/>
1 x UMD for your PSP, 1 x Blu-Ray for the lounge, 1 x download for ipod, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Whereas right now people are just buying the DVD ripping it and transcoding it for all their devices.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is how Sony will save UMD movies?
<br/>
<br/>
It's my media, I should be allowed to do what I want with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Same thing goes for CDs.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd eventually like to see ?3 albums and ?6 DVDs. In slip covers. On blank media. Without DRM.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd buy a lot more music then.
<br/>
I was disappointed by the Arctic Monkeys album.
<br/>
It cost me ?10, and I only like a couple of tracks. ?3 wouldn't have been such a big deal.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Tepples, why do you have your video bitrate so low? Pure curiosity, as I have mine up around 300 and everything works fine. Mind you for 40 minutes of video I'm looking at 100 megs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
