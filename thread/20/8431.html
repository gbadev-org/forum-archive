Good release, but IT playback is still abnormal. If he can simply figure out the problem there, things would be perfect. :) I'm very happy with this program now. Does the PSP even have a program this versitile?<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Well, my Moonshell Settings Editor is already in later beta stage, beta3 is already being tested by Moonlight. The only thing left to do is graphical preview of Moonshell color scheme. Other features are completely useable, including multilanguage interface :) Expect release soon. Hmm, maybe with Moonshell 0.6 ? ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I feel the need to mention a couple things after using Moonshell 0.5 most of the tonight:
<br/>
<br/>
-After playing a bunch of OGGs, I found I was unable to play certain IT files due to MoonShell being "out of memory." These IT files play properly when MoonShell is freshly booted, so perhaps there's a memory leak.
<br/>
<br/>
-The backlight is still turning itself back on when the lid is closed when a new song is played
<br/>
<br/>
-an Impulse Tracker (IT) file still doesn't play its order lists/pattern rows properly..though I mentioned that before.
<br/>
<br/>
This is sitll in beta so of course, I'm just letting ya know of any bugs I may have found. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I personally think you should remove the "PlayControl..." part, and simply have the song name in the bar, rather than have it in it's 8.3 character format. It just looks better, in my opinion. It could possibly be hard, but perhaps you could make something that will catch the song name variables for each library and toss it right into that little bar there..
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, awesome release, I'm thrilled about all these features MoonShell has. It's like a portable WinAmp..much more versitile than even the more expensive mobile music players on the market today.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Thank you for the report. 
<br/>
<br/>
The bug that the memory leak exists in the OGG decipherment was confirmed. 
<br/>
It is correcting it now. 
<br/>
There is a bug in the sequence control of IT synth. The reason is uncertain. I want to cure it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I want to display the long filename and the internal organs title text, etc. in the title of the PlayControl window. I Wish.
<br/>
However, Unicode, a regional language, and ROM font, etc. have of ..profundity.. consideration necessity. 
<br/>
It thinks by the further version though it is not implemented by Version0.5.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MoonLight, did you make your own IT/S3M player using a modplug library on the internet? or did you implement someone elses?
<br/>
<br/>
Me, being around since the IT format was created (and talking with the author, Jeffrey Lim, a *lot*..infact I'm probably the reason why the first IT player was even made, heh) ..I HATE Modplug. It's so unstandard, doesn't sound right, and it seriously over-loads the CPU.
<br/>
<br/>
I have to recommend this library here: <a href="http://mikmod.raphnet.net/" target="_blank">http://mikmod.raphnet.net/</a> Mikmod is so much better, and I'm not just saying that because Jake Stine and I were the first to actually MAKE an IT player. :P
<br/>
<br/>
I think that source would be great because you could have amazing IT, S3M, MOD, XM, ...*any* kind of classic mod format relatively quickly and easily, with little CPU usage and the like. It would be perfect for DS, and MoonShell.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

the maximum means that it drops frames on anythink above that.  it doesnt actually do 24fps if you play a video on the previous version it tells you each time theres a dropped frame</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Exact same thing is happening to me, and I changed absolutely nothing in the global.ini. That displays on the top screen, and the bottom screen is frozen.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm running it on a GBA MP v2 with Chishm's firmware v2. I was running it via MightyMax's Multiloader, but renamed Moonshell to _boot_mp.nds, and the same problem happens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

INCREDIBLE!!! I can confirm 100% that IT files work PERFECTLY now, XMs are now playable (with NO clicks or pops), MODs work PERFECTLY, and S3M support is still good. :D

Correction: IT support crashes every now and then, but when it plays, even the more intensive IT files play (with some clicks and pops).. Here is an example of one: <a href="http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/turittl.it" target="_blank">http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/turittl.it</a>

It is glad to move normally. 
<br/>
However, there is a bug that doesn't start 'Ver0.5 base'. (Wry smile)
<br/>
<br/>
The phenomenon that the decipherment is skipped by 'Turittl.it' was confirmed. It is a limit of ARM9CPU.
<br/>
The mixing option is not yet supported.
<br/>
However, the following items will be added to 'Global.ini' in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
refer libMikMod developer help.
<br/>
enables the interpolated mixers.
<br/>
enables the surround mixers.
<br/>

Version 0.5 2005/10/26
<br/>
<br/>
The window buffer memory is allocated by the necessity. Memory saving design.
<br/>
'GIF/GSM/MOD/S3M/IT/XM/MTM/OGG' plug-in was added.
<br/>
Corresponded to the CF version of M3 perfect Adapter. (The NDSROM start cannot be done. )
<br/>
The turning off bug of the backlight was corrected.
<br/>
The file name was displayed in the window title.
<br/>
'StartupSound' setting item of 'global.ini' was moved from [System] to [Boot].
<br/>
An unknown key is detected by 'Global.ini'. It changed like doing the disregard continuation.
<br/>
The bug that the MCUCount error occurs by dmvenc.exe was corrected.
<br/>
Additionally, correction for a moment.
<br/>
<br/>
It takes a rest for a while if there is no fatal bug.

Please teach when behavior is abnormal.

Actually, Impulse Tracker (IT) support does not crash. It just loads slowly. I do not mind it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Panning in Impulse Tracker (IT) is inaccurate, but I think that is MikMod's fault. 
<br/>
<br/>
Does this library have Dynamic Voice control? I know Jake Stine put it in some time ago. WinAmp has it called "Max Voices" in the configuration. Can you add that to global.ini also? That way a person could configure MikMod to only use 16 channels at most to keep CPU load down. 
<br/>
<br/>
MikMod sounds BETTER than ModPlug, for that I am sure!

I am so happy! Domo Arigato Moonlight! :D

That's happening for me...
<br/>
Using PassMe and hacked GBAMP... If I put Moonshell as _BOOT_MP.NDS, I get the two white screens. If I use GBAMP Multiboot to open up Moonshell, it works fine.
<br/>

Version 0.5 appears to have trouble running .txt files...

<br/>
I remember something about chism's driver not booting unless the flash is defragged..but wasn't that supposed to be resolved?
<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, it could simply be a problem with your compact flash. Defrag, chkdsk it, etc. I've had no problems with moonshell and I actually bought this compact flash at a refurbishing place. I use a 1 gigabyte compact flash. It's the best thing in the world. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm simply including the text files in the IMFS until the issue with reading them off the card is resolved.
<br/>
<br/>
In the moonshell folder, under "files" I made a subfolder for my ebooks, slapped them all in there, and then went up one level to run WriteFiles_IMFS.bat. The shell script generates a new _BOOT_MP.nds in the main folder to be dropped onto the card.
<br/>
<br/>
The text files are included in the .nds binary, which counters a lot of the convenience of being able to use a CF card, as one has to update the "files" folder and rerun the script upon each change. As a temporary workaround, though, it's more than bearable.

Uhh.. there are other things you can do, but keep in mind that the codec in the AVI is probably a lot more complex than the compressions that DMVenc uses.
<br/>
<br/>
There are solutions, though. 1 gigabyte compact flashes are fairly cheap these days, depending on where you buy them. (Stay away from the big retail stores like Best Buy) Or, you could use the GBA side of the GBAMP to view the video, using GBAlpha's software.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
