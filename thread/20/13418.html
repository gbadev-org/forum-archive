    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My DS Lite's touch screen doesn't detect the locations of touches properly at some points on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
In the lower left quarter of the screen, the point registered is about 10 pixels to the left of where the touch occurs.  The further left and down I go, the further off the point registered is.  This is easy to see in Club House Games, for example.
<br/>
<br/>
The built-in tool for recalibrating the touch screen calibrates based on points in the top left corner, the bottom right corner, and the center.  Since the touch screen is accurate for those points, I can't fix it with that tool.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any homebrew available that interfaces with the DS's touch screen calibration data?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, because I believe that all that is saved is the top left and bottom right.  My brother's white DS lite has a similar problem caused by too much drumming on the left side and too hard; the touch surface has gone slack on one side, but remains hard on the other.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?cuyb10fzdz2" target="_blank">Strummer</a> or <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?71zxcztscix" target="_blank">Drummer?</a>.

Or maybe you would rather play with sand? <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?a05z5wmdvxm" target="_blank">Sandscape is for you in that case.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if it affects commercial games, and it's less than a year since you purchased your DS you should be able to get a replacement ('repair') by Nintendo for free.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I just got a replacement system from Nintendo this very week for the same problem.  11 1/2 weeks inti my warranty, too.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a picture I made using DSOrganize that shows exactly how the calibration was off on my old system's screen.  The red lines should be straight lines traced over the straight gray lines.

The new DS Lite Nintendo sent me is a lot nicer than my old one anyway.  The hinge design has been improved and the newer touchscreen is now just as vivid as the top screen (actually, more vivid).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey hope I'm not too late but I had the same problem with my dslite. I was using the most current flashme version 8a and my comercial games  and even picochat had screen calibtation problems most noticeably in bottom left portion of the screen(same as homebrew offset). I tried calibrating a dozen times or so and even pulled the battery to reset to factory defaults but the problem persisted. I decided to revert to flashme ver 7 and guess what problem solved. My touch screen is accurate once again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Nevermind its doing the same thing again. Now if I pull the battery the calibration will be correct for a little while then suddenly in the middle of a picross the calibration goes bad again. WTF
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll have to noflashme and if that doesn't help its warranty time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
