    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible for someone to make a wmb program that when loaded just detects save size then reads it bit for bit and transfers it to something like a ftp server with the wireless card.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like this so I don't have to buy any flash carts or anything. I already have wmb working fine on my computer running Linux. I can get my ds flashme'd easy.
<br/>
<br/>
I am under the assumption I can play wifi games with there original carts with the flashme firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's possible.  I thought someone made a program like that back when wifi only supported UDP but it probably wasn't released.
<br/>
<br/>
Flashme shouldn't have any effect on multiplayer games.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
