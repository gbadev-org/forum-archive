    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Howdy there DS Devrs :)
<br/>
<br/>
I've set up a Nintendo DS Developers Group on the <span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.greatgamesexperiment.com" target="_blank">Great Games Experiment</a></span>.
<br/>
<br/>
Go and sign up for the GGE and join our group: <span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="http://www.greatgamesexperiment.com/group/ndsdevelopers" target="_blank">NDS Developers</a></span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Info on GGE:</span>
<br/>
The Great Games Experiment is a mySpace type affair but for gamers and game developers and game publishers to hang out at. It is currently in Beta, but anyone can request to sign up.
<br/>
<br/>
The site is split into sections home, games, groups, developers and publishers. Each section is pretty self-explanatory and I found it very simple to use.
<br/>
<br/>
Once in there, you can join any group, rate other users, games, groups, and even chat.
<br/>
Developers and Gamers alike can show their stuff while being members of some of the most active groups around.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all over there ;)
<br/>
<br/>

Personally, I hate the navigation on their site (and have told them so via Support Requests and Survey's), but everything else I like.
