    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As you can see from my reply at the bottom there, I withdrew my entry from the competition after reading the judges comments.  It's not that I couldn't stand losing (if you can consider 5th place losing in a comp with ten nice prizes), I just really disagreed with the manner of judging.  I think I expected a more professional job to rival the work I put into my game... instead the comp seemed to favor those who ported existing games and it seemed to me that the reviewers didn't really spend much time with the games.  Or if they did, they ignored glaring gameplay flaws when assigning points to the games.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking of hosting my own comp which will be a game design comp more than a coding/tech comp.  Just need to save a bit of money for prizes..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why didn't you just take the prize and use that as a prize in your own comp? lol
<br/>
<br/>
There is always going to be judging issues when the judges are coders themselves. They will tend to judge on technical achievment, coding complexity and the like, rather than gameplay and originality.
<br/>
<br/>
Things like emulators rate high because they are often more difficult to write than a standard game. Emulators are also very popular with the punters, and offer a number games to be played from the one ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I thought the graphics in your game were quite good especially if you did them yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand your feelings. DSGoo was described as "Nothing special, I don't have fun while playing it...not a game and not an app..." by one of the judges. Whereas I have got some posivitve feedback from people who actually enjoyed playing it. But I believe it's a fair call from a coders perspective.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't get why you pulled out of the comp though, since something is better than nothing. You could have sold it, given it away, or whatever and got something for your hard work. If it's in protest, then that's fair enough.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the purpose of the comp is to bring publicity to neoflash.  Our game's become advertisements for neoflash with the splashscreen on the front.  By pulling out, they do not get to include my game on their CD (at least they should not) and when I release the follow up version with improvements, I will have no qualms about omitting the neo splash screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I think the product is a bit overpriced, especially considering the flash cart barely fits into my DS and feels like it could fall apart at any moment (the magic key is very solidly built though, if anyone just needs a pass through).
<br/>
<br/>
I was having second thoughts about being associated with Neoflash prior to the judging... but afterwards I just wanted to wash my hands.  I can certainly do without a 150 to 200 dollar prize (whatever that thing is supposedly worth/selling-for).
<br/>
<br/>
As for my own contest... I certainly do want to host a contest.  I need to work out the details and wait at least two months to fund the prizes though.  And considering my feelings about neoflash, I wouldn't have wanted to give one of those away anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think others will read what you have to say and understand your not being a sore loser but expressing your feelings in the matter.
<br/>
<br/>
I think NeoFlash has always been quite expensive along with many other storage solutions for DS/GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
Myself, along with many others, advertise NeoFlash because they have an obsurdly ingenious advertising campaign. But along with that, they have helped many homebrew developers by supplying free carts and passme's.
<br/>
<br/>
In that manner, I cannot say that NeoFlash have done anything bad for the scene. But perhaps they can re-consider who the judges are, and how they judge to prevent such misshappenings in the future.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Easy piracy?  I don't think I've heard of any way to play pirated games yet other than using a NeoFlash cart.  I've a feeling the new firmware blocking PassMe is because of this rather than homebrew itself.  Buuut maybe I'm just biased.  I don't like the company anyway really.  Not to mention that they're charging way too much for tech that can be had for much cheaper.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
