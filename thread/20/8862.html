    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eventually when Lite parts start appearing on ebay and other tech sites, will it be possible to replace the two DS screens with the new bright DS Lite's screens? I know you'd probably have to use a resistor or something to tie down the power setting to highest, and that'd minimize your battery life, but I rarely go more than 4 hours on my DS without charging it anyways. Kind of like an Afterburner for the DS. All I can think of is the screen sizes are the same, and I'm assuming the power's easy 2-lead maybe a third if the voltage regulation for the 4 modes isn't done onboard, and the touch screen layer can be separated so you can use your old one from the normal DS. Any other thoughts on it?<br/>_________________<br/>-Unrequited</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I read somewhere that on DS Lite the black color is more black and not dark grey like with DS. So the DS Lite LCD panels are more modern than the ones in DS.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

...obviously, which is why I made this thread. I'm just wondering if anybody's opened up their DS Lite's to see if they're the same size/thickness as the DS Fat's screens.<br/>_________________<br/>-Unrequited</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I still believe it's possible to change them, but maybe Nintendo did change the connectors to make that changing more difficult. Compare the pictures: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.xboxrepairguide.com/images/large/ds_top_screen_sm.gif" target="_blank">DS top screen</a> | DS Lite screen (sorry, I lost the url)
<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I have returned my broken DS to the store and they give me a new one. This one has less bright backlights. It's really strange. Maybe those screens are cheaper ones? This one is with FW4.
<br/>
Also I have noticed that the repair part screens are different than the ones that comes with new DS (they have more powerful LCD's backlight and the touchscreen is harder). Maybe they are from different supplier?

Off topic:
<br/>
Yesterday I found my Afterburner GBA and compared it's screen to DS screens and you can believe when I said: Oh My God! DS screen is so much better.. brighter and the contrast is better. I did even watch pictures with my GBA and now I use my DS instead. I can't wait till DS Lite comes to europe. :) Also there is a huge difference between GBA Afterburner's and GBA SP's frontlights brightness. 
<br/>
I don't think I will survive without touchscreen (I hate PSP.. or squeezed PlayStationOne+). In my opinnion new handhelds should all have touchscreen!<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If they are the same, I would expect to see Nintendo to utilize those screens in the regular DS as well. Considering they are still intending to sell the original alongside the Lite, it's possible. Just look at what they did with the GBA SP, and that was a more-involved change than just switching the screens. Plus, if the screens are compatible, they could really save on the manufacturing cost by only producing one kind. Then again, they don't always use interchangable parts (the Lite's AC adapter comes to mind as a recent example). Hopefully they are the same, though.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

All they'd need to do is to make a battery like the DS Lite's, only compatible with the GBA SP/DS..<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Indeed. That's 17% more energy in there... damn Ninty. Are they gonna continue producing the old DS, or will wait they all get sold out eventually? I  read somewhere that in US the DSL would replace the old model, while they'd sell side by side in Japan.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Reggie said in an interview that they will sell the old DS so long when they have them left. DS Lite is the future after that. But I believe they will still make replacement parts for old DS.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

The bottom one is the same as the display in the DS, but the top one is different. The lid tends to get bumped, so we were looking for an LCD module that was both stronger and slimmer than the one in the DS. We had trouble finding a pre-existing part that met all our requirements, so we worked with an LCD manufacturer in a process of trial and error to create a customized part. Rather than shoehorning an existing LCD module into the slimmest case that it would fit in, we designed and built an LCD module that fits a slim case and is also exceptionally durable.?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
