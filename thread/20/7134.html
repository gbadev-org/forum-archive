    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there anything out for the Supercard to view Fullscreen Videos on Supercard? 256x196? Moonshell doesnt work... Is there something else out? 
<br/>
<br/>
ps. why isnt it possible to make a good videoplayer for the DS??? I mean there were a lot PSone Games with Videos and the PSX only had 33mhz. And for Nokia Ngage there is even a Fullscreen DivX+Xvid Player with mp3 Sound. I think the DS has more HArdware Power than the Ngage does. 
<br/>
<br/>
I found a Webpage where u can download Video for the DS which are realy amazing! Its made with a mpeg4 Codec, but its only for developers. Thats so cool a 27 minutes Anime Episode is only 16 MB! Imagine how cool it would be if u would encode it with higher bitrates...
<br/>
u can see the videos here: <a href="http://www.ds-video.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ds-video.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

since when did the ngage have a more powerful cpu?  one of its failings was that it was underpowered.
<br/>
<br/>
playstation could do videos cos it has cds therefore the videos needed little compression and were easy to play.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

N-Gage was underpowered for 3D games, but it was just fine for 2D games. The N-Gage CPU is faster than that of the DS, but there is no specialized 3D rasterization hardware on the N-Gage. Movie decoding generally runs on the CPU, not the video chip, unless you have one of those new DirectX 9 cards that can do an inverse DCT inside a pixel shader.

The videos still used MPEG-like compression and were decoded through a hardware-accelerated "MDEC" coprocessor. This is the technique that the Play-Yan product uses.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Caimans codec implement mpeg4 standard features, but it's not mpeg4 compatible, mind you. 
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't looked at the demos (no way to run them on my DS yet), but by the sounds of it, it seems more efficient than vanilla MPEG-4, at DS specs.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, creating such optimized video codecs is a hefty task. Caimans is a commercial product. I don't know how much the licensing fees cost (when there are no visible prices on the website, it surely ain't cheap), but I estimate something between 2K to 5K, per title, with options for royalty-based licensing and volume licensing.
<br/>
<br/>
It's just a matter of some talented homebrew coder with loads of time on his/her hands get interested in such idea... whenever that happens...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
