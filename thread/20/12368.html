I've always had this idea to for a DS Checkbook/Register, so I know how much money I have just by pulling out my DS. The problem is, I'm still learning how to program.
<br/>
<br/>
With this program, you can keep track of your expenditures. You will be able to add and edit entries, which would consist of the date, a description, and the amount of change in the balance. Ultimately, it'd be nice to have all this data just exported into a .txt file.
<br/>
<br/>
What I've learned so far in programming are the basics: input, output, selection, repetition. I've also learned arrays and pointers. (This is all C++ stuff I've learned.)
<br/>
I haven't learned file management.
<br/>
<br/>
How would one go about creating such a program?<br/>_________________<br/>FW4 White DS with FlashMe v7
