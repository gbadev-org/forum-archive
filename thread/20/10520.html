<br/>
I am getting a DS Lite soon..  I would like to match their WFC IDs so I can switch between my old DS and the DS Lite when playing WFC games (not running at the same time of course).  Has anybody else attempted this?  Also, would games be able able to detect the change or would I have to change the MAC ID of the DS Lite as well?  Any info/code is appreciated and I hope to try it out when I get my Lite.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Commodity. 
<br/>
<br/>
I preffer MKDS on Phatty but MPH on Lite. 
<br/>
I can go either way with tetris/acww. 
<br/>
<br/>
Then theres availability. In my case, my bro has the Lite, and I have the Phat. He hasnt bought MKDS or MPH (yet), so I sent him my ID and let him borrow it for the time being. Since he is yet to have a WFC Game, his ID isnt lost. 
<br/>
<br/>
This would simplify borrowing games with others, or with yourself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The whole point of having WFC IDs is so you can't do exactly what you are asking.

The best you can do is link both to your My Nintendo account.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
