    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to get SnesDS games running using the GBAMP?
<br/>
<br/>
I know the gbamp can only take *.nds files (which work fine on my set up) but SnesDS seems only to output *.ds.gba
<br/>
<br/>
Can I convert from one to the other?
<br/>
(by removeing bits at the start using a hex editor? How would I know what to remove?)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Only the "Soundless" Binaries that olimar released can play SNES DS on the GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it was released privately, and there's only a few people who actually have it.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to wait until SNESDS is fixed to work for the GBAMP..perhaps a new version? At any rate, from the looks of it, the project's been abandon for now. Hopefully something will change in the future.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
~sigh~
<br/>
Thanks anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a generic way to change the format anyway? (in case I come accross homebrew that would work, were in not in ds.gba format)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
no, and i would suggest you dont bug olimar about it.  your not missing much anyway since the soundless bins doesnt work with most of the games due to the sound not being there (it causes roms that would otherwise work to not do so).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh yeah.
<br/>
Many SNES rom's were sound synched.
<br/>
That's why netplay in SNES9x never worked well.
<br/>
Ah, 8 way bomber man at school.
<br/>
That was great until it went out of sync.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I noticed I cant get the official ni-fi demos to run ver the PassMe/GBAMP..dispite them being in *.nds format, and obviously using only the ram.
<br/>
Is this because me DS isnt moded? 
<br/>
Or is there some other reason?
<br/>
<br/>
Theres an awful lot of demos I would like to try, but I have no wi-fi card.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
ok, thanks for letting me know.
<br/>
I can wait a few months (either for new firmware or a wi-fi card thats certain to work with the online system).
<br/>
Got plenty to try out in the meantime :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
