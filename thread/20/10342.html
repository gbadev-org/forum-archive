    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im developing a windowed GUI, which is supposed to make setting up applications that need to output stuff in a pretty window based GUI easy to develop.
<br/>
<br/>
The main reason that I'm doing this is because I've got some decent ideas for applications, but since most of them will be window based, I thought it would be nice to develop a library for showing... a bunch of stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Approaching 1500 lines of code now, and stuff is starting to work rather well.

There should be a way to switch screens btw. Dunno if its already there. Just giving my $0.20 MXN</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
No, it's not based on anything except palib.
<br/>
All the code for window handling is written from scratch.
<br/>
<br/>
The option to switch screens are already there (dpad left and right). Other controls are 
<br/>
dpad up = bring up keyboard for window input
<br/>
dpad down = hide keyboard
<br/>
L = put the active window to the other screen
<br/>
<br/>
Stuff that works as of now:
<br/>
Creating, closing, moving, resizing windows and lists.
<br/>
Keyboard input to windows (text shows up in window right now).
<br/>
Adding / removing items from lists
<br/>
<br/>
And uh... a bunch of other stuff. But it's still in a very early stage of development.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have developed a GUIKit for the Nintendo DS. It works great, and is totally independent of graphic modes. So you can use it for mode5, mode0, 3d or on the PC or whatever. I haven't had time to make many widgets for it yet, but the primitives from which other widgets are derived are all there.

I am up for some guikit collaboration if you are interested. I have it done for the most part, but any ideas or patches to the code are appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seems nice, gonna have a better look at it later today.
<br/>
<br/>
My internet connection is dead at home right now though, so I can only have a quick look at it here at work right now, but I'll download it to an usb memory and bring it home later or something...
<br/>
<br/>
My internet connection being down at home is also the reason that the link to my demo won't work... but I'll get that on an usb drive and upload it to my server which is elsewhere later today :)
<br/>
<br/>
I might be interested in having a look at your code, but I don't really have much experience on lower levels of NDS programming (I've only just started, and am using palib). I like to utilize high level libraries when programming, but I'd be happy to learn the other libraries as well :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
