The first link is a guide for DS Lite overlocking, the 2nd is for regular DS overclocking. Both also tell you how to put in a switch to switch from regular speed to 1.7x normal speed.
<br/>
<br/>
I put them through google translator and it's not clear. Is there anyone here fluent in Japanese that can translate this guide? Or someone who can do this themselves based on what they see in this guide and then write something up?
<br/>
<br/>
I could see this possibly becoming useful...for things like Moonshell maybe to make video run very well, or so emulators run better.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone think a software based overclock is possible? Is it possible that FlashMe could be modified to allow for this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

doubt it.

what about heating issues for the DS? they must've not been designed to run at that speed for a reason..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I suppose so, but neither were a hell of a lot of CPUs, but every day people overclock their processors without a hitch.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it's not like people will play DS like this. Maybe just for homebrew. The guy put out videos showing what happens when you play DS games while overcloked. It makes the frame rate really high, but it messes with the sound and stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">they may think its without a hitch but the high temperature could be decreasing the CPU lifetime (although they'll probably want a new one before their current overclocked one dies)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The fact that you're able to switch between normal and overclocked easily is what would make it worthwhile for most people, since if you're playing Real DS Games? you (most likely) wouldn't want to play them that fast.  
<br/>
<br/>
However, on a side note, I've found that moonshell's dpg playing performance increases fairly noticeably if you turn off Adaptive Delay Control in the settings.  I was using a couple of 1:00 youtube videos, so there's a chance that the sound may go out of sync with longer videos.<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It wasn't really designed for overclocking, so I would imagine the limit is the design of the system.
<br/>
Whereas with PC overclocking, most chips are inconsistent at high speeds (or otherwise faulty at high speed) and so underclocked and sold as cheaper models. So all you're doing is clocking them back up.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE
