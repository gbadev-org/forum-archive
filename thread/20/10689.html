    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does anyone know if there is anything like this for sale anywhere?, for those to lazy to click the images below, its a sort of wrap-around for the gba slot, so that gba carts dont stick out so much, useful for gbamp and other huge carts.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well yeah, i was also hoping I could just put the metal bit through the little holes in the cart (theres a tiny hole for each pin), and glueing the wire-plastic down to the board so it didn't move, but that method could've easily shorted at least 2 of the 32 wires :(
<br/>
<br/>
also the GBAMP holes are in a different place to official game carts making it even more harder &gt;&lt; so then i tried taking apart an old GBA to take the slot, but I couldn't get it off the board.... now that GBA doesn't work, so if I can get that off somehow, I could probably easily make one if I were ever to have access to a solder :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

hopefully someone will. 
<br/>
<br/>
If someone does, please make a DSlite version which includes an adapter so it fits in normal DS (surely its not too hard to make a tiny clip-on extender..)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Looks like a GBAMP would fit?

<br/>
Ah, crap... now I only have one reason preventing me from spending $150 on a DS Lite when I already have a useable big DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

to make it so the carts don't stick out...
<br/>
<br/>
not only do they look bad sticking out, but its also easier to knock them out of place</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
