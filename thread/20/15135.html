    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a developer new to the DS homebrew scene, I couldn't resist the urge to check out what's already there and would would be a cool DS app/game, especially as a little project for people with <a class="postlink" href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/copious-free-time.html" target="_blank">copious free time</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my initial shot, feel free to tick items off the list that have satisfactory implementations, or add new ones:

Just some ideas of things that I would like to see (and perhaps already exist) and if I could clone myself even work on, that either don't exist, or could become a bit more polished:
<br/>
Subtractive Synthesizer
<br/>
IFR Simulator (like on the VIC 20)
<br/>
VIC 20 emulator (port of VICE?)
<br/>
Skat (German card game)
<br/>
Nine Men's Morris (I'm working on a version)
<br/>
Bridge
<br/>
lots of ideas along the lines of flashcards programs; somehow letting the DS help you memorize/learn facts/vocab/stuff.
<br/>
those dev tools I mentioned: profiler &amp; source level debugger
<br/>
Football/Soccer Manager (I'm working on porting Paul Robson's SDL port of the original FM)
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
One I forgot to add in the initial list:
<br/>
Air Traffic Controller (yes I know there is a Japanese commercial game, but I was thinking along the lines of simple, expandable, and in other languages besides Japanese. It would also be a good test case for a decent text-to-speech engine... this is how I remembered, because <a class="postlink" href="http://www.atcsimulator.com/" target="_blank">ATC Simulator</a> uses Concatenative synthesis.
<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of Bridge vs. Contract Bridge, how about a clone of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bridgebuilder-game.com/" target="_blank">Bridge Builder</a>?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by nczempin on Thu Mar 13, 2008 1:09 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Here, I'll help you:

<br/>
Well, although it may sound like a port request, it isn't.
<br/>
<br/>
I am a developer, and I would like a list of projects that I can help with. Yes, I am new to the forum; I am also new to DS development. I do have a lot of development experienced, and currently (although this may of course change in the future) a lot of energy and motivation to cut my teeth on the DS. So instead of just writing something useless, I would like to find out exactly what hasn't already been done satisfactorily on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, perhaps this thread would be better-placed in the "Help wanted" or "Help offered" section.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So you're saying that GPF has already tried all the possible means for optimization; it can never become any faster, and there is not a single DOS program that can ever find any use on the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Where is this ported DosBox, all I could find was this:

So judging from what I've seen, I'm not the first person to get the idea to get some (very) old DOS games working, and I'll leave it at that. Writing emulators is not really my strength, but to just say "it's impossible" or "it's too slow" is giving up too quickly IMHO.

I have no way to judge his optimization skills. However, I also have no way of knowing how much time he actually put into it. The post I quoted indicated a "quick" port, which would indicate he put as much time into it as I did for the Football Manager, which runs horrendously slow, because my first goal was simply to get it running at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Having used your proposed method a bit more, I think it is unlikely (although I would never say "impossible"; perhaps some creative way could be found to utilize that second processor on the DS, or something else) that we would get a _full_ port of DOSbox, but it should be possible to get some early PCs emulated, and some of them had some interesting games, some of them not so bound by CPU (so they would work in an emu).

<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I'm up for this kind of challenge yet. While I am very interested in learning how to write an emulator, I am not foolish enough to think I could compete with GPF or other experienced developers in this arena. I'll finish my Java-based VIC-20 emulator one day, then perhaps follow the Space-Invaders-Emu and a/the Pacman emu, but a full-fledged PC, even if only 8086 (let alone 286, and certainly out of the question is a 386) is currently out of reach for me.
<br/>
<br/>
The idea just came to me when I thought about the Ultima IV clone, and that perhaps some CGA-based stuff would be cute, although not necessarily to be done by me.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just trying to get an overview of what has already been done, what would be worthwhile projects, and out of those, what would be feasible for me to do given my attention sp... err, spoon?

Wouldn't that just need the DS to be a MIDI controller, sending MIDI messages to the PC?

    <h4>#152744 - HyperHacker - Thu Mar 20, 2008 9:47 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since I'm almost certainly never going to make a DS music player, this seems like a good place to spout off some ideas I had about how one might be made:
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing a lot of CPU time is spent decoding. What if ARM7 decodes one channel while ARM9 decodes the other simultaneously? Assuming ARM7 is fast enough to decode a single channel, and it doesn't cause slowdown with both accessing RAM or something, this seems like a more efficient use of the hardware. Obviously ARM9 has to be the one to read data from the disk to be decoded, but since it wouldn't make much sense for one channel to decode faster than the other, ARM9 almost certainly wouldn't be spending all its time decoding, so you'd have some spare time to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
For those of us who listen to music all the damn time, it'd be neat if we could "transfer" music between the DS and PC. For example you have track 27 of playlist Foo playing in Winamp and the song is at 1:37. You hit a button on the DS and Winamp stops. The DS loads up a copy of playlist Foo on its storage device and starts off at track 27 at position 1:37. Then you can transfer back again. So if you had to get up and go somewhere, you could effectively take the music with you, without having to stop and skip through the playlist and seek through the song.
<br/>
<br/>
Why do all the music players insist on looking pretty? How much time do you spend looking at their interface? I'm looking at you, LMP-NG, with your (presumably) single bitmap layer and skins and EXTREEM LAG. <b style="color:#FFA34F">Text</b> mode + background image + maybe user-specified font colours, with the font itself loaded from a bitmap file, should be all the customization one needs and would be a zillion times faster. The less time spent redrawing the interface the better. <b style="color:#FFA34F">Text</b> mode is easy to use and it's very simple to use the scroll registers for smooth scrolling, a second layer for drop shadow, etc, while using almost no CPU time at all. And don't even bother updating the interface while the lid is closed and we can't see it anyway! Duh!
<br/>
You might even use some sprites for the buttons (or just define their locations in a config file and draw them on the background image), hell it'd still take no CPU time at all to have like little things floating around for effect or something.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS may not be powerful enough for real multitasking, but if we could pause the song, pull up a notepad, write something, close it, and resume the song, that'd still be awesome. If nothing else, the player could write the current position to a file and then launch a .nds/reboot/power off, and resume from that position next time it starts, so we can run another app and come back where we left off. This is more "semi-multitasking OS" than "music player", but I think it's quite feasible to have an OS where only one program runs at a time and the rest are paused and paged off to disk or slot-2 RAM. There'd only be swaps when switching to another app so it wouldn't kill the flash cards. Think like DSOrganize, but with the apps not built in, and you don't have to close one to start another; it just gets paused and its memory saved somewhere.
<br/>
If you built music playing into the OS itself, or designed it to allow even just 2 apps running at the same time while the rest are paused, I bet that'd be enough for most people who want to listen to music while using the web browser or what have you.
<br/>
Also most PCs nowadays sync with some ?ber-accurate clock via Internet. Why not sync the DS clock to the PC clock?
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people seem to want visualizations, spectrum analyzers, etc, but lack of available CPU power makes it infeasible. Maybe the data that would be displayed could be precomputed?
<br/>
<br/>
Most players I've seen link in like 50 different libraries for different audio formats, which makes the binary big. Smaller binaries mean more room for buffers. What about dynamically loaded libraries? Every time a song starts swap in the appropriate decoding library.
<br/>
I wonder if slot-2 RAM is generally fast enough for a buffer?
<br/>
<br/>
It kinda sucks when you want to pause/skip/etc but the DS is in your pocket. Maybe the player could react to tapping on/near the microphone. I wonder how reliable that would be, responding to taps but not background noise. Alternately, if the user wore a headset or was really loud, it could respond to whistles.
<br/>
Or we could just wire something up to slot-2 or the actual mic port, but that's getting into hardware hacking... still it might not be hard to do. Take the "empty" DS Lite cart and wire buttons onto the data lines or something, so that you can just read from anywhere in the slot-2 ROM/SRAM regions and get the button state.
<br/>
Shake detection via motion sensor is another possibility, but people who are running/jogging/driving on bumpy roads might find it unreliable. I wonder if certain motions unlikely to occur by accident (or again, tapping) might be reliably detectable.
<br/>
Perhaps there are existing wireless remotes that the wifi hardware could pick up signals from? I wonder if it's possible to pick up Bluetooth? (Doubt it. &lt;_&lt;)
<br/>
Well, we can detect insertion/removal of cards in either slot... pull out the GBA cart to pause? Opening the lid triggers play/pause? You only have to open it a few degrees to register.
<br/>
For that matter there must be all manner of silly GBA carts with input systems that would be useful here. Like that Guitar Hero thing. Or the carts with solar sensors. (Stick an LED on the sensor, cover in electrical tape, rig up buttons to make the LED shine different brightnesses.)
<br/>
Going along with the microphone/motion sensor idea, maybe it could pause and play some other sound if it detects my cell phone ringing/vibrating in my pocket next to it. That phone also has a bright blinking light when it rings, again, solar sensor...
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when the battery hits "red light" level, after the current song is done, it could play a brief warning sound before moving on to the next one.
<br/>
<br/>
And finally where are all the streaming AAC+ players? :-p
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking I should get its source and see if I can at least optimize the interface and input routines, they seem to be very inefficient. With clever use of background layers, transparency, and sprites the iPod look could be retained while using almost no CPU power for the interface. (Draw the song name to a bitmap layer at startup and scroll it, and that's about it.) And I'm guessing it does the input handling in the main loop, which can make it completely unresponsive at times, whereas doing it in VBlank would solve this.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I'd go about trying to add all those features I mentioned - I'd rather write my own if I were going to do that (but I have no idea how to go about writing a music player &lt;_&lt;) - but it'd be nice just to have those optimizations made, to solve the input responsiveness problems and presumably improve decoding speed.

Basically I've got mpd running on my PC that's outputting over the network via esd to my DS.  I can then use a curses based mpd client (ncmpc) to control song playback.

i have a separate output device in mpd which outputs to icecast... so i'm listening to music from mpd with DSOrganize...
<br/>
<br/>
as for ideas i'm thinking of:
<br/>
 - better standalone streaming ogg/mp3 player (best if it also had built in mpd client ;)
<br/>
 - <a href="http://www.last.fm/" target="_blank">http://www.last.fm/</a> radio streams player (probably something like <a class="postlink" href="http://nex.scrapping.cc/shell-fm" target="_blank">shell-fm</a> could be used as a reference

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">HyperHacker, that's quite the idea you have there. But, I'm one of those people that like that custom interface. infact, I wouldn't even use things like moonshell if it didn't have the custom interface.
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, if I could code (as what i wish osmeone would make on the DS would most likely be quite a big project), I would want a Windowsesque type OS, based off of something like Moonshell or DS Organize.
<br/>
<br/>
how it would work is, much like the DS's firmware, it would read the DS slot and GBA slot, meaning, it would show anything that was in those slots, give them a "drive" number (just like any computer would) and allow you to boot them. The only different between it and the firmware would be that you could remove one game (seeing how you would be booting from a flash card, this would be nessisary), put another one in, and it wouldn't lock up, it would read what was in there. It would also have a third drive for the ROMs (homebrews only, though, so no one would use it for illegal gaming, as I'm very against that) to be loaded into (but, obviously, if you wanted to play a DS game and took out the homebrew device, it would cause it to crash trying to load the Homebrew because it couldn't find it).
<br/>
<br/>
It would be set up almost exactly like a computer, reading the micro SD card (or what ever the flash memory type is) as a harddrive and allowing you to browse through the files (set up kinda like moonshells browsing).
<br/>
<br/>
The touch screens purpose would be for the media player and rearanging desktop icons (which would just be counted as short cuts so that you wouldnt have two copies of 1 file onyour sd card)
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously I'm guessing this'll never happen along with, if it did, the DS just couldn't handle it and would instantly crash. But, it would be cool, right? :p<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):
