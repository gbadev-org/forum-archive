Heh, I tried to visit, but you didn't have my friend code then must be.  I did try it online for awhile with a friend, worked very well with no noticable lag even on this connection that was connecting at like 28.8 kbps.
<br/>
<br/>
And the manual says you need broadband..HAH!  :D  I think I'm gonna try connecting again.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
I wonder if you tried to connect at this one point when my connection dropped out due to my laptop being a jerk?  Yeah, that probably was what happened...I was connected to this other friend of mine and it dropped...he was in the middle of shaking a tree, and it repeated over and over.  It looked sorta, eh, bad you might say.
<br/>
<br/>
btw, I think I'm gonna keep an orange inside my house for now until I get some trees going (my friend had oranges).  If anyone visits me, feel free to grab this orange if you need oranges.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by The 9th Sage on Fri Dec 09, 2005 5:39 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

But man oh man, if you find the "red" rock (not actually red on AC:WW), you can get 8,100 bells from that puppy!  And on top of that, fossils are even easier to get money from (no waiting for the stupid mail!).  I've played for a total of maybe 2 hours, and I've paid off my first mortgage, bought (and re-sold) enough stuff at Nook's to go from Nook's Cranny to Nook'n'Go, plus I've almost reached the first discount level.

And if you ask me, your house doesn't look all that big... same size as my house, and I sure could use the bells.  But 5,000 isn't much, you're right.  I tried to plant 5 trees with 10,000 bells underneath each.  1 got snuffed out when an animal moved in, and the other 4 have been sitting there for weeks (I time travel) but no money is growing on them.

Yes, I have the golden shovel.  Yes, the trees become normal trees after you remove the money (at least, the did on the GameCube version).  If you try to plant money with a normal shovel, all you actually manage is to bury your money so you can get it later.  Kinda like a bank, except that someone else might take it before you.  Wait, a normal bank will get your money before you do, too.  So it's exactly like a bank.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You must know the right place to fish, or not know about the magic rock.  Every day, one rock in your town will give you money when you hit it. 
<br/>
<br/>
(The following is information for just anybody, but also in case you didn't know).  The shovel is your friend.  When you hit the rock with your shovel, you will get knocked back a little.  So place a hole behind you.  Place another hold beside you and run up against it so when you get hit, you will be pushed towards that hole.  Ultimately, you will not move enough to have to re-position yourself.  Se diagram below.
<br/>
<br/>
() = hole
<br/>
. = you (money also appears here)
<br/>
(_) = rock
<br/>
$ = where money will appear (eventually)

</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
You only have so much time to get money once you hit the rock.  The most I've been able to get from a rock is 7 bags.  The more bags you get, the more money will be in each bag.  Starting with the first bag, you will get 100, then 200, then 400, 800, 1000, 2000, and 4000.  So in total, you can get 8,500 bells each day.  This is why I time travel.  It takes a minute to start my game, anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 minutes to find the right tock, another 45 seconds to hit it and grab the money, and another minute to save and change the date on my DS.  So in total, I average about 8500 bells in under 6 minutes, sometimes 4 minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
Bewarned, though, because if you don't hit the rock fast enough you won't get that 4000 bell bag, and that one counts for a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
So KoD, if you already knew about the magic rock, I beg you to tell me where and when you fish 'cause I'm always on the lookout for a faster way to make some cash.  I liked the GC version w/ Animal Island.  I use a duplicating trick, and I tell you that duplicating 25 bags with 30,000 bells in each sure adds up fast!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Looks like I've got an extra thing to help me make money while I continually go back and forth each day. Fruit is still my main cash crop, since I get 6000 bells every 4 trees, and I've got at least 20 trees up with fruit atm. Problem though is that since I don't feel like advancing 3 or so days (and not knowing what will happen with the neighbors and the environment), I go forward one day, save, go back one day, save....rinse and repeat until trees bear fruit. It takes longer, but with that, I make sure nothing happens that I don't know about.

I wonder if that is because 7 bags plus that one hole on the corner is all that can be around the rock.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can tell you right now that has nothing to do with it.  If you have too few spaces around you, then the rock moves when you hit it and nothing comes out.  It stops moving when it's empty.  So if I could get 8, then the rock would move on the 8th hit... and it doesn't.
<br/>
<br/>
What <span style="font-style: italic">I</span> wonder is if two people hit the same rock at the same time, while a third person gathers the money to keep the ground empty... can you get more hits in?  It is a time-based thing after all...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If that were the case, 2 people hitting the rock and 1 person picking up would be MUCH more profitable in the end. Now, the size of each consecutive bag would be extremely large, and whether or not bags can be that high is unknown to us right now, but someone MUST have already tried this because it is so simple.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
LOL, after selling a bunch of fruit, I ended up getting over 100k bells on me, and Tom Nook placed 99k worth of my Bells in a separate bag, so I'm assuming that if the bags from the rocks COULD go higher than 4k, they will DEFINITELY not go over 99k per bag, LOL<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
My concern is how fast can the rock be hit.  Is there some kind of minimum time you must wait between hits?  But even if you only get 2 extra bags out of it, that would likely be either 8,000 and 10,000 (because you go from 800 bells to 1,000 bells) or 8,000 and 16,000 if you follow the doubling rule, so 2 extra bags would give anywhere from 18,000 to 24,000 bells.  Sa-weet!

So we should try it sometime.  All get together in one town, and make a plan to hit rocks.  This layout is probably the best 'cause it still only blocks one spot for bags to fall:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
  ()
<br/>
 $ . ()
<br/>
 $(_) .()
<br/>
 $ $  $
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
With () = hole
<br/>
(_) = rock
<br/>
. = person
<br/>
$ = bag o' cash.
<br/>
<br/>
The gatherer would grab bags falling on the lower-left corner, and would co-ordinate the timer.  Set 1 or 2 minutes to get from rock to rock and dig holes, then when the alarm sounds one person takes the first hit and the other takes the second.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently between jobs, so finding a time for me to be available is really easy.  Anything on my schedule has a 50/50 chance of me being able to do it whenever the hell I feel like.  So speak up, let's find a time to get 3 people together and try this!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe, since this thread seems to have gone the way of The Crossing, <span style="font-weight: bold">a mod who's a really really nice guy</span> could break the AC stuff into a separate thread, leaving the original stuff for sharing friend codes.  :)
