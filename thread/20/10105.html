    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">im not talking about homebrew, im asking this:
<br/>
<br/>
my main question is, is the DS powerful enough to handle half life 1. <span style="font-style: italic">Not</span> a homebrew port, but an official port. do you think the DS could handle a graphically scaled down version of half life?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the PS1 did it, but VALVe had to do some pretty extensive modifications to the engine for it to work. (Not nearly as nice looking!). It was a similar job as what they did to run HL2 on the original Xbox. (Which was enough of a degradation of the game's graphical finess that they are rumored to be doing an XBox 360 version anyway - although, some of the optimizations which just improved the speed overall went upstream to HL2: Ep 1).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,
<br/>
Would be neat to see, but the controls would also be a bit of trouble for them to figure out. (5 buttons for movement/firing, the other 5 being accessible only to pinky fingers, so they'd have to be for uncommon actions).
<br/>
I guess a weapon interface would have to be drawn on the touch screen along with a big crouch button. (HL1 has a lot of crouching!).
<br/>
We could expect 1.5x more quality than the PS1 handled, assuming it was all crammed into a game card (perhaps a bit tricky).
<br/>
Better load times, anyhow :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recoded from scratch, and rendering to the DS's resolution, it could be done and made to look very well.
<br/>
<br/>
You wouldnt have stuff like texture filtering though, so its impossible to match the graphics.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only chance of getting Half-Life on the DS is if the Quake port project goes through well, and someone converts all the Half-Life materials, and scripts to be compatibile with that one.
<br/>
<br/>
We're more likely to get a CS mod of Quake.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: go back to the nsider forums.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Definately not possible, even quake has memory problems on certain maps.
<br/>
Not only that the entire HLSDK is off limits to any project not using it for their engine.
<br/>
<br/>
What you could do, is write your own game around the half-life story - say from the scientists point of view or something.
<br/>
Then you write a 3D engine designed toward the DS hardware, add in your own artwork, maps and sound.
<br/>
<br/>
Another issue is that valve may not want you to do anything with the half-life name and order you to stop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Direct port? Next to impossible. The HL1 engine, the way it is, required far more RAM than the DS can offer. Also, the Dreamcast port had framerate issues already.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, a re-make, using an engine built from the ground up to the DS, using DS-specific art assets and levels, yeah, that could work. But it's a lot of work, and I doubt Valve would undertake such project anytime soon. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in two years or so, when the DS userbase becomes too large to resist, we'll start seeing some official classic FPS ports, like Quake, Quake 2 and maybe HL. After all, the build engine (Duke Nukem 3D) was ported to GBA (though DN Advance was not a direct port), and if the Sega Saturn could do a custom-engine-powered Quake, I'm sure the DS could too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
