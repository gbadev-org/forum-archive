Now, looking at the pictures, it almost seems like this will store your wifi settings on your DS itself, not the cartridge. While this will make it easier for players to connect, will this have any effect on a FlashMe'd DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While the settings may be stored in firmware, from what I've heard the menus are likely included with the game (though based off of a template program in the official SDK, sort of like Xbox's "Content download", if you've seen that).
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in those screenshots suggest that the menus are included in a firmware update to the DS. The visual style is similiar, but that's kind of to be expected. It's not white though, so it wouldn't blend in with the main firmware menus making it even more unlikely. And heck, I doubt Nintendo would flash the firmware, it could potentially be risky.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic">Reverting to old nickname...

Anyway, the settings are probably in-game. All it means is that you have to look for access points for each game that you play that has wireless support. It's not a big deal, but it can get annoying setting up access point profiles each time.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
It doesn't seem too out there to think Nintendo could have Mario Kart (or any other wifi game) install something into the firmware, just as newer Xbox games can install a new dashboard. They wouldn't have to offer any kind of service, because (from what I understand) only wifi-enabled games would need wifi settings. 
<br/>
<br/>
My biggest issue is bricking my DS. I already know I'm gonna buy Mario Kart the day it comes out, I just want to make sure I'm not also buying a new DS that day as well.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The most likely course of action is for the network setup tool to write the settings to firmware, same as the user name / favorite color / birthday info is stored, it will NOT WRITE ITSELF.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no way for nintendo to 'upgrade' the firmware without shorting SL1, the portion that is protected simply wasn't designed to be upgraded or even extended.
<br/>
<br/>
As other people have said, developers are probably provided with source code and sample art for the configuration tool (if nintendo wishes to allow them to 'theme' it), or perhaps just a binary module that they're not allowed to change (ala the official arm7 binary).  This way, all games can get at the common settings stored somewhere towards the end of firmware, and you won't have to reconfigure each game individually.
<br/>
<br/>
Even though the games can't update the booted portion of the firmware, there is a still a very small but finite chance that the wifi games will not work with a flashme'd DS.  The most likely potential cause is a security check that CRC's the firmware against a list of known versions, although this limits nintendo's options in the future, if they wish to release new firmware revisions later.
<br/>
<br/>
News on this later: I have two DSes, one flashme'd and one original, and will be trying out both with Mario Kart on release day, dumping the firmware before/after running it, and tweaking the config settings to see where it's stored in firmware ^_^<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

Sometimes you have to give something up to have another

(example: XBOX Live &amp; Homebrew/modded Xbox) Some people do it, and others dont.

If itt is the case where you cannot have a changed firmware, I would bet that most of use would revert back to the original firmware.........

IMO the DS will save wifi information to some of the unused firmware.
<br/>
Nothing else. Those screens are from The US/Eurpoean Mariokart. At least they look very similar to the japanese ones.
<br/>
Nintendo won't update the firmware, because what if someone turned it off half way throught the update? Bricked DS. People wouldm't like that.
<br/>
Or if the battery died? Nintendo make games consoles elegantly and simply. They won't want to do things like crazy firmware flashing. They have probably planned it all out from the beginning. Also what if people don't get mario kart? Then they would have an out dated firmware. This does mean that they could CRC check the firmware though. Unless the further update like the japanese Blue/Red, Nintendodogs thing. But unless they could write new CRC checks to carts....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you close the DS, you can't hit the power switch. Instead of going to sleep mode, the program could use the lid sensor to start the rewriting.

Nintendo cannot update the firmware without requiring you to short SL1.  They didn't design it correctly!  The BIOS will refuse to run a firmware that fails CRC check and most of the checked code (but not all, hence the ability to brick an unmodified DS, yet another stupid design flaw), lies within the 64 KB protection watershed (this applies to *BOTH* ST and sanyo flash DSes, there aren't any with only 256 or 512 bytes of protection).  This checked code contains a second check for the remaining portion of firmware, which could in theory be updated, except that the CRC for this portion is (you guessed it) stored below 64 KB also.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, CRC16 isn't very secure, and you should be able to engineer a collision for a modified binary, but this will require N different versions of the firmware update in your game, where N is the number of existing firmware revisions.  And you still can't update most of the bios, just the secondary load binaries (dunno what they do, haven't traced it out that far yet, but I'm guessing probably pictochat and the settings menu.  loopy probably knows).  Also, there really isn't very much room left in the firmware to put new features in.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo *could* have designed a core firmware that boots and runs DS and GBA games and fit within 64 KB, but also ran plugins from above 64 KB, to provide both security (against brickers) and expansion (for stuff like the wifi menu), but they did not.  End of story.
<br/>
<br/>
Like a lot of other features (e.g. XKEYS, rather than putting the damn buttons in KEYS, and thus giving you no interrupt on them, and added complexity), this just reeks of rushing the DS to production (don't get me wrong, most of the flaws in the firmware and BIOS probably would have been fixed had they taken more time on it, and made homebrew much harder, also we would have had to wait longer for mario 64 ds ^_^).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

You need the network settings set up befor you can even connect to the server. So storing them on the server would not be possible.
<br/>
<br/>
But I hope they have a reserved space in the DS. The same space that holds the personal information could possibly be used to store the wifi settings. The game would just provide the userinterface to edit these settings.

I was able to do the 3 contests for that day.
<br/>
<br/>
My theory on Ndogs is that it keeps track of the time, synching every now and then ,and keeps time in an internal clock. When it turns on it compares time with the DS and if it's off by more than say.... 30 seconds, it tells the game you just took a walk and taught all your tricks, then synchs the time. That's why when you set the clock ahead or switch DS's you can't walk for a while and can't teach that day's tricks. Even if you switch to another DS that is on the same time, it'll be off by anywhere from 30 seconds to a couple minutes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That is exactly how I am thinking. Much like on the PS2, where you have a singular network setup file, but any game can edit the file because every online game also contains the setup program (or some version of it).
<br/>
<br/>
Here though, there is no file to speak of, just a few bits of data held in RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't see how it is any different to store the player's username in RAM, and have it globally available to all games, then it is to have a WEP key similarly stored. It's not like we are talking about a lot of data here.
<br/>
<br/>
We are talking about, I would think at most, 1 KB of plain-text data. Probably less, depending on your actual setup.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I don't think that the DS keeps power to all of the system's RAM, but there is at least some portion that is always kept powered to store user data. Who is to say how large this portion is, and if Nintendo didn't allocate room there in the first place for WiFi settings (WiFi was one of the core design elements of the system), I have never seen it referenced in the Wiki or any other technical documents (though maybe I have missed it).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i didnt say you could use it over the internet.  The nwc wont be region encoded because that would totally defeat the point in it.

So would North American and European games have to have a hiragana/katakana font in order to be compatible with player names in Japanese? This is the big reason why the Pokemon games are incompatible, as the system designed to handle ASH and PIKACHU can't handle さとし and ピカチュー. Super Smash Bros. Melee has both Latin letters and kana in one game, but it might confuse a lot of people who wonder what these "funny hieroglyphics" are. Or would it transliterate player names into romaji whenever at least one Latin-only player is joined?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The DS already has a Japanese character set available to it in both Pictochat and the user setup screens (user name and such), so it isn't unreasonable to think most games would also support japanese characters. I think players would be smart enough to figure out that the wierd squiggles are japanese.
<br/>
<br/>
Do most Japanese players take Japanese-character usernames, or do that take westernized usernames? Either way, I think Nintendo would not allow Japanese players to play US players, simply because of the lag.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

after thinking about it.. sure, it would be enough for japanese and western language.. but what about china, russia, korea and all other countries? I don't really think that including every possible alphabet in the world is a solution.. probably we will se some f-ed up text on people with other charsets or possibly the nice boxes you often see on asian homepage if your browser don't support the charset ^^<br/>_________________<br/>go back to coding and stop screaming wolf :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Bit of a bump here, I know, but in a recent interview with Jim Merrick, the European director of marketing for Nintendo, he confirms that WiFi settings will be stored on the DS itself, and not on the games.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the article, in Spanish:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=NRV&amp;id=cw4364e1acb0d17&amp;&amp;iframe=1" target="_blank">http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=NRV&amp;id=cw4364e1acb0d17&amp;&amp;iframe=1</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The important bit translated:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote"> a little on Mario Kart and the WiFi subject. We already know that the game will bring the configuration options. It will be necessary to make these changes with each game or once done with Mario Kart they keep automatically in the console?
<br/>
Indeed, the console remembers it. We have up to 3 different configurations, 3 totally configurables profiles individually, and to choose the one that comes in each occasion: the one of house, the one of the work, and the one of hot-spots, to put an example.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like each game contains the WiFi setup utility, but the settings are written either to the DS flash or the RAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hope they put japanes characters in the us game and vice versa, because they did that with animal crossing: ww.

You sure... Since you loose all settings if you erase the firmware and have to reflash with FlashME failsafe.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, they do not get cleared, at least not by the removal of the battery.  The firmware identifies them as invalid because the RTC bit was cleared, and makes you enter the information.  If you ABXY out of flashme and dump the firmware after a battery disconnect, the info is still there.
<br/>
<br/>
Repeat after me, there is no battery backed RAM in the DS (except the few bits in the RTC).  All of the user settings are stored at the end of the firmware chip (two copies at end-0x100 and end-0x200, I forget how it decides which one to use).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
