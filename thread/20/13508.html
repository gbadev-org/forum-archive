    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there.
<br/>
I am quite new to the world of DS homebrew, so I need some help getting myself set up.
<br/>
<br/>
To make things clear, this is what I have:
<br/>
<br/>
A PC with an SD card reader
<br/>
A Nintendo DS lite.
<br/>
A M3Simply <a class="postlink" href="http://www.m3adapter.com/SLOT-1/main.htm" target="_blank">http://www.m3adapter.com/SLOT-1/main.htm</a>
<br/>
This data on my SD card: (screenshot)

<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have tried to install Moonshell, in order to try and play movies on my DS. All I did was copy the files to the /moonshl directory from the download, and attempted to run it, however, attempting to open a image or a movie failed.
<br/>
<br/>
I have downloaded "M3 Movie converter" and tried converting a sample movie and then play it on moonshell, but that didn't work either.
<br/>
<br/>
So, now I am stuck. If anyone knows what to do, I'd really appreciate the help. I don't speak Japanese and I find the directions in the simply manual/the moonshell site very confusing, so please help me out here :)
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, LittleMikey
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I can play games fine, there are no problems there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What do you mean by "failed" and "didn't work"? Did you see any files at all?
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we shouldn't help you at all, since you just showed us your piracy collection in a screenshot. :/<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
