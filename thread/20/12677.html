    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you want to convert an avi file which you already have on the DS <span style="font-style: italic">using</span> the DS or do you want to convert on a PC to use on the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
The former is not possible at the moment imo (maybe with ds linux?) but it certainly isn't feasible due to the lack of memory and processing power</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's called "dpgenc.exe" if I remember correctly.  Open it and then you can change the language if you like.  Change the conversion options before converting if you want to.  Then just drag and drop your files onto the dpgenc window itself to start the conversion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyhow Moonshell (use the newer versions instead of the ones maybe built into your cart) is your best bet for DS video (the only other one I can think of at this time is Birslip's old app (2005 era): <a href="http://drink-slurm.info/birslip/index.php?site=prjds" target="_blank">http://drink-slurm.info/birslip/index.php?site=prjds</a> ). Moonshell can play back files with the DPG extension for which there are 4 ways of making one that I know of.
<br/>
<br/>
By hand, my prefered way and argueably the most complex: DPG video is a special header followed by raw MP2 audio and MPEG1 video stream. Nowadays OGG audio is supported and there is a GOP list at the end of the video (for faster seeking).
<br/>
See all the guides all over the internet and this thread for more:
<br/>
<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7897" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=7897</a>
<br/>
I will also post back with info should you want it.
<br/>
<br/>
DPGenc, this is the official conversion software and it can handle a fairly large range of input (certainly all the ones listed by Eddy 912 save perhaps mov).
<br/>
<br/>
BatchDPG, started life as a frontend for DPGEnc and now is an encoding GUI in it's own right. The reliance on .NET (only a small app in the sound encoding stage requires it) is argueably the biggest detractor but the quality and resultant filesize are not to be argued with. It uses AVISynths directshowsource so anything able to be played on your PC (save DRM laden nastiness) should work.
<br/>
<br/>
EZBuilder, released to a few Chinese forums. One of the features is DPG encoding it's quality and options are up there with any of the methods already listed. It is not quite so fire and forget as the previous apps but very nice should you get it running. It accepts AVISynth input so you are limited only by your PC here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For quicktime video (ones with a mov extension) might I point you towards quicktime alternative:
