    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Today my Sonic Rush Adventure WiFi data was eradicated.(I'm SKing by the way)
<br/>
Is there anyway to backup, restore, and modify the WiFi section on that game card, and others?(The modding is only to fix the WiFi ranking and such)
<br/>
Hmmm... Since I'm using DS-X, I guess the app couldn't use FAT... I'll need the source so I can merge it with liblobby...(It's my only option)
<br/>
<br/>
On second thought, I forgot my DS-X is broke... It would be nice to know how to do these things anyway though...

<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about the Wifi section on the DS Cards, so when somebody plays the game and ruins the Wifi ranking and such, it can be fixed.(I am <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> talking about dumping the entire DS Card to whereever, this is about the Wifi data on the card)
<br/>
<br/>
I got my Sonic ranking back to where it was, but it would be great to get a good answer about this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just backup your entire savedata before someone else plays your game. After that, restore it back to the card... might be cheating, though. :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess I'll need to use my buggy and unfinished Nifi EEP app...
<br/>
liblobby crashes on it whenever the EEP size is larger than 512 bytes...
<br/>
Fortunately Sonic is that size. However, I'll need to finish the code to overwrite the eep.(It only does backup right now)
<br/>
<br/>
But, if I where to play on it, make some new records and such, the backup would become old and the new records would be lost... Would be great if I knew where the Wifi data is stored... Maybe it's at the end of the eep?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
