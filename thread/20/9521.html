    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just an idea i had...
<br/>
<br/>
for places where a Username and password are required, have one DS connect to the wireless network and enter the username and password, and a second DS connects to the network (and thereby the internet) via the first DS, so that WiFi Connection games and other online apps can gain access. a second DS is much cheaper than a WiFi capable laptop.
<br/>
<br/>
i'd do it myself except i don't have the coding knowledge yet, so this should be a nice, quick project for someone<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, I don't think you realise what's necessary for this to work. You need:
<br/>
<br/>
- SSL or maybe even some other encryption
<br/>
- a fully working web browser
<br/>
- a ICS host application (you don't realise how much work that is, do you?)
<br/>
- Ad-Hoc
<br/>
- an AP application for the DS
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, current WiFi Lib is crashing quite a lot. And another thing:
<br/>
DS's WiFi can only work at maximum on 2Mbit connection, and sharing this little among multiple devices would be horribly slow.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, DS has only one WiFi device, so it can't be a host and a client at the same time. 
<br/>
<br/>
And did you know that most of the password-protected public wifi hotspots register your MAC address when you log-in? So you could simply use DSLinux with Lynx (when it's optimised enough for it to work - and does it even support HTTPS or SSL?) to login, then turn off the DS and then connect with your WFC game.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

thats most...the wireless network at my uni needs a new login each session it seems.
<br/>
<br/>
i thought you'd just need to connect to the network (HTTP request to a site, the network jumps in and asks for username/password) then route packets between the second DS and the network. should have realised ad-hoc hadn't been done yet, but i thought SSL had been included since NDSMail is using it next release. oh well, i guess the device limitations itself will quickly end this idea anyway
