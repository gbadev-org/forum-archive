Can opera be created as a rom?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its very<span style="font-style: italic"> possible</span>. (and obviously we can do FAR better then links..dslinux has already got an equilivent if you want it).
<br/>
<br/>
It would take a lot of time and effort ,and it would never look as good as opera would.
<br/>
<br/>
Too routes I see are 
<br/>
<br/>
a) porting this:
<br/>
<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9702" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9702</a>
<br/>
Which needs to be heavily cut down.
<br/>
<br/>
b) building from scratch, working at it a tab at a time and generaly putting shitloads of effort into it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think a homebrew browser is needed though, no mater how bad it looks visualy, a hb browser can do so much more then the official opera will ever do.
<br/>
eg. Downloading stuff to FAT media. (ebook, mp3, rom ect)
<br/>
<br/>
What I can purhapes see happening is a very basic browser being made, then people makeing special simple html page websites for it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My own views for layout were based around the idea of the text being rendered onto a big sprite, which is in turn allowed to spread/scroll over 2 screens. Images could be decoded onto another sprite offscreen, then copyed onto the main one in the correct place when ready.
<br/>
(presumably images would be dealt with after text..dunno how fast any of this would work).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Its called retawq, iv got it partial ported to run directly on the ds, with a port of pdcurses but right now only have been successfull displaying the about screen and loading an html files from FATlib(broke this part somehow recently unfortunetly) most of the opensouce web browsers rely on filedescriptors for sockets and this is in progress in toolchain/libnds and then will eventually be added to the dswifi lib, so unless someone knows a browser that supports berkly sockets like features of whats available now, it will take a lot of work/time to write one from scratch.

Depends what you define as a browser really...we will never get stuff to look even remotely right without a heck of a lot of effort. true.
<br/>
<br/>
But it shouldnt be much work at all to merely display text, navigate links, and download.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
