I probobly done something wrong, but when i recently got my super* device I nevered went back to gbamp.  It works easier on the super* but on the gba,p it just boots up into a blank white screen.  BTW, I used chism hack as well.[/QUOTE]

His brother's DS already has FlashMe 7, but he adamantly refuses:
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;J_____&gt; I don't want it flashed because then I'd lose the intro screen.
<br/>
&lt;tepples&gt; But there's the stealth version, which keeps it.
<br/>
&lt;J_____&gt; I'm guessing that the new firmware fixes minor issues with commercial games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
