    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, I was checking out these pictures of the DSLite and found one that showed the SL1 port, still accessible from the battery area. But there isn't even a pink sticker this time.

<br/>
<br/>
That's interesting, though. Maybe it's just because this is a demonstration model?
<br/>
<br/>
Although... I wonder if that means that my normal DS's warranty is, in fact, not void...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Not forbidden anymore :/
<br/>
That mainboard is TINY!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I just stuck my DS's pink sticker on top of one of the LCD voltage pots when installing FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

This maybe a left over from prototyping (where they might be changing the firmware every hour or so with bugfixes and stuff) or it may be an easy way to reset a DS to factory (you know after you've sent it back for a repair and they send you a refurb that's been reset?).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ON the first prototype DS Lite Pics the SL1 was soldered over(no gap at all) so they could reflash it with out haveing to do anything. I can't remember where they are now but they where the first real pics ever.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
