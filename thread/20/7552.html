    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the link, and while that's certainly a fun little diversion, it's not quite what I'm talking about. Lumines, at least in my opinion, occupies that  middle-ground where it's not too taxing on the DS or PSP but impossible on the GBA. While that game was nice, suffice to say it felt like a GB game. Now that, with some better looking sprites, better backgrounds (maybe some nifty 3D elements), and better music (like some heart-pumping techno/dance, not that lame rap song that was in tepple's game) is what I'm talking about. Basically, something like this:

Luminesweeper is skinnable. If you want to use <a class="postlink" href="http://headkaze.webpal.info/lumines.htm" target="_blank">Headspin's skins</a> (or draw your own) and convert songs from your StepMania folder, that's fine by me. If you're complaining that better skins don't come bundled with the program, then perhaps we should organize another PayPal donation drive so that I can hire professionals to design skins ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
As for the "lame rap song", I chose "Da Bomb" by Kris Kross because what other song would you suggest that talks about dropping bombs? That skin is supposed to look like minesweeper, indirectly making fun of people who mispronounce Lumines as "Loo Mines" ['lu.majnz] instead of the correct "luminous" ['lu.mi.n@s]. And have you tried to drop more than 100 pieces in that game before pressing Alt+F4 in VBA? The skin changes every 100 pieces, just as in Lumines for PSP.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Believe me, I would if I knew how. And maybe this summer, when I have some time after graduation and I've got my M3, I'll try to learn how. This topic was just to sort of "feel the water" so to speak to see if such a thing would be possible with DS homebrew.

First off tepples, sorry if you took any offense to any of my comments. maybe I came off a little more critical than I actually was. I wasn't aware that your game was skinnable, and I guess that relieves some of the issues I had with it. And as for songs about dropping bombs, perhaps "Bombs Over Baghdad"? ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm still working on getting Luminesweeper cleaned up to the point where I can release the source. It might not happen until I port GSM Player to libgba and then port Luminesweeper to libgba.

But then how would it know which song goes with which skin, or which song goes at which tempo? If you're willing to edit .Lspec files to match GSM filenames in gsmsongs.gbfs, but you just don't want to run the GSM Player builder separately, you could paste the relevant parts of GSM Player builder's batch file at the beginning of Luminesweeper skin builder's batch file and use a version of SoX compiled with MP3 support.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

well for a start i doubt you'll wanna use gbfs with the gbamp, at least where mp3 support is concerned.  i dont know much about gsm player but if it doesnt do the job theres nothing stopping you from using the port of libmad that moonlight made for moonshell.

a similar idea could be used for custom skins(ie it looks a directory "skins"  on the cf card and uses them).  not worth worry about now though but stuff for later should you get there</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still wouldn't help with the tempo issue. The game engine needs to know the song's BPM so that it can know how fast to move the sweeper (one pass every 16 eighth notes).

If you're asking what I think you're asking...the tempo of the music is a big factor in Lumines. As the music gets faster or slower, the sweep bar that clears completed blocks off the screen moves across faster or slower, which changes the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The tempo issue would be solved by requiring an *.Lspec for every song with the temp stored in there.

I eventually discontinued it, as I honestly hate the game (no matter what system it's on), and I was only cloning it as a learning experience.  I dropped the project in favour of more interesting things.  (I'm currently thinking about trying my hand at an Internet Radio client).

<br/>
Yes, it uses Chishm's FAT driver. I'm planning to make it moddable in an easy kind of way once the menus get in a working state. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the SD version, well, its still in a testing phase.... so not yet. Eventually, I plan to make a CF version as well as a "linked" version for FC owners. If the SD driver works the same way, I can compile a version that way as well, but I won't be able to test it.
<br/>
<br/>
I won't start putting out multiple releases until its in a resonably bug free state though.
<br/>
<br/>
No music due to the fact that I can't find anyone to write music that would work well with it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, copyrights and stuff.... :P
<br/>
<br/>
It can't really be existing music, at least not the way I want to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning to use small (~5-10sec) loops. Each loop can progress to the next one seamlessly, but can also be looped endlessly. Every time the player clears 9 or more blocks in a single sweep, it advances to the next loop. After, say, 5 clears or so, it switches to the next theme.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how Lumines does it, but thats what I think would work well (This is also how Lumixed does it, and thats my main point of reference at this time)
<br/>
<br/>
If you want a good example, look at the music in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dakurv.com/lumixed/" target="_blank">lumixed</a>.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I've read that Lumines goes on to the next 8-beat loop if you have at least 1 clear on one pass and that it goes to the next skin after every 4 or 5 levels. I don't know what constitutes a "level" in Lumines, but at least Kaikai's clone adds a level after every 100 single blocks are removed from the board, which in the end is equivalent to what I implemented (adding a level after every 100 single blocks (25 pieces) are <span style="font-style: italic">added to</span> the board).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
