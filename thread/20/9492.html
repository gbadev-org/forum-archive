Unless I'm missing something, just encode your file in mono.  All the audo plugins I've looked at use a full decoder implementation, and should do the correct thing with a mono input file, auto detecting as needed.
<br/>
<br/>
(Also, if you want minimal file sizes, I'd recommend using Ogg Vorbis.  Gets the best compression for audio quality of all the stock audio formats (except midi - but that's a special case).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, this is quite cool. :)  I just found it doesn't seem to make thumbnails for GIF files though.  Even if it just made a JPG of them that'd be ok.  Maybe in another release.  Only reason I noticed it is that I had a bunch of this one webcomic in a folder (Underpower) and some of the early ones were GIF images.  I don't even use GIF a heck of a lot usually.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Config stuff for thumbnails now, and a bugfix with the verticalpadding of images in dual screen image viewing mode. :)  Further down in the post he seems to be saying he's gonna try to figure out the M3's memory further...I guess you can only access 8 MB at a time and it has some kind of a 'paging' system?  Sounds confusing...must be able to use it all though as the M3's own software does (of course).

that would be great to have (he can even make it part of the .ini on how long to wait... or have the up and down arrows decide :) )

for image size,

i think it should be a .ini again where you can decide what to start at :P...

the off screen thing,

i think that you should have a arrow pad thing on the bottom screen telling you where the styles is draging the image,

and you should see the image on the top screen :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There have been some very nice additions since the last time I downloaded Moonshell... the PC end of things seems to be much more manageable now, too!
<br/>
<br/>
I notice one flaw at the moment:
<br/>
With older versions, I could set the BacklightTimeout for things to -1, which would mean that the backlight never switches off.
<br/>
For some reason, I can no longer do that :(
<br/>
Instead, when I open an image, the backlight flips on and off violently. The system shuts down shortly afterwards. (Which is interesting... perhaps some kind of hardware safety feature?)
<br/>
<br/>
The image viewer is being a bit fiddly for me.
<br/>
I like how it goes into a fullscreen mode... however, when I scroll the image, it goes back into normal mode, which makes it useless for big images.
<br/>
I'm finding it a bit hard to get used to having the file information for images drawn on top of the image I am viewing instead of a seperate window.
<br/>
Still, the two screen image viewing is something that I've always wanted but been afraid to ask for!
<br/>
Is it possible to set the image viewer to go to full-screen mode without scrollbars or window title instantly? Or perhaps to press a button to do this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, I am noticing much faster booting speeds, faster opening of text files, and smoother video playback.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it looks like most of my problems can be solved by playing around with Global.ini... and I just remembered that DSOrganize has a syntax editor for ini files, so I can do it entirely through my DS :)
<br/>
Great job, Moonlight, as always!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Yeah, switching the light on and off too fast will trigger a protection circuit and shut it down. I think it'd have to be a lot faster than you could really see, though. FlashMe fades it in by flashing it really fast, so it'd be even faster than that.
