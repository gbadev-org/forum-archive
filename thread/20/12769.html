I have converted my adaptor to a softAP in the past but found many problems to show up which messed up my internet connection. So now I use the USB with the official software.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not until somebody dumps and disassembles the official Wi-Fi library to see how it is handshaking with the dongle. Given the prevailing attitude on gbadev.org against distribution of tools capable of dumping DS Game Cards, that's not likely to happen soon.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
