    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to all this tech stuff, so go easy on me.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a writer for a games website and I'm looking to start taking my own (decent quality) screenshots, rather than using the ones from GamesPress. I asked on there how I'd be able to take shots and got a link to here. I'm not interested in just taking shots direct from the game with a digi camera - I actually want to be able to connect it up to my PC and use some screen capture software to do the rest. I've had it suggested to me that I need to use homebrew to get started, so if anyone could talk a thickie Luddite like myself through the necessary, I'd be hugely indebted to them.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can assist in ANY small way, I'd be massively grateful. This really is quite important to me, and I'd really appreciate any assistance you might be able to provide.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,
<br/>
<br/>
Chris</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

About IS-NITRO-CAPTURE... damn NOA just won't reply to Europeans and NOE doesn't know what is. Great!
<br/>
<br/>
I so wish there will be custom hardware or homebrew to capture screenshots (both screens) and maybe even video just like the official device.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How expensive are we talking?
<br/>
<br/>
So GBA cap is possible then? How's that accomplished? That'd be a start, as the reason I'm doing it is partly for the site, and partly because I need it for freelance purposes.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Semi-off-topic, but I'd like to see more digicam DS screenshots on the web, since I find the screenshots and videos (mostly the videos) taken with the official DS capture software inferior-looking than the DS's own output. I think a good camera, with manually-adjusted focus and at good lighting conditions could provide a much better impression of how the game will look in actual hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Right before the DS launch, I was very concerned about the excessive graininess and aliasing in the screenshots and videos I saw of Metroid and Mario 64. It looked really low res, the polygons seemed to shake too much while moving, almost PSOne-like. I was puzzled, because the videos from the E3 demos looked much smoother (I didn't really notice the DS had no texture filtering until I looked very hard at a Mario Kart DS video back in the day).
<br/>
<br/>
But when I saw camera-captured videos of Mario 64, it looked totally different. I couldn't see aliasing at all, the movement was very smooth and the colors looked much softer and easier on the eyes. When I got my DS, the Metroid demo looked far better than the videos I had grabbed on IGN. It's almost as if there was no anti-aliasing at all in the direct-captured videos. Nanostray, as example, looks super smooth running on the DS screens, but looks extremly aliased in the videos (the colors are also a bit off - it's smoother in the DS screens).
<br/>
<br/>
Videos would benefit the most from using a camera, because the direct-capture lacks the native DS screen ghosting, that plays a good part in making the movement smooth. The ghosting completly hides the lack of texture filtering in many textures of fast-moving games,  like Nanostray and Mario Kart DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If one could get the specs and diagrams on one of these units, perhaps they can post them so others can modify their DS's manually. Of course, it would probably rob Nintendo of much money. Ah well.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
