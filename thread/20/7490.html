<br/>
to be honest, its about bloody time Nintendo Australia actually did something. does anyone know if NOA, NOE and NCL are offering similar functionality in other parts of the world, cos all i've heard is its just online play
<br/>
<br/>
also shows that sgstairs new project looks like its possible :-D
<br/>
<br/>
i'll see you all online on November 17 :-D
<br/>
<br/>
edit: changed the topic<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sebbo on Fri Nov 18, 2005 10:46 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Hmz....but if this means they can send demos ver any wi-fi hotspot, dosnt that mean at some point we will be able to download demos (officialy) from my PC ?

Purhapes off Nintendo wi-fi site.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is some speculation that the Nintendo USB WIFI adapter might be able to host demos too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dont think so.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo is piggy-backing on existing inferstructures, they are not literaly setting up their own wi-fi systems at thousands of locations.
<br/>
Software only, if anything.
<br/>
<br/>
So I dont see why, say, a McDonalds spot would be able to host demos, but not a home router.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perhaps the McHotspot has a Linksys router whose firmware has been customized to handle Ni-Fi in addition to IPv4.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so the special Bark Mode function is more just a simulated one side bark mode then? don't i feel stupid...ahh well, nice to see Nintendo Australia being a bit more aggressive for once...the demos sound interesting tho
<br/>
<br/>
what sort of features are available in NWC over in the states?
