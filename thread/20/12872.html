<br/>
All I know is that the key combo works under windows but wine seems to ignore it making the debugger almost useless under Linux.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the latest version of no$gba doesn't seem to work either, crashes out with GetGlyphOutline being unimplemented.
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts/ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It works perfectly, I wish I could speed it up a bit though but 70-80% is fast enough and now I can switch between CPUs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
