    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">One thing that has really suprised me is that nobody has yet (that i have seen) created a Linux live CD with the specific purpose of DS/GBA development
<br/>
<br/>
it seems like the perfect candidate, as long as the OS boots correctly, and you have USB support, there shouldnt be any issues. hardware not being dectected/utilised correctly isnt an issue when all you need is 2D, and a USB disk
<br/>
<br/>
As long as the USB works fine (Never seen a pc where USB hasnt been seen fine) you could store your Source files there.
<br/>
<br/>
many flashcarts either function via usb plugin (ala DS-X and Firelinker), or use flash cards, which most of the time are read by usb devices, so you could upload created .NDS straight to most Carts
<br/>
<br/>
It would also make documenting how to use the development software+enviroment much easyer, as you could have just one to aim for
<br/>
<br/>
Heck, i'd chip in ?15 if somebody did a full version of this, prehaps updated it once a month.
<br/>
<br/>
(there are even tools for Knoppix and Slax to make it really easy, you could probably do it in a few hours with the know-how, i just wish i understood linux better)
<br/>
<br/>
You could even do a USB version (and likely make it &lt;40MB) and sell it, and give the proceeds to the developers of Devkit, and so on</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Support would be so much easyer if you knew the exact enviroment the troubled user was in
<br/>
<br/>
it ofc , also makes it much easyer for a new user to wet his feet
<br/>
<br/>
Everything is a constant, so you can write (and put on the disk) a tutorial that walks the user through all of the basic steps of creating a basic program
<br/>
<br/>
Its a couple of hours work for somebody who knows the Toolchain and the OS well, so i ask, why not? ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
While I do believe that Windows is a completely worthless platform to be programming on, this certainly isn't the best answer. The person would be much, much, better off just installing everything onto their machine, dual booting if they want.
<br/>
<br/>
If you can't figure out how to install Ubuntu or one of the other "friendly" distributions, there is no way you are going to be programming anything of any use in the first place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

heh, a live CD doesnt boot on the DS
<br/>
<br/>
its a CD based copy that you boot on your pc
<br/>
<br/>
And TJ has highlighted exactly what i was getting at
<br/>
<br/>
your right, windows is just a mess to use, so you expect somebody to install an entire OS, just so they can see if they like Developing for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
thats a touch Elitist
<br/>
<br/>
It doesnt matter if a user doesnt end up making somthing "Useful" , if more people try out DS dev because it doesnt require installing an OS, it would increase the public mindshare about Homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
And besides, if they decide they like it, they can install it from the CD to the PC
<br/>
<br/>
@Hyperhacker, lay off the coffee mate :P
<br/>
Linux has versions of Messanging clients, media players, and i'm pretty certain there are textpad programs ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and FYI, my laptop dual boots ubuntu, but is only booted into for Devkitpro as the hardware doesnt support linux well at all</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Great point, You ofc could do both
<br/>
<br/>
you could boot to USB, have the whole OS there and your projects
<br/>
<br/>
same OS, same enviroment, same projects
<br/>
<br/>
and ofc, its easy to simply copy a project from USB&gt;Main PC and the other way
<br/>
<br/>
As for windows vs linux for programming, thats not a can of worms i want to open and derrail the thread (theres plenty of discussion on the web about that already)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're on the go and want to code on another computer for some reason, this could work. But like tepples mentioned, a portable version of DKP would work better for this.

I did something similar to this a while back, but I had a VB.NET app get its path and pass the drive letter from that to a batch file that setup the environment. It worked great, when the machine I was  trying to run the CD from had .NET installed.

Still, where's the point? You won't magically be able to programm just by having all the tools in one place. You either know what you're doing already or you don't, but setting up the development environment should be the least of your problems. If you "just want to find out" whether you like developing for the DS you'd better start reading GBATek, IMHO.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cry me a river. I don't use Vista and you probably shouldn't either. My home system has both Windows XP and Linux installed while my work PC has only Linux. I don't have any problem doing DS dev if I need to. 
<br/>
<br/>
Installing DKA is not a lengthy process or a tiresome process. Text editors are not hard to find for either platform. Compilation and testing is easy enough to do on either platform.
<br/>
<br/>
There's still be no good explanation as to why one needs a Live Linux distro just for DS development. 
<br/>
<br/>
Are you some kind of ultra-mobile person who operates only from internet cafes?
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you feel the need to develop on other people's PC's only?
<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, though, I suspect there is not real justification for creating a live Linux distro for DS development other than for the "Ain't It Cool!" Factor, which is largely disposable in my opinion (Kinda like the attempts, every now and then, to get GCC up and running in DSLinux, so that some silly fool or other can have the joy of typing make in his or her DS and tapping out code at a rate of 1 line per 2 minutes on the touchscreen...)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

As I said before I support portable applications, I was just saying a live cd ISO would ensure compatability. I'm not in desperate need of an ISO, I already have my development environment. 
<br/>
<br/>
The ISO would have DKP preinstalled, so once the ISO is booted, you can jump straight into dev-ing (once you start learning of course). Problem with a live-cd is updating everytime DKP is updated, and of course including other libarys (like PAlib).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've got feeling that a lot of people trying to get a port of GCC on DSLinux are only interested in using the DS as a wireless 'cracking' tool, as they normally ask for stuff like Kismet as well.  Anyone with half a brain understands the complete uselessness of having GCC on such underpowered device, especially when you can use ssh/ftp to create and collect binaries off an external server.

If I may remind youu, Dell recently reversed their decision to pre-install only Vista on new PCs. They once more offer the option to install Windows XP. They've also started offering pre-installed Linux options :-)

I have no idea about the windows situation, but on my linux system it's quite easy to get DKA up and running under a normal user account. If this is not the case in Windows, well, ouch, too bad I guess.

Somehow I imagine that's the exception rather than the rule. Feel free to put together a custom live distro for your cousin though. Might make a nice geek birthday present...

There is no better way to spend your bus time than playing Animal Crossing. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, hmmmmmmmm?

Have you tried reinstalling Devkit from stratch with a slow internet? Atleast with an ISO you could put it on a download manager quick and easilly, and once you have it you can easilly burn it onto a CD.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Perhaps you should reconsider your choice of OS if it's that necessary to re-install so often. If you're doing it just for fun, though, that's your grave.
<br/>
<br/>
As for installing DKA from scratch, here's a lesson for the lazy:
<br/>
<br/>
Do Not Use The Internet Installer. You'll save yourself time and slow-connection hassles by just having the zips pre-downloaded.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're not compentent enough to install DKA on Windows using the zip's from SourceForge, then you're not competent enough to use DKA.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me outline the ridiculousness of this all to you, though...
<br/>
<br/>
You want to package up a Linux distro simply to run a piece of software that comes in at under 20mb compressed. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you're still set on it, though, maybe you should look into simply adding DKA into the Damn Small Linux distro? Possibly a less foolish idea than custom-creating a Linux Live CD for DKA...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

*points to begining of thread, where i mentioned that there are LiveCD/USB Distos in place, which only require a couple of hours to setup with the packages needed*
<br/>
<br/>
As for Reconsidering OS, Once i can run 99% of availible software on linux, run all the latest and greatest games full speed, and not need to spend an hour tweaking WINE etc (only to find somthing doesnt work), i'll use Linux full time
<br/>
<br/>
Until then, Windows will be my primary OS
<br/>
<br/>
you use Linux, how nice for you, that doesnt make anybody using Windows less important/relevant to the Development team than you
<br/>
<br/>
Your posts all reek of *its not useful/Relevant for me, so it cant be useful/Relevant period*

Somebody mentioned that to make anything significant with the toolchain you need the know-how to do other advanced things
<br/>

tell me this, how many kids with Chemestry sets did anything useful, any kids cure cancer?

You'll prevent my kid from getting a Chemestry set over my dead body, useful or not ;)

Here at my workplace we try not to play games. It tends to get in the way of actual work. Hence, Linux is a good choice.
<br/>
<br/>
I find it a good choice at home as well. I do all my gaming on the DS and hence Windows is now largely irrelevant for me, so I just don't use it very much at all.

No, it reeks of "I don't have the patience to deal with people who are too stupid to even get DKA set up on Windows". 
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said before. If you're not "qualified" to use DKA on windows, you're not "qualified" to program for the DS. And by qualified I mean competent, in this case.

You know, somehow I suspect that DragonMinded is not a 14-year old kid. Same goes for WinterMute, SimonJHall, Lick and the rest of the GBADev crew who actually produce stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
I see no reason to pander to kiddies when they don't actually do much more they post "I have this great plan for a game! Can someone tell me what a GCC is so I can make it?!?"
