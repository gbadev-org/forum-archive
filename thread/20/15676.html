    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay so I found Dserail, DSrobot, and a couple other companies like that. I was so happy that I could make one of my robots to use a DS instead of a micro controller then buying a wi-fi adapter, a microphone, etc... So then I found that Dserail is discontinued!!! I remember reading that the GBA port has I/O ports, would it be possible to use a slot-1 program(LIBnds) and a GBA I/O at the bottom? Also if there is just schematics of an idea on how to do it, that would be appreciated.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, you can access the SLOT2 from the ARM9, you just have to route / map the slot to the processor. :^)

<br/>
IIrc, there are some schematics floating around the net, with which you could build your own DSserial.
