Hopes for the future:
<br/>
<br/>
Are you planning to make a graphical interface (or similiar) for it?
<br/>
<br/>
Any changes you could ^draw^ more letters and save them?
<br/>
*I'm dreaming of a Window$ Notepad like memo for the DS, humming...*
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be too difficult to add multilingual support for it (for drawing letters like: ?, ?, ?)?<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSMerlin is just a library that others are free to use in their own projects.  I won't really be developing a gui for it since that's the job of the application developer to make a gui that fits with their app.
<br/>
<br/>
Drawing your own letters and symbols WOULD be a very neat feature.  You could even set up your own gesture-based macro system.  But that would involve reading and writing files to the flash card (to save the patterns of the symbols you drew).  Not impossible by any means, but I'm not ready to tackle that just yet. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, adding support for symbols in other languages is no problem.  I'll be happy to do it once there's an actual need.  As of now, and AFAIK, the only program to use DSMerlin is my own demo and poffy's poffPad, and I think he has stopped working on poffPad.  So if anyone else decides it's worth using in their app I'll put more time into it, but it's not really worth developing further if no one is goign to use it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Possibly more examples of using the library might qualify.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
-- You know, the human.
