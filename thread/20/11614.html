    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just an idea:
<br/>
<br/>
What if we had an OS for the DS capable of loading "programs" into the RAM of Supercards/M3's or the DS RAM - although I believe this to be too small. You may say that we already have DSLinux but I believe that DSLinux is not people friendly and also not specifically designed for the DS (especially colour).
<br/>
This OS should be easy to have programs written for it and developers can leave out certain features that will be incorporated into the OS: for example closing the lid of the DS to turn off the screens. 
<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the advantages of this idea is simpler programming, the ability to run more than  one applications at a time, and easy to use.
<br/>
<br/>
The disadvatages, in my opinion, is the limited space of RAM when using devices without added RAM i.e. GBAMP.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, there are some problems...
<br/>
<br/>
The extra memory in the SC and M3 devices is not as fast as the DS's main memory. This would end up being a problem in the long run, I thinnk...
<br/>
<br/>
However, more importantly, OS's are never "simple programming". Implementing one with support for multiple processes/threads would be an added burden.
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I just can't see much point in this at the moment. DSLinux is a good OS, but in many ways it's not really necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
The "features" that you rather have implemented by the OS could just as easily be implemented in the form of a library that can be plugged into existing homebrew projects (Lick's new libcartreset is a good example of this...)
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think it would be nice if someone would write a libscm3ram library, something that would allow easy access for non-DSLinux programs to the extra memory of the SC and M3...
<br/>
<br/>
But a custom written OS? Seems a little overkill to me...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: In case anyone gets the idea that I'm bashing DSLinux in the above post, I'm not. What I basically meant was that while DSLinux is a great OS, the DS itself does not really need an OS in the traditional sense to function as a workable device. In other words, it's not like a PC or something similar that's essentially useless without a proper OS installed. Hence a full-scale OS for the DS is not quite as essential as it is for the PC. Nevertheless, we already have one full-scale OS for the DS (DSLinux) and a damn good one at that. Which is why I don't see the point in writing a fresh OS of the kind described...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

This program will hopefully replace .nds by adding a program environment capable of doing mainly everything with only a little RAM used in retrospect (for SC/M3 anyway).

I'm afraid that I will have no chance in programming something like this - I can barely manage flash - so I'm trying to spread my ideas to programmers.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What about WinDS ? Isnt that an OS? Multi-tasks and such fine at least. Just dosnt have much usefull on it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, imo an OS dosnt suit the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
You dont need an OS to have the features of an OS, you just need people working to some agreed standards so programs can be switched seamlessly.
<br/>
<br/>
eg.
<br/>
Wouldnt it be nice if file extensions triggered certain programs to load up?
<br/>
<br/>
Theres lots of fairly easy way to do that, none of them need a OS as such. (at least, no moreso then Moonshell and DSOrganiser).
<br/>
<br/>
But it would need agreement. The boot program would need to look at the file extension, cross check it with a list of programs in a agreed directory, and if it finds a match it saves the file location in ram, and boots the relivent program.
<br/>
The program then looks at the agreed location in ram so it knows what file to open, and then it opens it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====
<br/>
More advanced features could also mean "faked" multi-tasking.
<br/>
eg. Having a piece of music playing when your using a few seperate programs.
<br/>
No multitasking at all...all the programs merely have a lib to play the sound file, and they "share" the information as to what sound file was playing, and how far into the song it was.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Personaly, I am really missing the ability to listen to music and read at the same time.  STILL the GBAMP's default game-boy firmware beats the DS homebrewers and that upsets me a tad ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I could, of course, list loads of other wish-features. (..standard save dialogue box that everyone can put in their progs easily..)
<br/>
<br/>
Ranging from easy to hard.
<br/>
But Id still say all are easier then making an OS, and they are certainly more ram-efficient.

btw, did anyone else see the Moonshell creator made a boot from Vram program? :p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I think it would probably be a bit easier and more stable to write a multi-threaded sound/input library for the ARM7 that can be used nice and easily. That way pretty every program using the library could integrate this desire for playing music in the background while reading small-font text on an itsy-bitsy screen that everyone has ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know, there are problems with that idea too, but the whole "faked" multi-tasking thing sounds a little dubious and likely to cause problems galore if someone tried to implement it...
<br/>
<br/>
I think a better bet would be a standardised ARM7 binary or source frame-work that uses multi-tasking to support all these functions people seem to want going on at once.

Or something...

Dont get my wrong, Im not expecting perfection...there would be a pause or a jump when switching programs.
<br/>
But I think a seconds "jump" in the soundtrack when switching would be acceptable. So it wouldnt be the smoothest way.

<br/>
But I dont think there would be much problems as such, certainly not as much as true multi-tasking, and the additional resource usage that requires.

DSLinux dosnt have to get an advanced GUI to be more usefull.
<br/>
Look at Moonshell...the windows and such on the bottom screen are nice, but not essiential for anything.
<br/>
Its the fast scrolling list at the top that does all the work.
<br/>
<br/>
Windows, fancy backdrops, frames...not needed.
<br/>
But fast program access using nothing but Dpad and "A"? Yes....that would instantly make "the rest" interested :p
<br/>
<br/>
(ok, in reality its a little more complex then that, youd need a moonshell style list and some sort of task-switching tab...but thats about it, imo)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Technically a pretty nifty entry systemn could be implemented using the current keys avaiable on the DS. Problem is, it would entail learning a new input style.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, you can cover the basic key needs with the D-Pad, ABXY buttons and L/R trigger...
<br/>
<br/>
D-Pad + ABXY + L Trigger gives you 32 key combos and you'd be able to use the R trigger to switch combo-sets for things like numbers, symbols, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
As I said, it would be tricky to learn, but I reckon you could get a nice input speed up once you got going. Whether your DS's buttons would survive the experience is anyones guess...
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I was thinking of putting together a little mini-app to test it and see how well it would work :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Anyways, if people want some kind of OS on the DS, isn't it a good thing to look at the xbox/xbox360 OS and the psp firmware? Like how it's arrangend and how the buttons are used?
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if an OS is really needed. But I do think it's nice to return to your DSOrganizer/Moonshell App or whatever App you used when you launched some homebrew application and ended that application. Reading while listening to music or occasionally playing a video file should probably a feature plus a file manager.
<br/>
<br/>
Or should it include all of the above and even more. And provide an basic API set for the DS it's functions which can be used in your homebrew application?<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hehehe, you need to download DSL more often Tepples :-) Most of the current builds bypass the login prompt...

I find it bizarre that they can tie up predictive text so thoroughly. I mean, I would imagine the specific algorithms behind T9 and other similar algorithms to be patented, but I don't quite see how they could patent the entirety of predicive text in itself. Still, if that's what they've done, then it sucks indeed...
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmmm, I'm sure there's probably a way to reproduce the ultimate effect of predictive text without violating the T9 patents et al, it would just take a bit of thinking. Possibly some kind of dictionary system. I was initially thinking of a hash table, but I'm not sure how you'd handle partial hashes...there's probably ways though :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

In any case, yes DSLinux isn't exactly user friendly, especially for new users.  But still, it's the only multitasking OS currently available for the DS, correct?

It seems to small compared to other things being talked about.

jenswa says a lot of good points about looking at console firmwares. Id extend that down, and even look at the GBAMP's firmware. It really dosnt take much to make a GUI suitable for a handheld, and hence make Linux faster to use.

You keep talking about "simple" interface as if your dealing with people that cant handle the current one. This isnt a question of idiots wanted something like XP. This isnt a mater of skill level at all. 
<br/>
<br/>
What we are asking for is a QUICKER interface, as text based input on a machine without a keyboard is very slow. Slow and repedative.
<br/>
You are of course right,developing Linux is a great education excerise for learning the hardware. 
<br/>
<br/>
But when every time someone suggests "wouldnt it be nice to listen to music and read at the same time", theres always someone says "nay nay Linux already does it". But it dosnt do it <span style="font-style: italic">practicaly</span>. Its no good for <span style="font-style: italic">casual use</span>, whatever your skill level.
<br/>
<br/>
Im very at home with DOS,but i still wouldnt put up with a CD player that demanded it every time i wanted to change the track. Do you see?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My own view is it seems odd that so much skill and effort is put into the hard stuff, that its odd that the relatively easy task of making a GUI is forgotten.
<br/>
Im also scared that a massively complex, resource-grabbing windows-style gui is going to be attempted....which is very impressive....but likely not to be as suitable as, say, the sort of GUI (top of)moonshell,DSorganisers, or even typical mobile phones have.
<br/>
I dont know, maybe linux infects people after awhile...the need to do everything the hard way makes people feel l33t :p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
