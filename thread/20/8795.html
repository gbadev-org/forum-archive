    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A lot of developers have made homebrews that have TCP/IP functions and have been waiting for sgstairs WiFi Lib to develop TCP. Anyone want to come out of the framework and post any links to homebrew you know that's on hold until sgstair updates his lib seeing as it seems to be soon according to his last update?
<br/>
<br/>
These following links are to WiFi based programs that have the interface worked on, and are waiting for TCP/IP:<ul>

Anyone know of any others that seem promising?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, yes, those. Those, however, are functional as their base function is local control. I was thinking more of homebrews that were pretty much 'useless' without TCP/IP (IM, Chatting, Web Surfing, etc) that have just been sitting and waiting, and therefore not really known about. This way we can bring some apps to light just before they get their functionality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
