    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How?
<br/>
Isn't the entire visual end handled by the DS, with the M3 simply supplying data?
<br/>
As far as I know (which, mind, isn't very far), the M3 would have no way to get this information...
<br/>
Edit: I suppose it is plausible, but having it run reliably may be a bit complicated.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">M3 could indeed do something like that, a patch similar to the reset patch could be used that jumps to some code that dumps the screens raw data to files on the SD card, unfortunately this would only work on things that they can currently patch (and their focus is definitely not homebrew patching). Also, the currently running file name is stored in the M3's internal memory so that it knows where to backup the SRAM to on the next boot.
<br/>
<br/>
edit:/ after having a look around, I think I'd much wrather sign a petition for them to get homebrew running "properly" on the M3/G6 first...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Blackmail" would work almost as well as a petition. Without proper homebrew support, the devices are good only for running backups, which may not be a substantial non-infringing use. Start with a polite request for help in developing libraries to read and write a file system from homebrew software, and after the third denial: "Please help us out with the library so that we don't have to ask for help from Nintendo or the feds." And because we're requesting something that we have a colorable right to have under U.S. copyright law as interpreted in <span style="font-style: italic">Betamax</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Grokster</span>, such a prelude to a cease-and-desist notice is likely not to be considered criminal blackmail.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm willing to bet that their compatibility issue is within their launcher software..which I really don't care about, because pretty soon they're switching to MoonShell, which is 100 times better, anyway.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I asked them (politely) for info/public support for using their devices with a FAT type system like chishm's library, and it has been ignored entirely (approx 6 weeks ago now). (consider this: M3 is region locked, the DS is not...does this sound like a step to support <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> community effort?)
<br/>
<br/>
So far as I see, reading sectors on the SD isnt a problem, and read/write sectors on the CF isnt a problem. With limited experimentation using current FAT from chishm (uncommenting the write stuff), SD writes erase the bootstrap (making the card not recognizeable by windows) but does indeed write what you tell it to the SD.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: just because they are moving to moonshell does not mean they will use moonshells .nds start routines. They could very well just be transplanting that from their "old" kernel sources wrather than improving it.
