    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Very new to the homebrew scene for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Recently Flashme'd the DS, and have an M3 (the SD one).
<br/>
<br/>
Now, upon bootup, it goes to the NDS Movie Player. It looks to me like it's a slightly altered version of the original GBA movie player.
<br/>
<br/>
Hitting 'Select' takes me to Moonshell - a much nicer environment and more visually pleasing.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a few questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Can I make the DS boot right into Moonshell?
<br/>
<br/>
2) If not, can I make the "This product is NOT produced, licensed, or supported by Nintendo" splash screen go away?
<br/>
<br/>
3) In Moonshell, can you launch applications and homebrew code? It has a Game button/tab, but how does one go about executing anything?
<br/>
<br/>
If you can provide any answers or point me to a document or webpage that does, thank you very much!!

Sadly, none of these things have been implemented into the M3 yet. Supposedly, M3 team is trying to get homebrew and roms running directly from the Moonshell shell, if/when this happens, the main menu will be replaced with the M3... As of right now, the M3 firmware hasn't been hacked, so there's no way to remove that message, and sadly, there's no talks of it being removed either.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been following this stuff for a long time, so I'm waiting for anything like what you're asking to be implemented, but who knows if/when that will happen. Instead of fixing problems with the current firmware (like GBA - NDS rom linking, that was added a few updates ago, but barely works, if at all - for reference sake, GBA - NDS rom linking is the ability to cause an NDS rom to believe there's a certain GBA game in the GBA slot - nice feature, useless if it doesn't work), they choose to keep adding more and more features ( the PDA - which is still only in Chinese and thusly useless to anyone not able to read Chinese).<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

Thanks for answering my questions though!

So... what exactly is moonshell good for currently?
<br/>
It plays music and movies but so does the NDS Movie Player by M3.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The newest version of the extended moonshell plays a new format - DSM, which some people claim is a better, higher quality format - but there are no tools currently to make it (at least not publicly available). It also allows you to view multiple media at the same time - i.e. listen to music while reading a book, or any of a number of other combinations.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The point, eventually, of the extended moonshell for the M3 will be to play DSM files... AFAIK, it will also play older files, DPG and even GBM, etc... but a DSM file is, like a DPG file, a single audio/video file, and supposedly is better quality... from the test they showed, it looked like better color rendering, better quality sound, but fewer FPS, and the file size was a few hundred K larger for the DSM over the DPG... when people are given a good encoder for DSM, and people use that encoder versus the BatchDPG encoder, then we'll see some better, more real world tests of the two formats.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

1) Yes you can make your M3 boot right into Moonshell(The one that is build right in M3). Upon turning on your DS press and hold down the "START" button and it will load right into Moonshell instead of M3's default menu.
<br/>
<br/>
2) No at this point its not possible unless someone is able to hack the firmware
<br/>
<br/>
3) You cant run application/homebrew codes from the build in Moonshell. This function has yet to be implement into M3's Moonshellas of today. However if you install the original Moonshell, you can run application/homebrew codes right from Moonshell. But this is not really necessary since you can always run homebrews right from M3's menu using the Game menu.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
this is not 100% true. althou its video n sound on 1 file instead of seperate files, but there's still cases where by video and sound come unsync. If i dont remember wrongly, you can sync the video n sound for M3's format if they happen to go unsync but this cant be done if you are watching dpg. But all in all I still suggest using dpg for its small file size as compare to M3's gbm/gbs format. And we can probably wait for M3 to release the converter for their new DSM format which is definitely much better than existing dpg format</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does anybody know what this error means?
<br/>
<br/>
"NDS GAME SAVE in card but CANNOT find ATUOSAVE backup file. Backup fail! Press A to continue."
<br/>
<br/>
It occurs when starting the M3 NDS Movie Player.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only reason you would not want Autosave turned on would be if you wanted multiple saves made - which is a pain in the @$$...
<br/>
<br/>
But as for your question - that means that you don't have gamesave data on the M3 - meaning, it can't save your game when you turn it off... When you put the Game on your SD or CF card, you should be using the Game Manager and having it copy it directly to the media card - this creates a game save automatically...
<br/>
<br/>
The other reason it does that is if you're running homebrew and don't have a gamesave.. you can use the game manager to do a direct copy to the SD or CF card and it creates a gamesave, or you can just create an empty .txt file and rename it to the exact same name as the application file you need it for (i.e. for me, I needed it for moonshell, and my moonshell file is called "_Moonshell.nds" so I created a file in the NDSSAVE folder called "_Moonshell.dat".<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't quite know what you mean. If I'm in a game and save, it works fine. If I didn't have Autosave on it would make a new file for each save?
<br/>
<br/>
I tried making some fake dat files so it wouldn't give me error messages for a few apps like NDSMail and beup, but it doesn't work. Hrm...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It also seems like the M3 deletes any file it doesn't like. The renamed txt files I put in NDSSAVE vanished.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#90884 - takieda - Mon Jul 03, 2006 5:37 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The files should not disappear, and the problem *should* go away... umm... how are you checking to see the files have disappeared? You use the homebrew (like NDSMail), restart, get the same error message (which should have disappeared), then turn off the DS, take the SD card out, put it in your system, then check for the files?
<br/>
<br/>
As far as turning autosave off...  you have to manually save the files every single time you restart - becomes a pain in the ass. You'd have to manually create multiple .dat files (either by copying your current .dat file, or by creating new ones). Then, under options, turn off Autosave. Then, once you've finished a game, restart the DS, go to the games menu, highlight the game you want, then press Select. Now press left, or right until you find the save game file that you want this particular save to be saved into, then hit A to save it. Then, when you decide to start the game again, when you press A to start the game, you'll have to press left or right again to find the file you wish to load.
<br/>
<br/>
This is ONLY useful if you have so many people using your M3 that it warrants having seperate save files for every person, or if YOU want seperate save files so you can explore different paths in a game, OR the game only allows one save normally, and you want multiple saves so you can back up in case of a mistake, etc... None of these things are very useful to many people, considering the hassle you have to go through, but if you absolutely must (and I can only think of one that really warrants it - Animal Crossing - if you want multiple people to play on your M3 without having multiple characters in your town), that is the method for doing so. But you HAVE to remember to backup your save file, as this won't do it for you at all... IF you forget, and you go to load a different save file, or the same one, etc... the SRAM is overwritten and there's no way to retrieve that save from before.
<br/>
<br/>
I have several ideas on how M3 team could improve this, but expecting M3 Team to user ideas is like expecting M3 team to give out free M3's - i.e., not gonna happen unless, by some chance, it will actually make them money in the long run.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

But mine is the chinese version.

I updated it to the newest version..

I was wondering..
<br/>
M3 has its own M3 enhanced moonshell, which is accessed thru the extend function.
<br/>
I got the original moonshell from the site because M3 never updates their own moonshell.
<br/>
So, can I make it in such a way that when I go into the extend function, it will load the moonshell that I put in, instead of M3 enchanced moonshell?
