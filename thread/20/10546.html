    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hey all,
<br/>
<br/>
i'm another ds homebrew n00b i'm afraid...
<br/>
<br/>
i'm trying to get scummvm working on my new datel max media dock but am having trouble.  below i will run through my progress so far, and then i'd really appreciate it if someone could help me out or tell me whether what i'm trying to do is even possible.
<br/>
<br/>
incidentally, my ds is completely "fresh", and the only hardware i'm using is what came in the Datel MMD package.
<br/>
<br/>
+ ok, first of all i blank my (1gb) compactflash card.
<br/>
+ next i copy scummvm-a.nds (v0.61) to the root of the card and rename it BOOTME.NDS.
<br/>
+ then i zip up my "indy3" directory, with no compression, (using the command 'zip -r0 indy3.zip indy3'), copy it to the root of the card and rename it scummdata-a.zip.
<br/>
<br/>
now, when i fire-up the ds i see some text on the top screen explaining controls, but the bottom screen remains blank.  after a short delay two more messages appear on the top screen:
<br/>
+ "ZIP file check... Not in use!"
<br/>
+ "Flash card reader not found!"
<br/>
and that's as far as things get; no control inputs seem to have any effect, and nothing else happens on either screen.
<br/>
<br/>
please, can anybody help me out?  has anyone managed to get a similar setup working?  is there something i'm missing here,  or am i stupidly trying the impossible?  i can't help feeling i'm tantalisingly close; but by the same token i'm also fully prepared for crushing disapointment.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance,
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately Scummvm DS currently does not recognise the Max Media Dock as of right now. Chishm has released a new libfat that should include compatability for the Max Media Dock so that it would allow scummvm to run on it when it is implemented. The setup of the Max Media Dock wouldn't have it use the zip method anyways though as that is for GBA flashcarts. I actually got into the menu using my Ipod's HDD but it doesn't show the files (and therefore can't run games). I guess we just have to wait for the next version.

P.S.- Don't try to tear apart your Ipod. The HDD does not work well with the MMD.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
