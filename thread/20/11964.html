<br/>
I can see what you're trying to do here and unfortunately it will not work. The picture has shown me that you want to plug a peripheral into a peripheral. Unfortunately the router won't be able to support this type of configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to get a wireless router and use that to connect your DS to the net. I recommend the Linksys WRT54G as a router or just get the WAP54G so you don't have to fiddle with your speedtouch modem to get briding to work. The WAP54G is basically a "switch with antenna's."

Grab one from here: <a href="http://www.itestate.com.au/products_detail.asp?code=PD00002733" target="_blank">http://www.itestate.com.au/products_detail.asp?code=PD00002733</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
