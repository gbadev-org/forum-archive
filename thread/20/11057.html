    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you're out of luck as far as mame goes, but a quick rundown:
<br/>
<br/>
NES: pocketnes is native to GBA and borderline perfect with more features than nesDS, but nesDS uses the full screen resolution, the Y button, and, if you can track down emu_kidid's modified version, FAT support.
<br/>
<br/>
SNES: snesDS or snezziDS. both very flawed in some regards but between the two probably about half of the SNES library is totally playable.
<br/>
<br/>
GB/C: goomba or goomba color. both gba native.
<br/>
<br/>
DOS: gbaGI for sierra games, scummVM for lucasarts games.
<br/>
<br/>
Genesis: PicoDrive - not fullspeed yet, and no sound, but works leagues better than anything else and is very much playable for some games (rocket knight adventures!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's no legal definition of 'abandonware'.  
<br/>
That's just a term coined by pirates to make themselves feel better.
<br/>
I thought linking to WAREZ sites was frowned upon in these forums?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
There is considerable confusion about the term "abandonware", just like the mythical law where you can keep a ROM for 24 hours. As you say, both are just terms or concepts that people like to use to make them feel better about piracy. This certainly isn't the first time an innocent person was fooled by such things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Theres a big difference from piracy on something you cant possibily pay first-hand for anywhere, and piracy just to save yourself money.
<br/>
<br/>
If something is<span style="font-style: italic"> truely</span> abandoneware, then I see no moral reason not to pirate it.
<br/>
Even though they are both illegal, theres quite a big difference from a moral/ethical standpoint. imo.
