I don't know if it was ever confirmed, but not long ago I read about some kind of Nintendo branded USB wireless receiver that will be used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You will be able to use any 802.11 router for access.  Nintendo will sell a USB device for those without a wireless router, and I would bet some software will come with it to set up the sharing of your internet connection.

The RALink chipset is only required to use Nintendo's proprietory protocols which the BIOS DS Download Play requires.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
