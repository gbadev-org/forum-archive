    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using the max media launcher and its kind of sticking in the slot and doesn't easliy eject.   I thinking of using the hacked firmware so I don't have to use it anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
My question is, is it safe to do?  I did the firmware upgrade on my original DS but I remember hearing that it was more difficult on the DS lite.  What's the story. ANy feedback would be apreiciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The key danger in early experiments with the DS Lite was shorting SL1 to some metal part of the case, causing the DS to turn off or even blow a fuse. But if you build the proper tool, installing modified firmware on the DS Lite is actually a bit easier because you don't have to move any sticker. Grab two identical metal paperclips, bend out a straight part, place them beside each other, and tape them together near the end as seen in <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/gbaforum/DS_Lite_flashing.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a>. The two paperclips are of the right size to bridge SL1, and the tape prevents them from touching metal parts of the case.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just flashed a Lite this weekend and it was a piece of cake - I just used a single large insulated (plastic coated) paperclip.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I thought it was even easier than doing it with the original.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't want to start mass reflashing here, but I've flashed three DS's to FlashMe, and lots
<br/>
of people at work have done the same. Most of the time getting annoyed by the slow
<br/>
flashing time, because of some sort of a connection error. Anyway, we just wiggled a
<br/>
screwdriver in the hole (it's more about pushing it down than turning it around) until the
<br/>
flashing operation was complete. This was with old DS and new DS Lite. :) So it shouldn't
<br/>
be that difficult... You might blow you DS to pieces, but don't be afraid of doing a reflash.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

5% at a time, and then I have to readjust the tool to get the next few percents done... :)

Yeah, I suck at it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
