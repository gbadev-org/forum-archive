    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm... a sudden and unexpected blog post by Dragonminded...
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It's weird that so many people notice these things. I don't think he's being dillusional, but I won't hide that I don't know what he or various others panic about. For once I think I'm happy to be completely ignorant :b
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add, though, that if a flash cart manufacturer doesn't make FAT access easy then people should just not bother to support them unless they really have to.
<br/>
...Same way that it's not my problem if a user of my software uses a peanut butter sandwich as a hard drive.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping he lets other people pick up the project where he left off, because DSO really is a great piece of software.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with future endeavours, DragonMinded.
<br/>
<br/>
(And, has anyone got this compiling in Windows after converting all the MakeFiles to Windows format? I'm going to try in Linux in a while, but it's so nice and easy to keep DevkitPro up to date in Windows).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
Here's the list (as accurate as my memory allows):
<br/>
<ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Supercard SD &amp; CF</span>: Released SD and CF drivers early on, haven't done anything since. Did release "MoomShell" patcher for SC Lite, but no documentation on changes required to drivers.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">M3 SD</span>: Released SD drivers, supplied a M3 SD for testing and reverse engineering.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">M3 CF</span>: Nothing. Unlock sequence and register addresses provided by MightyMax IIRC.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Neoflash MK2/3</span>: Provided drivers, helped to add them to gba_nds_fat and also made improvements to the library (the original caching layer in gba_nds_fat was written by them).
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">GBAMP CF</span> (same company as M3): Basically nothing. I did this all with the help of other people on these forums (DarkFader in particular).
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">GBAMP SD</span>: Nothing. No support for this device at all.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">G6</span> (same company as M3): Released a precompiled library, requests for source have been denied.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">EZ4 SD</span>: Gave read-only driver source to Infantile Paralyser (author of MoonShell). I haven't had contact with them.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">NinjaDS</span>: Provided drivers, had extensive contact with them while getting the drivers to work.
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Max Media Player/Dock</span>: Nothing. Register addresses were found in MoonShell source.</li></ul>
<br/>
Many of the cases where drivers were provided to Infantile Paralyser / discovered in MoonShell source may be due to langauge barriers. Despite the company not providing any help, the GBAMP CF is still the best option for homebrew in my opinion, since all NDS features (firmware, launchers, drivers) have been written by members of the homebrew community and have been customised for our purposes.

DSOrganiser was a fantastic app, one of my most used.

The Homebrew database was particularly one of the most important developments for this community and its users.

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">If he did not:</span> He intentionally included code covered by the GNU General Public License (namely libmad) in the same address space as his own code and distributed the product. The side effect is that all the code in the same address space becomes subject to the GPL.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">If he did:</span> If DragonMinded tries to sue somebody who distributes a fork of DSOrganize under the GPL, then DragonMinded is admitting that he infringed the copyright of the GPL software. At least United States copyright law states that "protection for a work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully" (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#103" target="_blank">17 USC 103</a>), which in this case would put the parts of DSOrganize created by DragonMinded into the public domain. Even if not, plan B is a defense similar to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclean_hands" target="_blank">unclean hands</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Even so, DragonMinded might try to get forkers on trademark law. In that case, don't call your fork "DSOrganize". Call it something else and mention that it is based on DSOrganize only in the credits.

If he released it as open source then it is the responsibiltiy of whomever continues the project to ensure that the previous developer does not get bothered with questions about the forked version.
<br/>
<br/>
A better idea would be to rename a fork of the DSO 2.3 source and make it explicitly clear that DM is not associated with it.

He's talking about his legal rights about the code, not about his moral rights or his rights as a person. He waived the right to use a propietary license the moment he linked against GPL code - he must give others the same rights to his code that he got from the programmers of libmad and mikmod. He can't expect people to respect his license if he doesn't respect other developers' ones.
<br/>
<br/>
It's NOT personal. It's a license issue. Specifically section 2b of the GPL, which DragonMinded accepted the moment he distributed a binary with linked GPL code. License-wise, his achievements or departure are irrelevant.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, it's not personal. Don't get so riled up.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, and then DSBlue will quit in about a year, but not to worry...another developer will have already started again with his own system!
<br/>
And the cycle repeats.
<br/>
(Besides, I was hopeing DSBlue would stick too being <span style="font-style: italic">"the all-around WiFi uber-app"</span> rather then become a media or file manager like DSOrganiser.)
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but Im getting very cynical at the general humanity of people.
<br/>
Soo many great developers work extreamly hard, normaly with no help from card markers, then they get pissed on by underappriateing 
<br/>
end users.
<br/>
Is no wonder people quit.

The community is  far too dependant on a few "uber-coders" makeing mega app's, imo. And they are leaving.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My advice would be not let any one person get to you.
<br/>
For example, when I released a test port of Wolf3d for the PSP there were  a few bad comments to the tune of "it doesn't have sound, im not playing" or "omg gfx sux".
<br/>
<br/>
I keep on going despite that since a greater percentage of people are able to use stuff I port and are mostly greatful for me doing so.
<br/>
<br/>
The flashcart issue is a problem, but you can only do what you can.
<br/>
If there is no driver for the device, then thats just it. They have to wait until support is added.
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't like the way things are done in IRC, stop going there.
<br/>
There are many forums (well, atleast this one) you can visit and ask for help in.
<br/>
<br/>
What is this "scene" anyway? I thought that NDS homebrew was developed by people
<br/>
who like to code for this platform?
<br/>
Kinda sucks how a few people on IRC can make you hate programming for the nds.
<br/>
<br/>
But whatever you want to do, good luck.

Like Lazy1 said, there's always going to be criticizms. When I made a new layout for my website, some people complained. One person said the fonts were much too big in Linux. A valid complaint, so I made them smaller. Another just said it sucked and didn't provide any specific reason why, so I promptly told them to STFU. I didn't throw out all that work just because someone felt like flaming.
<br/>
<br/>
People have complained that my DS boot menu (still in progress) is pointless because Moonshell, DSOrganize, and the firmware already do the job. I haven't stopped working on it because of that. I've simply been focusing on making it do things that these apps don't do.
<br/>
<br/>
Hell if I just stormed off every time someone complained about something I did, there's <a class="postlink" href="http://board.acmlm.org" target="_blank">at least one forum</a> I'd have left years ago. I can't seem to make a post there discussing things I don't like about any given video game without someone (usually this one person actually) nearly starting a flame war over it. Simple solution: I just ignore their posts.
<br/>
<br/>
In short: Some complaints are perfectly valid and should be addressed. Others are generally a sign that you should ignore the person making them. But very, very few are a good reason to just give up.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is no "no selling" clause in the GPL - you're free to sell whatever you want. The only condition is that you also provide the source.

As long as you make the source reasonably available, you're okay - a link on your website, FTP, an address where source CDs can be ordered for the cost of postage, etc - any of these will work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gotcha.. I like the GPL..  And if it was "evil", it would be used as much as it is..  Remember, it's the person doing the coding that decides what liscense their code is under..  If you are "borrowing" code, why would the liscense change?  If you want to make your own, using another liscense, write the code yourself..  I don't get the problem.  And "why reinvent the wheel" isn't an answer or example.  If the guy who invented the wheel placed it under GPL, then deal with it or make your own wheel.  Seems simple enough to me..

Selling GPL'd stuff reminds me of the Shareware CDs that used to be next to the checkout for $10 or $15..  I used to think.. Why would anyone pay $10 or $15 for a bunch of progs on a CD that they could download for free?  And if they want to keep using them, will need to pay more..  Well, not everyone knows where to download them from, or has the time to download them, etc..

<span style="font-style: italic">Doom</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Quake</span> by Id Software were published under GPL at their respective engines' end of life. But the .wad files for <span style="font-style: italic">Doom</span> and the equivalent for <span style="font-style: italic">Quake</span> are under the old restrictive license, and the only lawful way to get them is to buy a copy or to use the demo episode.

Probably somebody who wants to take from the community without giving back to the community. The GPL and other <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_blank">copyleft</a> licenses are useful for encouraging developers to make their own works free software as well.
