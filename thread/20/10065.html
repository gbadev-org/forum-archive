"ique is currently developing a new gba cartridge, the cartridge has a usb slot, which can go online when plug into the computer. [some magazine's editor] used this cartridge to play multiplayer gba mario kart with ique's personnels"

Next to zero distribution costs but they may have reworked the games would make sence to add a cool feature like wireless multiplay through GBA

Without extra hardware? because you can do it on emulators I think</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i'd agree that they're reworking the games and putting them on these new cartridges...or you have to download them to these cartridges like the original iQue (the one that was basically an anti-pirate N64...*waits for tepples to make a pun about "anti-pirate N64"*)<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well from what other people have said in these forums it would have to be as the GBA hardware in a DS is separate from the DS hardware so to speak and the DS doesn't have a USB port built in and I doubt they would use the DS slot (even if they cood) as it wouldn't stand upto too much wear and tear I don't think</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
