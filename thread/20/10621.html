I must say after Devhook has come out, the PSP has become much more enticing as a dev machine. You no longer have to upgrade to play newer games and then downgrade again to play homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the EVOKE demo LN, make sure you post a ROM after the party.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am fairly new, so my opinion might not carry as much weight, but I disagree on the traitor part - it's everyone's decision to program or not, a statement that one is leaving the DS development behind is far better than silently fading away (imho, ymmv). Let's not get entangled in bitterness and just acknowledge his decision.
<br/>
<br/>
Moving on to the PSP is something I do disagree with, though. It may be a nice machine for developers, but supporting Sony is something that I personally do not like - they have to make a lot of amends before I am spending money on their products again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

but what i did notice is he never said this is definite 
<br/>
he could come back to developing the ds in a few months this is pretty much saying 
<br/>
my ds dev will low to a crawl and this is why so dont beg for an update
<br/>
another thing is he is very inexperienced and who knows he might not be able to achieve that greater potential the psp is said to possess
<br/>
so he might switch back
<br/>
i say he should have let ds stagnate and just dev psp or dev psp under an new alias rather then making an announcement this is just to gain atention which i dont like

Oh yes, I have to agree. It's absolutely disgusting that some guy on the internet should dare to spend his free time doing what he wants to do, instead of doing what you want him to do.
<br/>
<br/>
He should be ashamed of himself, the selfish man.
