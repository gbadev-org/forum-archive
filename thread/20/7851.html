<br/>
It was never in development. Blizzard just made a poll a while ago, asking if people would like to see Starcraft or Diablo on DS/PSP.
<br/>
There never was an offical announcement and it seems that there are no plans to make any of the games for DS right now. 
<br/>
Would be cool if they make it though.

Ok, a cheque will be fine! ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Two french guys are currently working on it. They have released a very early alpha version but it got all the starcraft feeling.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://stardev.ton-hebergement-gratuit.com/starlite.nds" target="_blank">StarLite 0.03 has been released!!!</a>
<br/>
<br/>
What's new:
<br/>
<br/>
- StarLite is now using 3D sprites. Gfx are the same, but it's just a tricky way to be able to have 1024 sprites on the screen
<br/>
<br/>
- <span style="font-weight: bold">Wifi mode</span> implemented!  If you have 2 DS, you can play against someone :
<br/>
<br/>
* Copy StarLite.nds on the 2 DS (so far, it's rather logical)
<br/>
<br/>
* on DS #1, put a equipe.txt file at the root of your card with just the number 1 in the file (without making any space or pressing ENTER)
<br/>
<br/>
* On DS #2, put a equipe.txt file at the root of your card with just the number 2 in the file.
<br/>
<br/>
This way the program will be able to know if you are player 1 or 2 despite the fact the authors didn't make a menu yet. It will come with the next release.
<br/>
<br/>
Launch StarLite and wait for both games to be ready to play. Enjoy!
<br/>
<br/>
It's still very buggy (the DS might crash from times to times and when you kill the opponent, your own marine happens to die too), but it's just to show it can work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
