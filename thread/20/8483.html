    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking at this picture, does it mean that the DS lite may be harder to flash?  There doesn't seem to be the same sl1 hole in the battery compartment.  Also, the same dotted paper that covered the sl1 slot in the normal DS is up in the corner on this board (I circled it and wrote sl1?? but the jpg conversion ate it up).  What do the experts think?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are some peopled who destroyed their DSs while disassembling them. And yes, flashing will probably be harder. If Nintendo couldn't block PassME2, they've at least tried to make it harder for us ... Oh, well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">man, I just came to redeem myself and say I found it when you beat me to the punch!  So it is still under the battery cover.

Anyways, supposing the DSLite has the NWFC settings built in...
<br/>
<br/>
Any odds they might fit in the reduced size of the Old DS? Including the no-RSA protection(a.k.a. Flashme)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I zommed in real close it looks like there are 2 pads on the board with solder ontop of them (probably just for this particular prototype)

Has links to all the pics &amp; the new manual too.

Edit bummer well looks like no Thumb stylus with this one, Wrist Strap Atachment (Sold Separatly) - see manual page 5 bottom right... maybe it will be included with Metroid Prime?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have to put text in a .jpg, make it white (if on a dark background) or black (if on a light background). The JPEG color space relies on luminance (brightness) contrast, and red on blue is one of the worst combinations.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
