    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have gotten quite a bit of work done on my port of sdl sopwith to the nintendo ds,  right now the game is playable but I'm not the best at finding bugs.
<br/>
So I'm releasing this alpha version to see how many people can find.
<br/>
<br/>
The game is playable in it's current state but must be run under real hardware and does not have any sound.
<br/>
Keep in mind its still far from release quality.
<br/>
<br/>
Tested using a gbamp and passme so I'm not sure about other loading methods.
<br/>
<br/>
[Updated 12/03/05]
<br/>
NDS Sopwith has been updated to alpha 2.
<br/>
Changes include:
<br/>
<br/>
- Hopefully fixed all input bugs
<br/>
- Hopefully fixed bug with timing
<br/>
- Fixed .sopwithrc file open error, it will no longer try and open the file
<br/>
- Added options screen
<br/>
- Added more keys
<br/>
<br/>
As usual the file can be found on my cheaply done site: <a class="postlink" href="http://lazyone.50megs.com" target="_blank">http://lazyone.50megs.com</a>.
<br/>
Let me know how the bug hunting goes, if everything turns out ok the next version may have sound.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lazy1 on Sat Dec 03, 2005 8:39 pm; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
First noticable bug: After controls list, I get a "swloadconf: cant open .sopwithrc:"
<br/>
<br/>
Second noticable bug: I have to press L or R three times before the options I choose at the startup will register.
<br/>
<br/>
Third noticable bug: Is the game supposed to be that slow? Is this emulated? It looks like an old CGA game..so I wouldn't be surprised if it were.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, it's pretty neat.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

one of my favourites; I'll be sure to test it out later :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the bug reports.
<br/>
The last thing isn't really a bug since the game limits itself to 10fps, but there is some room for improvement in my Timer_GetMS function ( ugly, ugly hack ).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Man I love you for porting this.  This was one of the best games!
<br/>
<br/>
Another great one that always reminded me of this was Flightmare.  Was actually completely different, but I guess it had biplanes in it and was a CGA game.
<br/>
<br/>
Great work... I'll play around with it, but havnt found bugs other than the ones mentioned (I just loaded it)...<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://scdev.org" target="_blank">http://scdev.org</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember many happy hours playing this as a kid.  The port looks great, too!
<br/>
<br/>
Although I'm sure it was faster, closer to 15fps.
<br/>
<br/>
When the wireless is out, a two player version of this would be a killer app for me.  I'm sure the original had a two player game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good to hear some feedback on this, btw the code I have limits it to 10fps but it may not be stable because of my hacked timer function.
<br/>
I'm currently re-working the input system and have started on an arm7 binary so that the other keys and sound can be added.
<br/>
<br/>
And since the code has support for multiplayer I'll look into it once I get a wireless router and when the proper ds network code is released.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not sure where the source code is, probably wont be helpful, it was a quick hack, but I'll see if I can dig it up</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It may seem slower since the last version had a really crappy timer function, the game itself is limited to 10fps and hasn't been changed.

As for the next release, I'll be playing around with sound later today and see about some kind of power management.

Good to hear its working though :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
