    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Blowing can make things worse. Here's what I do to clean Game Paks:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>Moisten one end of a cotton swab with isopropyl rubbing alcohol. </li><li>Rub the moist end across the GBAMP's connector several times. </li><li>Do the same with the dry end. </li></ol>
<br/>
In fact, Nintendo recommends the same procedure except with Nintendo's proprietary cleaning wand instead of the cotton swab.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It's a bit interesting, really. I wonder what would be behind turning my SC or GBAMP into an option pack to be accessed by something running from Slot-1...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

As I understand it, reading the file system on a GBA slot memory card adapter would involve setting up your program to use libfat, setting the current working directory to SLOT-2, and putting the program on one of <a class="postlink" href="http://news.ds-x.com/" target="_blank">these</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It could be possible that the GBAMP has become damaged somehow.. on the plus side, it's only 30 dollars for a new one.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I tried making a wrap around slot 2 extender, i accidentally shorted wto of the pins, cant remember wich onces, they were in the middleish, anyway no matter what gba cart i put in, the ds said it was an option pak, even without a game in. so its as easy as that (i think).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The compact flash card is in correctly. Also, all other gba games function correctly in the gba slot of the ds. The gbamp shows up as an option pack without the flash card in as well. The only thing i thik could have happened was it ws damaged somehow, which is strange because it worked the night begore and the next morning it stopped functioning. Any other ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
