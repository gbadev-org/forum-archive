    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have finished the GBA Movie Player firmware hack. It will allow you to boot a single NDS or GBA file from your CF card. More details are in the zip file. It will only load homebrew NDS files, <span style="font-weight: bold">commercial demos do not work!</span>

<br/>
This is intended to be used with a file select program, but none exists. Oh, and Dwedit has said that it corrupted his GBAMP, but I haven't had this problem. Use at your own risk.

Does this need a PassMe or does it work without one?
<br/>
And has anyone else had luck? I dont realy wont to destory my CF card, Either way, Hopefully someone will stick a PassMe on ebay UK so i can buy one.. Otherwise i guess ill have to wait ;)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">-Shoxz, </span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just installed it, I did'nt really care if my card got corrupted or not.  I don't have a passme, so I am limited to gba mode and gba multiboot roms.  It worked perfectly as a bootloader, but it seems to hang without a gba rom present (won't load the original gbamp software), but it will still let me firmware flash back to e18 to take care of that.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, between this and chishm's CF FAT drivers I see the start of a great community based alternate gbamp software suite.
<br/>
<br/>
I also think I need to get a passme now.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: passthrough to old gbamp mode started working miraculously for some reason, it's all good now</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by kokido on Sun Jul 17, 2005 5:49 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
1. is there any way to recover the gbamp original firmware if it is corrupted?
<br/>
2. will it still function perfectly as a GBAMP?
<br/>
3. are you saying this plays commercial GBA games or just homebrew ones?
<br/>
4. can i have other files on the card while booting to my nds file?
<br/>
<br/>
25 + 20 for a gbamp sounds a lot better than 100 + 20 for a flashcard</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">rmco2003: Did you use update.e18? Try placing it on the root of the card. If something really bad happens, try putting the flasher on the root of your card, rename it to _BOOT_MP.GBA then run it. Delete it from the card when you are done.
<br/>
<br/>
Shoxz: You need some form of pass me for DS mode. GBA booting works without it.
<br/>
<br/>
kokido: You have to run update.e18 on the card after you have flashed it. It will still work as a boot loader after doing this, but it also restores the original functionality.
<br/>
<br/>
Dovoto: Yes you can still fix it with a multiboot cable. Just run the repair utility.
<br/>
<br/>
Zubiac: I have used it to flash my DS. The 256KiB limit only applies in GBA mode. In DS mode it is limited to using WMB compatible NDS files, and even then it only works with a few. The plan is to get a working boot menu that improves compatibility.
<br/>
<br/>
Assassda: 
<br/>
1) Yes, you will need a multiboot cable if you can't boot the GBAMP at all. Then you use it to boot the flasher and run the repair utility. Darkfader is responsible for this function.
<br/>
2) Yes, that is the reason for running update.e18 on the card. I should add that you can remove update.e18 from your CF card after running it.
<br/>
3) Only homebrew ones.
<br/>
4) Yes you can.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, it can only load 4 Mb roms? And in order to run more than one the only thing you need is a program to load other roms?

Also, is there a way to manually skip into the normal firmware, or do you just have to delete _BOOT_MP.NDS?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to bother you. Im going to buy one sometime this week hopefully, testing demos only in an emulator sucks.

I have this same problem...it will boot the files like it now should, but it will not see the update file and it won't function as it normally would...I can however recover the firmware alright using the GBA boot file (it will then detect the update file and update, healing the firmware).  It is supposed to function normally when those _boot files aren't present, right?

It should boot up normally without the _BOOT_MP files on there. I can think of one reason it won't. Try defraging your CF card. If that doesn't work, try hex editing the CF card and place a 0 in the filename of the very last free root directory entry. If you don't want to do that try formatting your CF card.

I bet when it restarts it will not show the Nintendo logo, and a quick flick of the power on a DS says "There is no Game Pak inserted".

I have included a _BOOT_MP.GBA file in the zip that should provide a workaround.

I've formated my CF card and what do I have to put on it now?
<br/>
The flashmp_mb.gba and the update file and what else?

<br/>
ok
<br/>
I have put the flash_mp.gba file,the new _boot_mp.gba file and the update file on the root directory of my CF card.
<br/>
Then I plugged the GBAMP into my DS and updated the firmware.
<br/>
After that I deleted the flash_mp.gba and the update file from the CF card(as stated in the ReadMe).So the only file that remains on card is the _boot_mp.gba file.
<br/>
But what I gotta do now? Say i want to try out Tetanus on drugs.
<br/>
In the ReadMe it says that I have to rename the game to _boot_mp.gba but I can't cause there's already the 1kb file with the same name on the card.
<br/>
I feel really stupid right now(I'm not bad in those things normaly) but right now I'm totaly lost somehow.
<br/>
thanx again for any help

<br/>
<br/>
The only problem I've had so far is that the movie player will not boot with the passme without one of the _BOOT_MP files.  This is not much of a problem as I haven't flashed my DS with the new firmware so I can simply not use the passme to use the MP normally but if I ever decided to flash it I wouldnt be able to use the player normaly again.  I haven't tried the newly included _BOOT_MP.GBA but maybe that is what its for?

<br/>
The firmware is in two parts, a boot block and the main GBAMP program. The flasher overwrites the entire thing, but only replaces the boot block. The update then restores the GBAMP program without overwriting the boot block.
<br/>
<br/>
Darkfader:
<br/>
You have to admit, you do deserve some of the credit for what you have allowed me to use.
<br/>
<br/>
Zubiac:
<br/>
Just replace the _BOOT_MP.GBA with the renamed tetanus on drugs.
<br/>
<br/>
To use this to flash your DS:
<br/>
1) Put flashmp_mb.gba, update.e18 and _BOOT_MP.GBA on your CF card root directory.
<br/>
2) Start your GBAMP. Don't run the update at this stage. Go into FC Game and run flashmp_mb.gba. Install the boot loader.
<br/>
3) Restart your GBAMP in GBA mode. This time run the update. 
<br/>
4) Download flashme.nds from <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/" target="_blank">http://ds.gcdev.com/dsfirmware/</a>. It must be the NDS file, not the GBA file!
<br/>
5) Put flashme.nds on the root of your CF card and rename it to _BOOT_MP.NDS 
<br/>
6) Use either a passme or wifime to start your DS in NDS mode.
<br/>
7) Flash your DS according to the instructions on the web site.
<br/>
8) Remove _BOOT_MP.NDS from your CF card, and replace it with a different game, such as OMalone. Rename the NDS file of the game to _BOOT_MP.NDS.
<br/>
9) Restart your DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

   First off, congratulations chishm!  Props to the "Dark One" too!
<br/>
<br/>
   I ran into problems with my 32MB Canon Compactflash Card (FC-32MH).  I was able to do the first part of chishm's instructions fine, but, trying to reboot after flashing led to the "white screen of death" on my DS, and a "black screen of death" on my GBA.  I kept fixing and reflashing to the same results.  So, I broke out my SanDisk Ultra II 512MB, and "let there be light!"  It worked without a hitch. 
<br/>
<br/>
   I'm shooting for an update tonight, to my "Layman's guide to building DSLinux," with detailed instructions for chishm's creation.  <a href="http://www.dslinux.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=496&amp;st=0" target="_blank">http://www.dslinux.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=496&amp;st=0</a>

I believe that once your GBAMP corrupts, then you're out 25 bucks...I was referring to fixing it with repair mode, then reloading chishm's bootloader.  But, my problems was with the CompactFlash brand (it still works in my Camera), not corruption.

Now it will only erase and reflash the boot block. This means if you haven't already installed the hack it is now easier to do. You no longer have to run the update.e18 file after this hack.

Is it some kind of movie player locking itself issue?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">You got it in one. As you are well aware, the GBAMP is picky about reads and writes to the cartridge before it is fully unlocked (check the hardware hacking thread for further details). I tried to run the unlock sequence within the firmware code (copying it to memory first, of course) but this didn't work. 
<br/>
<br/>
The _BOOT_MP.GBA file doesn't even attempt to unlock the firmware when it boots. It simply copies the correct code from the firmware and runs it. I have a few theories on why it works: 
<br/>
1) The crt0 is setting the memory how the GBAMP expects it.
<br/>
2) Normally it has to search to the end of a directory before it decides to launch the firmware, this shortcuts that.
<br/>
3) The reads involved are somehow unlocking the GBAMP
<br/>
<br/>
Something else that is strange, is that when it is in NDS mode, the firmware will read from SRAM once if there is no _BOOT_MP.* file found, and one additional time for each _BOOT_MP.* file. The odd thing is, the firmware locks unless there is exactly one _BOOT_MP.* file, where * is anything but NDS. This means exactly two reads from SRAM. Maybe I should look further into it.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Changed method of detecting DS mode so it no longer reads from SRAM. This has removed the above bug. New version is available at usual place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Due to requests I've had, here's how to repair a screwed up GBAMP:
<br/>
You will need either another GBAMP, a flash cart, a multiboot cable &amp; GBA, or a DS with flashme installed and WMB.
<br/>
First, run flashmp_mb.gba using your prefered method. Next select repair by pressing L+R+START. When that has finished, put update.e18 on your CF card and update the GBAMP using it.
<br/>
If you only have a modded DS and WMB, you will need to get the flasher from the DevKitPro Tools CVS. Compile it for the DS and then run it. The remaining steps are the same as above.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am currently struggling to get it to work...
<br/>
<br/>
I've followed these instructions:
<br/>
<br/>
First, copy the flashmp_mb.gba and _BOOT_MP.gba file onto the CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, under windows, right-click on the drive letter for your CF card and select properties. I ran the defrag utility and told it to defrag the CF card anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
After that, insert the CF card into the GBA Movie Player Version 2 and stick it into your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, turn on your DS WITHOUT a PassMe inserted and let it boot into GBA mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Next, select "FC Game" from the menu
<br/>
<br/>
Then, select flashmp_mb.gba from the list.
<br/>
<br/>
Press and hold the L and R buttons, and then press SELECT.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, remove the GBA MP from your DS, remove the CF from the GBA MP, and copy Omalone.nds to the CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Next, rename Omalone.nds to _BOOT_MP.NDS
<br/>
<br/>
Put the CF card back into the GBA MP, and then insert the GBA MP into your DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Next, insert the PassMe into the DS and turned it on. BOOM! There was Omalone!!
<br/>
<br/>
I have done all the above and it still isnt working. My DS has been flashed so I dont need a passme or need to use wifime. All that happens is when I put on the DS, and the bottom screen just flashed really quick then the top screen is shown with the GameBoy Advance intro. Then it takes me to the normal GBAMP os.

As always, if you don't have the most recent version of either the DS or GBAMP firmware, get it. Try putting update.e18 on the CF card too.  Does it show the no CF card inserted screen when no CF card is inserted?
<br/>
<br/>
What version GBAMP do you have, and did it come in the proper box with plastic crate? How long have you had it and where did you get it?
<br/>
<br/>
Try using a different NDS file. A small one like the microphone demo is probably a better test.
<br/>
<br/>
Shaz:
<br/>
Sorry if you are already doing this, but make sure it is definitely called _BOOT_MP.NDS in capital letters. Also make sure it is in the root directory. White screens = trying to load an NDS but can't. Try going to the DS menu (hold select on startup) then choose GBA cart and see if the normal firmware shows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#49012 - shaz - Mon Jul 25, 2005 2:30 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok this is what happens now.
<br/>
<br/>
When I put in the 128MB CF Card with nothing on the card, It shows a white screen. When I hold Select at start up, it takes me to the DS Os and I choose GBA game and it just shows the GBA boot intro and shows a black screen. Also if I put _BOOT_MP.NDS on the card, it does the same thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Now when I put in the 64MB card and I put on my DS, the bottom screen blinks and then the top screen is shown with the GBA boot up intro. Then it takes me to the GBAMP normal OS. When I hold Select while puting on my DS, it shows the DS OS and I choose "Play GBA Game" and it takes me to the normal GBAMP firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope the above makes sense to you lot.

<br/>
The problem with your 128MB card is that it is not finding any _BOOT_MP.GBA files, so it can't boot in GBA mode at all. This is what causes the black screen, and is due to the firmware locking itself. Try putting the supplied _BOOT_MP.GBA file on the card.
<br/>
Another test to try, maybe on your 64MB card, is put tetanus on drugs in the root directorr of your card. Delete _BOOT_MP.GBA and rename tod.gba to _BOOT_MP.GBA. See if it boots the game properly.
<br/>
Also, swap the GBA screen on your DS. See if it will boot the GBAMP with your 64MB card onto the touchscreen.

After you have dumped the GBAMP firmware, check the bytes starting at 0x3CA0. This is where my boot loader is located, and should not be only 0xFF or 0x00 bytes. I would be interested if it is a passme problem, as I don't have one but Lynx is planning to ship the passme and modded GBAMP as a kit.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know it works with a PassMe for sure, as that is what I am using (removed FlashMe for PassMe testing).  I also know Natrium42 has the correct version of GBA MP, as I shipped it to him (prior to you releasing your update, otherwise I would have updated it prior to shipping it to him).
<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess the question might be.. Is there a CF brand/chipset issue?  I'm using a 512MB Kingston CF card with no problems.  I have updated the firmware multiple times and have run both NDS and GBA files from it without a problem as well as the GBA MP.  I have updated the firmware on mutiple GBA MPs (with the Kingston CF card) and booted Omalone.nds on all of them.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else we can try to compare?  Could there be a step that is being overlooked?  Or a way to tell if the firmware updated properly?  What about FAT16 vs FAT32 maybe?  I'm not sure what mine is.. I'll have to check.  What about the OS used to format the CF card?  XP vs 2K vs Linux, etc?  Just throwing out ideas..
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: What about the CF reader/writers?  Could they be messing something up?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It could be FAT16 vs FAT32, but I don't think so. There is one thing though, it detects the MBR based on the first byte of the CF card. If it has a value of 0xEB or 0xE9 then the card is assumed to have no MBR. If it doesn't have this value, then the loader scans the MBR for the first active partition and goes to it. To be honest, I'm surprised this detection method has worked successfully for so many people, as the bytes only exist on a system partition.
<br/>
<br/>
To test this out, do a complete format of the card, removing the MBR (if you are willing to) and make sure the first byte is 0xEB or 0xE9. It should then work properly. If you want to keep the MBR, make sure the first byte is not the above value.
<br/>
<br/>
The other possibility is you have a FAT32 format, but it has the FAT16 sector size field not equal to 0. This is not allowed by the FAT specs, but is a possibility.
<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn't be a CF issue, as they all obey the same specs when it comes to accessing them (ATA).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I said, I'm surprised it has worked so far. This is the smallest (code wise) way to detect the MBR that I could think of. I know it is PC specific, but I don't know of any universally compatible way to detect the MBR (apart from ignoring it completely). I have read that document, and is where I got the information for my file system code.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, do you think it would be better if I checked for the string FAT at offset 0x36 or 0x52? This is the only other way of detecting an MBR that I can think of.

<br/>
Run either of the flashmp programs contained in the zip file using your favourite method. If you can't run unsigned code on your DS, use the gba version with a multiboot cable or a flash cart. You can pak-swap while it is running.
<br/>
Natrium:
<br/>
I was thinking about that today. There are two possibilities:
<br/>
(1): If it doesn't find an active partition it jumps to the first partition on the disk (basically what you said).
<br/>
(2): If it doesn't find an active partition, assume it is a a non-partitioned disk, ie one without an MBR.
<br/>
<br/>
(1) is better if the problems people experience are caused by no active partitions on the disk. (2) is better when people don't format using a PC, as darkfader mentioned could be a problem. I don't know what Shaz's problem is yet, so I will wait until I get those sector dumps to make my decision. At the moment I'm leaning towards (2), as the active partition search is the same as what is done by a PC at boot up.
<br/>
<br/>
For a quick and dirty fix to anyone having this problem, here is one method to guarantee no MBR and a valid FAT partition on your CF card. <span style="font-weight: bold">Be warned that you will lose all your data on the CF card!</span> Only do this if you know what you are doing. Open the physical disk and purposely corrupt the first sector by overwriting it with all 0 bytes. Eject the disk then stick it back in your computer. When Windows complains that it is not formatted, allow it to format the card. Now it should work.
<br/>
<br/>
Shaz:
<br/>
Open WinHex. Go to Tools-&gt;Open Disk (or Disk Editor, depending on your version). Choose your CF card under physical disks. It will be one of the Hard disks, but not Hard Disk 0. Now go to Edit-&gt;Define Block. Put 0 in the first field and 512 in the second. Then go to Edit-&gt;Copy Block-&gt;Into New File. Save this as the physical dump. The partition dump is the same, except when openning the disk, select the correct drive letter under logical drives.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did most of the software hacking, although darkfader wrote the assembly version of the sector reads, and of course ndsmall, which I also used. So Dwedit is right, Darkfader did the hardware, I did the software.

If you want to donate, I don't have any thing like PayPal. However, since Darkfader deserves a lot of the credit, you could donate to him.

Other alternatives: Darkain said he might port his loader to the GBAMP if he had one, so you could get him one.

EDIT: Hmm. The loader seems to load to 0x203000. This complicates things greatly. My advice is if you have a GBA and no other flash carts, then make an Xboo cable and use it to recover. That is what I use.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you were testing without using the loader then yes. I am trying to do it the other way around. I thought about modifying the link script so that .text starts at 0x02030000, but that didn't appear to work. I also tried modifying gba_crt0.s (plus recompiling it) to copy from there to the begining of EWRAM, like it usually does for multiboot programs started in ROM. Again that didn't work.
<br/>
The other way I tried was to integrate my custom loader into the bootsector of the disk, except Windows XP won't let me partition the CF card after I had to delete the old MBR due to corruption. All partition utilities I have found only work in DOS mode, where my USB CF reader won't.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can partition fairly easily under linux, and it supports most usb flash card readers (but not all).
<br/>
If you don't want to install linux, you can use a live cd that runs directly from the cd, like knoppix (homepage: <a href="http://knoppix.net/" target="_blank">http://knoppix.net/</a> bittorrent downloads: <a href="http://torrent.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/" target="_blank">http://torrent.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/</a> )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Shaz:
<br/>
Can you PM a current dump of the physical and logical first sectors of the 64MB card, like before. Make sure it is the proper dump, not an old one.
<br/>
<br/>
I have decided to put the new project on hold for now, while I get the CF stuff bug free. Only problem with CF cards is they vary so much in their disk layout (MBR, FAT16/32, active partition, sector size, etc) that it is hard to make sure this works on every single card. It's not helped when I only have one CF card to test with, and it obviously works fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No loader yet.

Still has the 256K limit I believe, because it's still booting in GBA mode and has to load the whole ROM into memory.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, NDS mode has the same 4meg limit as a GBA Flash cart, though neither of them really have a 4 meg limit.. You just have to write your homebrew to swap data in and out of RAM.  Ex. being Moonshell.  I have 30 meg worth of mp3s on my CF, and am able to play them all as Moonshell only loads the MP3 it is playing into RAM, which is why it has the ~2.4meg limit?

SuperCard has 32MB onboard chip that the data is loaded into between the CF/SD and GBA port.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also tried to load it in GBA mode and I got was the GBA splash screen followed by a black screen, I tried putting the update .18 from the movie advance site and i wasn't able to load it, it still stood black.

Even that won't work all the time. Format doesn't modify the MBR. If you really want to make sure the CF card will work, back it up, purposely corrupt the first sector, then format it using windows format. Works for me every time, even if it is a bit of a hack. Alternatively, set the first partition as active.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I have updated the firmware hack. It should be more compatible with CF cards now. Specifically, if it can't find an active partition it just assumes there is no MBR, so if you have formatted on a Mac, it should hopefully work.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by chishm on Mon Aug 15, 2005 8:24 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Yes there are. But PATA is not hot swappable (on most desktop PCs), so you need to put the card into the adapter before booting. This is one reason (besides availability and ease of use) that people use USB adapters. It is far easier to corrupt the first sector in Windows XP than to open up the computer, put in the adapter + CF card, configure jumpers and BIOS settings, then run MS DOS fdisk.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't really want to. If you want to, you will need to dump the supercard's firmware (or a patched game) and disassemble it to see how it enables/disables CF writing. Either that or very kindly ask Romman. Don't like your chances on the last one. The only way to prevent piracy is to not let other people have the information - maybe that's why the manufacturers are so reluctant to give out technical details.

Then there's some FF's from 3CA0-3FFF.

I bet those C compiler error messages could also be removed, why would it care about calling a pure virtual function?
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think it stores any data in the FF field on the boot page?

<br/>
If the dupe code, FF field, and compiler error messages are not needed for the thing to run, you get 12800 bytes to work with! (E00-3FFF)

Edit: Nope, it just crashes if you replace E00-3FFF with blank space.

<br/>
Edit: It appears that the third instance of the bios 1E50 - 2D78 is discardable.  Without F28-1E50, it gives corrupt graphics.  Without 2D78-3CA0, it refuses to boot at all (but will still give a missing CF card warning).  I'll try replacing the C error text with blanks, see if it still boots and works fine.
<br/>
Next I'll try keeping only the first 256 bytes of each of the dupe bioses...
<br/>
<br/>
Edit again: It boots fine with the 3rd bios missing ONLY if there is a firmware update on the CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Doh!  more stupidity on my part... I was flashing the modified firmware with holes missing instead of the original firmware with holes missing.  Now I just flashed the original firmware with the 3rd bios removed, and it works fine.  Enjoy the 3880 bytes of free space from removing the third bios.
<br/>
I bet the C error text is also removable, I'll try that right now...
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: The C error text is removable, so is the 00 00 00 06 after it.  912 more bytes of free space.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting findings, Dwedit. I had managed to remove most of the 3rd BIOS, down to 0x3300, but any further and it wouldn't boot. I will try removing more and see if I get the same results.
<br/>
When you refer to the third BIOS, which address range are you talking about?
<br/>
<br/>
My original boot loader was squeezed into that FF field, and the original firmware doesn't use that section at all. It's a pity I can't use the full range taken up with dupe code, otherwise I could have done it in C using my FAT driver (which has cluster fragment support). Ah well, at least I have enough space to add an unlocking feature to hopefully get around the requirement for _BOOT_MP.GBA .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just tested it out with the free spaces replaced with fields of FF's or 00's. Works fine, but I hope it isn't executing those FF's and 00's.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's a new error:
<br/>
"System Error! Please contact your distributor for help!"
<br/>
And I finally got:
<br/>
"Update Failed! This Card is a FAKE!! System Crash!" flashing red and white. It also corrupted my CF card, overwriting the first sector with the GBAMP boot sector. Nice.
<br/>
<br/>
Seems that area around 0x1300 is very sensitive.
<br/>
I am beginning to think the firmware does a simple read of certain parts to make sure they are still there, because I can rewrite large areas with SWI 3 (stop) and it doesn't affect it, nor does it get executed when it does freeze (ie, the GBA doesn't power down).
<br/>
<br/>
Apart from a small block at 0x32C0-0x32DF, I have been able to remove everything in 0x1300-0x3FFF. Removing anything before this has odd effects, such as freezing videos and the above error messages.
<br/>
<br/>
This gives me 11KB to work with! Beat that, Dwedit! Seriously, though, did you want to test it out too, just in case it doesn't always work?

Hopefully I can write the bootloader in C now.

It would be nice if you make something like FlashMe's boot method (pressing X,Y,A,B simultaneously during power up will start code on GBA flashcart in DS mode, even if there's no PASS or AXXE in the header ). For  example, you can assign X+Y during boot to start in NDS mode, and no key pressed to launch original GBA MP firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I originally downloaded your firmware hack, I followed your instructions and replaced _BOOT_MP.GBA with Tetanus on Drugs.  Once I realized I didn't <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> to do that, I loaded the original and never touched the file again.  I can load ToD from the GBAMP firmware, along with any other multiboot GBA file, so there really is no need, in my opinion, for the functionality.  But at the same time, it really doesn't bother me having it there.  If having the _BOOT_MP.GBA as a file on the CF card gives you more space in the GBAMP's firmware to improve your bootloader, then I say leave it, but if there is no other benefit, they I say pull the functionality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What do I have to do to make .gba roms work on my movieplayer?

<br/>
i downloaded the zip file already.
<br/>
<br/>
So I have to:
<br/>
Run flashmp_mb.gba to flash the firmware with the loader. 
<br/>
Alternatively, run flashmp.nds if you can (e.g. WMB it). Put the included _BOOT_MP.GBA file on the root of your CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Then what happens to my DS,cf-card and Movieplayer?
<br/>
The Cf-card is being formatted, the Movieplayer gets Flashed?
<br/>
<br/>
And can I just put .gba files on the CF-card, open the menu and select it in the FC-game menu? A friend of me said that I have to run the update.e18 after flashing so that I get the menu back.
<br/>
No?
