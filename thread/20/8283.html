<br/>
That's just it. They wouldn't likely update the BIOS of existing DSes, because it's on a mask ROM built into the CPU. This, however, is new hardware. Since they're brand new components, it probably wouldn't be too difficult to just put an updated BIOS in during manufacturing, as opposed to carving up existing units and probably having to replace their CPU.
<br/>
<br/>
However, they might not update it for compatibility reasons, just as they didn't fix the MidiKeyToFreq bug in the GBA BIOS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, but are any of them brighter than the default?  'Cause that's the part that's useful: of the 4 brightness settings on the new machine, probably 2-3 of them are brighter than the normal DS.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.

It's true, I've seen then at EB compared side by side (a fellow was debating on buying one so the guy at EB took out one of the new ones and checked 'em out).

When you're in sunlight, the screen looks dim in contrast to the brightness of the sun. The brighter the backlight is, the easier it will be to see in those type of situations.
<br/>
<br/>
It's exactly the same with my LCD monitor here. In the dark, I have to turn the brightness all the way down to be able to look at it. But when there's sunlight coming through the windows, I have to turn the brightness up because it looks dim.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">People say "brighter", but that's the wrong term. It's not about emitting stronger light, it's about using a higher contrast range. Dark colors being real dark and string colors being really strong.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen a micro or the new SP screen, but one thing caught my attention in the PSP screen: dark pixels are truly dark, and emit no noticeable light. When the screen goes black in the dark, there is no light left, whereas in the DS screen, a fully black screen still emits some light, giving it a washed out look (it's more noticeable in the dark).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The new firmware could very well contain new functions. The first DSes only had 256K, but they later made them with 512K. Of course, they still used the original firmware which had to be 256K or less. That means another 256K to fit whatever they want, as I imagine all new DSes will be 512K. If they could fit Metroid 2 into 256K, I bet they could fit a lot of neat firmware functions. However, if future versions of FlashMe are based on this, there'll have to be a 256K version for those with older DSes, which would probably have to be based on the original firmware. (Unless the whole point of a new version is to have the new firmware, then just don't use it. :-p)
<br/>
<br/>
(No, I'm not suggesting they add Metroid 2 to the firmware. &lt;_&lt;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I always wondered if the 1Gb "limit" was actually a real hardware limit, like the GBA 256Mb limitation, or if it was just Nintendo's choice for largest cart offer for the time being.
<br/>
<br/>
There were only a handful of 256Mb GBA games (not including the GBA video  paks), since the 256Mb cart was expensive to developers. But right now there are already 5 or so 1Gb DS games (and almost all of them were released in the last two months). It's almost a given that most of the upcoming high-profile RPGs (FF3, Tales of Tempest, Xenosaga, Children of Mana) also use a full 1Gb cart (which seems to be cheaper than the 256MBit GBA cart).
<br/>
<br/>
With so many games using the largest avaliable cart, I wonder if the DS can support larger carts, and if Nintendo will make them avaliable (2Gbit?). Either that or the developers will start using more sophisticated compresison schemes, like in the later N64 games. The current 1Gb games don't seem to be using any fancier compression and just feast on the extra space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
But the 256 Mbit limit of the GBA is illusory. Look at the NES, whose CPU could address only 48 KB minus 24 bytes. They put I/O on the cart to bankswitch it. There's no reason they couldn't do the same for the GBA except for 1. price and 2. the planned obsolescence of the GBA compared to the Nintendo DS and the GBA's true successor.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The limit is even more illusory on the DS, where the cards already have a fairly sophisticated command processor on board.  Although 32 gbit of even matrix semi would cost a fortune right now (if even available, more likely you'd have to use multiple chips), if you wanted more, there are 3 extra bytes in the read ROM command that are currently null.
<br/>
<br/>
Your initial binaries would have to be inside the first 4 GB, since the header addresses only go that high, and you'd need a seperate file system table, since all the addresses in that are 32 bit as well.  Other than that, no worries.

I don't like that GBA carts does't fit. Maybe I will stick with my old DS until someone makes DS backup card or GBA cart that does fit inside DS (should be possible, but the backups space would be small).

DS lite homebrew would not be so portable as with old DS.

It is the ニンテンドー DS Lite private AC adapter. (Length = of cord/code approximately 1.9m)

It looks like it requires yet another new AC adapter that's incompatible with the original DS, GBA SP, and GBA Micro. Pfft. At least the stylus is supposedly longer.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

True...
<br/>
<br/>
Still, it's nice with the larger DS that I can put in a GBA cart and forget it's there.  It allows the cartridge to act as a port cover (though I notice the lite has its own port cover, right?) and allows me to have an extra game on hand, without affecting storage requirements for the console itself.
<br/>
<br/>
If not for that (the Penny Arcade guys called it the "Extra clip" factor) and homebrew, I could give a rat's ass about the GBA slot and would just as soon see it gone altogether.  I have GBA's for playing GBA games, the control layouts are better.
<br/>
<br/>
Having a GBA slot that's not full size is understandable, but it's awkward.  Anything you put in that slot, other than the port cover, is going to be too big for the slot.  The flaw in the GBA/GBC analogy is that the GBA had carts of its own which did fit in the slot.  If there will be reduced-size GBA carts they will be very few, because they'll be incompatible with other devices.
<br/>
<br/>
It's just a tradeoff for a smaller, more convenient console.  A disadvantage, nonetheless, though.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC
<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
