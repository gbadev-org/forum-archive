    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My vision (for what it's worth) for viewing multimedia files on the DS which contain both text and images - like PDFs and HTML pages - is to use Alt text to display images. When the Alt text is clicked, the image is opened as a full page. Pressing a slightly more prominent than usual Back button (or double clicking the image?) would bring us back to where we were.
<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the images are all singled out and viewed by explicit request of the user so we aren't viewing hundreds of images, text, and videos at the same time.
<br/>
(Perhaps smaller images could be displayed automatically based on RAM availability...).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree, a PDF plugin in Moonshell would be great if it's possible!
<br/>
There are lots of files that only really work as PDFs, such as the Wilhelm I-Ching Translation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What we need first, though, is some code to read the things.
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
