We at Moon Books are not simply standing still, we are looking to the future, and to future book distribution methods. DSOrganize has an amazingly potentially very neat feature that may or may not go really really well with book distribution, the Homebrew Server.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has the desire and know-how to set up a homebrew server (info can be found here <a href="http://www.youngmx.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=311" target="_blank">http://www.youngmx.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=311</a>) please get everything running smoothly and get in touch with me to start incorporating Moon Books releases into the server.
<br/>
<br/>
With potential Moon Books compatability in DSOrganize, this could be a very large step forward in bringing literacy to the Nintendo DS. ... or at least books ;)
