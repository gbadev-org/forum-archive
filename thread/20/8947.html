of course they have, they can access the Internet so they need an ip adress. and you could use ds as a server, too, you would just need a server application for the DS (which dont exist atm afaik), and it wouldn't make much sense anyway, or would it?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes it would make sense. If you are developing a multiplayer game for Nintendo DS, then you will need to use one of the units as a server. Even if not, such as if you make a simple HTTP 1.1 server that runs on a DS, it'll get you a link from Slashdot and all the page views, PageRank, and AdSense revenue that comes along with it.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's no simple way to get your DS's IP address.
<br/>
<br/>
The only real way is to go through your router and check it's logs, or its information and actually see if there's a foreign IP address on your network. I believe the Nintendo DS will also call itself "Nintendo DS" on the network as well. Not sure.
<br/>
<br/>
You could always configure your Nintendo DS to have a static IP address, as opposed to DHCP. Then you'll at least know what it's numbers are.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Seriously though, if you're having problems trying to understand our explinations, then why don't you google your answer? There's hundreds of FAQs out there that will tell you how to connect to Nintendo WFC.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
<br/>
You need to put one of the cards into Infrastructure mode for the DS to connect, and even then, I am not sure what you want to accomplish, with the "dive" into MK.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
