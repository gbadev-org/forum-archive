You can lock the shoulder buttons. This version seems to play music better, at least .ogg. In older versions it would be muffled around %200 but now it doesn?t muffle till around %350. It's even listenable at %400 which it wasn't before.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, I managed to freeze it somehow by viewing a JPEG. I was hitting A and B a few times, trying to reproduce the 'garbled image on top screen' bug I mentioned (and I did), and it suddenly stopped responding to key presses or the touch screen. (The backlight shut off, though.) It only happened once, so maybe it's just a fluke.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Moonlight's main goal is to sort most of the bugs (all known ones) out before v1.00 release. 
<br/>
EDIT: After v1.00 it's most likely Game Over. Anyone could continue developing that because it's open source.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think 0.999 is a bad version numbering. Actually I was like.. wtf.. when I saw 0.999 after 0.992.. but he have changed  so much after 0.992.
<br/>
<br/>
I that hope v1.00 is a stable version and no slow downs if I tap any windowses while playing MP3's. I'm also hoping that the image viewer would be working as it should.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

<br/>
DPG audio does the decipherment with ARM7.
<br/>
<br/>
GSM and mp2 oversampling were not able to be built in at the same time.

<br/>
Which is more desirable?
<br/>
(Both are also invalid now.)
<br/>
<br/>
Method of confirming quality of over mp2 sampling.
<br/>
<br/>
1. The dpg file is made with dpgenc.
<br/>
2. The mp2 file of the unit is obtained with dpgdec.
<br/>
3. Please hear with MoonShellVer0.999 and compare dpg and mp2.
<br/>
<br/>
Postscript.
<br/>
It doesn't relate to whether the processing of ARM7 is heavy (mp2) or is light (GSM).
<br/>
It doesn't influence the ARM9 video decipherment.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way.

The image zoom thing pauses at various points like 100%, 200%, and 50%, which is very useful, video volume is nice and loud now, and the worrying button repeat rate with Select when playing videos was looked into.
<br/>
<br/>
There's still the weird problem with the top screen going blank when viewing images, though :(

<br/>
I noticed that the scrollbar in the text viewer will cut off the last character in a line of text. This is probably easily fixed.

Also... forgive me... a feature request: Is it possible to have the text viewer span across both screens?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Can you work around the bug for now by breaking the video at chapter stops?
<br/>
<br/>
As for frame rate, I'd suggest 12fps for non-action scenes and 24fps for action scenes. This is also a win for chapterized movies. If you're encoding animation (as opposed to live action), make sure to match the original's frame rate; it is likely to be 12fps or 8fps.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Well Moonlight has asked for help time and time again on his boards and here, unfortunatly the code is way over my head ATM. Maybe after the plugins section is finished Moonlight can rest and just do minimal updates to the GUI when Moonlight has spare time that is.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think you have outdone yourself Moonlight and should  take a well deserved holiday and get some rest!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes. That is so true. 
<br/>
There are cracking with some music files (if over 100%).
<br/>
The way it is now is probably the best way.
<br/>
<br/>
Video test:
<br/>
I test with default settings and 24fps, 256kbit video clip.
<br/>
With 0.999 test3 video seems to be more pixelated than with test2nocnt, why? Have anyone noticed?<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

<br/>
I've downloaded the Moonshell source code, moved it over to my Linux computer, successfully compiled it, and am now pondering it trying to figure out how the heck it all works.
<br/>
Moonshell, how on Earth did you write all this code?! 
<br/>
(It's amazing!)
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I am working on getting an option for the text viewer to span both screens (probably moderately difficult), achieve nice word-wrapping that works with spaces and compensates for the scroll bar, and optionally switch the image viewer to the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Any help with where in this ginormous source code I should be looking would be great :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

You can change settings in the global.ini and use skins. O_o  It's a bit different though than the current version normal MoonShell version, all skin settings are in the one global.ini like they used to be.  To be honest, it's kinda buggy yet.  It seems to work only sporadically for folks using FlashMe...it seems to work with a PassMe though.  I guess on the plus side you can view text and play music at the same time, which is kind of cool.

Ok, I replaced that moonshell version with G6 version of _BOOT_MP.nds. Now the skins work.
<br/>
But there is a bug in G6 I/O. If I go to MPCF and go out and try to go EXFS or anything else.. it gives me blank screen.
<br/>
Btw. Using MPCF has no seek time at all. Not even with big files. That is cool.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Ok, I see seeking when I use supermegabyte files. :D But there wasn't any with ~5-8MB files.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
