    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">..to use my NDS to the <span style="font-style: italic">fullest</span> potential. I'm looking for every app and game thats (atleast somewhat) worth my time. I'm the guy that usually overlooks something, so I want the devers who have spent countless hours on these forums to help me out. So far the only homebrew that I have is: (Updated from the responces...)
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>Moonshell
<br/>
DSOrganize
<br/>
NitroTracker
<br/>
Explosive Gas
<br/>
A touch of War
<br/>
VGMDS
<br/>
Super Snake DS
<br/>
DSDoom
<br/>
Bafio's Wifi Chat
<br/>
ScummVM
<br/>
DSLinux
<br/>
Draw
<br/>
Beup
<br/>
Pictodrive
<br/>
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
I know there is a lot more the community has to offer, and I feel rather guilty not giving everything a chance(since programming can be hard work).
<br/>
<br/>
The homebrew must either be flashcart compatible or SD compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Who knows? Maybe this will become the ultimate datasheet of homebrew apps...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Linkiboy on Wed Aug 09, 2006 2:33 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

also way of the rain is a good physics game.
<br/>
<br/>
speaking of physics my wy waverace tech demo pushes ds's to the limits with realtime waves physics and lots of polygons, but now its just fun for 3 minutes as the actual game isnt done yet.
