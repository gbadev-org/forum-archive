    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, first of all i would like to say that this is just an idea, and will most likely never happen. Also i would like to say i have no coding skills what so ever. XD anywho...
<br/>
<br/>
----The-idea----
<br/>
There is a free mmorpg for the pc called "starport" this game was created just by a few people and is a non-profit game it is a bit like elite in some respects you go around fighting, upgrading and trading with your ship (this game is 2D), Heres the link, <a href="http://www.starportgame.com" target="_blank">http://www.starportgame.com</a> its only 72mb, now, would it be possible to transfer this game to the nintendo ds? (of course with the creators permsion) Or would it be possible to make a similar game from scratch that is also an MMORPG for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
----------------
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, i think this would be nearly impossible but its a nice idea, what do you think? is this forgeable? or is creating a game like this worth it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Gamma</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, first of all, you are posting in the wrong forum (<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=20" target="_blank">this</a> would have been acceptable) and secondly, he did answer your inane question by saying "no." 
<br/>
<br/>
Look, I know it is nice to be idiotically idealistically optimistic about an idea and pretend to be cynical about it while asking those who actually have the skills and talent to bring it to life (rather than gaining that skill and talent yourself, or breathing every drop of air from your lungs into it, at the very least), and kudos to you for keeping up the act, but no one cares. Ideas are very numerous, if we even bothered to give our opinions about every idea out there (as you have requested) we would never get anything done. As for me, I just like to procrastinate my work.
<br/>
<br/>
If you weren't acting, just pretend you were from here on out, you will loose less respect that way.<br/>_________________<br/>- relpats_eht</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yo, welcome to the forums!
<br/>
I just had a quick glance over the site, and given the screenshots it doesn't look too taxing. However the screenshot look like they'd need a screen with a higher resolution/larger size than is available on the DS. Also due to the lack of source I doubt it'll be a community-done project, so would have to be done by the original people.
<br/>
Also as these two guys have (bluntly) stated, unless you do it yourself it's unlikely to happen!
<br/>
<br/>
To the others: let's not be rude about it. We need a structured system for people to supply ideas (eg a 'random ideas' forum), but until then we're just gonna have to make do.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you thought it was "nearly" impossible, why are you asking if anyone else will do it? Is there a salary or lots of pizza involved? ;)
<br/>
<br/>
If it's worth that much to you, there are already excellent, free tools and resources out there. And mind, I had PC experience first, but I've -really- enjoyed learning the DS. :-) Anyway, I've thought about porting stuff, and often, you have to ask yourself some genuinely hard questions.
<br/>
<br/>
First of all the DS screens are 256x192. Those are each *1/16* of the PC screenshots, and smaller fonts aren't gonna get you all the way there. Do you think the maps/radar will be legible? How much needs to be seen at once? Do some mockups in Gimp or Paint, to give yourself an idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Is chat an important part of the game? Especially during battle? How do you handle text input? The DS would prolly do better with voice chat, if you had a fast enough codec...
<br/>
<br/>
72mb is quite a lot for the DS. And that's just the compressed installer. Probably the bulk is graphics, which will shrink 4-16x to fit the smaller screen. If you're lucky it will be more like 16mb, and it will need a FAT device, maybe one with extra RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a cute little handheld with a mean punch, but it can't do everything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, so it's not really portable, but like he asked, could it be written on the DS from the ground up?  Sure, I don't see why not.  But, as others have pointed out.. unless you plan on doing it yourself.. don't count on it.
<br/>
<br/>
But, what this does is point out other projects to devers.  Not likely, but there could be a dever out there looking for an idea just like this.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
