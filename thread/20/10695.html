    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have flashme v7 installed, and I started having problems with the touch screen and buttons not responding, but I would just restart and it would be fine, but now I can't even use programs because they won't work.  Any help?  Sometimes the buttons work but for the most part no.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does it work good with regular games?  if not then you may be wearing the contacts, is it mostly the shoulder buttons because there is just a little piece of plastic used and that can wear easily, so stick something in there like a folded piece of paper or something<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No it doesn't, I can't play mario kart anymore!  It really kind of sucks, and I don't have the box anymore so walmart won't take it back and they don't have any new grey ds's to swap it with, only the blue ones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ya, I checked, warranty has run out.  I thought maybe it was something to do with my m3, guess I'll just have to wait till walmart gets some silver ds's.  Maybe I'll try futureshop, eb didn't have any at either of the ones in town.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
