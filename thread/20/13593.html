    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I mostly read the thread from two years ago about cracking the proprietary Nifi of the DS when in regular wireless mode to make a PC-to-DS client application.
<br/>
<br/>
I saw that they were successful in communicating with the DS, but never fully established that communication, since one of the packets from the PC never got a reply, presumably from coding error (I'm not saying that's what happened).
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming this can be slightly done from PC to DS, wouldn't it be possible to do it from DS to DS with the PC acting as a...hub, gateway, I'm not sure of the proper term since I'm not that knowledgeable about networking.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, say person A is in California and person B is in Maine, is it practically possible (latency issues aside) to play a non-Wifi multiplayer game over the Internet?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.
<br/>
<br/>
A member of a forum I mod is trying to get something like that to work, allegedly they've even seen each other's game, but they haven't been successful in establishing a reliable connection.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Even if you get the packages tunneled correctly, the usual internet ping rates would make most game partially or completely unplayable.
<br/>
<br/>
Programming local WiFi is much easier than doing online, because you're guaranteed very high ping rates most of the time, so developers don't need to worry about implementing lag-compensation algorithms and can use more crude ways to keep the game synchronized.
<br/>
<br/>
Mario Kart DS, as example, appears to use different code for the local and online WiFi. When something causes lag during local play (WiFI interference, packet loss, etc), the game will simply freeze for a split-second to synchronize. Tunneling the LAN mode over internet would probably make the races a freeze-fest (maybe even dropping connections if the lag gets too high).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, all I know is that they are tunneling through the Hamachi program from a USB Wifi dongle.  I don't have much of a clue with regards to the exact process.  Anyone here have much experience with either of these?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you said some games would be completely unplayable, do you know of any that would be in the slightest playable?  Maybe Meteos or something like that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Then they are either lying or are woefully off the mark. You can't just establish a VPN between the two computers and have the DS's communicate; the DS doesn't even use TCP/IP in local multiplayer.
<br/>
<br/>
There has to be some intermediary software that makes the computer mimic another DS, and then encapsulate that into IP packets. [/i]That<span style="font-style: italic"> is the hard part, and what has taken this long. Due in no small part to the difficulty of directly communicating with WiFi hardware under Windows.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
