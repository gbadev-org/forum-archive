You could try buying a copy of Doom for GBA on some auction site or running DSDoom.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As Dwedit pointed out - the SNES version of Doom is based on SuperFX, and is very unlikely to ever be supported on the DS, as the DS is generally too slow to emulate it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then play it on your SNES. Even the GP2X appears to have trouble emulating games that use a Super FX coprocessor. Do you really need to play it while being a passenger?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That really p*ssed me off, thankfully DSDoom put out that fire</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
