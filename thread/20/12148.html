<br/>
<br/>
I managed to get it working fine, but during compilation it was complaining that it couldn't find DC_FlushAll().  I looked in the source but couldn't find it myself either.  I ended up just commenting it out and stuff seems to work, and on my black DS homebrew wifi is much more impressive (it actually works more than 5% of the time now). :)  I was actually disappointed earlier that nothing seemed to work very consistently, so I'm excited to try out more stuff compiled with the new version.

Too bad everything has to be recompiled, it'll be neat to see how well the OS works out! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DC_FlushAll() is a function from libnds. dswifi compiles fine without it, but when linking your project, this function is linked to dswifi. In order for this to work, make sure that -lnds9 comes after -ldswifi9 in the LIBS line in your arm9 Makefile. I would not recommend commenting it out, as this might cause unexpected behavior.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
