    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Nintendo have revealed more info about the slim and sexy DS Lite.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo today announced that the DS Lite will be released in three color models on its Japanese debut on March 2. The handheld will be available in "Crystal White," "Ice Blue," and "Enamel Navy," and it will sell for 16,800 yen ($142)--1,800 yen ($15) more than the original DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Together with the announcement, Nintendo revealed additional details about the DS Lite. First and foremost, it confirmed once and for all DS Lite can play Game Boy Advance games, and its cartridge slot will be located at the same bottom rim of the handheld, as on the original DS. However, Nintendo notes that GBA cartridges will stick out by one centimeter when they're inserted into the DS Lite, due to the smaller form factor. The DS's card slot and power cord socket will be located in the same places as before, while the power switch and stylus holder have been relocated to the right edge of the handheld.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS Lite will come with four adjustable levels of screen brightness, with the maximum setting being five times as luminous as the original DS's. Battery life has also been improved. The original DS ran 6 to 10 hours on a full recharge, and the DS Lite runs for about the same number of hours on its maximum brightness. The new model can run 15 to 19 hours on its lowest brightness, 10 to 15 hours on its second level of brightness, 7 to 11 hours on its third level, and 5 to 8 hours on the maximum level. What's more, the DS Lite's battery recharges in three hours, which is an hour less than the original DS.
<br/>
<br/>
As previously reported, the DS Lite's body thickness has been reduced by a third (when folded), and it features a 20 percent weight reduction, from 275 grams to 218 grams. The screen size remains unaffected, and both the top and bottom panels use 3-inch LCDs. The original DS used semitransmissive LCDs for its two panels, but the DS Lite will use transmissive LCDs, which allows for higher levels of brightness.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS Lite will come with a new AC adapter that is not compatible with other Nintendo handhelds, including both the original DS and Game Boy Micro. There will be two stylii bundled with the DS Lite, and they'll come in the same body color as the handheld. The stylii will be one centimeter longer and one millimeter thicker than those included with the original DS. The DS Lite will also be bundled with a carrying strap and a plastic dust cover that can snap into the GBA slot when empty.

How many smart people accidentally shut off their DS's? I mean come on I've used a couple DS's (4 or 5, 2 mine ..1 my friends, and 1 my brother's) and never have i accidentally shut it off.

My Ds always took 4 hours for a full recharge and while the original games made the DS battery last 6-10 these newer more powerful ones have been draining it MUCH faster, I wolud sat 5-8 (mario kart, animal crossing and tony hawk none wifi do this, with wifi don't even go there). The lowest setting is probably going to still be as bright if not brighter then the current DS which means WAY more batter time if you want something a little darker :P.
