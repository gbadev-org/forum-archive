    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Instructions: 
<br/>
<br/>
1. Insert a DS game in NDS slot.
<br/>
2. Turn up your DS and open Pictochat, room A.
<br/>
3. Now remove the NDS cartridge from the NDS slot (don't worry, you can't do much harm).
<br/>
4. Both screens should turn in the same color.
<br/>
<br/>
If the screens don't turn YELLOW or MAGENTA (and you're not using iQue DS), it is a safe bet that it's PassME1 and WiFiME compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The color 'chart':</span>
<br/>
<br/>
- NDS-V1: DS will freeze, when you remove the cart.
<br/>
- NDS-V2: <span style="color: #6688ff">Grayish Blue</span> (thanks, tepples)
<br/>
- NDS-V3: <span style="color: darkgreen">Dark Green</span> (Note! A <span style="font-weight: bold">silver</span> DS bought in MK:DS bundle is most probably <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> installed with FW4!)
<br/>
- NDS-V4: <span style="color: #ffcc00">Yellow</span>
<br/>
- NDS-V5: <span style="color: #FF00FF">Magenta</span>
<br/>
- iQue FW: <span style="color: darkgreen">Dark Green</span>
<br/>
- FM-V1-6: <span style="color: darkgreen">Dark Green</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who helped me at this mini research.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by MaHe on Tue Feb 07, 2006 11:26 am; edited 9 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
One is from Japan (white) the other from america (silver launch).
<br/>
Both have different user color settings.
<br/>
Congratulations Mahe it appears you may have found the way for anyone to tell what passme they need.
<br/>
<br/>
[Notes]
<br/>
Also they go green if you remove the thing in the GBA slot however re-inserting the GBA slot reboots the DS. Re-inserting the DS cart doesn't restart it.
<br/>
I tried it with a GBAMP, GBA commercial game and a flash cart all give green screens.
<br/>
I tried different pictochat rooms and still got green screens.

I think I had a counterexample to that, a silver MKDS-bundle DS bought in Germany last week that didn't work with Wifime. Unfortunately I exchanged it the same day because of multiple stuck pixels, so I don't know what color it would have shown with this test.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Mine is a silver DS bought with the MK bundle - not done anything with it yet apart from play the odd game :).
<br/>
<br/>
Followed the instructions and both screens went blank, with what I suppose was a bit of a greenish tinge (though it's difficult to tell - it was only slightly more coloured than if the DS was off) - does this sound right? I've only just bought the DS and was looking to get a passme or variant but don't know which to get so this is obviously important to get right so I don't waste money on a passme 1.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heya guys,
<br/>
I've got a UK DS here that I bought second hand, it was in a metroid demo bundle so I assume it was an original UK release.
<br/>
<br/>
Screens turn the dark blue colour, I will be getting a NeoFlash MK2 in a few weeks so will update then. (I assume I will only need the MK2, an original DS game,  and an SD-card to get started)
<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has tested his UK Blue Nintendogs bundle and it produces the yellow screens.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing i'd like to mention that might be important to you guys. I've noticed that on some machines when you boot up and the health warning screen is shown, there is no nintendo logo below 'nintendoDS' on the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed this? Could people please post as regards to whether their DS has this?
<br/>
<br/>
I apologise in advance if this has been covered already, cheers

The only thing nintendo can do to fix the passme2 bug, is to range check the swi functions, or have a 1KByte bios swi jump table, in the arm7 bios.  Since this would involve making a new mask/die for the ds cpu, this is very unlikely to happen anytime soon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

my ds was preowned when i bought it in early september, but its an NU900, meaning (from what i heard) that it was refurbished at some point, but not when i bought it, so these are the stages of my ds's ownership that i'm thinking its been in

2. sold to some store, which sent it to nintendo to be refurbished

6. i bought it

That dumps the ARM9 and ARM7 BIOS..ses of the DS...what we're talking about here is the firmware.

It's a bit more of a pain in the butt to use (as you need to dump it in chunks so it'll fit into GBA SRAM) but it works. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I did try it, it didn't work right with the Supercard, even with natrium's helps, the checksums came out wrong.  So I'll leave the firmware dumping to someone with a better cart, and so I thought I'd be the guinea pig flasher :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

so what do you think it is?
<br/>
would nintendo need another firmware release?
<br/>
do you think they could posible make it so you can't even play people on multiplay (30ft one)
<br/>
if they have an illegeal copy?
<br/>
<br/>
that would be pushing the limits people will go to stop that tho :P

Sorry if this bump is pretty much unrequired, I float around gbadev but decided to go out and buy a ds the other weekend (silver mario kart bundle)
<br/>
<br/>
This method with the nds (brought on 19th april 2006 in the uk) gave me a very deep blue, if not grey. I think its <span style="font-weight: bold">FW6</span>, will look into it.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit1* On looking over the list again it might be <span style="font-weight: bold">FW2</span>, but the thing is that the DS has been out over a year now and the bundle ds' still feature the old 2nd FW? a bit odd and also still confusing for me. Also adjusting the angle of the ds will result in blues and greys changing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The FlashMe installer tells you which version you have installed.
<br/>
DSLinux also tells you before you log in.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
