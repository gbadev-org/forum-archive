    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Edit:
<br/>
My intent is actually to create an engine which uses the gameplay of Dune 2 on the DS. 
<br/>
Graphics and textfiles customizing the engine to look like Dune 2 or any other copyrighted game, will not be distributed by me. The user will have to do this for himself. It's probable some sort of graphics and textfiles pack will be released with the engine, but that will be all original content. 
<br/>

<br/>
Hmm... I was thinking of creating a remake of Dune 2 for the DS.
<br/>
It's not TA, but in my view it's even better. It should be strategy enough for most people; it being the grand master RTS which started it all*.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I've sent an email to the creator of D2TM, see if I can at least get the AI he uses and such. At least the graphics (mostly 16x16 tiles or sprites) suit the DS well. Plus most of the sounds are available in wav-format.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the time to undertake such a project by myself though. If programmers are interested in helping out with Dune2S, contact me.

I just realised that in order to get this noticed, and get responses from 
<br/>
other programmers, this'll need to go in a new topic. Plus it doesn't really 
<br/>
fit in this current topic, which is more about two TA games. :)

Dune 2 being the first serious RTS game anywhere, and given that an open source engine has been made to play the game, and the fact that coding something as simple as Dune 2 will be FAR simpler than trying to code a more complex game like C&amp;C, and the fact that Dune 2 is VASTLY underrated AND fantastically fun, and... and... AND.... etc...
<br/>
<br/>
You gotta start somewhere, and obviously, Dark Knight ez has chosen this as his project, so this is what he's doing. I'm not saying the other games wouldn't be good on the DS, but Dune 2 is NO slouch in the RTS department (consider ALL RTS since Dune 2 have derived at least some, if not most of their mechanics and design FROM Dune 2), backed by an EXCELLENT story by Frank Herbert, there's just too many reasons to port this. I'm VERY glad to hear it's being made for the DS. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

Okay, you've got me there. I'd been wondering if there were others out there... BUT to Dune 2's credit, most every RTS since Dune 2 has stolen from the formula popularized in the game. They all steal some manner of mechanics from Dune 2 (and I'm not talking just the overhead view). Also Herzog Zwei isn't considered by many to be a serious RTS game, considering the quality of the AI... or at least not a very high quality one. But eh, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel here. I have at least one friend that DID like the game, but I never really got into it.
