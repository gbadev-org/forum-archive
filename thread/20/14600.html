<br/>
like:
<br/>
<br/>
*what software to get
<br/>
*what will help me in the long run even if its harder to learn now
<br/>
*tips and tricks for ds programming
<br/>
*to just be there for my realy noobish and simple questions lol

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For the long run learn "algorithms", and the like first and begin to have "sport" with the areas that are required for the creation of a game. Some people learn better in different orders, which is why many people struggle with programming despite having the potential to learn.
<br/>
<br/>
For a starting point, I think an IDE that manages projects and compilations are good for learning "programming". Makefiles are a "related" topic, and learning them is good for general practice.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, people prefer to learn in different orders; some people are motivated by instant viewable results, so learning algorithms does not give them the practical results required to keep them interested.
<br/>
<br/>
So what type of person are you? Can you take in the theory of a topic without having to do the practice? Do you require viewable results to learn? Can you only learn by practice?
<br/>
<br/>
Until then I think the tonc tutorials are good for getting you intimate with the GBA, and embedded systems in general. cprogramming.com has tutorials on C++.

<br/>
<br/>
Ok well I'm pretty sure I need viewable results to learn, and I DEFINITELY learn by practise, but it possible for me to take in the theory of a topic depending on the topic and theory. I guess this mean algorithms will be harder for me to learn, but if it helps in the long run ill force myself to learn them lol. Thanks for the list keldon im sure ill end up using it, adn what direction should i take?
<br/>
<br/>
also answering the questions as i did would it be easier for me to get into ds homebrew if i start with making basic c++ programs, went on do gba advance development, and then go into ds development?<br/>_________________<br/>Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation:

LUA is definately limited, it's a simple scripting langauge thus much worse performance than C / C++ on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
PAlib is good if your goal is to get out a few quick demos, nothing too complex, and don't plan to spend that much time on the DS in the long run. The downsides of PAlib are that it's poorly coded, limits what you can do with the hardware, and breaks everytime there's a change in the underlying devkitarm or libnds (due to the way they integrate their stuff).
<br/>
<br/>
It's definately a good idea to have some basic understanding of programming in C / C++ before starting on the NDS, since it's a lot easier to test &amp; debug programs on the PC. I'd suggest learning by making a couple medium complexity apps on the PC first. You don't have to go through GBA, though it may help, since GBA development is much more mature than DS.
<br/>
<br/>
This is arguably the best primer on C++ on the market today:

By learning how to code this way you'll become a better all round coder, which should let you transfer your skills to most platforms/languages. However the learning curve is a lot steeper. Whereas you could get some basics learning simpler things first. However it depends completely on your style. I personally just jump into the harder stuff. If you get stuck you can always take backwards steps!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
