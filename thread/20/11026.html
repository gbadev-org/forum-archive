    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it true that DarkFader programmed a Virus for the DS?
<br/>
There is an Article saying that:
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndswelt.com/2005/10/11/warnung-nintendo-ds-virus-zerstort-die-firmware/" target="_blank">http://www.ndswelt.com/2005/10/11/warnung-nintendo-ds-virus-zerstort-die-firmware/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a German Page, here is the translation:
<br/>
<br/>
Warning, Nintendo DS Virus destroys Firmware
<br/>
<br/>
Like before on the PSP, the first Virus exists for the DS now. The Program was programmed and published by a guy named DarkFader.  The virus is camouflaged as Hentai Viewer (taihen.zip) or as Rom Loader (r0mloader.zip) and flashes parts of the firmware - for most user this means that the DS becomes unusable after the Attack. Remedy creates a Tool named FlashMe that must be installed already before - thus it is possible to put the firmware on again. Generally thus caution is required, if new Roms are installed - beginners should inform first in detail about Homebrew (privately programmed NDS software).

sorry in case of possible translation mistakes^^

r0mloader.zip

taihen.zip

Both are detected by Norton Antivirus aswell so you don't really have much to worry about. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But you shouldn't have to worry about it. As I said, it's pretty much out of circulation. IIRC nobody has been bricked by it since it was released.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?
