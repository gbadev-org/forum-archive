    <h4>#74847 - ultrablade - Wed Mar 08, 2006 3:27 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm... so today 3/7, I found out amazing discoveries.
<br/>
<br/>
So I did what I said, I traded my gbasp for my friend's broken nintendo ds. (I got the sp for 5 bucks seriously) My SP worked great, while my friends DS was messed up, what it did was come on, flashed a white screen, and cut back off. Besides that, he lied and said "My friend opened up my DS and took a chip out." Bullsh*t!
<br/>
<br/>
So later on, I took out the DS's daughterboard and I put it into my original DS. (Whose I thought the volume was not working. Read my other thread for more info in this section.) And check this out! His DS booted with music and all! I concluded this... F1 fuse is the fuse for the internal video output, and F2 fuse is the fuse for internal audio output! I figured out that the reason that my DS had no volume, is because the F2 blew! (Easily replaceable... I replaced my F1 also.) Well, I am going to solder the F2 on my orginal ds but that's not the point now.... [keep reading on]
<br/>
<br/>
On top of all that, his DS has FW1, and I had FW4 so I bought a Passkey 2 for like nothing! (Before I got my friends DS)
<br/>
<br/>
And so now it's like this. I have a fully working DS, and a Semi working DS. I;m trying to figure out why his DS screen flashes white and cuts back off.
<br/>
<br/>
That's that. It's the End.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">**UPDATE**</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I figured it out! The guy whose DS I have was eating something, and it somehow got into his DS, and food messed up the touch screen port. It's burnt out. So Now, I completed disassembled his DS and I just took his shell. I could fix his DS, but I would need to buy another touch screen and I'm not going to!
<br/>
<br/>
So now, I'm stuck with bare parts.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Part List:</span></span></span>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">Nintendo DS flashme 6 daughterboard
<br/>
Nintendo DS buttons. (Start, A, X, L, etc.)
<br/>
Nintendo DS top LCD
<br/>
Nintendo DS speakers &amp; the speaker boards
<br/>
Half working DS touch LCD?
<br/>
Nintendo DS bottom shell</span>
<br/>
<br/>
That's all I'm left with, plus my original DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the bottom touchscreen is replaceable and shouldnt cost much. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you live in USA, you might want to call Nintendo of America and ask for a replacement of the screen (sure, they'll charge, but at least now you'll have 2 working DSs for the price of an SP!)

<br/>
<br/>
there's a video that might help you out, audio is in spanish though. It shows that the bottom touchscreen isnt a touchscreen, its just an LCD identical to the top one, with a touchpanel on top of it. (Thus, calibration is needed)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oho, so the touch screen's lack of an easily replaceable cover (mounted in front of the casing) is, in fact, a design flaw. (As I thought.)

I'm surprised... Nintendo usually seems to do pretty well with designing sturdy handheld consoles.

Here's a link to that video on Google. (Much faster.)

It has proof, once and for all, that there are three layers on the touch screen, one of which is protective. (And one is firmly attached to another).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

You're kinda right, but wrong at the same time. There's only two layers. The guy only put the touch screen portion back.
<br/>
<br/>
I just took my broken one apart and noticed that there's only two layers.. It's kinda cool, the bottom screen is actually the exact same screen as the top one, only there's an extra layer atop of the screen that takes the touch read-outs. It's pretty freakin' sweet. hehe. But the touch-layer is being directly stimulated by the actual player themselves, which si why the screen protectors people put on it don't work well, because it's hindering the touch layer to take inputs properly.
<br/>
<br/>
The back protective foam is nothing more than a barrier that holds an extra cable on against the screen so that it's not loose.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
