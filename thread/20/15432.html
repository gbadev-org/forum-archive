    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I know this is probably wishful thinking and entirely impossible, but couldn't they incorperate another processor in an exp. pak? I mean really... it would give the DS more power than just a ram upgrade, perhaps putting another 67mhz processor in there (if thats possible), and perhaps give it a little better 3d capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
But, my question is what does the regular expansion pak affect when it comes to homebrews, like DS organize? I noticed when you view multiple pictures on DS organize, after about 10, it stops being able to render them. Would getting the 8mb ram expansion pak fix this? Along with would the webbrowser work a little better? just wondering. :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yes, some snes (also some nes games had stuff like custom sound processors on cart) games used some extensions in their carts, like the fx processor for games like starfox, doom (?) and yoshi's island. that effectively made the 2.5 mhz system a 16+ (or some other random value, i can't remember the numbers) mhz system with extended capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
you can recognise snes carts with build in hw extensions by the two (left and right) extra pin connector parts on the bottom.
<br/>
<br/>
on topic: it depends on the slot2's bus speed, i guess. but i could be done, although production costs for such a game would be too high, so i don't see it coming very soon. the nds is still a pretty powerful device. ;^)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well... the thing is, I see the ds as slightly underpowered. Its mostly because of its low 3d power, which I wish it would have more, but also, I was wondering, you would need a more powerful battery for the DS its self for this, wouldn't you, because of how this would also require the DS to work a bit hard to access this extra processor and ram? and about how much would  this cost (and could someone possibly make it themselves at home, just wondering lol)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is this true? i found it on a website:
<br/>
<br/>
CPU: ARM946E-S @ 67 MHz (capable of up to 200 MHz)  
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sub CPU: ARM7TDMI @ 33 MHz (capable of up to 133 MHz)  
<br/>
<br/>
It had the specs about the DS. Is it true that you can over clock (I don't know if thats the right term, I'm kinda guessing on that one) the CPU to 200mhz? wouldn't that fry it? (just wondering)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On the tiny DS screen, I'm not sure having alot more polygons would be worth it, it's all about compromise.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I used my OBJ loader to load a 1900 polygon mechwarrior I modelled once just to see how it would turn out, and it looked pretty much the same as a scaled down model in the hundreds.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think development for the DS is interesting because it's about creating something with limited resources. I remember simonjhall saying if he wanted to program for something with power, he'd program on his PC, if he wants a challenge then he'd program on his DS. I guess that's how I feel too, although an FPU would be great!
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the overclocking, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYIvASbELkw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYIvASbELkw</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The only 2 things that would (generally) fry a processor are heat and too much voltage. Overclocking a processor and not supplying enough voltage to keep it stable wouldn't damage it, but the extra heat generated could. Slap a Thermaltake Ultra-120 Extreme on it!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Rajveer on Wed Apr 23, 2008 1:38 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've asked this before and was told the GBA bus isn't fast enough. I don't really see why that's an issue if you're doing something like the SPC700 though, where you have very little communication between processors and a bit of RAM on the card for it. For something like an FPU it'd probably still be faster than software floating point. (And for SNES emulation, an actual SPC700 and a headphone jack. ;-))

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Most game code is usually executed on the ARM9 processor (in fact, Nintendo reportedly doesn't allow developers use the ARM7 processor, except by predefined API functions, anyways, even with the most likely inefficient API code, most of the ARM7's 33MHz horsepower is left unused).
<br/>
The ARM9's 66MHz "horsepower" is a different tale - it seems Nintendo thought that a 33MHz processor would be too "slow" for 3D games, and so they (tried to) badge an additional CPU to the original GBA hardware.
<br/>
However, the real 66MHz can be used only with cache and tcm, all other memory and I/O accesses are delayed to the 33MHz bus clock, that'd be still quite fast, but, there seems to be a hardware glitch that adds 3 waitcycles to all nonsequential accesses at the NDS9 side, which effectively drops its bus clock to about 8MHz, making it ways slower than the 33MHz NDS7 processor, it's even slower than the original 16MHz GBA processor.

You can still render just 2k primitives at max. per frame (the refresh rate is always 60 hz) and if you use the "frame drop cheat" via capturing (which I guess is meant above), you have to be very clever to hide it's big, big problems of having no depth information, as you are essentially just glueing two independent frames together.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released
