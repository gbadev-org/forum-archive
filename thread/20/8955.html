You'll need
<br/>
<br/>
- NDS capable of booting homebrew (WMB or flashcard - both works)
<br/>
- open Access Point (no WEP or other encryption supported by the lib yet)
<br/>
<br/>

You can contact me on MSN (messenger or eMail): <a href="mailto:dreamflat@hotmail.com">dreamflat@hotmail.com</a>

<br/>
The network code isn't complete yet, but by tomorow evening I should have both client and server code implemented.
<br/>
<br/>
You can contact me earlier, I can send you a version without network-code, so you can get familiar with the game (You can train with your friends via hot-seat  or with the CPU-enemy...the AI isn't too good, but for beginners it should be fine :) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
First (hopefully) working version online.

<br/>
Blubb uses the network settings in the firmware (1st entry) - use an official game to edit the settings.
<br/>
<br/>
It requires following settings :
<br/>
-Static IP
<br/>
-no WEP
<br/>
<br/>
You MUST forward UDP, port 9999 to your NDS (read the manual of your AP if you don't know how)
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't included an online-point in the main-menu yet. to start a online match you have to :
<br/>
1st : connect to AP(last menupoint)
<br/>
2nd : Press "SELECT" untill you are in the proper mode (Server or Client)
<br/>
(One player has to use client-mode, the other server)
<br/>
3rd : Press on "Multiplayer"
<br/>
<br/>
This version is only tested on LAN - I hope it works on the internet too....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You need following connection settings on the NDS (use Mario Kart or any other online game to change them) :
<br/>
The game currently uses Connection Settings #ONE !
<br/>
<br/>
-SSID : doesn't matter
<br/>
-WEP-KEY : EMPTY !
<br/>
-Auto Obtain IP-Address : NO !
<br/>
-IP ADRESS : 192.168.x.x (depends on your routers settings)
<br/>
-SUBNET MASK : depends on your router settings (normally 255.255.255.0)
<br/>
-GATEWAY : Your routers IP (normally 192.168.x.1)
<br/>
-Auto-obtain DNS : NO !
<br/>
Primary DNS : Your routers IP (normally 192.168.x.1)
<br/>
Secondary DNS : empty (doesn't matter)
<br/>
<br/>
To start an online game :
<br/>
<br/>
- connect to router (main menu : "Connect to AP")
<br/>
- in main menu press "SELECT" until you have the needed mode (server or client mode)
<br/>
- now click on MULTIPLAYER (the server should already be listening, when the client connects !)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by qw3rty on Tue Mar 21, 2006 10:38 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the first LOBBY VERSION online :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there are still lots of bugs to fix, but I need many testers now.
<br/>
<br/>
Download at : <a href="http://qwerty.servebeer.com/lobby-BLUBB.rar" target="_blank">http://qwerty.servebeer.com/lobby-BLUBB.rar</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Portmapping isn't necessary, although preffered by me, because it limits bandwith usage.
<br/>
<br/>
Features :
<br/>
<br/>
-Server-based savegames. Your NDS will be recognized at logon (don't worry, I won't save any personal data of your NDS)
<br/>
-Top Ten : "games won %" / "hits %" ; your user has to have at least 3 games + 1 game per week registerd, to be on the list.
<br/>
-Lobby-Broadcast Chat
<br/>
-Invite other players
<br/>
<br/>
Explanation of the user-list :
<br/>
<br/>
a "P" in front means "private", that means a user doesn't accept games of random users.
<br/>
a "O" in front means "open" - the player accepts games from anyone.
<br/>
If you press on "play" in the lobby-menu, you change your state to "open" (that's similar to nintendo's "worldwide" setting).
<br/>
Invitations are automatically acknowledged by "open" players.
<br/>
If the username is in brackets, the player is away playing a round of blubb - he won't receive the lobby-messages, nor can he send messages to the lobby.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See you in the lobby :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Not knowing anything about the source, my guess is that a few packets were lost. Recommended fixes (if this turns out to be a problem)
<br/>
<br/>
1. Have Blubb expect the DS to reply after recieving packet. Have it reply once it recieves. If the DS doesn't send the confirmation packet, it should send the original packet. If the second DS *did* send a confirmation packet but the confirmation packet never got there, have first DS resend the move end packet. Second DS will check it to see if it is identical to packet already recieved
<br/>
<br/>
2. Have a timer, resend packet after player has been inactive for a while. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's my two cents. Using either of these, in my opinion, would be good even if this isn't the bug.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do, of course, acknowledge the packets....in bad situations many packets are lost !
<br/>
<br/>
And I do send the "end-of-round" packet again, if needed, but there are still a lot of bugs in the lobby....so the server-based games aren't very reliable yet.
<br/>
<br/>
But I hope I can fix most of the problems soon...(I'm already on the trace of a few bugs :D )
<br/>
<br/>
P-S. : the download on my page was updated with a new version. I fixed a few bugs - one of them was the nonfuntcioning start of direct-connect games (when one user had his ports forwarded it wouldn't start !)
