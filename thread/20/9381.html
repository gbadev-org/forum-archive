<br/>
- run minigames

<br/>
I was just reading on Games Central (teletext page 805 in the UK - always a good read) that the tilt switches that Nintendo use have mercury inside them and this means that they are banned in the EU, which is why Wario Ware Twisted has still not been release here.
<br/>
<br/>
So no tilt switch in the DS and no tippy control for the wave machine. Very nice idea though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No , not at all.
<br/>
They dont use murcury, they use Piezoelectric sensors that works by tiny vibrateing strip in a magnetic field.
<br/>
<br/>
Murcury is an old method based on gravity.
<br/>
If it was murcury based, Twisted wouldnt be able to sense turning if you were holding it the wrong way. (like downwards).
<br/>
<br/>
The sensor in twisted is very good, very responsive.

The sensor of "Wario Ware Twisted!" employs our Ceramic gyro. The downsized and high-performance gyro is a key device for realizing this enjoyable game. In sum, it can be said that our Ceramic gyro has opened a new possibility in the field of games.

Maybe.
<br/>
Version of Touched can certainly identify it at least. (unfortuntely, the regions have to match..meaning I cant use my JapTwisted and USTouch to unlock the little bonus).
<br/>
<br/>
I dont think GBA games have to be specialy designed for a DS program to access bits of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#81449 - tepples - Sat Apr 29, 2006 5:44 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For programs using the official SDK, the DS program needs to contain a bit identical copy of the 32(?) byte header of each cart that it wants to access, and then it's granted access to the cart. This header differs for the xxxJ (Japan), xxxE (North America), and xxxP (Europe and NZ/Australia) versions of a given title, which is why you can't use GBA and DS games from different regions.
<br/>

For homebrew, just read from ROM at 0x08000000 and SRAM at 0x0A000000 (not 0x0E000000 as on GBA).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Must just be Nintendo treating Europe like the strange aunt that you keep in the loft, becuase "she is family", and give food to and the like but you do not really like talking about.
<br/>
Or could be some nasty chemical in the sensor that does not meet the RoHS Directive. Although this directive does not mean they are banned until July this year so who knows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
