My DS lite is now unflashed ready to be sent off to Nintendo for repair and
<br/>
another friend has an unflashed DS lite. The host used a backup bomberman (patched for supercard) and both <span style="font-weight: bold">unflashed</span> DSs downloaded the game fine.
<br/>
<br/>
From what I understand there is an RSA check for DS download play to prevent piracy or unofficial code. <span style="font-weight: bold">Doesn't this mean a modified bomberman could run through wifime on newer DSs, or am I missing something?</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oh, so it's not unique that it works on unflashed newer firmware DSs? I thought backups/pirates had a problem with DS download play because of the RSA check. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thought I'd found the solution to wifime2. Oh well!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
