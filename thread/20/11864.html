    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been having a problem with DPGPlay that I can't figure out how to fix. DPG1 files playback way too dark (DPG2 too probably), and I can only assume that it's related to the pixel format. However, I don't know how to get mplayer to handle the different pixel format.
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix it (apart from using something like a gamma change)? I'd appreciate some help.

Edit: Well, LS5 found the problem, but I definitely don't know what to do to fix it.

In RGB24, one color might be represented as... let's say 10101010, right? dpgenc then applies a bit shift. For RGB21 it shifts it by 1, for RGB18 by 2 and for RGB15 by 3. So for example, the previous color information would become 10101 when RGB15 is used (the last three bits get lost in the process). The problem for MEncoder is that it detects this color information as being 00010101 instead of the 'correct' 10101000 (which is still less precise than the original color, but it comes very close). dpgshow shifts these bits left again internally, so you'll have to find a way to simulate this with MEncoder.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
