As you know Nintendogs has some tasks that you can do only three times a day. And changing the RTC settings won't bypass it. So ... how did they do it?
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's a simple solution, I just can't think of one ... :/<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">just a guess;
<br/>
<br/>
theres some sort of counter or flag in the firmware somewhere
<br/>
<br/>
save game saves the last value the counter/flag was at
<br/>
when save game is loaded it compares the values, if they're different the time has been changed so it locks all the features until the next 24 hours.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
