    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have done everything I can. I have much experience in coding and file trans. between my PC and my DS. But I have one small problem. I need help with this from someone who has knowledge of the DS "imposter 'Pod" homebrew. Here is the problem:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have had my Linksys wireless adapter (PCI) for a few years now. I have located the Ralink 2560 series replacement software after a good deal of searching. I have also located the WMB.exe program for sending homebrews to DS download play. I only need some feedback on how to replace the drivers on my PCI Adapter with the replacement ones. ONce I have this finished, I should be able to run wmb.exe without a problem. Can anyone tell me where I should look to find my drivers? I'm running XP with SP2.

If the color indicates that you have a DS with firmware version 4 or higher, you cannot use WifiMe, and therefore it would be usless to help you with the wireless drivers as the only things you'd be able to send with WMB would be officially signed demos.
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't harm your game card since neither slot-1 nor slot-2 is being accessed while in Pictochat mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I expect there'll be a lot of newbie-ish questions revolving around this since the article mentioned gbadev.org forums, and was specifically referring to the iPod DS thing.  
<br/>
<br/>
How wonderful that all effort side-stepping the trademark name was killed by a magazine's cute little article.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I didn't see a specific reference to whether you're using an old DS or a DSL.  You're better off following the advice given later and investing in a newer media device since the wifime hack stopped being a viable option after the new chipsets were introduced.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of taking out the card is to get it to freeze, but depending upon the color of the screens when it freezes, you can determine your firmware version.  Only certain versions will work with various techniques.  The link posted before elaborates on this.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting it to work with wifime, following the instructions should work.. is the network card actually one listed as being compatible with the hacked drivers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And if it just freezes without turning the screens a solid color, you have v1, and WiFiMe plus a SLOT-2 card should work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But now when I try to do a Hardware Update or replace the drivers it gives me the usual: "None of the information is related to your hardware" and won't let me replace the Ralink drivers. I've even checked the official drivers and they are Ralink, but it won't let me replace them with more Ralink drivers. And I'm really positive that my card is on the compatibility list.

That's a pretty confusing statement.  I take it you mean you don't have an mp3 player that looks like a ipod, you are intending to use lmp-ng.  Please don't refer it as "DS ipod homebrew".  I'm sure the coders of lmp-ng don't need the hassle of Apple trying to sue them

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I too am completely confused by your last statement.  You are trying to run LMP-ng, correct?  The DS media player that looks like an iPod?  Like felix said, it won't do you any good, since you will have to have a media adapter to store the songs on anyway.  
<br/>
<br/>
Even if you figure out how to send WifiMe through WMB, all it does is boot a slot-2 flash cartridge in DS mode.  Like you said, you must have FlashMe installed to send unsigned homebrew through WMB.  However, you cannot install FlashMe if you don't have a media adapter in the first place.  Theoretically, you could use WMB to send WifiMe, which can launch the Flashme file stored on a slot-2 device, after which point you can use WMB to send unsigned homebrew.  
<br/>
<br/>
The point is that you will have to spend some money some way or another.  I would suggest getting a slot-2 device.  Put Flashme on the media card and use WifiMe to boot it.  Then add your music and LMP-ng to your card, boot up your DS, and launch LMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am using a custom made mp3 program that is NOT related to the ipod except for the click wheel on the bottom screen. That brings me to my second idea. What I meant the second time was the only thing that is the same between the REAL IPOD and the DS media player is the click wheel.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">LMP, aka Lick's Media Player, used to be known by another name, something like DSPod or DS iPod or something.  The name was changed right about the time it got discontinued.  The very last release of it was the first version to offer sound support, though it was very choppy.  Here is the original thread for it:  <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11800" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11800</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucas took the source for Lick's Media Player and updated it to work better, act more like an iPod, and playback mp3 files without the choppiness of the previous version.  This modification he called LMP-ng.
<br/>
<br/>
If nobody believes you, it's because you refuse to tell us what the actual name of the homebrew program is called, and as far as I am aware there is no other iPod clone for the DS.  Therefore, all we can do is assume.  From what you say, it almost sounds like you're using a private program that was never released publicly, in which case there's no point in asking us about it.  If you're using the discontinued version, I have to ask why, as LMP-ng supercedes it and is greatly improved.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And everything should work.  And if you have any problems with those instructions I'm afraid you'll have to retract your statement about not being new to DS homebrew ;)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">--Drack</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I just found out that we all have been wasting our time. There is a new SLOT-1 DS card that has a slot for a micro sd card. All you have to do is flash the homebrew-whatever it may be-to the micro sd. Take out the sd and put it in the ds cartridge and put the cartridge in the ds. Boot it up, and you don't even need flashme!!! I AM SERIOUSLY TICKED OFF.
