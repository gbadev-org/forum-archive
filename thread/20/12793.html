    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, first time poster (as you can probably see), and as a result I feel a bit cheeky asking for advice straight off the bat, but hopefully it will be ok and I won't be eaten alive by the masses ^_^.
<br/>
<br/>
Right, erm..  I'm currently working on a visual novel project as part of a course in experimental film (I'm very interested in exploring the line between film and video games when working with interactivity and methods of presentation) and have been looking at the different methods with which I could approach it. Initially I considered using Flash as I have worked with flash and actionscript before and I believe I could further increase my knowledge of it to the standard necessary and complete the piece by September. Recently however I came across tools specifically made for the production of visual novels and have been exploring them.   nscripter/Onscripter being the engine I have looked into most and am now experimenting with.
<br/>
<br/>
For those unfamiliar with nscripter/Onscripter, <a href="http://nscripter.insani.org/index.html" target="_blank">http://nscripter.insani.org/index.html</a> will give you a rundown. But basically it is an japanese adventure game scripting engine, nscripter being the original and onscripter being the updated opensource variant and continuation (nscripter has long since stopped being updated).
<br/>
<br/>
As well as creating the project I have been asked to greatly consider the method by which it is to be shown and interacted with and whilst creating the piece for PC is perfectly adequate I personally feel having it on a DS would be far better, due in no small part to the DS being booklike in apearance and its size allowing to create a much more intimate   relationship with the work. 
<br/>
<br/>
Onscripter has thus far been ported to a number of platforms (OSX, Linux, OS2, GP2X, iPod, Dreamcast and PSP) and I come here to ask if anyone in the DS homebrew community has any knowledge of a port to the DS or for that matter if it is even possible to perform such a port - I would have <span style="font-style: italic">assumed</span> that having been ported to GP2X (and to a lesser extent) PSP, that DS could in fact run Onscripter but I know very little really about the abilities (or lack thereof) of the DS (for example - would it be possible to run the linux build within DS linux?).  
<br/>
<br/>
I am not asking anyone to port Onscripter to DS (although if someone wants to do so I'll be more than happy to cheer them on :P), I'm just looking to find out if anyone knows if it is possible and if anyone out there is already doing it, equally if anyone knows of any similar engines with a not overly complicated scripting language that work with DS to create visual novels then please let me know so that I may investigate them further as possible ways to create my piece.
<br/>
<br/>
I thank anyone for taking the time to read this post, (sorry if it is a bit long) and doubly thank anyone who takes the time to post a response.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
