The next version is done, it includes display pictures, ink support, some sounds (any idea on where to get wavs?), some bug fixes, and source code (so you can recompile it against the ever changing wifi-lib). I'll be travelling tonight (to the World Cup!), so I'll release it around friday when I'm back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm sorry for this message, it's kinda annoying, I get it too sometimes.

that would be so funny :P

also all the wav's are in msn messager main folder in program files...

<br/>
i suggest you have a config file that lets you choice which sounds to activate...
<br/>
also maybe have it read from shell folder (from moonshell...)
<br/>
and make a beup folder in that to store all the audio files
<br/>
so people can choice which sounds :)...
<br/>
<br/>
i guess it would be also good if you build the some default sounds into the app too...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

I really like your program, but never really got to use it.

Nudges arent flash thingies. They are screen shakes. He suggested you use the rumble pack from Metroid Prime pinball or the WairoWareTwisted to get the shakes done right. I doubt its any use though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, good to see you, kevinc!
<br/>
<br/>
Since everyone else has been posting feature requests, I'll post mine:
<br/>
<br/>
Improved keyboard (make keys light up when pressed, more accurate keypress detection if possible).
<br/>
<br/>
Remove the need to double tap to select your status (Available, away, etc.) if possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Add the ability to save settings to a config file.
<br/>
<br/>
None of these are very major, but they would be nice additions.  Improvements in connection reliability would be nice but I think that's mostly the wifilib's fault.  Thanks for continuing to develop this great program!<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
use the <span style="font-weight: bold">D-pad </span>for the cursor (so you dont have to touch the place when you write something wrong.. its very annoying)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">L and R</span> for Screen swapping
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Select+Start </span>for disconnect
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Y</span> (Nudge function?)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">X</span> for close the window (its allready done)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">B</span> for quick backspace
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">A</span> for quick sending the message
<br/>
<br/>
there are even other important tings too:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">SCROLLING!!!!!!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
you cant read the latest messages :(
<br/>
(so if you miss something.. you cant get it back :D)
<br/>
<br/>
nudge function is not so hard as far as I know, you only need the code that will send the nudge :)
<br/>
<br/>
another important thing:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Changing the nickname</span> by touching on it
<br/>
<br/>
oh and uh.. there is plenty space on the lowerscreen, so the <span style="font-weight: bold">keyboard can be larger/bigger</span> :)

and yes.. the latest thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">SOUNDS!</span> :D
