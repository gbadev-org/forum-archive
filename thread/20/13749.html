    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a program out there that simply acts as a passme when booted?  Reason is I don't want to have to insert and remove my microSD on my Games n' Music every time I want to boot my GBA Movie Player CF.  Especially since the GnM's are known for having poor microSD slots that the springs that hold the card in break if you overuse them.
<br/>
<br/>
If there is such program, I'd really like to have it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Never mind, found a passme.nds in the NeoFlash firmware, and it worked on my Games n' Music.  Go to the NeoFlash site and download the latest package, then look through it to find the passme.nds file (it was named something else, I renamed it to passme.nds).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting... usually slot-1 cards will have at least a button you can hold to let it act as a passme.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
