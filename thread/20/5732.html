A new loader can be found in the GBAX 2005 compo.  Check it out, its the most feature-rich and compatible loader out there!

The next installment of the loader, current version being 20050630.  Go ahead, give it a try.  :)
<br/>
[/EDIT3]</span>
<br/>
<br/>
what the screen shot above is for, its a multi-rom loader.  itll load up multiple NDS ROM files.  the code to do so is pretty much stand-alone code, and i threw a wrapper around it that interfaces w/ the DarkStar API so i had an easy way to launch the various ROM files.  i'll probably start working on an actual GUI front-end for the loader tomorrow.
<br/>
<br/>
with the way this loader is designed, it should be possibly, and actually very easy for demos to be able to jump back to the main menu.  its as simple as a single function call by the ARM7 and ARM9 at the same time, so you would have to use a modified ARM7.bin to support this tho.
<br/>
<br/>
there are still some issues tho right now, as not all of the NDS files im tring to load seem to be working.  from what i can tell, this seems to be an issue *somewhere* (not sure where yet) in my ARM7 code.  i'll continue to investigate this tho.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ok, FAQ time..  (i'll keep appending decent questions to this as they arise)
<br/>
<br/>
Q: How do I use it?
<br/>
A: The build process is simple. Extract the ZIP file to its own folder, dump in extra .NDS files to the folder, and run the build.bat file. Once this is done, it'll build a "DarkStar.ds.gba". Flash this file on your GBA Flash Card, and you are set! 
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Does it use a filesystem, or somehow search for the roms on the cart?
<br/>
A: It uses a filesystem, and is designed so that demos may also use the same filesystem to store data.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Will the loader work with PassMe, FlashMe, WifiMe, Cartless WifiMe, and Emulators?
<br/>
A: Right now, itll only work with anything that loads from a flashcart.  With the way things are statically compiled for their memory locations, this is about the only way to do it.  If it where to be compiled as a NDS file itself and loaded over wifime, when you tried to load a ROM, it would overwrite the loading functions in RAM while loading.  This would corrupt the loading as well as running software.  So for now, carts only.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: How many demos can this loader support on a single cart?
<br/>
A: I dont know.  I'm currently sitting at 54, and the list keeps growing.  Because sprite allocation is static, I would estimate the current limit of being around 120 or so.  This, however, is a flaw of the GUI, not the loader itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: SOURCE CODE!!!
<br/>
A: Maybe later... The loader itself isn't even out yet (well, it is now)... All in due time, my friend... All in due time...
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Is DarkStar the loader?
<br/>
A: At first, yes, it was.. but I seperated out the loader from DarkStar, and now DarkStar is simply a NDS file on its own that interfaces to the loader to tell it to load other NDS files.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: You mentioned in IRC that DarkStar now requires a flash cart.. whats this all about?
<br/>
A: This was for the short period of time (last night only) that DarkStar and the loader where one in the same.  To simplify things, i seperated them out so they are individual peices that arent dependant upon each other anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Can games return back to the menu?
<br/>
A: YES, but this will have to be implemented on a per-game basis. Am I giving out the info to do this just yet? NO... You gotta wait another build or to, as I shift some code around and fix it up first.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Updates in this version of DarkStar, and whats this dspaint.exe?
<br/>
A: ok... the mysterious "dspaint.exe" file... i'm already getting questions about what it is included for... dsPaint inside of DarkStar has gained some new features since the last major release. There have been some UI changes, some tool changes, some fixes here and there, and a couple new features. You can use the R/L buttons for image flipping and mirroring. You can press up/down to increase/decrese the pen size used for the drawing tool, line tool, and box tool. You can draw using an alphablended mode.... but best of all, you can now load/save images. There is no way to manually load/save currently. Loading automatically happens when you open dsPaint. Saving automatically happens when you exit dsPaint. Saves are stored on saveram. You can only store ONE image at a time (dont ask to increase this, it was hard enough to fit 1 in there). Use your flashcard tool to dump the first 64kb block of SRAM to a file, and pass this file to dspaint.exe to get a nice BMP version of your image.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have been working on a ndsbooter for a week, and i had a lot of trouble. i guess that DS prevents bootloaders in some way. my bootloader works when it wants, and does very weird things when reading from memory. i could boot tetris with a routine written in asm, but i modified a line in arm9's main.cpp and is not working anymore. the routine is copied to 0x02002000 and then executes from here. when the copier ends, the palette is modified, but all times DS hangs. before i have changed that line, it worked. then i deleted that line in main.cpp, and not worked anymore. this does not make sense!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

tetris seems to work perfectly.  i sat there and played it for a few minutes last night and didnt notice any problems with it.
<br/>
<br/>
for the other demos that ARENT works, i have a strong feeling i know what is wrong, and since i just got home (was posting from away using laptop before), i can fix the theoretical problems and hope that itll all work today.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
<br/>
Darkain: I do have a (somewhat silly) question - would it be possible to add in a GBA ROM into a launcher that is running on passthrough DS code (Im assuming so, sorta, since the DS itself can launch GBA carts from the DS boot screens) - now the reason I am asking is because I dislike having to erase the cart  (F2AUltra 1Gb)   every time I write to it //ie: want to do something DS on it, so it would just be really nice to throw on a DS FS like darkstar's, with some apps etc in there, and have the regular carts bootloader in it as well, so that the cart can boot into both DS and GBA modes...or perhaps a way to boot the first GBA rom after the FS
<br/>
<br/>
Im sure you will want to work out the bugs you are currently dealing with before considering looking into this (if you havent already) and Ill just continue on dreamin'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

which is exactly what i plan to do.  i'm going to be working on a small flash cart driver thatll sit in IWRAM on the ARM9.  this little driver will support the basic flash cart functions, such as bank switching both the Flash ROM and the SRAM.  
<br/>
<br/>
as for loading GBA games, yes, this was the plan as well...
<br/>
<br/>
as for both of these ideas/featues... not right now tho.  ;)  i'm working on other stuff at the moment... but yes, its been thought about, ive discussed the idea w/ other developers, and ive chosen how i'm going to implement it.  the only thing left now is said implementation (once i get time after the other stuff im doing)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

current state of the loader GUI.  :)
<br/>
<br/>
as i stated before, the loader and the GUI are two seperate entities... there is nothing stopping anyone from writing their own GUI front end to this loader later one (when i release specs on it).  i'm just writing my loader using DarkStar right now, since it already has the class structure in place to do things easily (text output, sprites, input, etc)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

This idea is pretty great. We should have a sort of windowmanager where we can build our aps on. And a standard multi loader, so if we make our apps on this window manager, we get some sort of os and all different apps would look the same. And if we exit our apps, then they will load the multi loader.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
whats contained in the zip file:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">boot.nds</span>: a version of DarkStar which contains a GUI front-end for the nds loader
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">build.bat</span>: a small script to build the flashable .ds.gba file
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">dspaint.exe</span>: a utility to convert dsPaint image into BMP files
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">gbfs.exe</span>: file system build utility
<br/>
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">loader.bin</span>: the magical NDS loader
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
The build process is simple.  Extract the ZIP file to its own folder, dump in extra .NDS files to the folder, and run the build.bat file.  Once this is done, it'll build a "DarkStar.ds.gba".  Flash this file on your GBA Flash Card, and you are set!

ok... the mysterious "dspaint.exe" file... i'm already getting questions about what it is included for...  dsPaint inside of DarkStar has gained some new features since the last major release.  There have been some UI changes, some tool changes, some fixes here and there, and a couple new features.  You can use the R/L buttons for image flipping and mirroring.  You can press up/down to increase/decrese the pen size used for the drawing tool, line tool, and box tool.  You can draw using an alphablended mode.... but best of all, you can now load/save images.  There is no way to manually load/save currently.  Loading automatically happens when you open dsPaint.  Saving automatically happens when you exit dsPaint.  Saves are stored on saveram.  You can only store <span style="font-weight: bold">ONE</span> image at a time (dont ask to increase this, it was hard enough to fit 1 in there).  Use your flashcard tool to dump the first 64kb block of SRAM to a file, and pass this file to dspaint.exe to get a nice BMP version of your image.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i'm sure this question will come up.. "can games return back to the menu?"  and the answere is, "yes", but this will have to be implemented on a per-game basis.  am i giving out the info to do this just yet?  no... gotta wait another build or to, as i shift some code around and fix it up first.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

technically, you will be able to in future DarkStar versions.  instead of having all of the resources compiled into the binary (BG, menu theme, font, sounds, etc), they are going to be files on the filesystem.  this has sorta been planned for a while... and now that there is a tool to convert dsPaint images to BMPs, they could then be used as the background image.  (dont ask when this will be available, as i got a couple other priorities ATM)<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

<br/>
<br/>
not sure how darkains loader loads the ds roms, but Im going to guess if you can get the value it uses to find your app inside the FS you should be able to use that point to start looking for your FS.

If I take the multiboot rom made from a buncha demos (the one before you released the multiboot loader from the E3 demos) and use a hex editor to truncate it (I only have a 64Mb cart... all I thought I needed for homebrew at the time), it works just fine (well, the first few demos do).  But using your tool, all I get is a white screen when I choose a demo.

Is there something I'm doing horribly wrong?  It all looks so easy!  I just copy the NDS files from the demos into the directory, run build.bat, then flash the resulting ds.gba file onto my cart and pop into my DS.  DarkStar loads up just fine, and it sees the demos complete with names, descriptions and pictures, so as far as I can tell it SHOULD work...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

as for non-working demos?  i'll tend to that later.  i know of some very odd bugs in my loader which may be race conditions of the two CPUs... its been taking some time to debug.  i'll keep at it tho.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

its not the fact that they are nds files that prevents them from running, its other reasons.  its the same reason why you cant WMB them, or use the small nds loader.  again tho, im not gonna get into detail here.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

i had the same problem. it doesn't seem to depend on the type or the number of roms though. with a ds cartridge (metroid) inserted i got only white screens, but the loader started and worked flawlessly after i removed it and rebooted the ds.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ya, some nice theories there...
<br/>
<br/>
what the problem REALLY is, which is something i've known this entire time.... there is a timing issue.  since there are two CPUs, its hard to get them to load in sync in such a way that they wont over-write each others code in RAM.  things like having a cart in the other slot WILL effect this, because the firmware makes checks on both cart slots before booting, therefor it will take so many cycles longer on one CPU than the other, throwing things slighting out of sync in my loader.  
<br/>
<br/>
any time a ROM doesnt load from within my loader, well, its the exact same issue.  the issue is always ROM filesize, because one CPU does all the copying (which will soon be changing) while the other is in an infinite loop.  i have had issues at times w/ one CPU loader way too early comparied to the other when doing this.
<br/>
<br/>
the problem was more or less fixed, i just hadnt realized that it effected the main boot.nds (the menu) as well.  but these theories you have presented me has shown me new ways to cause the loader to fail, which i just tested, and worked.  seee, i ALWAYS keep my DS in the same state in terms of what games are in it, as its used strictly for developping on, so i never thought about the other cart slot before.
<br/>
<br/>
but yes, all in all, its a timing issue, and i just have to stall the two CPUs to the same point in time in the boot loader as well now, which is really easy to do.<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

what you need to do is just replace your boot.ds with darkains loader (with his help of course) then you will only need to ever get that one file to load properly...he can deal with all the other fun details ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a programm writen by Josath named "PME2NDS" which is able to do that.
<br/>
It's very easy to use(just drop the ds.gba file on the pme2nds exe and it will create a nds file).

I tried to use the pme2nds.exe tool to remove the header so that it would work on the GBA MP, but then it just loaded the first ROM in the multiboot image.  I guess for the GBA MP, we'd really only need a directory reader and loader.  That way, you could copy .nds files into a directory and then launch them using the loader..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

ok, hurry up and test it.  only bug fixes.  shouldnt need to insert/remove cart, or what ever tricks you where doing.  the default setup in the ZIP file (loader + darkstar) works perfectly, so shove other demos at it, and let me know how well it loads in FlashMe (with and without a DS cart inserted) as well as on PassMe.  
<br/>
<br/>
if for some reason it DOESNT work, please give me the complete list of demos that you are attempting to load and your configuration (passme vs flashme, etc) so i can reproduce errors and FiX0R THEMZ!!!<br/>_________________<br/>-=- Darkain Dragoon -=-

I have a problem with the loader. When I put one of my roms in it (nDoS.nds, which works prefectly well normally) and try to load it, The backgrounds are messed up (some parts show as blank black spots), and the sprites don't seem to show.
<br/>
The rom also hangs when loading some functions (always the same, but no idea why).

Do you have an idea to make it work with the loader ? Could this come from a difference in devkitarm ? (I use version r12)

Yep, having this happen as well.  Very odd...you'd think that if it loaded fine you would be good to go since it's loading fully into RAM AFAIK.  I've noticed snesDS Wifi compatible NDS ROMs don't work either...heh, I figured I had some extra space, and I hadn't played with a recent version of the bin version of snesDS so why not throw a few on there and see how they work?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm, I never saw anything about a release newer than v20050630 so I went back through this thread and found it.  Maybe you should put something on your website so others will be aware of the new (test?) build.

There's a programm writen by Josath named "PME2NDS" which is able to do that.

It's very easy to use(just drop the ds.gba file on the pme2nds exe and it will create a nds file).

It is when you can't afford to buy a decent debugger. It is when you can't afford to buy every single make and model of flash card and debug the loader, especially when (say) XG2 changes its ASIC annually. It is when you're not an asm expert. It is when you don't know what values the loader is looking for when it does a POST (power-on self-test) on the cart circuitry. It is when you live in a jurisdiction without strong statutory protection for reverse engineering.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
