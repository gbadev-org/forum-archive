    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to know how I can extract some files from a .nds, like textures, models or musics.
<br/>
For exemple I want to see the maps and the textures of Mario Kart DS.
<br/>
I've found the way to see the maps from Super Mario Kart and Double Dash, but not for the N64 and the NDS version (I know it's possible for the GBA, but I can't found too).
<br/>
<br/>
Someone knows how to extract?
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dismantelling the rom itself is against the laws of owning the game. You have some rights to the game, such as making your own bck up, but you're not aloud to take the rom apart. Also, you would probably need a debug rom, which has probably not been created. I don't think that you should be discussing this at all sorry man :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't need a debug ROM to have a look at the innards. Those are just the versions used by developers. They do tend to be pretty fun to play with and have more unused content, but they're not really related to examining a ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I've heard of archive extractors for MKDS' format, but not any level or model viewers.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hey it's looking good! I'm waiting this ;)
<br/>
<br/>
So it's illegal to extract files just to see them? I don't want to use them in any game/program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

@kusma: good to know. :^) although, the trend in policies is more like "you don't buy the binary data (software etc.), you just license the right to use it". ... crap.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by silent_code on Mon May 05, 2008 5:16 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

I have no clue, but licenses like this has AFAIK been ruled to be illegal in Norway. (Or rather, the no-disassembly clauses are illegal / invalid - not the entire license of course)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

With commercial off-the-shelf software, the license vs. sale issue is more one of contract law, which in the United States is handled by the several states. State law has run more along the lines of a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test" target="_blank">duck test</a>: if it looks like a sale of a copy and feels like a sale of a copy, it is a sale of a copy.
