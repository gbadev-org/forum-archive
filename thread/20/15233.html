    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I've got the newest version of moonshell, I'm using a games N' music, and I have it set to auto launch (named bootme.nds). Now, I can only run roms off of it if they can't be DLDI patched, so all of my other apps, like colors!, won't run off of the card because of being patched with GnM dldi. Also, when moonshell loads, it says t here is an error and I should reinstall it, which I've done quite a few times, but it fully boots even when this error pops up. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I use both Moonshell and DSOrganize, pretty much together, DSOrganize for the txt editor and Moonshell because of the custom skins, but I was wondering how to get moonshell to work properly on my card. (sorry if this is in the wrong place :()<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As great an app as Moonshell is, it hasn't been updated in quite a while and still has a fair number of bugs. I found it doesn't like the GnM much at all. I would recommend using DSOrganize for text/image file viewing and LMP-NG 1.02 for music. Moonshell is still my choice for video though.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MoonShell is more than a Multimedia Application. You can run every .nds File you have on your card.<br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

Also, does anyone knowa good video converter for Moonshell, one that doesn't entirely scramble the video, making it impossible to watch, like the batchdpg does?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

Use dpgmux combined with ffmpeg, dpgmux includes batch scripts with different settings both in audio and video.

Keep in mind you'll have to grab FFmpeg from SVN since they do not issue formal releases.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What I was wondering was this, is it possible that some apps aren't compatable with some SD cards? because, I use Lameboy, but when I tried to use it on my 1gb card, it says theres a memory error at 120 and 121, which I have no clue what that means. I'm not sure if its just the fact that the card is 1gb, or if somethings wrong with the card, or, even if it's just my GnM card. Anyone else have a problem like that?
