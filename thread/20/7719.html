Says I need too

"1.  Delete nesDS.bin (if it exists)
<br/>
2.  Run nesDS.exe
<br/>
3.  Run build.bat"
<br/>
<br/>
But running build.bat gives this error:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does it work if Moonshell is _BOOT_MP.NDS? Because Mighty Max's loader is my default, and I'm booting into moonshell, and when I run NESDS from Moonshell, I get the same problem as all the other times..
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the lastest firmware for GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, It was reported that demos and snesDS work now on GBAMP.. For some reason, it still won't work any differently for me.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since Flashme installs itself only into the protected area of the firmware, it'd be next to impossible for a future nintendo game, or even an intentional bricker tool, to brick the Nintendo DS...
<br/>
<br/>
I think FlashMe's going to be getting as good as it gets.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it's time now someone actually started working on a custom, new firmware.. That would be cool..to have a suite of wifi tools as the firmware, that could link with say..an NDS program file on any flash card (would have to include drivers for them all) for an extensive configuration mode. Then, for instance, one could include the TCP/IP stack right into the firmware, so one could go online without even needing anything in the GBA slot.

Go to <a href="http://www.darkfader.net" target="_blank">www.darkfader.net</a> and download FWDumper. It'll dump your whole firmware. If there will be anything blocking FlashME and un-flashed DSs, you'll just restore it back, and no changes will be visible :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dumped my firmware to a bin file, how would I go about putting it back?

Also, whats the most recent version of FlashMe? Any chance of a link?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try that and see if it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
