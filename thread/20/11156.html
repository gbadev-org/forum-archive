    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey all.
<br/>
<br/>
AmplituDS is my first real project for the NDS, and it being one of the first homebrew games to feature (IT) music and not only that, but on top of that it's actually also used as gameplay element. 
<br/>
It's based on the gameplay of Amplitude for the PlayStation 2. From the people who also created Guitar Hero.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com/" target="_blank">http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The current release only uses SRAM to save one's highscores and options.
<br/>
Support for FAT and thus allowing people to create (and insert) their own game stages will follow shortly, also including the ability to write the savefile as a file to the inserted FAT card.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that... It should be noted that the game is not the easiest game out there. For beginners, I recommend starting out by choosing Close View as camera mode and using the Turrican version. The SMB remix stage is harder but more fun if you get it right due to the high recognisability factor of the song. :)
<br/>
<br/>
So, have fun!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Slightly updated versions online now. Music/stage synchronisation is now greatly improved and thus should provide a better gameplay experience.

<br/>
If the SuperCard stores GBA saves as .sav files, then yes: AmplituDS will create a .sav file on your SuperCard.
<br/>
<br/>
When a FAT version is released, media-cards which can be written to with the FAT library will have a save stored as a regular file in a specific AmplituDS folder on your media card.
<br/>
<br/>
Already got such versions sort of working, but I can not test the loading in of different stages from the media-card myself... I do not own a media-card, just a regular flashcard.
<br/>
I did win the EZ-Flash forum competition with AmplituDS though... meaning I'll receive an EZ-Flash 4 and will be able to test such things out properly in the nearby future.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Frequency is one of my all time favourite PS2 games, I completed EVERY stage on hard. Wasnt as much of a fan of amplitude because I preferred frequency's soundtrack, but this is AMAZING on the DS!!!! You sir, are a hero.
<br/>
<br/>
I love the menu music too!!!! PLZ make it playable :)

<br/>
Actually, all stages consist out of three files:
<br/>
- An IT (Impulse Tracker) music file. These music files usually have the .it extension.
<br/>
- A textfile which specifies who created it, what instruments are assigned to what lane, and some other details.
<br/>
- A textfile with the colours and places of the targets.
<br/>
<br/>
Once I'll release FAT support, you'll be able to insert game stages you've created yourself into the game with ease. (Basicly by copying the three files into a specific AmplituDS folder on the media card.) 
<br/>
<br/>
Still, if you can find a great IT music file which really appeals to me, I might be willing to spend a day myself to make an AmplituDS stage out of it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And glad you all like it. :)
<br/>
It means a lot to me, since a lot of effort went into this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
edit:
<br/>
The menu music playable... I don't know... Don't think I'll put effort into that myself, but like I said, you'll be able to make it into a stage yourself soon enough.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As in: which way are tracks (targets) and music desynchronised according to you? Is the music played ahead of the targets?

Also, is it only at the beginning, and gradually lessening... or the other way around... or just overall lagging?
<br/>
<br/>
And the SMB version does not have this lag you speak of, right?

edit:
<br/>
Hmm... my debug, with slight dynamic synchronisation* keeps saying the tracks needed to speed up (be placed more towards the user) with the Turrican version. I don't have the feeling it lags (greatly) though. I'd really like more information on this, Tepples.
<br/>
<br/>
* Once a track-part has passed, this synching function is called and only slightly adjusts the tracks if needed (not much, since then the user would perceive the game as being jerky(?)).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Music in Turrican is consistently a quarter note ahead of the targets.
<br/>
<br/>
And it'd be wise to stretch the track by a factor of 2. You currently aren't using the top half of the touch screen for anything.

And about the stretching...
<br/>
I have not taken any classes yet concerning 3D, and figured all this out by just looking at code. I couldn't get camera to work (so I just changed every object around the camera) and changing perspective wasn't a real success...
<br/>
If you could help out in any way with that, I'd appreciate it.
<br/>
I'm unsure as to how helpful it will be though (would it really be easier for the user to see what the layout is of the track-part?)... plus, I might add environment objects and shooting stars, also taking up space.

It should be easier to see the note marks if you use scaled sprites and if you draw lines from one note mark to the next. If I had a decent music playback library for GBA, I'd make something myself.

As far as I know, it should work on all cards which support homebrew NDS creations. I can't tell you how to get it working on your card because I don't have experiences with that card.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples:
<br/>
I guess you're right. It could be done with mode 7. I'd rather stick to 3D for learning experience and that it seems to be more useful for future development.
<br/>
Actually, you're right on the mark with every point you've made so far. Like I said, I'm reluctant to go with mode 7 and sprites though. The lines being drawn from one note to the next is also present in Amplitude (as you might know), and I have thought about it but rejected it due to me not knowing a way to making the line vibrate when a target is hit. I could just leave that part out though, and put in lines anyway. I should be able to manage that.
<br/>
And if someone is willing to give me pointers (or help out with the code) on the 3D side as to enhance the engine, changing perspective, scaling things up, vibrating lines and such, let me know. ;) I'll try to learn on these things on my own, but I can't guarantee things as I failed before to get all that to work properly.

The source code to AmplituDS is available online. If you want to work on it, or just use the music engine, you are able to. I'm using a modified libmikmod to allow the different instruments of IT files to be played at different volumes percentages of the original (of which I'm only using 0% and 100%). I am aware it can't be used for GBA, but as I recall, you have also worked with DS before.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Great game by the way but some bits are extremely impossible to be in 2 places an the same time so it makes the music get a little annoying because you can't quite get it so you can hear the whole song. Maybe once you have completed a row of notes it should keep playing that sound for longer, like the drums and keep the more technical gameplay to the strings.

It's probably the best homebrew game ive played to be honest though, its the one ive played for longest so far. I must go to sleep now and i will be sure to post this on my website in the morning.

For example, in Amplitude (PS2), after you complete 2 consecutive measures, it autoplays the next 11 measures in that track. Perhaps because you only have 3 tracks, knock that down to 5.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Tepples:
<br/>
Lighting up is certainly doable. Good suggestion. :) 
<br/>
And yes, I did try pitching the camera there, but could not get it to work. I thought I understood the principle of cameras but was apparently wrong. And glRotate alone would not cut it.
<br/>
<br/>
Retrohead:
<br/>
Weird that the SMB version didn't work. The only difference which might cause this is the size of the .nds file (the SMB song is larger in size). If you want, I could create a test version with the intro song cut out of the SMB version to see if that makes a difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Retrohead &amp; Tepples:
<br/>
I did that on purpose, so that you can stack up the multiplier to 10x. (Each consecutive track-piece shot down properly increases the multiplier.) And yes, that can be done. I did it a couple of times myself. 
<br/>
Also, it makes sure the player has something to do instead of to just wait.
<br/>
If you both prefer the continuation of music over that though, I'll rethink that through.
<br/>
And tepples, by a measure do you mean a track-part? Like one small piece of a lane? I'm not sure if you're right then... I thought (note the thought part) that when I played it and got all 6 lanes completed (without messing up) I needed to get back to the left lane again which had appeared again.
<br/>
I do know that Amplitude has checkpoints... places where the music keeps playing and your energy recharges (not present in AmplituDS). Were you talking about that?
<br/>
<br/>
edit:
<br/>
Tepples, I made new versions with better start of the tracks, and dynamic synchronisation disabled. It seems to be (near) perfect now with synchronization.

In Amplitude, some parts of songs don't have all the instruments, and I have to wait a few measures, but the multiplier doesn't disappear unless I fail to play a given measure. What you could do is open up the touch screen for something like my AXE demo when the player has a "freestyle" powerup (as in Amplitude) or when the player plays all tracks (as in Frequency).

True, which is why Amplitude erases 11 measures for you: two for each other track and one to get back to the other side. But advanced players play the tracks in order 1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3, so as not to need to zoom back to the other side. Frequency, on the other hand, erases only up to the next checkpoint (which are spaced much closer than in Amplitude, usually one every 8 to 12 measures), so the pattern is typically 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 4, 3, or the like.

The game seems much more playable now you have tweaked the synch a bit so well done with that. It still is annoying me that as soon as i do a perfect run, i go to start on another track and straight away the track i just completed is coming back again.

Amplitude for PS2 does not work by turning volume on and off. It works by actually playing the sound when you press the key. And even if you screw up a measure (symbolized by a darkened track piece in your game), the player can still continue playing notes in the measure, although it won't count for anything.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I know Amplitude has a maximum multiplier of 8. I could alter it, I guess, but I am in no way fixated on recreating the Amplitude gameplay in an exact way.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking on freestyle mode... basicly thinking I could use a looping sample and let the user adjust its playback speed (and thus 'scratching'). I tried out your AXE demo quite some time ago. I'll try it out again and see if that would fit better. Great suggestion.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you basicly request one track-piece of room/nothingness when the player accomplished to let all lanes play (without failing once). So that would come down to... erm... letting the next &lt;amount-of-lanes&gt; track-parts be destroyed as well, and decreasing that by 1 when a track-part passed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

The menu being garbled... I'm assuming you mean the background of the menus. It's a known problem on M3 and it's apparently also present on SC. I'm not doing anything wrong though. It does work on my flashcard and on EZ-Flash 4. If someone knows a solution, I'd be more than happy to make some alterations.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Tepples</span> (second post):
<br/>
Alright. I'll adjust the timing of both once more. It's gotten pretty close. Thankfully it's just adjusting one variable (the length of a track-part in seconds).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I know Amplitude does not work by turning volume on and off. However, me using libmikmod does not (easily) allow such custom tasks... it was not designed for such things. Volume alteration was "easy" enough for me to hack in and I'm quite pleased with the result as it is. I won't be altering libmikmod to do things in a totally different fashion.
<br/>
<br/>
The player being able to continue the music even if the user failed a track-piece... It would have benefits. Also some disadvantages. I do think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. I'll need to think on how I'll handle this, I have some ideas. Again, a good suggestion.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So basicly, my <span style="font-weight: bold">to-do list</span>:
<br/>
- Slightly adjust synching both stages (longer track-parts).
<br/>
- Let completed lanes stay gone for a to be calculated time instead of a now in textfiles specified one (specified for each track-part seperately) and make sure the multiplier does not dissapear when there are no track-parts for the user to shoot down.
<br/>
- Let the player be able to continue the music of a track-part even if he failed that track-part.
<br/>
- Check out AXE again. Think about implementation for freestyle.
<br/>
<br/>
And on (slightly) longer term:
<br/>
- FAT support. So people can create stages themselves. (Start looking for great IT music files, people. ;p)
<br/>
- Adding lines between notes/targets.
<br/>
- Better utilization of the bottom screen, more filled with the lanes.
<br/>
- Better graphics. Contact me if you can help out 3D or 2D wise.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing anything?

What you describe would be a hybrid of Frequency (dedicated freestyle track) and Amplitude (destroying track pieces).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Frequency:</span> When all parts are played, the freestyle track opens up from here to the end of the section. The player must put something in the freestyle track each measure in order to keep the multiplier from disappearing.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Amplitude:</span> When all parts are played, the player can move about the tracks without losing multiplier. A powerup is needed to enter this freestyle mode, and it automatically destroys track pieces until it expires.

<br/>
<br/>
I just had a brain wave about what you said with the user being able to play the track if they fail. Perhaps you could create a different music track that would play in a slightly distorted manner making it sound like you have messed it up, therefore not making the song sound empty at the same time with some indication that you had gone wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen this done in several music games, notably um jammer lammy for the psx so maybe if you have enough room you could do it for this.
<br/>
<br/>
The frequency idea sounds good having a freestyle track once you have the main song playing which could progressively get harder. Of course you would need a break in this though else the player would get worn out. Perhaps the song could then reach a checkpoint or something and go into a break then require you to start the main song tracks again ableit harder now of course :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm unsure as how to implement it different sounding. I'm not even sure it would be desirable. (Isn't the darkened track-part enough of an indication?)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, freestyle is not what you think it is.
<br/>
In Amplitude (and apparently Frequency as well) the space ship would fly to the center of the screen... and the user could then move the ship to the left, right, top, bottom of the screen... wherever. Freely moving the ship.
<br/>
A scratch noise is played in Freestyle mode, and by moving the ship, the scratch noise sounds different. (I suggest you try out AXE. Search the forum. It's quite similiar in concept.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples, I've checked out AXE once more. I see that you've (slightly) improved it visually since first I tried it out. Real nice.
<br/>
There are a few ways possible to implement that in AmplituDS. Will the music continue playing and should the AXE drums not play? Or should it 'completely' switch to AXE? I would prefer the former, I guess. I'm not sure how good the two would match though (AXE tones and AmplituDS music for the stages). 
<br/>
Also... should one be able to move the space ship instantly when a press is done in another position (as with AXE is the case), or should it move to the new pressed point in a certain speed?

I'd need to see your freestyle mode to comment on it. Can you implement it then upload a version for playtest? I know this <span style="font-weight: bold">could</span> mean alot of wasted work though!
<br/>
<br/>
My immediate thoughts is to make the freestyle mode easy to start with but with a sharp difficulty curve that way you would not be in freestyle mode for too long until you have mastered the game. By this i mean you need some kind of way to fail whilst in freestyle mode say if you have not hit a single note in one bar or something, that is if i have grasped the concept correctly?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I found out that memcpy-ing a background and/or its palette into the appropriate background memory is not a good thing to do. I found this out when I tried to alter my palette some time after the initialization process. A lot of tutorials use memcpy for this, but it seems it can mess up. Might be the cause for the corrupted / not-showing backgrounds on M3 and SC and such. I would not be surprised. I fixed that up. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I also now made it possible to choose difficulty level. The user can specify a default difficulty in options, as you're accustomed to do with view and controls already.
<br/>
And the border of the background changes to a different colour when a different difficulty level is selected. Thought it'd be a nice visual thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Editing the new 3 layouts for each of the stages (so 6 in total) will be a pain in the ass and will take me probably two days of full-time working on them.* If someone is willing to help out with this job, let me know. If you have a FAT card, I'll give you a special build of AmplituDS to aid you in this (with the inclusion of the new changes I made). The job would mostly consist out of deleting targets out of already existing layouts, as to make them easier. That way, I'll "only" have to create 2 new layouts (1 for each stage) by adding targets. That would save me a lot of time, allowing me to concentrate on other aspects.
<br/>

Wait, are you creating the location of the gem/beat things by hand? I thought it was automatic, at least that's how Marfitude works...you just give it any random .MOD file, and then pick a difficulty (from 0-3), and it generates the layouts automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
Though, I can see how it would be more difficult to do it automatically instead of by hand, because this means you will need lower-level access to the MOD file, which may not be easy with whichever library you are using.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Takes like half a day to a days work for one single track layout.
<br/>
<br/>
Attempting it in AmplituDS itself would be disastrous, by the way. I'm using a slightly modified version of libmikmod and I'd need to let the entire music play once to know where all the notes lay. Kind of a pain if you have to wait an entire song before you can play the stage with that song.

If someone could prove me wrong and create an automatic layout creation program which actually works like a charm, I'd welcome it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You totally beat me to a release... ahh well, I've been too busy to work on the project as much as I've liked to. So I've been working on a port of Frequency to the DS, aptly called FrequenDS. I've been having various problems and it seems like you may be too, so maybe we could collaborate a bit or something (although you're probably a good bit better than me).
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link to my project:

My project has FAT support and uses WAM files from the Marfitude project, which generates them automatically. I've also used 8 tracks. My biggest problem right now is that the whole thing gets out of sync. I haven't looked at your source yet, but good job on your project so far!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DDR tracking takes similar amounts of time, even with the graphical editor in StepMania.

Or it could play the song once at high speed, make the layout, and cache it to the CF card.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yes, but like I said, I couldn't get a good layout out of it. I tried to use a textfile which mapped notes to targets, but that wasn't such a good idea. (When the same pattern is played two notes lower for example, you'd want the same pattern... which my implementation failed at.)
<br/>
<br/>
I might rethink all that through, and adjust Amplitrack to analyze series of notes instead of immediately mapping each note to a target. Not real high on my priority list, since it's definitely not a fun thing to work on. Maybe the WAM files Chrisluu mentioned could help out in some way.
<br/>

<br/>
Chrisluu:
<br/>
I couldn't test out FrequenDS due to it needing a FAT card, which I don't own unfortunately. From the looks of the video, the visuals are quite nice. I totally liked the target range graphics (the three blue circles). I tried something similiar at first, but in Distance View (camera view in which you also see the entire ship) it would get really ugly and unclear.

I've PMed you my msn address, so we can discuss things further.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

essentially I'm using fat image which takes advantage of FCSR support in fatlib, thus i don't even need the source code, or to recompile.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for this version, josath. I knew about the possibility of using an image, but never got around to fiddling with such things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
