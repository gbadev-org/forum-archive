    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys.
<br/>
<br/>
So far, Nethack has been my most favored homebrew for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I keep running into some junk that appears to be a bug in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems that repeating text after the second or third time displayed gets cut off after the first word such as...
<br/>
"That" instead of "That door is locked" or 
<br/>
"Never" instead of "Never mind" etc.
<br/>
<br/>
This is becoming a constant problem and I'm not sure if it's an in game issue or if I have the incorrect settings.
<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I changed was the tileset based on the instructions found here...
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Does this have anything to do with verbosity?
<br/>
Has anyone else encountered similar problems?
<br/>
So far, the only way to correct this issue is to save the game and reload my character.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it tends to consistently crash on me after my character has died.
<br/>
<br/>
What is the text command needed to have all of the stats and attributes displayed without being prompted at the end of the game?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping that perhaps that might help resolve the game locking up if it were to remove all of the prompting after my character has squibbed.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch to whoever can help me out on this.  :o)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have encountered similar problems. Seems to happen quite often in some games, then not at all in others, seemingly random. Usually when space needs to be pressed to advance the text.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, thanks for the feedback there Quirky.
<br/>
<br/>
I searched around and didn't find any posts that made similar complaints about this so I wasn't sure if it was only occurring on my end.
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't happen right away so I was thinking that perhaps it had something to do with the verbose setting even though I haven't changed any of the settings from what is available for download at his site.
<br/>
<br/>
So there's no special settings to change for this not to happen again or any better method to recompile it with the original source code that's also available at his site?
<br/>
<br/>
It kinda blows when the screen just reads "You" and then cuts off short.
<br/>
<br/>
It's like, okay, I give up, "I what?"  :o)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Doesn't nethack shut off the DS after you die? Or is that just when you quit...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never just quit, I've always saved after I'm finished playing and the DS does shut off on purpose (usually).  Actually, last time it crashed on me after I tried to save.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I've played this enough to determine a definitive reason for some of the bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
However, my hunch is that it is something to do with hitting the "ESC" key after being prompted for further instructions.  Somehow that carries a variable over which becomes problematic for text to display properly further on in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
It also occurs consistently when attempting to map the DS buttons for special functions.
<br/>
<br/>
I've never got to the tombstone screen after my character has died, the text just leaks to the bottom screen and crashes in a strange manner.  Is there anyone that actually has seen this?
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I've been trying to email the author about some of these issues but haven't heard back from him in quite some time.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone here could look at the source code and find the cause of these floating, little bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn't be too difficult if you have a very huge brain.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here's hoping some brainiac that enjoys problem solving will look at the coding and figure out what appears to be a simple bug and find a way to correct this issue.  :o)
<br/>
<br/>
This is such an enjoyable handheld experience.  I'd really hate to see this project incomplete as it is, especially if there is only a trivial, overlooked, simple line of code that is missing.
<br/>
<br/>
