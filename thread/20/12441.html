    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I seem to be having problems playing wifi with tettattds v1.2. The problem is: I try to connect to the main server (ted.getmyip.com) and I get "connecting to accesspoint..."
<br/>
and then "... searching". After that, simply nothing happens. It stays like that until I shut down the DS. Now I have configured my WIFI previously with mariokart and other games, and every one of my retail DS games work online flawlessly. Does anyone have a suggestion to fix this problem? 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
