Works fairly well..and supports all the major protocals anyways...I think it's called BitLBee at least...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
So far it can send/recv IMs, get buddy list, warn, set away message, and check profiles.

Its all text based right now, I have to design a GUI for it.

Its a little unstable, since there are some bugs in the wifi libs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
