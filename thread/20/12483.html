    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">J2ME is probably possible. Cellphones have quite limited resources.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This question has been asked before. If you do a forum search for Java in the DS section you'll probably find the relevant threads.

The short answer: Yes. A couple of OSS J2ME VMs for embedded platforms exist and porting one is possible.

I looked into porting one of them (Can't remember which one now) and it seemed quite do-able, just a fair bit of work :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
