    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since learning about NDS homebrew etc.  I've been reading and trying to do research. 
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is.  There are so many versions of the same programs floating around.  It's hard to find the lastest and/or best version.
<br/>
<br/>
I have the GBAMP with the hacked firmware and a flashed NDS incase the info is important to know
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you guys keep up?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can't really believe DarkFader would do something so despicable, but apparently the log found here: <a href="http://www.tehskeen.net/files/dsdev.20051007.log" target="_blank">http://www.tehskeen.net/files/dsdev.20051007.log</a> explains it all.

It's too hard to believe someone who's done so much for the community would do something so sick, and actually laugh about it in the end. Not that I'm saying pirating is good, but destroying 200 dollars worth of hardware just to get a cheap laugh?

Yep. Only the first block is write-protected by the SL1 contact.
<br/>
The rest of the firmware isn't protected.
<br/>
If you used flashme some recovery code is placed here allowing you to restore your firmware if it becomes damaged or deleted. Handy, eh?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#56443 - Ilomoga - Sat Oct 08, 2005 8:10 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So if I understood everything correctly the situation is the following:
<br/>
This r0mloader or how it's called flashes the parts of the firmware which are NOT protected by the SL1 contact.
<br/>
If you have the original firmware on your DS this will make a brick.
<br/>
If you have Flashme installed you're safe, because you can flash Flashme again because restoreFW is in the protected area, isn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
So for homebrewer it's safer to have flashme installed than not?<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
