    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, 
<br/>
<br/>
0xtob found something interesting in the german Nintendo faqs (i couldn't find this in the US faqs):
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Warum muss der Nintendo DS beim Wechsel zwischen den Anwendungen ausgeschaltet werden?
<br/>
Die verschiedenen Anwendungen des Nintendo DS (z. B. PictoChat) arbeiten mit unterschiedlichen Taktfrequenzen. Daher ist es nicht m?glich, direkt von Anwendung zu Anwendung zu wechseln, sondern es ist notwendig, dass der Nintendo DS zuvor in Grundstellung gebracht, also ausgeschaltet wird.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
in english:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Why has the DS to be switched off when switching the application?
<br/>
The different  applications of the Nintendo DS (e.g. PictoChat) are operating on a different clock speed. Thats why it's not possible to switch directly from one application to another, (...)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
So, is the faq incorrect or can the DS get clocked down? Why would Nintendo use this feature in the firmware? Batterylife in PictoChat, but in the settingsmenu?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can imagine its because it changes some values in the firmware itself ( your birthday, the time and so on ), but I'm not sure. Might be too much juice for the task.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It sounds too much like an excuse for this behaviour. If it was for this reason, you'd just need to change the frequency another time.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That is interesting, but sounds fishy. I always thought it was because loading these apps would overwrite the secure area, making it impossible to boot the DS card afterward until you shut down. (They could even do this intentionally.) Or they were just lazy (or running out of space for code) and didn't want to have to account for user settings being changed and load the menu from the firmware chip again.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It could be that the Nintendo DS firmware developers knew about the PictoChat freeze on GBA Game Pak removal (as seen in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/" target="_blank">TakeMeOut</a>) and were afraid of someone with DirecTV cracking experience making a GBA card that could glitch the DS to load from the GBA slot by manipulating the Game Pak interrupt line in a certain way.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Anyway it was like that since V1, so I think they'd have just tried to fix the freeze instead.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It might be to reduce clockspeed as a power-saveing feature.

(eg, the Alarm clock mode wont need the same as a game of Metroid will it?)

After all, this is Nintendo we are talking about..they seem to always push power-efficiancy in things.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Tepples has anyone ever told you that you sound EXTREMLY INTELIGENT
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am always impressed ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic
<br/>
<br/>
So does that mean you could change  the firmware to allow pictochat button to access the gba slot for NDS access. so then you could still load GBA from slot two too. :) ( to many two to too's )

<br/>
Anyways, this seems unlikely to me because the DS would still have to change clock speeds at some point while it is turned on, and it would most likely be clocking up.<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Clocking down isn't normally seen as useful.
<br/>

The more I think about it though, the more it should be a feature even if it isnt :p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Underclocking is a very useful feature, I'll have you know. 
<br/>
<br/>
I use a laptop with a very shitty battery life (around 2 hours without wifi), so Underclocking is the only way i get get around an extra hour. 
<br/>
<br/>
In the DS's case, its the same thing. Underclocking [and switching to lower light on DSLite] can help you squeeze a few extra hours on the DS's battery life.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">spacepirate</span> since when is stating the obvious "Brown-Nosing"
<br/>
<br/>
He is obviously a very smart person and I was just giving praise to that. In the real world it is called a "COMPLIMENT" but I guess you have never been given one, so yeah I was "Brown-Nosing"
<br/>
<br/>
Similar to the PSP, it was under-clocked to 222Mhz (or somewhere around that) instead of using its full speed ( 333Mhz or somewhere around that). (for power conservation)
<br/>
sorry too lazy to look it up, and when I had one I knew but now do not remember. 
<br/>
<br/>
So underclocking is very useful at times   ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
