    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First off, this is not a Warez related topic. I have with me, at this very moment, a Japanese copy of Opera DS Lite imported with the help of Lik-Sang. Keep that in mind with regards to what follows...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Out of pure curiosity I downloaded the Opera DS rom and stuff it on my SC: mSD. The rom itself ran through the SC converted app fine, coming out a valid size.
<br/>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly enough, the rom didn't actually work.
<br/>
<br/>
What was interesting, a a little surprising though, was the fashion in which it didn't work. Specifically, after loading the rom I recieved...
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing...
<br/>
<br/>
Nada...
<br/>
<br/>
Two white screens...
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that's right, not even a message in japanese to the effect of "You need the memory expansion plugged in for this to work"...
<br/>
<br/>
So right now I'm wondering how much of the Opera DS functionality actually resides on the DS cart and how much resides on the GBA cart.
<br/>
<br/>
There was some mention, somewhere, of Opera DS being upgradeable. A wild rumour? Who knows...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, does anyone have any thoughts. I've got two ideas...
<br/>
<br/>
1: Opera DS resides mostly on the GBA cart
<br/>
2: Opera DS tried to access it's memory via the SC and had a hernia...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm more inclined to think 2 is the case, but if anyone else has any ideas...
<br/>
<br/>
I'll update later with some news on what happens when I test out the actual Opera DS carts (I only picked them up an hour ago from the PO, you se :-) )<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You probably didn't load it right. Lots of people got Opera loading saying the memory expansion is missing
<br/>
To check it, just insert your Opera DS card without inserting the expansion. You'll see the message.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You converted it wrong. You can't have trim or restart on. Also, it boots and asks for the RAM cart just like the real one.
<br/>
<br/>
(You could have easily solved this by booting your DS with just the DS cart and see if you get white screens.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the conversion tool for the SuperCard probably borked the rom.

<br/>
Testing out the actual DS cart with the SC popped up a nice little japanese message and then powered the DS off.

<br/>
Blah, well, so much for that...

What of the rumours of updates to Opera DS though? Vapour?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
