    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there currently a released program, that scans the wireless network for DS Download Plays, and lists them, on the Computer? Would there probably be a way to write one, maybe some examples? Thanks in advance..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as Iknow there is no Client software like what you want. There is a server that acompanies WiFiMe but no client like what your talkin about. However, the tcp/ip stack is allready available for use and, you could use the drivers from WiFiMe. Im not a very good coder so I cant help you with that but, there is potential there.
<br/>
What would you do with it?
<br/>
From what I have heard there is already a way to capture packets from the DS download centers. Im not sure how they are doing it but, it is possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, first off I will admit that  know almost 0 about capturing NDS packets. However, from what I have seen you use a pc/laptop to capture the packets then somehow transform that into useable data. That should be sendable to a DS. 
<br/>
My question then is what would you need a second DS for? I tried looking for Wiki info but all they had was the source code for capturing packet6s and very little info. Do you have a link so I can understand the process a bit better. I am more than willing to RTFM when I can find it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suppose I didn't explain well what I need to do.
<br/>
<br/>
I need this whole thing, at a show I'm putting together. I need to have a tv-screen displaying all the games available via DS Download Play - therefore I need to make some sort of application on the PC, that sniff the data - just the initial data with name, players, icon and those things. However, I have no idea on how to do so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you want to display ALL DS Download Play games, even if for example someone offers a single card game (that this one is shown as long as he offers it?)
<br/>
<br/>
If you only want to display the demos you are sending via WMB you could use the images on the site where you can download the demos.<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Example:
<br/>
DS1 sends single-card Mario Kart DS
<br/>
DS2 sends single-card Nanostray
<br/>
<br/>
PC catches name of the DS'es and names of the games and lists them.

Hope I make myself somehow clear :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's possible but only on Linux :)

BTW, and yes, this application works, although there's a problem in the driver  (read the webpage).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
In my case, I need a second DS to transfer the info ;)
<br/>
<br/>
When you try to send a demo (be it Lost Magic or Touch Golf, for example), you only send a beacon, thats what I can capture. 
<br/>
<br/>
It doesnt send the WHOLE demo unless another DS picks up the beacon and sends a flag to send the whole demo that way. 
<br/>
<br/>
After the DS sends the whole demo to a second DS, thats when all the packets captured are stored and then turned into usuable data with the help of firefly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
