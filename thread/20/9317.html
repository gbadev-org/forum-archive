    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While im waiting for my passme to come, I've been reading about this bricker trojen. Im only planning to use a few emulators and perhaps learning to code for the DS,  but I dont like the idea that someones code can make my DS unusable.
<br/>
<br/>
If I run things through an emulator, would I discover if the program was trying to do something bad to my (emulated) DS? I heard the bricker sets a picture of a wall on the screen, would this show on an emulator?
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a good way to detect brickers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here is a quote from the readme:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">crashme scanner is only as reliable as the sig DF provided. It picks up crashme code on some homebrew.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
That might help, although I would not trust it 100%.  As far as emulators, if I remember correctly the bricker alters your firmware then displays the brick wall.  I am guessing most emulators will crash upon a program tyring to access firmware so you would not see the brick wall and know for sure.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, but emulators that freeze on seeing a write to firmware will also freeze on seeing a write to 3D registers. And even on hardware, if you have installed FlashMe, you can always reinstall FlashMe using the A+B+Select+Start+power on failsafe method and a traditional GBA flash cart or SuperCard.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True, but a bricker can use obfuscated code to keep a static scanner from picking out those addresses, so a scanner would have to actually run the code in a sandboxed environment functionally identical to a DS. This will not become possible until cycle-accurate DS emulators appear, because a bricker trojan could detect bugs in known emulators and run benign code, but then brick the DS when running on hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
