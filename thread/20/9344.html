    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I figured you could go into the file and replace two characters (ex. Shy-Guy and Mario), but when I tried that, I couldn't find Shy-Guy. It was possible to me to trade, like, Dry Bones and Toad, but the Shy-Guy file was missing. Later I found the Shy-Guy logo, but I can't still find the guy himself - anyone know where its hidden?

No, it's just not counted as a character and is in the wmb binary. extracting the nintendo archives and replacing it with another character will make it work. So it is possible, although there are no good Nintendo Archive extracters out there.<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise.

That would mean that if you play with one card one of the DS' which downloads from your game would send the data of Shy Guy to the server DS. But does that make sense?<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm guessing that there are two binaries: one used for single-player and multiplayer play, and one used for WMB on both the client and the server. The Shyguy data is in the WMB binary. To settle this, we could decompress the WMB binary (probably a .srl file) and search for model/texture data.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Oh, and in the DEMO version, if you go play multiplayer (without any downloadplay at all!) you're automatically a random shy-guy! So it ought to be in the demo version :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry for going off-topic on this. I've only started poking around files since last night. I did a whole bunch of work that turns out was not needed. I guess I'd just like to ask this before I continue with my project out of boredom. Is there a dumper that decompress these (LZ77 compressed) files from Mario Kart DS on-the-fly? The Dumpers I've tried do not and that is where my personal project ended up. Also, what has been achieved with this game (mod wise)? Sorry for derailing the topic and asking noobish questions. (First day messing with a handheld, especially from Nintendo and just making sure I'm not wasting even more time.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
