I was in awe when I read about this.
<br/>
<br/>
From a Google search it appears you can buy it in UK (amazon), don't know about anywhere else.

Luminator, a German knockoff of the PSP gem from bhv Software, is coming out to the Nintendo DS. Xider, the UK branch of bhv Software, is planning on releasing Luminator DS in the third quarter of 2007 for Europe. The DS release has fifteen different skins background designs with 15 “CD quality” songs. Compared to the dozens of skins in Lumines fifteen skins seem meager. However, Germany has their own spin on dark trance so the beats have to be different from the pop-centric soundtrack of Lumines II.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"CD quality" would probably be 128 kbps or less, given the limitation of the DS DAC. A 1024 Mbit Game Card, with 3/4 of the ROM devoted to music, would allow over 100 minutes.

If I had time, I'd port <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">luminesweeper</a> so that SLOT-1 weenies could get their square on.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
