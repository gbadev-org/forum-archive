I bought my DS lite from <span style="font-style: italic">Currys</span> on the 1st of December 2006 and I do have the receipt. Does anyone know what kind of support DSs get?
<br/>
<br/>
Am I able to send it for repairs from Currys, or should I contact Nintendo, do either of them refuse to repair after a certain amount of time after purchase?
<br/>
<br/>
oh and I don't have the little slot-2 that came with it... Would they notice/care? Should I burrow a friends?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know Nintendo's warranty is a year after purchase, but they will still repair it afterwards (thought you will likely have to pay for the repair).  They don't care if you include the dust cover thing or not, and they told me that irregardless of what firmware is in it, unless you opened up the system the warranty is still standing.
<br/>
<br/>
This saved me once as I screwed my first DS Lite up totally trying to flash it.  I really should have tried to insulate the screwdriver first.  &gt;_&gt;  It very obviously didn't have the stock firmware, being the non-stealth version of Flashme (battery cover wouldn't come off, the screw was stuck so I couldn't re-flash it), but they still took it in.
<br/>
<br/>
This Curry's...I have no idea, it's probably up to whatever their return policy is.  If you can't return it there you are probably best off calling Nintendo...more than likely they will send you a new DS Lite and the stuff to send your broken one back to them.<br/>_________________<br/>----

<br/>
I don't like the fact that I'll have no DS lite for maybe a whole week :( I use it everyday. I don't like the fact that you have to phone in either, I'd much prefer a web chat or email - but oh well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you don't have to call...
<br/>
i did it online, then called to be sure and towards the end of the conversation she said they had the web one and that it was good i confirmed.
<br/>
today i just got my shipping label and im sending it in after discovering really nasty cracks
<br/>
oh and as far as the button problem they told me you can use a tooth brush and warm water to clean the dust out of it...
<br/>
my ds lite had that problem too &gt;.&lt;;
<br/>
<br/>
-edit- forgot to mention i got the shipping label in almost 1 day, even though they said 10 days lol<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

ok first off, maybe your the way you talked to them made them mad or something because i had no trouble i got my shipping label and sent it off already. they did not require any proof i even own it lol...
<br/>
they how ever do not give you a box to put it in...
<br/>
<br/>
hyperhacker: btw, i lied to them about the date i bought mine (i said may when it was march lol...) they cover for a year, then when you send it in they extend it another year :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

I don't think you got the point, the way the US and UK service centers work are quite different. The link you gave is only US, the UK doesn't have such a form.

He didn't sound mad at all. Nor do I recall even mentioning trouble.

Lastly, what's a shipping label? That a US thing?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
