    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you look at the bottom screen during playback, you'll see a progress meter at the bottom.  Simply touch anywhere in that progress meter to jump to that position.  I don't think you can see the exact position in mm:ss of where you are though.
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean by a bookmark?  Like a playlist type of thing, with a list of songs you wish to listen to later?  Or do you want something that will save your progress within a single file so you can jump ahead to where you left off?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was using Moonshell (I am new to this) and I realised the 'change' option. I selected it and chose the Normal Shut Down option (I think that that was what it was called). After my song finished playing, my DS Shut down as expected. Now whenever I enter Moonshell, my DS Shuts down.

Help would be appreciated. :S</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
