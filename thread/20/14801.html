 Then of course if you like Mario 3 then you got to play McDonald land. Yes I know it is ironic, a corporation bent on shortening lives produces a game using its icons as the heros. Irony of ironies, but freaking awsome game! One of the best platformers for the NES ever! With a little gfx hack, someone could make that into a wonder un-official Super Mario 4! :)
<br/>
<br/>
 Speaking of Marioish games, both Looney Tune Adventures are great, not to mention Duck Tales, and Chip and Dales Rescue Rangers, both of which have a sequal as well!
<br/>
<br/>
 For the Atari 8-bit you we've got Crownland. So assuming the emulation becomes full speed sometime soon, then you'll have  acess to a woderful work of platforming art!
<br/>
<br/>
 There is Giana Sister for the C64 which also comes in a a Super Mario flavoured GFX hack.
<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sure there are more that can be enjoyed on the DS, but those are the only ones that come to mind atm.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try this instead:

It's an emulated version of Giana Sisters that has been optimized for play on the DS as far as screen and controls.  Plays very well, though to be honest Great Giana Sisters absolutely pales in comparison to Super Mario Bros despite being an unabashed clone.
<br/>
<br/>
I put together a nesDS pack with 101 hacks of SMB1 appended (including the original and the Japanese sequel and such things as well as fan hacks).  It's probably the most played NDS file on my flash card.  I can't even imagin how many hours I've logged on SMB over the past 20-odd years and it's still just as much fun as it ever was.
