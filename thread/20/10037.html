<br/>
Parasyte has now revealed that he has hacked Metroid Prime: Hunters.
<br/>
<br/>
No need to worry, Parasyte is a pretty upstanding guy--he never revelaed how to cheat in Mario Kart DS and he bashes online cheater-wannabes at GSCentral.org.
<br/>
<br/>
Pretty interesting news, nonetheless.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

It reminds me of back in the day, when I would play an RGP and use a table as a shield and a tree for a weapon..  ooh... look at me.. I'm a uber leet hacker that can use a hex editor.

Or, was there really some true hacking involved to do this?

<br/>
<br/>
Some idiot which I aint naming release some tool which I aint naming to hack MPH online. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now not only can Parasyte do it (his intentions seemed clean), but any idiot with a flashcard (or something, I really dont want that tool or try it or anything, I dont know what it involves). 
<br/>
<br/>
They just ruined the only game online that I used to play. Lets all flood Nintendo with this until they ban those worthless cheaters. 
<br/>
<br/>
Chances are Nintendo will be a LOT more careful with flashcards and people running homebrew now, posibly even tighten the Wii to prevent this sort of stuff from happening.

<br/>
Thats exactly the point
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldnt have minded if they somehow locked the tools so that they cant be used online, or if people actually GAINED something out of cheating on MPH, such as new levels or weapons (like you mentioned in Mario Kart, people actually get to play on the "locked" levels).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
However, there is something you can do: Disconnect.
<br/>
<br/>
It won't be hard to see who is cheating, just disconnect and find other people to play with. The cheater will join a few other games and if enough people just disconnect he'll get bored and do something else.
<br/>
<br/>
Since there is no method of in-game communication, I doubt many people will cheat just to piss everyone off like in other games.
<br/>
Another solution is friendcodes, play only with people you know - sure this is bad, but it's not the end of the world.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Honestly, they can have all the points in the world for all I care.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry to revive this, but I had a question about this. Does anyone know if this method might be used to alter the game controls to make them less convoluted? I could care less about cheating in the game, but I can't stand fighting with the awkward controls in what I feel would have been an excellent game if they had only added the ability to customize them. And I know I probably can't do it with my commercial game, so I'll probably have to hack a ROM of it. But do you guys suppose it's possible, or would it be easier if I just grew another hand?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
