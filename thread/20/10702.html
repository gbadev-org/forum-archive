Just it seems like emulated  black and white MacOS is just more pratical for actual useage dispite its age. Which imo, is just crazy :p

If the fact a new version of linux is such a problem, wouldnt an older version be more benifial? do we need all the new stuff?

If the goal is to get OS functionality, or easy-porting on the DS, then dos the new linux offer much real benifit over earlier versions?

My thoughts exactly.
<br/>
<br/>
Not to sound noobish in the realm of hardware and software programming...but with all the talk of linux memory requirements....would it be possible to write a quick piece of coding that would allow linux to utilize the memory of a cf card on lets say...a gbamp or on a flashcart as ram? I know it would drastically shorten he lifespan of such devices...but for those willing it would be an effective shortcut through hardware limitations. And if this is way off the mark and impossible...I apologize ;).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DS Linux just recently got user space XIP making most of the new stuff possible.  The DS doesn't have an MMU.  And even if you could make a swap partition on a GBA MP, you can pretty much consider your CF card to be garbage in a hurry, as it doesn't take long to make 10,000+ writes to swap.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you are trying to run a bunch of applications and have already maxed out the 4MB RAM in the DS, than it will be swapping A LOT.  You could probably damage your CF card within hours.  If you wanted to test the theory, and just kept opening apps, you could probably destroy your CF card within minutes.

Unix systems don't really work that way.

Newer user applications tend to take more resources than older versions, but the Linux kernel itself and the GNU system run as well on a 486 as they do on a P4.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The DS is a tad better then a typical 486.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also bear in mind that most of the embedded Linux ports also run on systems with more memory. The majority of the palmtop computers targeted with Linux ports have at least 16 megabytes of ram, even going back quite a few years. Many of the embedded application and library ports are now written assuming 32 megabytes of working ram is available.

<br/>
Compared to a lot of established hardware for the purposes of acting as a general purpose computer, the DS is quite gimped.

Not that the DS can't still do what we want it to, it just requires a different approach. I remain of the opinion that Linux is not a sensible approach. I would rather see a good launcher and a lot of well designed dedicated apps.

GBAMP users will still be given a build, but it will be limited, much as it is now.
<br/>
The fix for the '8-bit write problem' will only affect those with SuperCards and M3 (as these devices have the extra RAM). The SuperCard CF is the choice device for use with DSLinux (at the moment). No NoPass devices are supported, except by the .nds build, but even that is broken on some devices.
<br/>
<br/>
The SuperCard and M3 emulate a 256Mbit flash cart using SDRAM chips. These are volatile memory (data is lost on power off) but are practically infinitely re-writable. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is why there is that little counter when loading stuff on the SuperCard (I don't own an M3 and so don't know much about it). This is showing the content being copied from CF into the SDRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
As I said before I feel the NoPass-RW devices aren't really suited for homebrew, only piracy. They don't contain extra RAM, as DS cards are block devices, much like CF cards and Hard disks. This allows them to be easily written too using file management utilities like Windows Explorer. Therefore they have no need to emulate a NOR flash card, which is what the SuperCard and M3 does.

You can't 'sacrifce' a commercial game unit for RAM, because the game is stored on a Mask ROM chip, which is write once.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Oh?
<br/>
So homebrew developers will be forcing people to purchase new and expensive hardware to run their stuff, rather than trying to appeal to the largest audience (4Mbyte of RAM and libfat device)?
<br/>
<br/>
Most developers can't afford to buy lots of random hardware, and currently NoPass-RW are expensive (like $125?) for a device that isn't expandable.
<br/>
You can pick up a SuperCard, NoPass and CF Card (1Gbyte) for less than that. And in the future you can get a bigger card, or use several cards (one for music, one for homebrew). 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still waiting for the flood of "OMG MOONSHELL DOESN'T WORK ON MY NOPASS THING, YET ROMZ DO!!!?!!111111!!!11 HELP TEH NOOB" posts.
<br/>
<br/>
Also according to some reviews I've read (about the UltraFlashPass mainly) they are very slow to write to, the full 64Mbyte card taking nearly an hour to burn. They also have very low homebrew compatibility.
<br/>
<br/>
The one device that could change that is the DS-X card. It has 512Mbyte internal memory, supports USB 2.0 (doesn't give an exact speed) and is apparently "Mass Storage Compliant" meaning it should support Windows, Linux and Mac.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree with the notion that homebrew developers should stick with what is here.
<br/>
<br/>
Using everything out of slot-1 would make things horribly complicated for past hardware, drive people crazy, and make some older homebrew apps stop working.
<br/>
Besides, these devices going from slot 1 are not only much more expensive than the current solution, but that isn't even taking into account the storage medium.
<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, DS homebrew (especially DSLinux) has been shaped in such a way that it is important for apps to be able to write to a removable storage medium other than SRAM, and FAT file system stuff has been so well developed that I doubt anyone wants to see it go.
<br/>
These devices going into slot-1, however, would undoubtedly need to use MiniSD or maybe Transflash for such removable storage, whereas I (and many others) generally use SD or CF.
<br/>
<br/>
For freeing up RAM, people just have to accept the fact that Nintendo, as usual, has given their console pitiful amounts of RAM (It's not hard; the stuff is cheap!), and accept it as a personal challenge to go where noone has gone before.
<br/>
<br/>
NoPass RW devices, while potentially quite nice, seem to me like they would cause a lot of unnecessary bother.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Indeed. Look at the hassle caused by the UltraFlashPass.

<a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10783" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10783</a>
<br/>
This would mean EVEN MORE builds of homebrew.
<br/>
We already have .nds, .ds.gba and .sc.nds, will we need a .UFP.nds too?
<br/>
<br/>
I say the homebrew community should boycott the piracy biased devices like the UltraFlashPass.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

<br/>
<br/>
The largest DS slot save area is 2mbit, or 256Kbyte.
<br/>
The largest SRAM save is 64Kbyte IIRC.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE
