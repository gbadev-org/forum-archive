DOSBox? Y'know... considering that's SDL, the only real problem would be screen size and emulation speed >:3</div>

Don't bother asking me for the sourcecode, I don't have it.</div>

    <div class="postbody">Very interesting.  I can't get it to run too many files -- Operation Neptune didn't work :( -- but I did get a test batch file working in addition to Visicalc and this EZEDIT text editor program.  I'm assuming the control keys are hard-coded, which doesn't make too much of a difference since it's rather slow in the first place.  The arrow keys and Enter button are enough.<br/>
<br/>
Excellent proof-of-concept though.  I knew GPF was working on it at some point in time, but I didn't realize a semi-stable working binary was available.</div>

If a PII @ 400MHz can only hack a 386, then what is the dozy little CPU in the DS gonna be able to do? Plus I'd imagine that there's some fancy x86->x86 JIT code going on in there, and an ARM version would have to use a generic C interpretter or something.<br/>
<br/>
Ah reminds me of playing Wolfenstein 3D on my Amiga through a PC emulator. Now that was *slow*!</div>

    <div class="postbody">Yeah its pretty slow, thats why I stopped working on it, even on my dreamcast port which is a lot more powerful then the ds I gave up, just not worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants the source its, gpl so I will send to anyone who requests it, so far only have had 1 request.<br/>
