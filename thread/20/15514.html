=====   Mod's, please lock this thread =======
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the problem is this:
<br/>
<br/>
On boot, DSLinux looks to see if a /etc/passwd file exists and if it doesn't, it generates one.  The reason why the GnM fails is because for some reason with later versions of DSLinux it only works read only.  This means that the /etc/passwd file doesn't get generated which a lot of Linux programs rely on, which causes all the errors.
<br/>
<br/>
What people have been doing with the GnM is supplying their own /etc/passwd file to skip the part where it tries to generate one.  This can hardly be called a fix as the entire root filesystem will be readonly and various Linux applications (like gpm for example) need to be able to write PID files and the like.
<br/>
<br/>
As I've said over on the DSLinux forums, I am no longer interested in making DSLinux work on Slot-1 devices as they cannot provide extra RAM which DSLinux so sorely needs.
<br/>
<br/>
See <a class="postlink" href="http://dslinux.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/RunningDSLinux#Notes_on_Extra_RAM" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of known working Slot-2 RAM packs.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#156768 - Lynx - Tue May 13, 2008 9:12 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Could someone PLEASE explain the problem to me?!?!  DLDI reads/write FINE with the Datel Games N Music card!!!
<br/>
<br/>
I just tried it.. Grabbed a new 2GB MicroSD card.. Formated it.. copied JUST dslinux.nds and the linux folder onto the card. DLDI patched it with <span style="font-weight: bold">VERSION 1</span> of the DLDI for the Games N Music.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Renamed it to bootme.nds</span>. Insert it into my Games N Music, popped that into my DS-L and turned it on.  It boot up fine and gave me the # prompt.
<br/>
<br/>
Again, I cd /media and created a directory fine.  went into that directory and did 'vi test.txt' and was able to create/type/write the file fine.
<br/>
<br/>
What seems to be the problem with the GnM already!?!?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
