    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im having some trouble with getting beup to work (copying the .gba and .ds from the zip directly to the sd card). Basically every homebrew program i used worked without any problems whatsoever but for some reason beup doesnt seem to want to do anything. I've tried every version (no fat, rein etc) but they all do exactly the same. Beup boots and I see the connection screen. I press use firmware (selecting custom is useless since it still says it will use the firmware) but all I see is connection, nothing happens after that. The wifiled on the DS also flashes alot slower than when you play a game.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes all games go online without a problemen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are using the nintendo usb wi-fi connector then you will need to use unofficial drivers to change it into a softAP since homebrew isn't compatible with the nintendo drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
Just because official games work doesn't mean homebrew will.  For some people DHCP fails with homebrew, so you need to enter a static IP.
<br/>
<br/>
If you entered your WEP key as ASCII then you need to change it to Hex.  Also try without WEP just to see if you can get it working.  Make sure broadcast SSID is enabled or hide SSID is disabled.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
