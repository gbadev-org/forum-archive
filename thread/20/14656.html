    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i never could get the demo files to work I finally found a copy of the full files my friend had and got those to work I even merged them with chex quest to make that work on ds you have to make sure to do the DLDI patch then depending on what device your running on if you can't get the application to start "SuperCard Magic Homebrew Patcher" to add a header to it thats what i have to do sometimes else it won't boot homebrew. You need to place the .wad files in thier correct folders using the folder structure designated by ds doom where did you download your copy of ds doom from it could be old.
