    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Me and my pals started to write a Gravity Force style clone for the DS on our free time. There's lots of work to do,
<br/>
 and currently you can't do much, just shoot the other planes, take damage and collide with the background, but we hope
<br/>
that one day in the near future this will become one cool game. :)

Anyway, I'll post more news here later, but mean while check out the game at

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This release brings lots of menu goodies plus bug fixes. Expect a new release with more
<br/>
ingame features and friendlier network play this weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what's new in v0.0.5:
<br/>
<br/>
* New menu logic.
<br/>
* Reworked the network configuration menu screen.
<br/>
* Added key configuration menu screen.
<br/>
* The client's IP is shown correctly.
<br/>
* Removed alpha blending from the fading background layers, because it made layer jumping a bit confuzing.
<br/>
* The settings are now saved in SRAM when changing the menu page.
<br/>
* Some UDP packets can go and vanish, and this made some bullets to never die thus shrinking the bullet buffers until free space ran out.
<br/>
* Fast acceleration is now even faster.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ttursas on Sat Oct 07, 2006 9:34 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's what's new in v0.0.6:
<br/>
<br/>
  * Added version number into the save data. Only the latest save format will be supported in the coming releases.
<br/>
  * The client's IP will be reloaded from dswifilib after making a connection to an AP.
<br/>
  * Key input reading on the ARM7 side is done from the very first frame.
<br/>
  * Started to work on the game configuration menu screen (added gas and gravity).
<br/>
  * Keeping the layer change button pressed doesn't make your plane to change the layers more than once.
<br/>
  * When changing layers the front layer grows bigger before becoming the back layer.
<br/>
  * Added gas (meter and functionality).
<br/>
  * Changing layers eats gasoline.
<br/>
  * Now the player doesn't collide with the layer graphics while changing the layers.
<br/>
  * Made the camera independent (so the screen isn't centered on the player all the time anymore).
<br/>
  * Touching layer graphics will kill the player.
<br/>
  * Added respawning.
<br/>
<br/>
... and tomorrow I'll release 0.0.7 with changes on the server side. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
  * Turbo acceleration eats twice as much gas as before.

<br/>
  * Made the multiplayer game logic a bit clearer.
<br/>
  * Added lives.

* Gas bar is drawn only if gas is enabled in the game configuration menu screen.
<br/>
* Changed the way gravity works.
<br/>
* Added a new menu page: PLAY, and compressed the tabs.
<br/>
* Moved network play to PLAY menu page.
<br/>
* Added animated menu hotspots (to show the user what he can really click).
<br/>
* The menu screen scrolls up at the startup.

* It's possible to shoot holes into the background layers with missiles.
<br/>
* Fixed two nasty bugs in the collision detection code.
<br/>
* The settings are now saved when changing a menu page, but only if the user has
<br/>
   changed some of the values that go into the save file (to limit the SRAM access).
<br/>
* Added new explosion and smoke graphics.
<br/>
* When a bullet hits anything, a small explosion is created.
<br/>
* When a plane crashes, lot's of explosions are created, and the plane isn't drawn.
<br/>
* Made all explosions bigger.
<br/>
* Made the smoke grow bigger and vanish faster.
<br/>
* Turbo boost consumes 50% less gas than before.
<br/>
* All particles are now drawn on top of the layers.

Thanks! :) In the next version there'll really be 3D planes and positional sound effects, and

<br/>
* When out of gas, machine gun shoots bullets less often.
<br/>
* Missiles create bigger explosions.
<br/>
* Enlarged big explosions.
<br/>
* Added mines.
<br/>
* Mines and missiles have limited supply (currently five per plane).
<br/>
* Added support for creating circular holes in the background graphics (previously

  only rectangles were supported).
<br/>
* When the player's plane explodes, a circular area of pixels is removed from the
<br/>
  background graphics.
<br/>
* Increased max gravity by 50%.

* Added some preliminary sound effects.
<br/>
* Sound FX and the music can be turned off in the game configuration menu page.

<br/>
<br/>
* Made the planes faster, and easier to kill.
<br/>
* The gravity works a bit differently now.
<br/>
* Adjusted the way the plane moves.
<br/>
* Made the sounds louder (master volume was at 50%).
<br/>
* Made the camera move faster.
<br/>
* When not accelerating, the plane slows down slower.
<br/>
* When accelerating the frequency of the plane's motor becomes higher.
<br/>
* Fixed a stupid bug in the RLE decompressor.
<br/>
* All explosions that created holes in the background create now bigger holes.
<br/>
* Added title screen.
<br/>
* When the level is changed, bullets and planes are now reset.
<br/>
* Added kill statistics.
<br/>
* It's not possible to start a network match with just one logged player.
<br/>
* Changing the server's IP address after connecting to an AP should work now.
<br/>
* The hardware divider unit is now more often used.
<br/>
* Added support for single layer 1024x512 and 512x1024 pixel levels, plus added two test levels.
<br/>
* Adjusted the default settings to be more useful.
<br/>
* Optimized bullet drawing.
<br/>
* Mines got new graphics.
<br/>
* Added 25-Oct-2006 dswifilib UDP bugfixes.
<br/>
* Added preliminary plane selection screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what's not on the list, is this new feature called "Wifi malfunction". :( Currently
<br/>
multiplayer mode doesn't work at my machine. The game crashes after connecting

Anyway, if you are running Linux, plain "make" in the server directory will do the trick. If you

About libcartreset, hell, that would be nice :) Now that the network code crashes the

libfat as I'm pretty sure I'll soon have to use it... I'll give it a try.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Why I'm not using libnds? Well, it wants to hide the beautiful Nintendo hardware from my

hungry eyes. :) I just want hack the hardware myself, just for the kicks, and it's also
<br/>
nice to stay partially independent at the same time. Anyway, doing so has taught me

lots of things... I've got nothing against the libnds guys, great work dudes! :) But I just

<br/>
I've got lots of trouble for not using libnds, but hey, so far I've managed to survive. :)
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, why write your software so that it depends on lots of things when you can get
<br/>
away with less? For example libfat seems to need just three tiny functions from libnds.

Why not let the user define them? That way libfat would be 100% independent...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DevKitARM got some bugfix updates that fixed the problems I was having, but I was already

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's new in v0.1.3:
<br/>
<br/>
* Integrated libfat and libcartreset (press SELECT+ START to reset to GBA slot).
<br/>
* The player plane doesn't zoom with the layers, when changing layers.
<br/>
* Added machine gun sound.
<br/>
* Machine gun bullets are now gray.
<br/>
* The planes are now positioned nicer in the plane selection menu screen.
<br/>
* The plane selection menu screen shows the plane stats (not yet in use, though).
<br/>
* Animated the mines.
<br/>
* You cannot change the level or the plane model when a network game is on.
<br/>
* When changing the level, the plane model selection remains.
<br/>
* If you get "CANNOT CONNECT" from dswifilib, it's possible to try again.
<br/>
* Kill statistics are now saved on the server side.
<br/>
* The player can scroll through these statistics on the PLAY STATISTICS menu
<br/>
   page, if there is a connection to the server.
<br/>
* Redrew the test levels KUUSIKKO and AARRELAIVA.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
What's broken in v0.1.3:
<br/>
<br/>
* When playing network matches, choose the same plane on every client. Will be fixed
<br/>
in v0.1.4. I'll need to write a plane texture bank manager.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
Changes:
<br/>
<br/>
* Lauri left the team. :( Unfortunately he didn't have the time for this project. But he might
<br/>
surprise us with some small things in the future.
<br/>
* The (project) name could change in the near future. It seems that Wright Flight is
<br/>
already in use...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

* Added texture manager for the plane textures, and now you can mix different planes

<br/>
* When changing planes while PAUSE is on, the plane is now correclty centered.
<br/>
* Increased collision accuracy for the bullets (not for machine gun bullets, they are 
<br/>
   handled simpler).
<br/>
* Brought the two level layers closer to each other,  and made the zooming less
<br/>
   aggressive.
<br/>
* Background destroying wasn't distributed correctly between the players.
<br/>
* The layer base color affects the planes, bullets and particles correclty.
<br/>
* The front layer became darker after changing the layers for the first time.
<br/>
* The player can choose the plane he wants to follow in the network play.
<br/>
* Changed the network play logic a little. Now the client doesn't disconnect from the

Anyway, about the AI, if you are wondering, the calculations are distributed so that
<br/>
each connected client (player) will calculate roughly as much AI stuff as everybody
<br/>
else. If someone timeouts, no problem, the load is automatically redistributed. Works
<br/>
nicely on my two DS's... Let's see tomorrow how it'll work with more. :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's new in v0.1.7:
<br/>
<br/>
* Updated libcartreset to v0.72.
<br/>
* Removed -ansi from the server makefile's gcc options.
<br/>
* Made turbo boost a little slower.
<br/>
* Halved the damage the planes take from colliding with each other.
<br/>
* The network I/O is now also handled in the plane selection screen. Before it wasn't
<br/>
   and would lead to a timeout.
<br/>
* All planes have white base color. Before each player would have its own base color,
<br/>
   but most colors just didn't work well.
<br/>
* Made the gravity 25% stronger.
<br/>
* If the player changes the plane while connected to the server (but no game is on),
<br/>
   the plane selection is sent to the server automatically.
<br/>
* The online status of the other players is also shown on the play menu screen.
<br/>
* Added sparkle and dark smoke particles.
<br/>
* When a plane is low on energy, it'll start emitting dark smoke and sparkles.
<br/>
* The weapons do now 33% less damage than before.
<br/>
* Compressed network update packets.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
v0.1.7 is mainly a bugfix release with also fixes in the playability. Expect more features
<br/>
in v0.1.8 (like cooler HUD, smarter AI, and something extra as well).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's what's new in v0.1.8:
<br/>
<br/>
* All the players are shown as online when they login to the server, not only after a match begins.
<br/>
* After respawning, and at the start of a network match, the plane is invulnerable for five
<br/>
   seconds, unless the player starts firing.
<br/>
* The plane doesn't move after respawning until the camera has reached it.
<br/>
* If a player timeouts, but manages to recieve the timeout notice, his plane doesn't vanish.
<br/>
* Changed the button configuration: Now there are two weapon buttons, one for the
<br/>
  machine gun and one for the special weapon. The third weapon button now changes the special weapon.
<br/>
* Adjusted the gravity, made turbo boost faster, made turning faster while turbo boosting,
<br/>
   turbo boost eats 50% more gas.
<br/>
* Plane to plane collisions do now less damage.
<br/>
* Dropped the initial network send frameskip to 3, the optimizations seem to allow this
<br/>
   (or is it my new ZyXEL P660HW-D1 ADSL2+ router?).
<br/>
* Once again the bullets are reset when a network match begins.
<br/>
* Added hidden debug menu screen (press spot X on the credits screen).
<br/>
* When starting the server you must specify the client timeout.
<br/>
* Each plane has now its own collision region.
<br/>
* Added new HUD graphics. Also the selected special weapon and the remaining bullets
<br/>
   are displayed on the HUD.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
This version really doesn't bring that much new, but lots of tweaks to make the game

more playable. In v0.1.9 we might have that improved AI, real level data from the editor,

more tweaks, and etc...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
* Reorgazined the play menu screen.
<br/>
* Added two new multiplayer modes: deathmatch and 10 kills.
<br/>
* The HUD shows now 0 if you are out of ammo.
<br/>
* When in plane selection screen, or while the game is paused, the master volume is 50% of the normal.
<br/>
* Added "VICTORY!" and "DEFEAT" messages to the network play (and DEFEAT replaces the old GAME OVER).
<br/>
* Cleaned up the HUD (and redrew PAUSE).
<br/>
* You cannot pause the game during a network match anymore.
<br/>
* Added bombs.
<br/>
* Added free EWRAM, and the free ARM7 time to the hidden debug screen.
<br/>
* The plane selection view is now in perspective.
<br/>
* The HUD shows again the number of the remaining lives (if they are relevant for the current game mode).
<br/>
* Added line-of-sight to the AI bots, and the turrets now fire at the closest plane that is firing that they can see.
<br/>
* Added a little random to the AI turrets' targetting.

The next release could come out soon as Markus is working on the editor and the

we'll be there once again testing the game in a totally unsuitable enviroment. :) Nintendo's

* When a multiplayer match begins, "GO!" is displayed on the screen.
<br/>
* Moved "VICTORY!", "DEFEAT", "GO!" and "PAUSE" a little up so that they don't cover the plane.
<br/>
* After pressing "CONNECT!", "READY!" or "END!", the user cannot select anything in the
<br/>
   menus for one second. This is to prevent accidental double clicking.
<br/>
* Bombs and mines didn't score kills, fixed that.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'd like to have ambient music, but the other guys would like music with melodies.
<br/>
Meaning that anything that fits the game. Just make some music that you think would
<br/>
fit the game, and stuff it down our throats. :) We are going to have old and new planes,
<br/>
and history and future style levels, so the range is big, and mixed. If your music is good,
<br/>
I'm pretty sure it'll end up in the game. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Here's also a chance to experiment with the music. If you want to apply those MOD effects
<br/>
to e.g. polka, violins, tango, go for it. :) Just don't do boring music.
<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, all the other team members have so far done stuff that they'd like to
<br/>
do for a game like this, but so that not all are against it. Or on some occasions I've coded
<br/>
two mutually exclusive features, like gravity and !gravity flight models, if there's been

different opinnions about some features. And third flight model is coming in the near

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's what's new in v0.2.1:
<br/>
<br/>
  * Added IMA ADPCM compression and playback for the sound effects. Currently only the explosions are IMA ADPCM compressed.
<br/>
  * Added Deflate-like compression to the toolchain, and Inflate-like into the game (didn't follow the RFCs 100%).
<br/>
  * It's possible to shoot holes into the background graphics with the machine gun by enabling the "ALL BULLETS DO HOLES" option.
<br/>
  * PAUSE status flag isn't saved into SRAM any more along with the other status flags.
<br/>
  * Added small explosions to plane collisions.
<br/>
  * Added water drop particles that collide with the backgrounds, and with each other.
<br/>
  * Fixed and optimized background collision data calculation.
<br/>
  * The plane attribute values in the plane selection screen were shown in wrong order.
<br/>
  * The plane attribute values are now used (minus weight). You can expect that the default values will go through a lot of tweaking.
<br/>
  * Decreased stack usage (especially the ARM7 of dswifilib was eating lots of stack).
<br/>
  * The special weapon selection remains when the player dies.
<br/>
  * On the network configuration menu page, it's possible to choose the number of the access point configuration in firmware (1-3) that the game uses.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
Duh, well, Markus didn't have the time to finish the level data importer, so the levels are
<br/>
a bit empty at the moment. :( Anyway, expect that to be fixed pretty soon. Hopefully in

the next release in a week.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's new in v0.2.2:
<br/>
<br/>
* The project has a new name: "Explosion of an Aeroplane".
<br/>
* Incorporated the dswifilib bugfixes (DSLite related) done on 11-Jan-2007.
<br/>
* When the current special weapon runs out of ammo, the next one with ammo is automatically selected.
<br/>
* Added third flight model: OUTER SPACE.
<br/>
* It's possible to select the base color for the plane in the plane selection screen.
<br/>
* Redrew the missile sprite, and flying missiles now emit smoke particles. The missile sprites are also rotated correctly.
<br/>
* When out of gas, the turbo boost works as the normal acceleration.
<br/>
* Added a template banner (icon) to the ROM, though it seems that M3 cannot show it. DS-X shows it correclty.
<br/>
* Added support for delayed particle spawns (very easy to create a lot of particles that appear later).
<br/>
* Added heat seeking missiles.
<br/>
* It's possible to destroy the AI turrets with missiles and bombs.
<br/>
* If you press L+R in less than 0.5s after your plane has started to explode, it fires some (50% chance per bullet) of
<br/>
    the remaining special weapon bullets into random directions.
<br/>
* Made the zooming zoom more away from the playfield.
<br/>
* The bombs get the plane's initial Y speed.
<br/>
* Added enemy missile launchers.
<br/>
* If you press the name of the level in the PLAY menu screen, the level will be reset.
<br/>
* It's possible to zoom out and in into the plane in PLANE SELECTION menu screen using X and B, and corrected the Z-scaling.
<br/>
* The plane selection and the plane colors are saved in SRAM.
<br/>
* After respawning the plane is invulnerable during the first frame of the new life as well.
<br/>
* Changing layers uses only 50% of a gas tank, not 100%.
<br/>
* The level is reset when a multiplayer match begins.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm off to Egypt with Markus, to scuba dive once again! :) Anyway, in the next release
<br/>
we'll try to do the following things:
<br/>
<br/>
* Add support for 1024x1024 4 color levels with one layer
<br/>
* Double the level graphics via zooming
<br/>
* Instead of gas the layer change could consume batteries
<br/>
* Synchronize the play options so that all clients use the same settings
<br/>
* The player should get minus points for killing himself
<br/>
* Add a map screen
<br/>
<br/>
... and more levels, airports, etc?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

* A suicide is worth one minus point.
<br/>
* The missile turrets don't target invulnerable planes any more.
<br/>
* Changing layers eats now batteries, and the batteries are recharged over time.
<br/>
* Shrunk the plane graphics, and made the planes a little more agile to make the levels appear larger.
<br/>
* Added layer check to bullet vs AI bot collision checks.

<br/>
* Key presses don't affect the plane while the player is configuring the keys.
<br/>
* Made the mines larger, and now it's possible to shoot the mines.
<br/>
* Added initial radar/map screen.
<br/>
* Halved the damage in plane-to-plane collisions.
<br/>
* Normal missiles do bigger holes.
<br/>
* Once again shrunk the plane graphics, enlarged the level graphics to make the levels appear larger.
<br/>
* Slowed down the heat seeking missiles a little, made them less agile, and added more random to their turning.
<br/>
* The planes consume much less gas than before.
<br/>
* Press L+R while the game boots to skip the loading of the saved configuration.
<br/>
* Machine gun makes smaller holes.
<br/>
* Added collectable items (machine gun boost, health and gas) that respawn.
<br/>
* It's possible to boost the machine gun two times, from normal to heavy cannon, and from heavy cannon to laser gun by collecting the machine gun boost icons.
<br/>
* By pressing down the both acceleration keys, the plane does super turbo (and consumes even more gas).
<br/>
* Special weapon auto selection (when ammo runs out) can be toggled on and off in the game configuration menu screen.
<br/>
* Random number generator is reseeded every time a level is reset.
<br/>
* Pause works only while the client is not connected to a server.
<br/>
* If a client timed out while connected to a server, but no game had been started, the client couldn't reconnect.
<br/>
* Clients drop the connection when server timeouts (and the user can configure the server timeout threshold in the client).
<br/>
* Gravity now affects the planes more, when turned on.
<br/>
* The planes accelerate slower in space flight mode.
<br/>
* Decreased the stack usage.
<br/>
* Optimized bullet drawing (less overhead on the 3D hardware).
<br/>
* Gravity is now calculated using the weights of the planes.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
Jaakko failed to produce new usable graphics during all this time, and I had to draw the
<br/>
collectable icons. Markus didn't get the airports to work 100% so I had to comment
<br/>
them out from the code. Anyway, it could be that I'll be doing more GFX in the future to
<br/>
get things done. Expect that v0.2.5 will have new multiplayer modes, new weapons, and
<br/>
more GFX, and v0.2.5 should come out in two weeks.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's new in v0.2.5:
<br/>
<br/>
* The game screen now displays the changes in the connection to the server (CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED or SERVER TIMEOUT).
<br/>
* Optimized HUD, bullet, collectable and particle drawing by using those geometry commands that reuse the previous Z.
<br/>
* Redrew the HUD. The new one is more compact and takes less screen space. Also redrew the mines.
<br/>
* Fixed scaling bugs in the HUD items.
<br/>
* Exploding planes don't collect collectables.
<br/>
* Collectables appear and disappear with a burst of particles.
<br/>
* Cleaned up CHANGELOG.
<br/>
* The gas and health meters in the HUD display the actual values with a small delay.
<br/>
* Added brightness adjustment to the game configuration menu screen.
<br/>
* The boot screen changes to credits screen when the first level has been loaded.
<br/>
* Bombs, mines and missiles are activated a little later after being fired.
<br/>
* Background layer airplanes aren't drawn on top of the front layer any more.
<br/>
* Collectables are now drawn on top of the particles.
<br/>
* Added a new multiplayer mode: collect stars (whoever collects all eight stars wins).
<br/>
* It's not possible to change the menu screen while the boot screen is visible.
<br/>
* Rewrote the code that checked who won and who lost in a network match.
<br/>
* Made the red dot on the map a little brighter, so it should work better on the original DS.
<br/>
* Added airports.
<br/>
* Added cluster bombs.
<br/>
* Incorporated dswifilib bugfixes (12-Apr-2007), and removed C99 style variable allocation from dswifilib.
<br/>
* Recreated the planes using Blender, and now we have two versions of the planes: ingame planes with 55-65 triangles, and plane selection screen planes with 200-400 triangles each.
<br/>
* Reprogrammed data sharing between ARM7 and ARM9.
<br/>
* Y and A keys change the plane in the plane selection menu screen. Also adjusted the initial zooming and rotation values.
<br/>
* The network match settings (level, game mode, all bullets do holes, gas, battery and the flight model) are now synchronized between the clients.
<br/>
* When low on gas, the gas bar blinks, and when low on health the health bar blinks.
<br/>
* If changing the plane model while the plane was exploding would make the plane remain as a fireball.
<br/>
* Code cleanups: even less C99 style variable allocation from the stack, and made the interrupts use less stack.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I redid the 3D graphics, and some 2D graphics (like the HUD), because Jaakko just couldn't
<br/>
produce a thing. And now all the 3D is done using Blender, not with XSI. Markus
<br/>
added the airports, so no more falling and crashing at the start. Enjoy! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah this is our hobby project number one at the moment, but as there's

still a lot to do, especially now that I'm also doing the GFX, things move

a bit slowly. But you can expect the next release in two weeks, once again. :)

Well, if you wait long enough and the GFX guys don't do a thing, then

<br/>
<br/>
v0.2.6 (09-May-2007)
<br/>
* Updated to inflateTT-DS v1.2, so the data files are compressed a little better.
<br/>
* Found a couple of places where C99 style variable allocation was used, and cleaned them up.
<br/>
* When a player disconnects from a match all the bullets owned by him are deleted, so they don't appear as ghost bullets any more.
<br/>
* Made the interrupts use even less stack.
<br/>
* If the game server doesn't respond to a join message in 1.5 seconds, NO RESPONSE will be shown on the game screen.
<br/>
* The player's plane starts from an airfield when changing the level, not from the current location.
<br/>
* Gas is now blue.
<br/>
* Collectables don't spawn so close to the walls any more.
<br/>
* Remade the machinegun boost icon.
<br/>
* Added collectable icons for mines, bombs, missiles, heat seeking missiles, cluster bombs and invulnerability, and collecting a weapon icon will grant the player three shots.
<br/>
* Increased the collision distance for the collectables.
<br/>
* Increased the rate at which the airports refuel the planes.
<br/>
* The planes cannot crash to the airports any more.
<br/>
* Airports don't attract the planes if they are turbo boosting.
<br/>
* Decreased the amount of ammo the planes have when they spawn.
<br/>
* Added priority to collectable allocation, so that if there is no free space in the collectables array and we need to spawn e.g., stars, we can overwrite less important collectables.
<br/>
* Added quick turning.
<br/>
* The player doesn't lose lives if he isn't engaged in a network match.
<br/>
* Added a new level: ROME.
<br/>
* Increased the maximum number of particles.
<br/>
* Cleaned up MUSTIKKA's level graphics.
<br/>
* Optimized collision checks.
<br/>
* It's possible to collect nine bullets to each special weapon.
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>

Not what I had in mind, but a cool idea! I was thinking about just doing
<br/>
something small, like a small puzzle game, just to check out how PSP
<br/>
works. Looking at the example projects that come with the homebrew
<br/>
devkit, I'd say it's pretty to work with, but let's see.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I could try to port that small game to DS, and add a player vs
<br/>
player mode over the internet to it. And then perhaps port the client
<br/>
to Linux as well. :) Hell, I kinda like the idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Correct. New PSPs have 3.10 or later firmware, which has not yet been cracked, and there's no guarantee that it will be cracked before PSP homebrew becomes irrelevant.[1] The DS, on the other hand, is still at a comparative version 1.50.
<br/>
<br/>
[1] PSP homebrew becomes next to irrelevant once Pocket PC devices become powerful enough to run ported PSP homebrew at full speed. Microsoft has shown no intent to put lockout on consumer products running Windows Mobile OS, except for smartphones.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Google Product Search (formerly Froogle) shows entry-level Pocket PC hardware manufactured by ASUS for under 250 USD, comparable to the price of a PSP given that it's not subsidized by a console maker or a mobile phone network operator. The extra money you pay for a Pocket PC goes toward keeping the lockout turned off.

The DS and PSP tend to attract gamers (fuck the "media capabilities", really), where Pocket PC doesn't. If I read something like "Final Fantasy 7 ported to handhelds", I wouldn't expect the handhelds to include Pocket PC.
<br/>
<br/>
So in other words, the PSP is probably more interesting than Pocket PC to port Wright Flight to than Pocket PC. Not because of the hardware, but because of the audience.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
