    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought that maybe to make things a bit more exciting here, we should have a weekly(or any other time)homebrew match. In the first week, 2 homebrew programs or games(of course if the author agrees), will compete in a poll, and the winner stays. and of course, another homebrew tries and takes it place,and so on..
<br/>
What do you think of it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps a bit longer.  It may boost some peoples' skills a bit, as well as the viewers'/readers' if the contest entries were (forced ?) open-source.  Of course, I would love to have some goal for programming, and not just having to think of my own ideas on what to program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">this kind of sound like something I have seen done in another forum, its not a coding contest , but more a popularity contest of already released homebrew(iv seen it done with commercial games). It brings more attention to those programs that people find is great homebrew software etc.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Darkflame: then it would become a competition.
<br/>
What I mean is exactly what GPFerror is talking about, but as strager said, maybe we should extend the time a bit more.
<br/>
I would like input on which 2 homebrews to do for the first &lt;insert time &gt;:)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
