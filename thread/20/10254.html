DS does not have the hardware to play Old GB games

<br/>
The thing boots the gba in color mode while using the flash memory from the GBA cartridge as the game data.
<br/>
As a DS does not support booting in color mode you'll break something before you'll play a game :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Old game-boy games will run in GBA mode using a emulator, if you run the file with SuperCard it will start, but I don't think anyone has made a adapter yet that you put into GBA slot and it emulates GBC,GB. It would be good if such thing existed so you can play GB cartridges you own, including the saver. If you run on SuperCard it doesn't save it<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Games such as Kirby Tilt and Tumble are the main reason I still keep my GBColor around. Too bad you cant emulate that efficiently :P(You could,but it takes most of the fun away)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
