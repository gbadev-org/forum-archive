It looks as though the <span style="text-decoration: underline">N64</span> has better 3D hardware, from the information I could gather about both systems.
<br/>
But if a game were to be written for the NDS's unique hardware, it should be able to look like N64 quality.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right, suppose we shut down the unused screen, don't emulate sound, use both CPUs, don't support the expansion pak, etc. That means we're using a machine with:
<br/>
-12 buttons and a touch screen
<br/>
-36MB RAM, assuming you have something like M3 in the GBA slot
<br/>
-99mhz of processing power split 66/33 across two CPUs
<br/>
<br/>
To emulate a machine with:
<br/>
-14 buttons and an analog stick
<br/>
-4MB RAM
<br/>
-93mhz(?) of processing power
<br/>
<br/>
Problem 1: Not enough buttons.
<br/>
Possible solution: Use the touch screen as the analog stick and two buttons, or the D-pad and two buttons (and use the real D-pad as the analog stick). Since the touch screen can't read multiple touches though, you'd have to press one at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
Problem 2: Not enough memory (except for ROMs 16MB and under). 36MB of RAM isn't enough to hold a 32MB ROM, 4MB of emulated memory, and the memory used by the emulator.
<br/>
Possible solutions: Don't support 32MB ROMs (which kills a lot of compatibility), or require both a GBA-slot RAM expansion and a slot-1 device (since N64 games load from the cartridge like DS games do, slot 1 could contain the ROM and emulate the cartridge) which is expensive. Obviously most homebrew won't have this problem but let's face it, there's no real homebrew worth playing on N64.
<br/>
<br/>
Problem 3: Not enough CPU power. We're talking about using two ARM CPUs totalling 99mhz to emulate an R4300 at 93mhz. If the N64 were ARM or the DS were R4300 (God no), it almost might be feasible to emulate at maybe 50mhz.
<br/>
Possible solutions: Er... connect a much more powerful CPU to the GBA slot?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Find a feasible solution to problem 3 and then we can discuss why things like the graphics hardware and coprocessors are also far too much for the DS to handle.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was a joke ;)

However, I am very serious when I say Dos/X86 would be a nice thing to emulate.  Unlike N64s/PS1s, Dos has games covering the whole spectrum of mhz requirements...going down nice and low for some.

Also, ram is hardly either an issue.

How about running an N64 emulator on your PC and using a streaming app to get it onto the DS screen?

Then somehow map the buttons? :D

It's hard to get people motivated to venture into writing a complex emulator when they know there's no chance it'll ever run at full speed. Twice the speed isn't enough to emulate a different architecture processor, I'm afraid. 
<br/>
<br/>
And even if the CPU were fast enough, the DS 3D hardware is so different and specialized that many PSOne games simply cannot be directly ported, let alone be emulated via HLE, requiring the emulator to render the graphics via software renderer, making it even slower.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
