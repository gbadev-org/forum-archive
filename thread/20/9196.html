    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DPG has become something similar to MPEG-1, so it just might be possible. As for AVI, which fourccs are you talking about?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">He's asking about WMA though not WMV.. Audio not Video. Very legit question, would be nice if someone took some time to make the plugin.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't expect anything other than DPG played back by the hardware.. the other stuff is mostly supported by the encoder.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Screw WMA... how about AAC/MPEG-4 Audio? There is a Helix codec that is optimized for ARM, which I have been messing with. Unfortunately I don't have the time to figure out the plugin system for moonshell (although it looks pretty simple) and debug the sucker. I might put some work into it, although I think moonshell could pop it out pretty quickly since he is familiar with his code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then make a stand-alone program that uses GBFS or Chishm's FAT library and then let someone else port it to moonshell.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
