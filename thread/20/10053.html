    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm receiving my PassMe2 in a couple of days, and I'm in a dilemma about which FlashME to choose. Obviously, Nintendo has managed to block WMB from a PC (from another DS it works normally - how the hell could they detect that?! - maybe from the MAC address?) and obviously, there is an audio bug in FlashME Lite. I was wondering if it'd be better to install the plain FlashME 7 (but lose the brightness setting function) or FlashME Lite and live with the bug(s - there actually just one, the other one is intentional by the big N). I could change the brightness through MoonShell but it isn't exactly convenient, is it.

Also I think the WMB block is just a protocol change. There was something that all demos do, but wasn't required, so the WMB app doesn't do it, and now the DS Lite firmware requires it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As for WMB, Nintendo has been hard at work to stop WMB, since v4 WifiMe stopped working, so I guess it was a natural step forward.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
