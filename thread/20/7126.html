what hardware? Dev kits? a DS?

The DS itself IS cheap though so no reason for ranting about it.

It gives you the ability to hand out DSs with your commercial game (pre-release, still in development) to a bunch of people for play test/beta testing, and not cost you thousands of dollars for the Nintendo brand hardware..  As well as send it to companies that might be collaborating with the development (sound/graphics/etc), and doesn't have an official Nintendo developement kit..  Now they would be able to test on hardware as well..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Meaning, I'm guessing the standard graphics company isn't going to have all the official NDS development kits, so if you provide them with the .nds to see how their graphics look in the game.. this is a cheap alternative to buying the $20,000 devkit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The cost of losing your Nintendo official developer status is much more expensive than that....
<br/>
<br/>
Don't know exactly what the rules are, but if I were an official developer I would check the legal contracts very thoroughly before using any homebrew or "warez" focused tools.
<br/>
I don't think Nintendo would be happy with people shipping out non-encrypted easy-to-rip GBA versions of your game -- especially if they include development SDK debug components. Extra concerning if they appeared in the "wild" (ie. outside your development shop).
<br/>
Cheap "homebrew" alternatives may harm your current business model -- ie. companies keep an eye on every licence of a $20K devkit. They won't worry about a $200 NDS + GBA cart.
<br/>
----
<br/>
Remember, this is a hobby BBS. If you are an official developer, you have "inside information" regarding the confidential official SDK. In general you shouldn't be posting here!
<br/>
<br/>
For any "official developer" reading these forums, my advice is to be careful. If you lose your official developer status, the hardware is cheaper, but you will have to live with the reverse engineered open source SDK (like the rest of us) and give up on any opportunity of selling Nintendo games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless you give a unique serial number to each copy you hand out to your testers and watermark that number into the graphics somehow. Then by turning the watermark back into a serial number, you can track down the (censored) who broke NDA and then use the watermark as evidence to sue the pants off his (censored).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
