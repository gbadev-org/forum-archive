<br/>
<br/>
Now before anyone starts throwing things and yelling, I do realize how much work this project is and I am aware of my user status on this forum.
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering first of all if it would be possible with dev tools we have available cause i know that not everything is known about the DS. And two i want to know what is the best possible way to write a game like this or is OpenGL the only way.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested I need as much help as possible. I have a very definite view of what the final game should be so it would be easy or anyone to determine if this is possible or not right off the bat.
<br/>
<br/>
What I would like in the final:
<br/>
-Graphics on par with or higher than SSB.(ie SM64DS to SM64)
<br/>
-Top screen is the stage with bottom screen showing percentage, lives, time, etc and a still image of the whole stage with small icons showing the locations of the characters.
<br/>
-At least local Wi-Fi up to 4 players.
<br/>
-Stages from first game(since they are easier to recreate) with the new moves added to melee.
<br/>
-At least 10 characters
<br/>
<br/>
If this is a bad idea or not feasible please don't just say no explain why not cause I don't understand everything about DS yet.
<br/>
<br/>

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Three tips before you get started: <ol type="1"><li>Don't call it "Super Smash Bros." Call it a side-view fighting game. If you're pirating Nintendo's characters, there are some users on this forum who won't help you. </li><li>If you plan on adding multiplayer, the dswifi library currently does not have any provision for ad-hoc mode or using a DS as a soft access point. Thus it requires all users to be within range of an access point, which isn't helpful on car or bus trips or while waiting in line in a public place. </li><li>Prototype your game logic on a PC running Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows first. The debugging tools are more mature, and you can wait to optimize the graphics until later. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was the one that originally started making the fighting engine for the DS that was SSB esque, I was designing it in such a way that the super smash bros sprites would be imported, but I myself would not be includeing them.  Let me tell you, it is a lot of work,  it will take a lot of time, and people will be contacting you left and right bothering you from this.  Most you wont mind, but there will be a few that never stop bothering you, asking every 5 minutes if you are done, to the point where you are just sick of working on it because it feels like work not a hobby anymore.....well thats what happened with me anyway lol.   If you want to continue where I left off, I will be more then glad to send you the source,  then perhaps I will get motivated and get back to working on it again.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

<br/>
i tried browsing your forum for the demo but the links don't work
<br/>
also i have M3DSS so it might have to be a little different to work on that right?
<br/>
anyway knight0fdragon if you can contact me on aim @ Roxas3087 i can talk with you about the details

I'm not trying to be an asshole, or stop this project at all, but hear me out. 
<br/>
<br/>
As we aren't really developing on the official SDK, it's going to be freaking hard to do something like this by scratch by yourself. So far, I have yet to see a single action/platforming engine for the DS made by the homebrew community. But I'm not saying you shouldn't be doing this at all. It's just going to take a lot of hard work, and I applaud you. But these ideas, are so easy to implement, what you need is actual programming skill. I recommend you find a team that will help you with this. knight0fdragon says he started on an engine, there's your first guy. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty simple to rip models from the N64 game, but I think you should go with 2D sprites. So far, Jump Super Stars is a successful game based on Smash (no percentage bars, but there are other similar aspects, play the game, trust me) and it uses 2D sprites. Not only will you be able to squeeze in many characters, but there are so many people on the internet willing to make sprites, and rip them, and edit them. Sites such as The Spriter's Resource and Dr. Shnaps Spriting Database* have forums dedicated to sprite edits and rips. tepples said not to call it Smash Brothers or use their art. It isn't a problem at all, and Nintendo sees this as Fan Art. You're only gonna get your ass hauled in if you make a profit out of it at all. Which you aren't.
<br/>
<br/>
Online compatibility isn't much of a problem. For the PAlib competition, some guy made an Online game called Orange Desert or some crap. Cool game, online is fun too. So that isn't even a problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's just programming that's the real hard obstacle. If we can get the entire homebrew community out to pause their current projects, and help out bit by bit for a single game, I'm sure we can create something big. 
<br/>
<br/>
For the few of you who have read my post: Take this in consideration please.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, god speed man. For everyone making a Smash Bros. like game for any platform, I salute them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A platforming demo is something that I've found to be conspicuously lacking from my portfolio. So I guess I have my work cut out for me after I beat the first mission of <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing Population Growing</span> in both my town and my cousin's.
