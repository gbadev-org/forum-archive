    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm making a side scroller game for DS called Zotbot, I'm planning to give the game controls similiar to soldate or abuse, so that you will control the main character's sword of sorts with the stylus. I also want to try to make this game fast with lots of grind rails similar to sonic advance. I'm only working on the side scroller aspect of the game for now because I haven't gotten a chance to get anything to play the game on my ds yet.

 I've just gotten around to adding a grind rail to one of my levels, you can check out my wip at:

I would probably make the jump a little slower if I were you, it's quite hard to get any kind of precise control.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it works great on hardware if you've not been able to try it yet :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree with him, looks good, but slow him down a bit for pete's sake! Maybe your reflexes are a lot faster than mine or something, but it is hard to control for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
also you should think of creating/?drawing your own backgrounds instead of ripping the Super Mario World L.1-1 background.
<br/>
It will give your game an individual touch.

keep up the great work<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
