@topic, its a special codec. you have to ask the codec developer or the publisher of the games to get any information about these codecs(sometimes, theres a credit to the codec at the beginning of a game), but i can tell you for sure, you wont get the license of the codec for free!
<br/>
<br/>
You could try to decode(or was it encode? i forgot what is what xD) the movie by yourself(or maybe with some help) but i think you dont have enough knowledge about codecs...
<br/>
<br/>
theres a third way to watch these movies on pc: open your DS and connect somehow the data cable of the lcd displays to your pc and try to record the pictures on the DS with you PC
<br/>
<br/>
and heres another way: use a good ol' camera and capture your LCD displays with it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I cant garenty it will work, but GE generaly does a darn good job at finding the right codecs/connections to play stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
DPG and GBM/GBS formats play on it for me.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
