but there is better hardware for this. slot 1 - DSserial, slot 2 - firelink. both open with known hardware and sample source to access it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm aware of that, Lynx. I was thinking things like USB storage device (libfat) and gamepad.
<br/>
<br/>
DSerial is nice, but I'd have to order one online (not easy) and wouldn't I have to build the USB port onto it too? ARDS support means anyone can go into a grocery store and hand over $20 and have a professional well-made device with USB, NoPass and cheat functionality.
<br/>
Sure some REing would have to be done, but I don't see that being a big problem. I've done it before with other hardware. I was just hoping someone else had beat me to it (especially since DS emulators/debuggers are so painful at this point).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I didn't know that the Action Replay had a USB port, but as Diddle mentioned the USB port on the the Firecard and all those clones is accessable, too.  The manufacturer released apps for using your DS as either a mouse (touchscreen) or gamepad through the USB port and was nice enough to include the source, too.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the first thing about programming for USB interface, but I was pretty excited about this until the NeoFlash MK5 (which is an N-Card clone) I won in their contest got stolen in the mail.  It doesn't look lke I'm going to get a replacement and if I'm going to pay for a slot 1 kit it wouldn't be an N-Card clone, so no more USB fun for me.  Still seems like would be the best option for someone wanting to use a USB interface with the DS...unless DSerial could do USB host, which would be the coolest.

I'm not sure I understand the question.  It comes with the USB port on it..  I'm not sure what the default firmware will allow you to do.
<br/>
<br/>
But, if you are looking for just the USB function it wouldn't make sense to spend $45 on a DSerial if you can get the AR for $20 and it'll do what you want.
<br/>
<br/>
I say go for it and see what you can get out of it!  :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No$GBA usually works best with .ds.gba files, though sometimes the .nds ones will work as well.  For a quick and easy way to append the loader if a .ds.gba file is not included with the download, drag and drop the .nds file onto the "Supercard Magic Homebrew Patcher" which will spit out a .sc.nds file that should work in No$GBA.  Sometimes it places the file a directory or two above where it should, but I still find it easier than opening a command prompt and manually appending ndsmall.bin to the file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
