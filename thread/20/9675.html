    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have Neo Cart and Magic Key 3 and I also have M3 adapter (which is way far better). My question is..is it possible to copy the original NDS game with M3 adapter? I can do it with Neo Cart (supposedly) but when I tried it with Mario 64 DS I ended up with a 0 kb file. Also,can dipstar be used with an original NDS game using M3 Adapter or does the game have to be loaded onto the M3 SD card?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
