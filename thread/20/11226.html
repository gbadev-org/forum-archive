    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
Good work on the game. I really do enjoy shooters. The one thing I do feel that it needs though is to use both screens. The ship size is fine, but the area for it to move in, as well as to see where and when the ships are coming, I feel that it is to small. Personally, I feel that using both screens would be a huge benefit(there's alot of width on the game but not enough height).
<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought:
<br/>
<br/>
The idea of using both screens but the top screen zoomed in. This would make it easy to see clusters of bullets before they reach the touch screen and enable you for some interesting tap, tap dodging.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's coming on well. Congratulations!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Stats on one screen (possibly a static example of the ship firing its full weapon complement with stats about power usage, like when you're upgrading), and action on the other.<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great start ! This looks and plays much, much better than Tyrian Advance.  I think it would be better to stretch the action on both screens, leaving thin statusbar on the right side (like it was in original game). Gap between screens is not problem at all - in upper part of status bar there are a power generator output &amp; your score , and in the lower part there are shield &amp; armor levels.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not really doing a remake of tyrian, its more a proof of concept i intend to make it a standard engine for anyone to use.  Yeah i know i haven't used any ds specific features yet, that'll come later.  
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone intends to make a full blown game out of it let me know, as i might not necessarily do it but it is incredibly easy to extend.  Next i'm gonna move onto either wifi or 3d.  (prob wifi as i know a lot about it already)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">looks nice, hope you expand it, and some kind of co op wifi multiplayer would be cool to see. i myself prefer 2d to 3d for shooters like this unless you meant something else when talking about 3d</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">By 3d i mean 3d graphics like NSMB merely for eye candy, the game will be purely 2d based like ikaragua or nanostray.  Thats not something i'm gonna do for a while though i'm gonna attempt some wifi first.  Check out the topic i'm about to start.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
