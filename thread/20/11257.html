Its not a question of "learning" is a question of convience. 
<br/>
Its not as quick to run a linux app because you are still stuck typeing stuff in.
<br/>
Or has that changed this last time I looked?
<br/>
<br/>
My main problem with it is only its a keyboard based interface for a machine without a keyboard.
<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with linux as such, in fact, the machine next to me has been nicely set up with  few flavours, includeing the very flashy and supprisingly good XGL interface.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I have found a few big hassles that have discouraged me from keeping DSLinux on my memory card longer than necessary: <ul><li>No physical keyboard for entering commands. My PC, on which I compile homebrew, has a keyboard. </li><li>The requirement of entering a name/pass on an on-screen keyboard every time I start DSLinux. When I want to develop homebrew, I can enter the password much more quickly on my PC's physical keyboard. </li><li>The requirement of closing all apps and shutting down the OS before the adapter becomes dislodged or the battery runs down. Computers, on the other hand, have internal drives (which don't stick out) and an easy "Shut down" option on the main system menu. </li><li>The difficulty of learning how to use or even close some full-screen apps such as retawq. A source code editor on a desktop computer, on the other hand, has a nice friendly close button in the upper-right (on Windows) or upper left (on Mac) corner. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The login can be circumvented, there is a thread on the DSLinux forums detailing how...
<br/>
<br/>
The closing all apps and shutting down OS thing is mainly a part of Linux itself. It's always been good Linux usage policy to issue a system halt command before powering off so as to ensure that all I/O buffers are emptied and all file-systems are cleanly dismounted. Which doesn't mean that just switching off will corrupt stuff all the time, but it does increase the odds.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you don't need to close all the apps. The poweroff command will do this for you, as it issues a kill signal to all running processes.
<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty curve is just part of command line linux usage. Admittedly, having to use an on-screen keyboard doesn't help, but in other respects it's mostly the same thing...

<br/>
With the extra RAM builds (or another build with many virtual terminals), typing poweroff in another the terminal while running userspace applications is quite useful, but even with the regular builds when you're viewing the terminal and typing poweroff there are a few applications running. (The terminal and poweroff, for example).
<br/>
Annoyingly, you must type your username / password for each virtual terminal, but it's well worth it in the end.
<br/>
<br/>
Most applications can be closed with Ctrl-C. (In fact, is that actually the OS's own doing or is it still the application's choice?)
<br/>
The little X on the corner is a recent addition to modern operating systems. In the olden days before windowed GUIs were used, people suffered the same thing.
<br/>
It's surprising, I know, that I am not still struggling to close Keen 4 to this day...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the most part I agree that it is a bit of a difficult thing to figure out, but it is an operating system so it takes a while.
<br/>
You'll be happy to know that I have successfully run Links within a terminal in NanoX, which I then closed by clicking an X in the corner :)

The problems you have are not faults in DSLinux, that is the way Linux works.
<br/>
<br/>
Having the system automatically log in as a user is very insecure, automatically logging in as root is just idiotic. No Linux distribution would ever dare do that by default (or else get laughed out of existence; I.E. Lindows), game console or not.
<br/>
<br/>
As for powering off, Linux simply can'y do this safely as a matter of design. Even if you put the system into synchronous write mode rather than Unix's normal asynchronous manner, you still couldn't turn the machine off any time you wanted. There are many files that need to be updated and closed out when the system goes down, or else there will be considerable confusion when it boots back up. This can be minimized by the system by putting those sorts of files back to sane defaults in the boot scripts, but this only complicates system initialization.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the "problem" here is that DSLinux is aiming to be a standard Linux system that just happens to be running on the DS, and not a system that is built to cater to people who just want to pop it open and run a telnet client. 
<br/>
<br/>
Those people would be better of staying in the homebrew arena, since DSLinux is never going to become that. Adding a GUI isn't even a priority for the core development, that is being left up to the community if they want to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You saying Linux is moveing/changeing files about on the CF as a mater of fact  each time it boots up and closes down? O_o

Didnt people almost universaly agree swap files were a bad idea due to limited writes? This dosnt sound far off that at all.
<br/>
<br/>
For a bit of hardware like the DS, a shutdown should be as simple as making sure nothing is currently being written too.  The DS hardware dosnt care if the power is cut. Its harmless whatever state it is in.

Something that is actualy practical to use in any form would be nice though. 
<br/>
<br/>
DSLinux seems to being made purely as a nice tech-demostration, or as a challenge.
<br/>
All Id like too see is it become practical for actual use regularly,or portably.  
<br/>
<br/>
As others have pointed it, it does multitasking...something no other area of homebrew is doing. The potential to have something actualy incredibly cool and usefull is there.
<br/>
Somehow though, its viewed as being <span style="font-style: italic">"not a priority"</span> too have a system that takes less then 5 minutes each time you want too run something.

This sums up the problem indeed.
<br/>
Very stuck mindset of what Linux "should" be, rather then what it would actualy be usefull as.
<br/>
<br/>
No one is going to use a portable system they are going to log into any time.
<br/>
People are not using DSLinux because not its hard, or because they have to learn, they arnt using it <span style="font-style: italic">because it simply isnt practical.</span>

Of course, if DSLinux was only ever concieved too be a nice tech demo,then fair enough.

<br/>
The same could be said for a desktop PC. If it is in your home, you are the "administrator"; and yet, no desktop distribution runs the user as root by default. Insecurity like that is a feature of Microsoft products.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be trivial to write a script or application that would wipe the contents of a person's media device if they were to run it as root. As DSLinux and DS homebrew in general increases in popularity, it only becomes more likely someone will attempt it. Do we forget the DS bricker so quickly?
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">You saying Linux is moveing/changeing files about on the CF as a mater of fact each time it boots up and closes down? O_o

<br/>
<br/>
At this point in time, many (most, even) of the files are located in the initrd that is in the system's RAM, but as the system advances and support gets better with media I/O, more files will begin pivoting onto flash to preserve settings beyond a reboot. With this expansion in mind, the system has to obey the normal startup and shutdown routines. Ironically, if DSLinux is ever to expand into more generally useful fields, this behavior is only going to become more important.
<br/>
<br/>
Even with configuration and dynamic files on the card, you still aren't looking at R/W cycles like you would if you actually tried to swap to it. It is the difference between writing a change to a file every few minutes or at every shutdown, to reading and writing multiple times a second if the system was swapping hard.
<br/>
<br/>
The issue is pointless to debate here. The DSLinux developers have no interest in building an OS that is simply a engine to drive user-applications. Their goal is to port a complete OS to a console, as has been the goal with XBox Linux, GCLinux, PS2 Linux, etc. There is rarely a "point" to it, no, but that is just how it is.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the system is obviously open source, and the developers would have no problems with a group forking development of it into something that would be useful for the average person. If any of you wants to create an off-shoot of the normal DSLinux system that automatically boots up into Links, then you could easily do that.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not dissimilar to the "real" Linux distributions. There are distributions that are only the core components of an OS and take nothing for granted (Slackware, Arch, etc), and then there are distributions that attempt as much hand-holding as possible (Ubuntu, Linspire, SuSE, etc). They are both made up of the exact same software, the only thing different is the intent of the group behind it's development.
<br/>
<br/>
If there is a group out there that wants to take the "Slackware" DSLinux and turn it into a Ubuntu, then more power to them. But it will certainly have to be an outside group, as the developers of DSLinux have made it very clear that they have no interest in such a project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Me, I like playing around with my OS and hence I like Linux :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I have fond memories of doing something like 30 or 40 Redhat installs over the course of a weekend, back when I fist got Linux. This was Redhat 3.0.3, mind you. Back in the day :-)
<br/>
<br/>
DS Linux is not a "tech demo" It's a port of a high-grade operating system to a portable platform. It'll take time to reach the level a lot of people want it at, but reach that level it may well do, as like many Linux projects it has a dedicated following of skilled programmers who like nothing more than a challenge...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">On file buffers: Linux' standard behavior on most filesystems is to avoid committing writes for as long as possible. The general purpose behind this is performance; if you've made changes to a file once, probability in most cases is that you'll make changes again, and it's faster to do that while it's still in ram. In the case of write-limited media, the other purpose is to harm the storage device as little as possible. Synching to disk too often will increase the degradation rate of the media unnecessarily without ensuring validity of the filesystem any more than normal; if you're powering off arbitrarily, you can easily power off during a flush. The only precaution here is some form of journaling, but that is a Bad Idea(tm) on limited-write media, for the same reason swapfiles are a Bad Idea(tm).
<br/>
<br/>
On security: did you forget that this is a machine with wireless networking? Running as root means that if there's a security hole in a networking app that allows remote exploit, then they gain root. This may be a limited device in what they can accomplish, but since we've already established it's networking capable, there's quite a bit of mischief a sufficiently creative intruder can achieve with root priveliges.
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that a traditional typing login-prompt doesn't help with this, but it's still critical to not be running as root default on *ANY* full stacked OS. DSLinux may not be user-friendly in its present state, but it's still capable of quite a bit through shell scripting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I understand that. It wouldn't be so bad if someone were to put a sync button or power switch on the touch screen, but having to open another console, type the name, type the password blind (especially with the troublesome touch screen code) and type "poweroff", is a pain in the glutes.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm fascinated by the bare fact that the general homebrew and the DSLinux communities are so far away from each other. I mean; there are still people on these boards who think DSLinux is only a tech demo, useful for nothing. And on the contrary, some people on DSLinux forums are still claiming playing video on DS is impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
To tell the truth, I absolutely love DSLinux and almost don't use anything else anymore (well, I DO read Garfield comics I download through 'links'  in DSOrganize :P). It's a complete operating system and feels and act like it.
<br/>
I maybe dislike using Linux on a desktop workstation, but for a portable console, it's absolutely a killer-app. 
<br/>
<br/>
Some facts:
<br/>
<br/>
- it was the first homebrew with file management (and still is, except for DSOrganize, which is easy to use but not that advanced, of course);
<br/>
<br/>
- it was the first homebrew with completed and perfect WiFi drivers - sgstair's lib still has some issues;
<br/>
<br/>
- it was the first homebrew to connect with IRC networks and therefore any IM protocol through bitlbee;
<br/>
<br/>
- it was the first homebrew to feature an internet browser (and still is);
<br/>
<br/>
- it is the only homebrew to feature multitasking (except for the M3 shell);
<br/>
<br/>
- it is the only homebrew making use of SuperCard's/M3's 32 MBs of RAM;
<br/>
<br/>
- (that's merely the start of the list, but I'll stop here)
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, it features just everything I need. And to tell the truth, I prefer terminal over the GUI, but that's just me (hey, after all it's easier to type <span style="font-style: italic">mv /music/*myband*.mp3 /home/music/myband/</span>, than to scr*w with the interface all the time - and the keyboard in DSLinux is among the fastest homebrew virtual keyboards too). tepples: As far as I know, nobody in the DSLinux does develop their own applications - they only port them - it's fairly easy and also serves a PC-like functionality. And nobody is complaining over the user-friendlyness; after all, there's a wiki with all the needed documentation.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#104176 - TJ - Tue Sep 26, 2006 10:59 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As MaHe said, I don't know of any application that was written (beyond some scripts) specifically for DSLinux. They are all ported PC apps. Nobody cares if the general public finds them useful, they are included because they didn't take much system resources or require much modification to run.
<br/>
<br/>
If a developer wants to create a simple to use and mass-market friendly application, then they are going to write that on the bare-metal; and aren't going to do it as a terminal-only program packed in with DSLinux.
<br/>
<br/>
So again: if you are looking for simple to start, simple to use, idiot-proof software, then stay away from DSLinux. That isn't what it is about, and probably never will be. If you don't understand it (or the concept behind it) then don't use it, and definately don't complain because the developers didn't go out of their way to add in hand-holding.
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't a hard concept here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, the new terminal has tab completion and command history. It's better implemented than Windows's terminal, too.
<br/>
<br/>
I understand completely anyone who doesn't like a CLI, but it really is not too different from a GUI.
<br/>
<br/>
With a windowed GUI you get used to some standards such as that tooltips are handy, Enter generally submits things, Alt-F4 closes windows with most window managers, minimizing puts a window somewhere, Alt-Tab in windows is a wonderful tool, and all those other little hotkeys that we look like stumbling old grannies if we don't use :b
<br/>
<br/>
The same is with a CLI; people look like stumbling old grannies at first because they may not be totally used to the idea that commands and programs are the exact same thing, --help after a program name almost always outputs command line options and maybe even a program's purpose in a readable way, multiple virtual terminals are sometimes the only way to run many programs at once (as opposed to multiple windows or virtual desktops), Ctrl-C almost always exits, Esc often opens some kind command mode or menu, and colour is a wonderful thing rarely used without reason.
<br/>
<br/>
(Hm... I've just had a thought that could make DSLinux more welcoming! An application launcher using that flashy menu code that somebody ported...)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

(It's a step down from the Model M keyboard that I used to use until a few keys stopped working a month or two ago, but the Logitech still feels OK.)

Try using the Windows on-screen keyboard (in Windows 2000, start &gt; programs &gt; accessories &gt; accessibility &gt; on-screen keyboard) to navigate cmd.exe and you'll feel my pain. Is there any way to enter commands on the DS that can match the 80+ WPM that I routinely pull on a PC?

I think, to some extent, this is effect a little exagerated, as it's always the newest community members that tend to post questions and opinions with respect to various things being possible or not possible.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I do see a few of the DSLinux.org regulars on these forums as well (Mahe, HyperHacker and a few others). It's a pity Amadeus doesn't hang out here, since I think he could contribute a lot of info...

Some of DS Linux facts he points out are interesting, although he's not entirely correct on the multi-tasking point (Multi-threading has been pursued before and is being pursued again [With a good degree of success this time...]).
