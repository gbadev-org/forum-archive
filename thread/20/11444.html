    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just posted this on my website but to spread the word theres no better place than this also, a nice new comp from Datel.
<br/>
<br/>
Heres the newspost i just made
<br/>
<br/>
Ok all DCEmu visitors and members/coders a new competition from Datel has been announced, heres the info:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Fifty prizes of Datel DS goodie bundles are up for grabs? </span>
<br/>
The Nintendo DS has a thriving home brew scene, with skilled programmers creating all sorts of wonderful games and applications. They?re easy to use too ? just get a home brew solution such as Datel?s MAX Media Dock, download the software from HERE --&gt; <a href="http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=34980" target="_blank">http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=34980</a> and transfer them to your media dock. You can then launch them through MAX Media?s intuitive desktop. 
<br/>
<br/>
To celebrate the success of MAX Media Dock for the Nintendo DS, Datel is looking for the best home brew games around to offer as downloads or to possibly be bundled with future products. They don?t have to be new games ? if you?ve already released a game onto the home brew scene, feel free to submit it for the competition. We?re not after exclusive publication rights either. If your game?s one of the lucky winners, you can still distribute it on the net and issue updated releases. In fact, if you?ve already written a game, entering the competition will be no effort at all!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">But what?s in it for you?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Easy ? we?re giving away up to 50 bundles of Datel DS goodies, worth ?100/$180 each! And if that?s not enough, your game will also get a much increased distribution, with Datel?s seal of approval bringing it to the attention of professional DS coding teams who might ? just might ? be looking for new recruits.
<br/>
<br/>
To enter, just send a copy of your game with a few simple instructions to <a href="mailto:homebrewcompetition@datel.co.uk">homebrewcompetition@datel.co.uk</a> by Tuesday 31st October. If you?re one of the winners, we?ll get back to you after this date. 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">So basically this is a great way for Datel to have more support for its Max Media Player, so to all coders this is a great chance to get some freebies</span><br/>_________________<br/>Webmaster of Nintendo DS Emulation News

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">heh..when was this announced?  A due date of October 31st..that's not much time to create an awesome game :-p  I think i'll submit my game, Super Snake DS, either way...maybe I'll attempt to get online play or just normal multiplayer working ..though..i kind of doubt it with all my homework and other activities going on lately :X
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Is there an official page for this contest anywhere?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it was only recently posted.  I guess they don't want anyone to make a game for this, they just want your permission to distribute your existing game.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wouldn't developers want MMD so that they can test file system code against MMD?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Isn't it MMD's job to ensure that the FAT libs work with their devices, not the other way around? Developers are not supposed to waste their time checking against every single new device of the day.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a feeling that might be part of the point.  As the fact that the MMD doesn't support homebrew very well by running a compo they might be able to "look" more homebrew friendly.  As the MMD is already out, there isn't much of a chance it will work with the current FAT lib, but that doesn't mean they couldn't send an MMD to Chishm with device details to allow him to add it to the list of devices it supports.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm not a Datel supporter by any means but they have the only device that I would consider widely available.  I think it would benefit the homebrew scene if we could get the FAT lib working with their device as anyone can walk into BestBuy and on an impulse buy, go home and find out about the wide world of DS homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
