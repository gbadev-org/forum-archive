So that people can add and amend this I was wondering if there is a wiki out there that has some information on it or one where this information can be added.

I've spent some time REing and documenting the WMB protocol and pictochat beacon frames (haven't gotten into the actual comms much).  I kind of gave away my 2nd DS, so I haven't worked on it any since Dec.
<br/>
<br/>
All of that info is going up on the wiki (http://www.bottledlight.com/ds) when I get the time, guess I could add the outline and packet formats this weekend if you want to work on the info there.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oops, maybe saying ni-fi protocol was a bad idea - I was using it to group WMb and Pictochat together.
<br/>
<br/>
Whilst developing a linux WMB host I found that there was information about the message structure and the like but it was spread through forums, randon websites and source code. So rather than adding another randon website I am looking for a more suitable home for this stuff.
<br/>
If some information is going up on the NDStech wiki (seems the ideal place) then I am happy to contribute what I know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's be nice if homebrew games could access the net without me turning my USB Connector into a bog-standard WiFi access point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Really doubt it. The NiFi protocol does not contain any information that would allow routing. If someone wanted to tunnel NiFi, the addresses would have to be specified by the user to the tunneling protocol.
<br/>
<br/>
It's more likely that the Nindi SoftAP just filters the MAC to restrict access to DS/Wii for WFC (IP traffic) and does not work for NiFi.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Right, because (in my imagined scheme) the routing info is inside the IPv4 packets, which in turn are inside the Ni-Fi packets. SOCKS works the same way, right?

If it were MAC number based, then it would work with homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Afaik the hardware packet-filtering (for receiving and responding in time) is not optimal in dswifi (see the hardware paket filter posts in the DownloadPlayHost Thread in the development forum) and still not known in detail.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
