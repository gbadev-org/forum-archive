    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got sound working, touchscreen support, a bunch of other stuff. Source code is also included:

<a href="http://www.telefragged.com/thefatal/index.php?content=inc_si_ds.htm" target="_blank">http://www.telefragged.com/thefatal/index.php?content=inc_si_ds.htm</a>

<br/>
Here are the more important bits from the readme:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What you need:
<br/>
 -The wad from the full version of Hexen (shareware not supported natively by code
<br/>
  released by Raven, may be integrated in later versions).
<br/>
 -A flashcart big enough to hold the binary with wad (well over 128mbit).
<br/>
 -gbfs by Damian Yerrick for appending the wad to the HexenDS binary. You can obtain
<br/>
  it here: <a href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/" target="_blank">http://www.pineight.com/gba/</a>
<br/>
 -A way of getting your DS to boot off of said flash cart, which also allows the arm9
<br/>
  code to access the cart's rom. I personally use wmb and a F2A 256mbit cart.
<br/>
<br/>
How to use:
<br/>
 -Place your full version Hexen wad in the bin directory where makewadgbfs.bat is,
<br/>
  along with the ds and ds.gba files. Also make sure you have gbfs, lsgbfs, padbin,
<br/>
  and cat somewhere on your path.
<br/>
 -After fulfilling the above requirements run makewadgbfs.bat, if all goes well you
<br/>
  will end up with hexends_wad.nds and hexends_wad.nds.gba files.
<br/>
 -Flash the .gba file to your flash cart, use the method of your choice to get your
<br/>
  DS to run arm9 code off of the cart. This method must support access of the flash
<br/>
  cart's rom section or HexenDS will not run.
<br/>
<br/>
What is broken:
<br/>
 -Saves. Hexen save data is huge and needs work to be cut down. For the time being,
<br/>
  a warp menu has been added under the "ds" section of the main menu for playing
<br/>
  around.
<br/>
 -Memory. Occasionally the zone may get too fragmented and the game may run out of
<br/>
  memory. This is indicated by the game freezing in place in a while loop. I have
<br/>
  added more cache swapping for asset types and have not seen this occuring lately,
<br/>
  but it's still possible.
<br/>
 -Speed. It's generally playable but does not run at full speed. More routines are
<br/>
  already being converted to ARM assembly and optimized so this will continue to
<br/>
  improve.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The two most expensive rendering functions (column/span drawing) have been ARM-ified and are significantly faster than the C versions (but I'm sure there's still room for improvement, I don't claim to be an arm master). May be useful in Heretic since I don't think they changed much if anything in there, though I haven't looked at the Heretic code so I don't know for sure.

You can just put them here and I'll see them, or you can post on my web site's forum if that's more appropriate. That lockup is probably the memory allocation error I mentioned in the readme, I'll put it in console mode and print out an error message in the next version when it happens so it's more obvious what's going wrong.

Hexen (assuming Heretic too) has a pretty robust system of swapping out certain types of lumps based on the tag on the zone allocation, which was intended for this very situation, so I do recommend making it work. It's just a matter of making sure lump types are able to handle being removed at any given time using the "user" pointer system. The biggest savings I've gotten so far was when I added some code to change zone tags on sound lumps after they finish playing. A bit of a pain with the back and forth with the arm7, but it was well worth the hassle. I also still have some rather large static allocations on the zone which may not be helping with fragmentation and can probably be eliminated.
<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that I still haven't been able to reproduce any memory allocation errors myself (since after I released v0.1), so if that is the cause of the crash in question in HexenDS it's hovering right around the limit. There's still plenty of savings to be done on the zone in my codebase, so that's probably the best solution here. I imagine you have even less assets and such in memory in Heretic than Hexen at most times, so the zone approach may work well for you as well. Did you decide to get rid of it because you were running out of memory, or was it just a decision from the get-go?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I do not really believe I had run into a memory problem, and I agree that the structure for swapping into and out pertinent data is done well in these games.  The reason I threw it out (early on) was because I was having some odd operations with it.  Sometimes, when I would allocate a new block with Z_malloc, it would bungle up the pointers in the linklist.  It would set the next pointer to something like 0x63454708 instead of 0x08634567 (notice the rotation of bits).  This is just an example off the top of my head, not actual number I read out.  Anyway, it would mess up the whole idea and lock up.  This is my first GBA/DS project and I just chalked it up to not understanding the memory architecture, so I drastically simplified it and went on.  But it was really weird.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem was showing up when newblock-&gt;prev was != to base or newblock-&gt;next was != to base-&gt;next.  So, I would just start moving the new block and increasing the size of the previous block up to 16 times.  If this dropped out and offset was &gt;=16, I would catch the error and freeze.  This worked better, but sometime it still dropped through in error.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

padbin is included in the gbfs archive. If you have a seperate distribution that does not include it, you should be getting it from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/" target="_blank">tepples's site</a> as mentioned in the readme.txt. As for cat, you might try <a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=cat+win32&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Google</a>, or you can just use copy as kickinz1 has already mentioned.

Game worked flawlessly but to append the wad into the .gba I had to edit the batch file to use the bin path and not bin/wad (not sure if the readme was explicit about where the wad should go other than in the bin dir). Speed was pretty good except in just a few places. Overall a great solid port!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's why I include 'catbin' in the GBFS distribution. Different versions of 'make' that I've encountered (old mingw32-make, new mingw32-make, MSYS make, Cygwin make) have different restrictions on running 'copy' and other command.com/cmd.exe internal commands, and 'cat' isn't guaranteed to be available.

Some of the GBFS programs are included with recent devkitARM. Or think of an analogy to apps for GNU/Linux, which usually depend on other installed libraries.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
