    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have had these speakers for several months. I just tought to take some pictures as I have promised in the past.
<br/>
<br/>
They can be charged with any USB port with power.
<br/>
There is three AAA reghargeable batteries inside of the speakers.
<br/>
Power up to 10 hours.
<br/>
And yes, the sound is better than via DS's little speakers.

But they aren't so cheap. :( And sorry, I don't know any internet store that sells them.
<br/>
I could help if you are interested, just PM me.

Go on ebay and look for portable speakers, their around $14 + $7 postage.

But how many of those speakers can recharge the batteries while they are still in the speaker?   That's an impressive feature. 
<br/>
<br/>
Can they be recharged by plugging them into a wall outlet or only USB?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, they are really good sized and they have protection (that paw) that prevents anything from harming the speaker element.

Hong Kong products are not so pricey. Actually I can not confirm where they are made in as they have no texts. The casing seems to be high quality (very sturdy plastic).
<br/>
You can get any cheap speakers for your DS, it's up to you. :) There are many bigger speakers with better bass (like the Philips ones).
