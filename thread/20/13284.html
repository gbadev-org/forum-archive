i'm curious if anyone knows what the big impediment is to building a cart that does radio reception, then relays it thru the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Three words: Ten bit DAC. That's why even Play-Yan has its own headphone jack. It's even worse if your cart starts in GBA mode, as that typically uses 8-bit sound.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

erm, am and even fm radio would sound fine through a 10bit DAC... we do listen to mp3s and watch movies via Moonshell afterall... no one seems to complain about the sound quality with those formats.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Radio isn't exactly high fidelity audio in the first place. Most of the stations I have heard, even FM, sound like garbage. I have listened to streaming audio at better quality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
