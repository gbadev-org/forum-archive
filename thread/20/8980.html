Nitro Tracker is a traditional DOS/Amiga style module tracker, reminiscent of the FastTracker/ScreamTracker era.  It allows people to arrange instruments according to timings and pitch shifts to sample music, in the style of .XM, .S3M and .IT as found in classic archives like the Hornet Archive and Scene.org.  However, Tobias actually did what we?ve all talked about: he used the lower touchscreen to present a more natural and friendly interface, so that people without a tracker background can work in a more familiar environment and watch how the tracker updates, until they can get better acquainted with the more direct music record interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Nitro Tracker is a fine example of what homebrew has the potential to do, given dedication and talent.

I would suggest to reply to that post, or even (no offense, falcon) delete this one, because it's no use having two posts for this.
