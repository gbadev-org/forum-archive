    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if there is a way using a wireless card and the proper drivers (similar to wifime) to recieve and transmit ghosts for Mariokart DS. This would be a great way to share your best times on the net, I think. Does anyone know how possible this is? I mean, one could monitor the signals from the two DS systems using a linux tool or two to see how to respond to the sender and the reciever, and to see how to actually send the data. 
<br/>
<br/>
Has anything like this been tried before? I want to try myself (I have some ideas about how to make it work) but I can't because I don't have the right kind of wireless card to do DS stuff...

i think it would be easier to code something to extract the ghost datas from the savegame...
<br/>
<br/>
it also doesnt really matter what wireless card you have. all you have to do is to let the card acting as a ds and sniff the sent data. doesnt really matter which card you have, but it would be easier if you have a rt2500/rt2560 chip, since there are allready drivers to let the cards working as a ds. however, good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's not really quite what I had in mind, although sniffing the data would work I guess. I want this program to actually link with the mariokartDS game, making itself look like another DS recieving the ghost. Of course, this might require a knowledge of the nintendo protocol, and I'm not sure if we have that knowledge here yet or not.

Can we extract savegames? I wasn't aware this was possible. And yet, you would still have to have a way to send the ghost out to a system without overwriting someone else's save, wouldn't you?

Yes, it's super easy, there are several apps which do it for you. SaTa's Rein is the main one.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, there is already someone doing something similar to what you want. There is a game called 'Band Bros' that lets players enter in custom songs. There is a tool which will extract custom songs from the save files, as well as let you insert songs which other people have made. 
<br/>
<br/>
One problem you might run into is that some savegames are encrypted, and I think Mario Kart is one of them. So you will first have to break the encryption. (But it can't be any harder then breaking the wifi protocol). 
<br/>
<br/>
The advantage to doing it thru the savegame, is that anyone who has a homebrew device can use it. Otherwise they would need a WifiMe-compatible wifi card (rt2500 or whatever).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Doing it wirelessly has the downside of requiring an RT[2500/2650] card to communicate using Nintendo's protocol. Doing it through save files has the downside of requiring a way to actually run homebrew on your DS (a fake wireless client could be used without running any code on the DS). Both have the downside of having to crack the format (wireless protocol vs save file encryption). So it's up to you really.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
