    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before I install FlashMe, I want to make sure that I can access the original firmware features, such as PictoChat and the calibration menu, and especially the <span style="font-style: italic">alarm clock</span> which I use as my wakeup alarm.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you flash the stealth version of flashme you won't recognise a difference between official firmware and Flashme (until you start homebrew code via WMB or from gba slot, of course).
<br/>
The normal version of flashme does the same things, except that the health screen is removed and the light fades in when you start the DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, if you use FWNITRO, the alarm clock feature is much better than the original firmware, but DS Download Play and calibration don't work (I need to fix both those things!), and PictoChat won't work either.
<br/>
<br/>
If the only feature you use is alarm clock, you may want to upgrade to FWNITRO becuase is much better alarm clock, but if you need the other features install FlashMe and wait for the other features to be implemented in FWNITRO.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alarm clock of FWNitro is really better: It's really frightening when it is active ;)
<br/>
I flashed FWNitro two weeks ago and the week after flashing I got up BEFORE the alarm started (It seems that I was afraid of being frightened of the DS o.O).
