    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It looks like the PSP is getting some heat from the gaming press. In the latest issue of PSM magazine there is a 2-page spread called "Whats Wrong with the PSP?" The articles sites dead pixels, bad load times, and horrible battery life among other complaints. And this is from a Playstation magazine! Then I read an article on Gamasutra (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050915/hong_01.shtml" target="_blank">DS vs PSP</a>) which is an open debate as to which system is better. They seemed to get far more responses from the DS crowd and the general consensus is that Nintendo has won at least this next holiday season. Comments included things like the DS is a sturdier system (better for kids), DS is way cheaper, games are more fun/original, etc. People in the PSP camp mostly resorted to saying it can play MP3s and UMDs, and rarely compared it on games alone. 
<br/>
<br/>
   This is not too surprising. All the people I know with a PSP, dont seem to be as satisfied with the purchase as I am with my DS. One person I know told me his PSP has been collecting dust for months and that he will probably get a DS. Other friends of mine with neither system agree that the DS games are just more fun. At first I thought Sony was going to kill the DS, but now it seems that the general public has actually realized (for once) that it is the games that are important.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No joke. Nintendo plans to release Play-Yan v2 worldwide during the 2005 holiday season, and GBA SP and GBA Micro will be just as capable of playing MPEG-4 videos as the PSP is.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I cant believe I got one ( well I traded an XBOX for it, I was so mad after having it for a while I went out and got another XBOX. The DS blows it away. the PSP has only one game and that is Lumins. all other  games suck. I only use it for the browser now( just when I am in bed and want to see if there is anything new on these threads).
<br/>
<br/>
The games look like shit on the PSP. Its funny, since the psp has so much more power over the DS i exect the games to look WAY better. but since my expectations are as high as they are ( on par with PS2 my ass)
<br/>
the Games look like shit to me. THEY REALLY DO
<br/>
<br/>
I am NINTENDO all the way forever. I trust them because they are about games and the people who play  them. NOT JUST THE NAME AND THE MONEY **COUGH**SONY**Cough**

Maybe offer a modding service too. Although mod chips are now illegal in Australia (thank you John Howard and FTA) the firmware mod may not be. It doesn't directly allow you to play pirate games, but does allow you to run home brew software (fair use). I am not a legal expert so don't blame me if you get arrested :-P .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I agree that right now the PSP seems to be a waste of money.  But I think the games that will coming out for it soon are worth it.  I usually only have about 10 games for a system anyway.  And right now I already have 3 or 4 games that I'd like to get for the PSP (I don't own one yet).
<br/>
<br/>
It just hasn't been out long enough to have enough good selections.
<br/>
<br/>
I mean.  The number of games that I want for the PSP is only shadowed by the DS by maybe 2 games.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the PSP itself has the capability to look like PS2 graphics (or at least between the PSX and PS2), it's just that games haven't come out to showcase it really.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than the selection I think people would be happier with the PSP if it cost less and had a longer battery life.  (Which are two of the three important factors.  Third one being game selection)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The reason I got a DS and have no interest on the PSP whatsoever is exactly the games. Of course the PSP line up will improve, but that isn't the point for me. I don't care how many GTA games it'll get, or how that port of the lastest multi-platform game looks and plays almost like the PS2 version.
<br/>
<br/>
PSP games play and feel like console games to me. It's a mini-PS2 at heart, and that doesn't quite thrill me: if I want console games with the lastest graphics, I'd go for the bigger brother instead. I find it redundant.
<br/>
<br/>
Before the DS was out, I was interested in getting myself a GBA, since it was the only way left to get some good non-pretentious 2D experience, in a world where most console games pretend to be the alpha and the omega epitome of movie-ish gaming experience. I enjoy a nice 2D game that is nicely polished because the developers didn't need to spend most of the development time squeezing more polygons on the screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah on this note the psp acctually has a 333mhz processory but it's limited by the offical psp dev kit to 2/3rds of the power at the moment because all the power would kill the current battery...or so I have been told. So the games can and will look better, but thats not the point to me. The psp is jsut a portible PS2 as stated multiple times. The only half way intresting games for it are already on bigger and better consols. I'm not THAT head over heels that I have to be able to play burnout EVERYWHERE I GO. Plus the PSP version of burnout feels like crap with that nub &gt;_&lt;. But thats just my rant, feel free to ignore it :D.

It's also very expensive and somehow I will pay for a lot of features that I'm not even intressted in. 
<br/>
<br/>
The main problems are the games imo. After all I think the people just want a system like this to play games. The video, mp3 playback and all the additional features are kinda like a gimmik. People will use it a while and then they are not interrested in it, just like when the first mobile phones with camaras came out. 
<br/>
They were no real alternativ to real digi cams just like PSP is no good alternative to the iPod as an MP3 player.
<br/>
And why should I pay the price of a DVD for an UMD video that I can only watch on a PSP? Why should I watch movies on that thing anyway?? I just want to play games!

<br/>
<br/>
I think the PSP could have been successful if it would have started out with a better line up of games, and continued to get great games for it; but it is to late, and I think the PSP will die soon. Sony, which is allready loosing lots of money off of every sale of a PSP, and making little money from people buying games for the PSP (since the majority of PSP games are just plain console ports, or have horrendous loading times), will be either forced to pull production of the PSP, or jack up prices of the PSP. Obviously, jacking prices up for the PSP would instantly kill the handheld, so I think within a few years PSP production will definatly stop.
<br/>
<br/>

What's funny about that is I remember when the PSP came out, and about for a month thereafter most game stores were overflowing with used DS's. Obviously, it's the opposite now. I think just that is a clear sign of how good the DS is. (And I laugh, and I say 'I told you so' to all the people that god rid of their DS, and then traded it in for a PSP)
<br/>
<br/>
My local gamestop right now has 2 used PSP's and only 1 used DS. When the PSP came out they had like 15 DS's just sitting there in the used cabinet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, it's because it got only 2MBs of VRAM, while the PS2 got 4MBs. Plus, AFAIK, the PSP memory bus isn't as fast as the PS2, so they can't do the DMA tricks to copy textures from the system RAM to the video RAM mid-rendering. All it can do is hardware compression. That's why many games have textures comparable to last generation N64 games in size.
<br/>
<br/>
some PS2 games use ~12MBs worth of textures using this technique. Actually, the console itself was designed around that concept since day one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's probably worth mentioning that it is physically impossible for a PSP game to ever look as good as the PS2, as the PSP screen resolution is substantially lower than NTSC standard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Oh really? Most PS2 units output a composite video signal to a television monitor. Composite video works by splitting the video signal into two frequency bands. The lower frequency band (DC to 2.7 MHz) carries sync and luminance (brightness), and the upper frequency band (2.7 to 4.5 MHz) carries chrominance (hue and saturation). The 2.7 MHz frequency range of luminance translates to about 480 horizontal pixels at best, and because the splitting isn't perfect, you still get dot crawl and muddy results around the left and right edges of brightly colored areas (PS1 boot screen anyone?).
<br/>
<br/>
Composite video signals are also interlaced. An interlaced picture only contains the data for half the scanlines in each frame: odd lines in one frame and even lines in the next frame. There are about 448 visible scanlines in an NTSC picture, and only 224 are updated each frame.  Granted, a lot of PS2 games run at 30 Hz so you get 480x448 usable pixels, but if you're running two players on one screen, each player still gets only half the vertical space.
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, each player's window is 480x224 pixels. Compare this to 480x272 on the PSP, which uses a dedicated LCD for each player.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

 Who cares at this point what the system Can do..... Stupid battery life. Thats just an excuse.............   The system was over hyped ( I think) kinda the same for the DS... Just a bad time for hand helds... 
<br/>
<br/>
With systems going from this generation to the next generation, handhelds just dont seem to fit.... Maybe that is just me. I am Huge into gaming from handhelds to PC's, I just havent found myself really excited ( as I was for Mario64, GBA,  splinter cell chaos theory (xbox) )
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
whatever, maybe Im just hoping for too much, then again no I am not. 250$$$ for a system that blows ( stupid me ) should have read the other options tepples listed instead of buying a PSP,
<br/>
<br/>
 like a potable dvd player, mp3 player and all the other stuff he mentioned, I did get a DVD player with a 11 inch screen ( bye bye UMD MOVIES ) I have XBOX, GAMECUBE, DS AND MY PC ( bye bye PSP GAMES) great I have a black piece of plastic that lights up worth 250$$

I just got Burnout REVENGE for XBOX and Burnout legends for PSP ( yeah I LOVE BURNOUT) it is just doesnt work for the PSP just too much for a handheld screen.

The DS is a less powerful portable, though it has quite a bit more possibility for homebrew PC app ports. But, due to processor limitations, it's abiliyies may be choked out a bit. Same with the lack of uniformity among storage devices.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hate playing games on the go. I'd always prefer to play on a nice big TV screen (GBPlayer==good :). If I had known about it from day one, I wouldn't have even gotten a GBA. The only thing I still use my GBA for is writing flash carts). And in the extremely rare instances I do have a chance to play anything while I'm out, I'd rather just pull out my PDA and play Mahjong or Solitaire. So I've never bought portables for the portability, I just buy them for the games. And like someone in an earlier post, I liked the GBA for it's unwillingness to kill the far superior 2D-style of games. (OT: That's strange...my delete key just stopped working, haha...) To be honest, when I started hanging around gbadev here, I was VERY surprised to discover that there's people who actually DO play portables on-the-go. Go figure :).
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I'm really enjoying reading through this thread and then thinking back to all the people who were SOOO completely certain that the PSP would do to Nintendo's portables what the PS1 did to the N64 (Even despite the circumstances being completely different).

put it this way if metroid prime hunters was on the psp and ds and you could play against each other online who's win and by a considerable margin.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">IMO The bottom line is, if you like handhelds you will like both the DS and PSP. If you can't afford a PSP then that's fair enough. But I personally don't understand the whole Sony vs Nintendo thing at all, since I come from a Atari/C64/Amiga/PC lineage and have never owned a console (except for a N64 for a short while).
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's similar to the whole ST vs Amiga thing back in the days, but I really like both consoles. And the whole thing about games, well I don't like many games for the DS (except homebrew and Mario64 which I completed on N64), and I really like Virtua Tennis and Lumines for PSP. So right there it has two games more than the DS that I actually like and play. My g/f likes Nintendogs, but I find it annoying hearing her yell out to her dog for hours.
<br/>
<br/>
DS had stuff all games out for it when it was released (PSP was only just released recently in Australia), so there will be more games for PSP to come. And if they are all PS2 clones then good, since I've never owned one I'm quite happy about that.
<br/>
<br/>
And finally, that argument about "better off getting a PS2 and watch it on the big telly" defeats the purpose of a portable console. I like sitting on my ass staring at a little LCD screen playing games. I like seeing old computer emu's running on little handhelds, it's retro and it's cool (as far as this geek is concerned). So I will have both my DS and PSP, and I will love and care for them equally.

I'm with you on that, for the most part.

i'm still confused why soul calibur 3 is being made for the ps2...the GC version sold far better, then again that may just because link was a playable character. SC3 would be awesome on the revolution tho
<br/>

i think we might see a few fighters on the DS since the button layout seems quite good for it (much better than the GC anyway). i'm really curious as to why we haven't seen any rally games for the DS yet, cos they hit the GBA pretty quickly<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
