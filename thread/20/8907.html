If you want to capture the "old way" download the AiroPeek demo from WildPackets.com, and the approriate drivers for your card. (It supports a bunch of cards)
<br/>
Transfer the demo to your DS, and use Airopeek to "capture" the transmission. Do this several times, (I think 5 or more) and save the packet dumps each time. (Sometimes packets will get lost and not be seen by your laptop)
<br/>
<br/>
Post the packet dumps online, and wait for someone who knows what they're doing to re-assemble them into useful data. That's the only way to get them without a special capture program.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
that was what one guy said in another forum of this topic
<br/>
<br/>
hope you can capture with these instructions
<br/>
<br/>
and Good Luck!...

Using the information in this wiki article, I could most likely turn a packet dump into a functioning .nds file, now all I need is a NDS.

EDIT:
<br/>
I just relized you need a DS to capture em in the first place. just borrow a friends DS and all the homebrew equipment
<br/>
<br/>
or you can buy a DS yourself

<br/>
EDIT 2:
<br/>
You can wait till someone here captures them and sends the file to you to change into a .nds<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If your card appears on this list then you can use the WildPackets AiroPeek demo to capture these, hopefully with no troubles.
<br/>
<br/>
If your card does not appear on this list, i believe that you may still be able to capture the transmissions using ethereal and the winpcap library.
<br/>
<br/>
Once the captures have been made, post the files gained to the forum and let someone who knows how to convert handle the rest.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://downtou.ne1.net/" target="_blank">http://downtou.ne1.net/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to reiterate what swimgod was talking about... I'm currently talking to sgstair about beta'ing his demo capture program, but that's a way's away (most probably will miss vol. 1's timeframe). However... here's the better news (notice I don't say good news). I spent 4 hours at Nintendo World today trying to capture vol. 1. Here's what I ran into:
<br/>
<br/>
The bouncer is a joke. He's some 20's something kid who has a suit on and stands at the door opening it for ladies and little kids, and is friendly.
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't allowed to use my laptop in the store because of wifi concerns (I asked an employee if I could take digital pics and then check them on my laptop which were legitimate requests since I brought my digigam with me). I was told I could take the pictures and then use the laptop right outside the doors. There is no nifi signal even just on the other side of the glass. Curiously though, I could join their internal wifi network for internet browsing (proxy-locked to only nintendo.com). So I booted up the capturer on channel 1 (since I couldn't scan 1/7/13) while in the store and captured 3 demos: Brain Age, Mario Kart, and Metroid Movie (not a demo, but a movie). I have the cap files, but here's the kicker, I'm not sure that they'll even be playable since everything done's through that middle-ware program. You download a mini-program which gives you a list of all the game demos you can play. Then you download a game demo. There are lots more I didn't get like Tetris Normal, Tetris Push, and Pokemon Trozei to name a few, but if I can't get these 3 assembled, it's useless to waste my time to do the rest. Like I said, I'm not even sure I got these full ones, because eventhough I have about 20mb of capture data (after the filter), there's no way that's 15 full captures (3 downloads captured 5 times each for completion)... but we'll see after I get them assembled.
<br/>
<br/>
On the deadline note... I hope I can get this figured out by Monday, because that's when Nintendo World gets in Metroid &amp; Tetris full versions, so they might change the demo pack to vol. 2 which includes metroid demo (what the guy said). He was unsure that it'd be done this week though, so maybe we still have more time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guys, I didn't post to brag, or to get help, I posted to let you know what was in the works. I have my own webhost, with more than enough bandwidth to handle people downloading, and more importantly, I've asked on many a couple occasions how to capture and assemble captured nds demos with people telling me that they'd do it for me instead of helping me learn, so this is my chance to learn. I'm going through it with sgstair later this weekend, and we'll get what we'll get. If anybody can do it, it's him, so I'm not really worried if I can't get it myself. Just be patient... or take a trip to NYC yourself. Of course if I can't get this done by myself or with him, I'll post them for everybody else, I'm not like the guy who captured Pokepark Fishing who STILL hasn't released the demo to the public, this is just my way of learning. If all goes ahead, since I'm just across the bridge from NYC, I'll be able to get the future volumes quickly as soon as they're released. Just hang tight, or go out and capture 'em yourself... there's still a couple days left, and like I said probably more than that because they're not expecting the new volume out next week.

That's utterly retarded. Don't expect any capper to share anything until they've been paid if you're going to do it like this. ...and this is yet another reason why I'm not sharing my caps with anybody until I've learned to "assemble" these by myself.<br/>_________________<br/>-Unrequited</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And, not everyone here is able to go to NYC. Not everyone is living in America, k?...

I can't explain how it's done, because it's different every time. There is no "extract all demos from capture files" tool. I didn't succeed in making one, too. You see, there must be a reason FireFly only made capture tools but didn't give the people any assembling tool for checking if their capture was complete.

Dude, just upload the capture files and we all can try. Nobody stops you to learn with sgstair even after we extracted the demos successfully.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have a M.S. in Computer Engineering, and I wrote my thesis on traffic shaping for DDoS detection &amp; protection, so I have a little bit of experience with packet dumps and packet-level forensics. It's not for lack of academics, or being a high school script kiddie that I don't know how to assemble binaries, it's people who are unwilling to teach others I find fault with, so if you want the caps any sooner, write up a detailed guide on how to assemble cap files into a working binary. Not for me as I'm gonna get that done this weekend regardless, but for the dozens of others who have asked in this thread and others only to get the reply, "cap it and give it to somebody else to assemble". Anybody with a working card and wmb capture tools (or Ethereal and a lot of time) can do a cap of their own. You didn't spend 6 hours of your time yesterday get to/from Nintendo World and doing the caps, so please don't tell me what to do with my 6 hours of effort. That said, I'm not holding these caps hostage, I just want a chance to learn how to do this myself, so in the future I can be self-sufficient and not have to rely on anybody else for Vol. 2, etc. I don't think that's an unreasonable goal.<br/>_________________<br/>-Unrequited</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

first, unrequited isn't a kid...he's completed a 3 year+ college degree, then did another year which was basically all research, which requires alot of patience and self-control
<br/>
second, all those posts were made within 24 hours...some people aren't on the net 24/7 (even tho they might like to be) so give him some time to upload the demo's. like you, he probably has a life away from the computer as well. he said to be patient, that he wanted to learn to do it himself and he was going through it with sgstair over the weekend...as of this post, the weekend just started in the US, so give him some time and be glad someone is in the process of assembling these demos for us all<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It'd be better to have a bounty for something that DS homebrew actually needs.. like a web browser, or an actual engine that emphasizes "extreme ease-of-development" ability for those who many not know how to program. For instance, a Game Maker for the DS that supports a scripting language of some sort. 
<br/>
<br/>
It's probably not gonna happen but like I said, it'd make more sense to have a bounty on something the DS needs, rather than something the DS is going to have pretty soon if people would just be more patient and understanding with each other. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I strongly agree with you. Not only does it appear that no money has actually been donated, the page isn't very professional at all. Several spelling mistake littered throughout, his keyboard clearly has a broken shift key, and random words seem to be bolded and overlined.

At this point, it seems as if the only person who dumped demos is doing it because he wants to. If I was in the same situation, I would do the same thing. I dont think there's going to be any problem getting all of the demos that will supposedly dissappear, especially since they've already announced that the Tetris and Brain Age demos would be on the stations that are going nationwide.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't say anything about misplaced words. But since you seem so defensive over your mistakes here are some of the obvious ones:

<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Q:	Who gets the bounty?
<br/>
A:	The person who creates <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">atleast</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">at least</span> a working .nds that will run the download manager over wifi, so we can <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">beguin</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">begin</span> to figure out how send our own apps instead of <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">nintendo's</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Nintendo's</span> list of demos &amp; videos. The best way to <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">achive</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">achieve</span> this, is to capture the stuff yourself as you can guess... So far they are only <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">avalible</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">available</span> at Nintendo World Store. Good luck and good will towards homebrew!
<br/>
<br/>
Q:	Why should <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">i</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> donate to this cause?
<br/>
A:	You should donate so you can have a new way of providing homebrew to new firmware ds in a <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">afortable</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">affordable</span> range.
<br/>
<br/>
Q:	How much progress has been made?
<br/>
A:	So far, not much. <span style="text-decoration: underline">S</span>adly, only one person has captured a little piece of what is <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">avalible</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">available</span> from the kiosk.
<br/>
<br/>
Q:	Do we get the bounty for capturing the demos, but not making the .nds?
<br/>
A:	Sorry, no. <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span>t is of almost no use to us if all you do is capture the demos. Although if you shared your captures with a person that might be able to create the .nds, you can split the money between you two(or more).
<br/>
<br/>
Q:	How long is this kiosk gonna be up, till <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">its</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">it's</span> updated?
<br/>
A:	Here is the kicker..., According to people that work at the store, they <span style="text-decoration: underline">t</span>hink <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">there</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">they're</span> gonna get vol.2 of this download kiosk on the 20th(<span style="text-decoration: underline">M</span>etroid and <span style="text-decoration: underline">T</span>etris release)... That leaves very little time. Please <span style="text-decoration: underline">h</span>urry to capture. Figuring out where to go from there doesn't need to be rushed as much, luckly :).
<br/>
<br/>
Q:	I have a question, where do <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> ask it?
<br/>
A:	You can ask it in an email or on a forum(gbadev.org, or PocketHeaven.com)
<br/>
<br/>
Q:	I don't understand why you need N<span style="text-decoration: underline">i</span>ntendo world store's demos, there are already demos available...
<br/>
A:	Some of them are, and some of them are not. But <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: red">thats</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">that's</span> not the main reason the bounty exists. The bounty is to create a working .nds of the download manager application that sends the demos to the ds. With that we can begin to hack it and try to send our homebrew instead of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">N</span>intendo apps :). I think that pretty much explains everything.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Yes, someone that understands why this bounty needed to be created :D
<br/>
<br/>
personal, even if i had a early version ds i would still have made this bounty to bring cheaper homebrew methods back :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.
<br/>
i just realized while writing this,
<br/>
<br/>
people who bought a ds when it first came out,
<br/>
didn't exactly need to save up because they arleady had money to buy it.
<br/>
<br/>
but if you bought it later (like when i did)
<br/>
you had to save up to get a ds,
<br/>
meaning you are slighty poor or just didn't have the money then...
<br/>
<br/>
so what makes you think the people will have the money to buy this super expensive things to run homebrew...
<br/>
<br/>
just takes more people out of the scene...

I actually would call this a good chance for wifime2. If they really included another launcher, chances are that it might be vulnerable like the old firmware's WiFi Play or through a buffer overflow.

Thats assuming that nintendo has no additional RSA checking, aside from the one used to download the loader to the DS in the first place.   Nintendo could just as easily have an RSA check in this loader as well,  and not only that, they could actually use a different private key for this loader, to prevent any of the captured demos from running on the DS as is.  (except for the one in a gazillion chance that the signature somehow validates on the built in DS public key.)

Regardless, finding out might actually involve reverse engineering this loader.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't seen any captures posted anywhere, and my last request for them went without reply. If they were released and I just never saw them, a link would be appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise I'm not as concerned about assisting with their assembly, since Firefly seems to be helping them and he's probably already modified his tools to handle the new captures.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

BIG Thank you to FireFly for helping me assemble these, we're working on the other two demos (Mario Kart DS &amp; Metroid Movie) right now. Hopefully they'll be up later today. The loader gets compressed versions of the demos, which the loader decompresses, and then runs. After FireFly got the decompresser isolated, it was just a matter of getting a full capture of the demo, which I had and him having to piece it together. I'm on a business trip the rest of the week, but afterwhich, if nobody's gotten the other 5 demos, then I'll be more than happy to go back to NYC or a Best Buy and get the rest for FireFly to reassemble.

Yes. I always edit the .nds file so that it has the correct icon and text. If I would not do this then almost every demo would show up as "Nintendo DS Demonstration" with a question mark icon.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. Broadcast DS Download Station to an unmodified DS, because the DS Download Station would pass the RSA signature check

Of course he mentioned that he's the capturer, if anyone else can capture them and send them to [firefly], progress can be made while hes still gone!
<br/>
<br/>
but also the "rest of the week" pretty much ends either today or tomorrow. So we'll see some progress nevertheless
<br/>
<br/>
thanks guys! Brain age is pretty good! looking foward to True Swing Golf the most, but I also can't wait for the rest!!!

<br/>
And will you two be planning on (attempting) to get the other demo's [volume 2, 3 and so forth] of the kiosk demo's? Hopeing that they don't protect them.
<br/>
But if they do, we can probably find a way around it.... hmm...?<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't lnow if WiFi is stable enough yet, but a packet capture app that'd write to CF would be cool. Hey- you don't even need DS Linux, once Stephen gets his WiFi libs all straightened out.  Either of those would be the best. You'd be totally inconspicuous, have no laptop to lug around, and get (theoretically) better captures since you'd be closer. The only downside is that you'd need two DS's, or just wait until somebody starts to download. Using the latter method you could browse the videogame aisle for a while with the DS in your pocket, and see what you come up with at the end.<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>dualscreenman wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What about Gaim DS?

but we really need a ds that can packet capture on the go :P

it Does need to be in a bigger program too :D

and your right,
<br/>
DsLinux is a great place for it :P

if not moonshell,
<br/>
why moonshell?
<br/>
well moonshell has kinda a graphic interface,
<br/>
and you can put little marks to indacate if you started a download or something :P

<br/>
anyway,

we REALLY need a portable packet capture with moonshell or dslinux,

that would be great :P

When you dump a game, make sure you disable flashme if you have it installed and instead use a passkey. I hope this helps as I'd love to see all this stuff working... now... back to Brain Age.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm gonna uninstall flashme now and install the new firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
edit: Just downloaded and installed hte new firmware - I'm dumping a copy of my metroid card w/ flashme still installed just to test it out to be sure I don't have to go and reflash everything.
<br/>
<br/>
I go to work in an hour or so, so providing all goes as planned, I'll have the demo tonight posted here at about 9:40pm eastern

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">* if mods think this is inappropriate content, please delete, thanks *
<br/>
<br/>
P.S: Backup your cf/sd media card before hand.  Since I havn't tried it out yet, I can't gurantee it's not a trojan.  Be careful.  If you have flashme, you should be protected as long as you don't short SL1. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
* EDIT: oops, this download is probably same as the one posted by achilles97206 above. here are some instructions on how to use it though
<br/>
<br/>
I saw this the other day, havn't gotten a chance to try it out.  Supposedly work with M3-SD as well.  Go to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gbalpha.com/China/gbalpha_download/Soft_Show.asp?SoftID=2273" target="_blank">this page</a>.  Right under the big HTML table, there is some red lettering to the right of "ONLINE" icon.  Look below the ONLINE icon, and you will see "┊ 本地下载 ┊ ", click on that to download.  The instructions goes something like:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Put dumper.nds onto your G6/M3, select it in the Game category to run
<br/>
2. Press SELECT and make sure the DS game card is inserted.  Press A to start
<br/>
3. Before it finish backup, the program will ask you to insert the game card again.  If you have pass me, remove pass me and insert the cart directly.  If you have Flash Me, just pop the card out and reinsert
<br/>
4. Press A to confirm, and the backup is complete.
<br/>
5. You should fine the game in a folder (?) called CleanRomDump.  It conforms to clean dump format.  Usable on all flash cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:
<br/>
- usable on G6/M3-CF/M3-SD. G6, M3-CF is the fastest.  Needs to calculate CRC when writing to SD, so it's slower.
<br/>
- You must use update 18+ for M3 to read the data correctly.  And firmware 3.23+ on G6
<br/>
- You have to format your media in FAT format
<br/>
- Make sure you have enough power during backup.  Might want to plug the charger into DS.  Do not turn off before backup completes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah it's the same tool that came with E18.
<br/>
<br/>
My dump of the MPH Demo card w/ just flashme (not using the passme) didnt work, it just froze up.. So I uninstalled  flashme and am trying again, this time actually following the instructions :)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: Are the dumps supposed to not load when you try to run the NDS?
<br/>
Both times I dumped the metroid card it'd just flicker the screen and lock up -- running it through the m3 game manager crashes the program.
<br/>
<br/>
Opening the file in  wordpad shows the header as FIRST HUNT etc... so It seems to have captured properly, it just.. wont load?

Yeah, you have to run the clean dumps through M3's game manager to patch it first to work.  You have to get the GM that matches your update E18 though.  Have you tried GM 3.14 (<a class="postlink" href="http://m3wiki.emuparadise.org/index.php/M3_software" target="_blank">here</a>)?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">interesting :D,
<br/>
well thats good news,
<br/>
(i tested it in ensata(nintendo's offical emulator) and it didn't work &gt;.&lt;;, but then again its just an emulator...)
<br/>
<br/>
i need to try it out when i get a chance :D,
<br/>
im getting a supercard CF soon :P,
<br/>
once that gets here i will be able to get it working on my ds :)...
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.,
<br/>
if you have the equpment it would be a VERY good thing if you could 
<br/>
capture the traffic of downloading to your GF's ds :),
<br/>
because there will be 0 noise from other downloading ds's
<br/>
and we can put all the download demo's up :) 
<br/>
<br/>

<span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal">Thanks</span>
<br/>
