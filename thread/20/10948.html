    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I heard there was a way to do online Mario Kart races with 150cc speed instead of the usual 100cc.  Does anyone know about this?  I want to increase EVERYONE'S speed, not just mine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Faster karts would just amplify lag issues. Do you want it because you think snaking will be more difficult at 150cc or something?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, racing at 150cc is a lot more fun than racing at 100cc.

In racing games, a general rule is that faster == better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have played the crap out of Mario Kart and I would welcome the new challenge.  If its not figured out yet, someone should definately do it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know I've heard that it's been done, but I can't find out any way to make it happen.  I don't think I heard about too much lag as a result either.  If you listen to Nintendo they'll tell you that those offline boards are unsuitable for online play, but they work just fine.  So I'm not buying the whole "Increased speed will cause lag" issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so who knows how to do it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the most possible way for this to happen would probably be Tunneling the wireless LAN, that is, assuming you can choose 150CC on multi-card multiplayer (I've never done it &gt;_&gt;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
