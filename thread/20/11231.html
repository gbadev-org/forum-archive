Since these games are usually transmitted by wifi they must not need the storage space of a DS card and no DS games use GBA ROM so it doesn't matter that the GBAMP lacks this.  I'm not complaining these games are great fun I'm just curious from a technical standpoint.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.thrivepresents.com" target="_blank">www.thrivepresents.com</a>

Sorry to drag this off topic but DS-Scene does not need more members at all. Especially ones like yourself so feel free to not sign into the site and your account will be deleted in 90 days.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact you used an email address that no longer exists is just sad i am afraid and by no means is clever as you make out.
<br/>
<br/>
I stated in my first post you needed to register and if you didn't want to then you could have not bothered which would have saved DS-Scene more bandwith (the reason for restricting to members only in the first place).
<br/>
<br/>
You could have made yourself look good by uploading to rapidshare without flaming my site but instead you now look like a fool.

I see how you feel...but...you have no right to complain, nor do the owners of the site (i'm not sure of yoru affiliation with them).  It's there fault that they don't implent e-mail verification, and it's their fault that they offer downloads.  If they dotn' want people doing that, offer the downloads without having to regester.  If they dont' want people over-leeching...don't offer the downloads at all!  They are pretty much asking for that sort of situation &gt;_&gt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And yet, when it comes to hosting files, its still hard to find a nice solution.
<br/>
GooglePages lets you host a files publicly for 10MB or less, but thats it.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone needs to invent a "FILE TO VIDEO" encoder :p So you can abuse video sites for hosting files.
<br/>
Then you could have a convient link for members of the forum, and a "external host" link for guests/lerkers.

I'm sorry but if you are trying to run a successful website that people visit, surely pasting links to it all over the internet would encourage more traffic, thus giving you a popular website. The link itself goes to a page on your site, not directly to a file, so people will know where they got the file from, and perhaps have a good look around your site. complaining about people posting links to your site os counter productive, you fill find yourself with less visitors.

Only GoogleVideo, Stage6...or youTube, for that mater, dont actualy put adverts in front of videos.

(the first two dont even have averts around them)

Frankly, YouTube is getting quite behind technology. Its small, and video low quality.
<br/>
But the others...I havnt a clue where they get their bandwidth from. 
<br/>
Divx and Google are big companys...but letting people upload gigabytes, and then letting anynumber of people watch them is just <span style="font-style: italic">insane.</span>

Bandwidth and space is become less of an issue, and Im just supprised there isnt, well, <span style="font-style: italic">"less crap"</span> versions of RapidShare and the like.

Anyway, Im sure it wouldnt be too hard to make a datastream into a video format.  Has to be durable enough to withstand compresion, but its still probably possible ;)

as I said, every other demos available at <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.akkit.org/Downloadable_DS_Demos" target="_blank">sgstair's wiki page</a> are broadcasted perfectly, but vol. 2 and 3 aren't. Vol 2 and 3 work flawlessly on my M3 though. Any idea why?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok my mistake.
<br/>
I'm using wmbfront, and for an unknown reason, if a demo is somewhere out of /data, it invents a folder with the name of the rom.
<br/>
<br/>
Example: E:\dsapp\data\DS Download Station Volume 2\Individual ROMs\A3XEclip.nds\A3XEclip.nds
<br/>
[edit]but if two or more demos are loaded together, the bug does not happen anymore[/edit]

alas I do not know who the author is, and if he is still in activity.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually I'm the author of WMBFront, which is a front end for WMB. I havn't looked at the source in a long time, but someone else did mention a similar bug a long time ago and I thought I fixed it. Just make sure your using version 1.3 from my site to make sure you have the latest one.
<br/>
<br/>
If so, I may be bothered if I find some spare time to fix it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
