I basically want to reduce the size of the GBAMP sticking out atleast a bit (mainly in preperation for DS lite - I don't want that sticking out that much more!)

<br/>
<br/>
how about putting the GBAMP into a translucent case (GBC case), trim the things so it fits in the GBA slot in DS, and adding an LED

<br/>
that would atleast make it look cooler

I managed to unscrew that screw in the back with a needlenose pliers, although it tooks some effort.  From there, just push the front side of the cartridge (the side with the label) down, towards the metal contacts, and it should slide off.  I found this out the hard way.  I tried pulling the front and back apart at the opening at the bottom.  When it didn't pop out, I used the pliers to force it open.  It's not a big deal really, since the game refused to boot correctly and I had already given up all hope of retrieving the saves from it.  But it still would have been nice to know that I didn't have to mutliate the cartridge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know it slides because so do GBA cartridges, and i opened my minish cap :)

Sadly I don't have needle pliers, and i've already tried my smallest pliers which I do have (too big).

Any other suggestions to get that screw out?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you can arrange a way to keep the ends of a paperclip very close together, you might be able to use that.  The diameter of the end of a paperclip is small enough to fit in each of those small 6 holes.  I didn't get this to work myself, but it's worth a shot.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I tried the same sliding technique on my GBA flash cart, but I couldn't get it to work too well.  I accidentally ended up forcing that apart somewhat, so right now I've got a flash cart with 1 broken latch... the other side is still intact, so unless I purposely pull the two sides apart, I'm fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, if you don't mind frying the chips inside, heating the screw with a soldering iron makes it really easy to turn.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
