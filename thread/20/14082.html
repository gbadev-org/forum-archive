    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would be really cool if TI Linux Emulator (TILeM) was ported to the DS, since it supports all of the calculators.  I would like to emulate my TI-84 Plus Silver on my DS (for a good excuse to take my DS to school :).
<br/>
<br/>
Either that, or a native graphing calculator program for the DS that made full use of the hardware (color screen, full graphs, more digit precision on decimal calculations, touch controls, etc) would be really cool.  I tried making a graphing app but didn't know where to start and couldn't get it to plot individual pixels right.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

A native app would be better, but this seems to work for the moment. Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried using PAlib, but a custom interface would be better, yet I don't know where to begin in libnds, and the PA drawing functions weren't working, I'll try again sometime, also it would be hard to implement an exec() function workalike to take a string and figure out the expression in it and evaluate it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
