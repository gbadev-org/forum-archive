it's not a flash card, but it seem a nice little addon for our DS... (through I see the advantage of 3time smaller dpg video and only using a 5$ flashcard...)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I noticed that in darker areas of video blocks of grainy dots would appear regardless of the resolution or bit rate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If your going to have such low battery life, you might as well buy a PSP.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've just got one and I have to admit it's actually not too bad, the quality is pretty good (I'd even say better than DPG) and it's nice not to have to spend hours converting everything.  
<br/>
<br/>
It played everything that I threw at it, including FLAC files and like other people have said, you've also got to give it props for not supporting piracy.
<br/>
<br/>
From a technical standpoint, it's quite interesting.  I guess it works something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Video/music data is loaded onto Media decoder chip, gets converted to a DS framebuffer friendly format and buffered on the 32MB chip inside.  This then gets squirted down the SPI bus to be displayed on the screens.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm more interested in seeing if the hardware inside the cart is reprogrammable and whether it's possible to write to the RAM on the cart<br/>_________________<br/></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
