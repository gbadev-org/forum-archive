    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just wondering, has anyone tried swapping the casing on the opera memory expansion with the one that came with their DS Lites at all? I want to try it out as I've got a black DS Lite and I don't really want a clear game pak in there.

<br/>
It looks like it's only secured by a middle screw but I'm not sure if there are any complications that might come up, has anyone ever taken apart a memory expansion cartridge?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Opera is a commercial slot-1 (like any random DS game) and it comes with the memory expansion (and is required). If one were to pirate the slot-1 they'd still need the slot-2 half. There are alternatives, but I'm not going to talk about them because discussing pirates is agaisn't the rules of the forums.

What tepples means by 'Which country?' is that there is a choice of a phat version of the browser in the European release. I believe the US release doesn't have a phat version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Seriously, my DS is from '04, that's not terribly long ago as to be "Unsupported"...but indeed it is.  And I don't want to buy a Lite (almost exact same hardware, with exact same specs except brighter screens and a small form factor) just to use it.
<br/>
<br/>
They should have released the Opera pack just for Phat, seeing that Phat (regular GBA cart sized) packs work in Lite DS, but not the other way around, or they could have given a Lite sized circuit board and a Lite and Phat case that you could choose from.
<br/>
<br/>
Or, I guess I could always use this as an excuse to get a Slot-2 homebrew card with extra RAM :P but I doubt that'd happen.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Fits in there perfect and doesn't have the slight bump on the one side that the standard EZ cart did.

Only thing is, I had to sacrifice the rumble pack motor which is fine since I hate things that rumble and have never used it. So technically I now have a "2 in 1". ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Shaking the DS sounds like the most useful option there.

This EZ 3 in 1 thing, do I buy it to replace by Opera ram? Is the RAM detected like the Opera ram or is it more like supercard?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I wouldn't call it more like supercard, but since the hardware is different, the memory addresses are different. So it wouldn't work as Opera RAM unless you could change some memory values whilst running your Opera cart...
