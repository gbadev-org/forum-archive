    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well ScummVM was made before (for platforms other than DS) by very clever people, and is open source.
<br/>
<br/>
Do the sierra games have something similar?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://freesci.linuxgames.com/" target="_blank">FreeSCI</a> exists and is GPLd, and already has a GP32 port, but I don't think it's under particularly active development at the moment. I have no idea whether it'd be feasible to port it to the DS, either.
<br/>
<br/>
(Wow, the FreeSCI site <a class="postlink" href="http://freesci.linuxgames.com/?page=faq#entry-WherecanIdownloadit?" target="_blank">refers to Debian Woody as testing</a>. Debian Woody is old oldstable - current stable is Etch, previous stable was Sarge, and stable before that was Woody.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey are you interested in making a SCI interpretter for DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I saw an AGI/SCI interpretter for the Gameboy Advance I betit can be ported to DS.
<br/>
<br/>
 I'd like the touch screen to be a virtual keyboard... hit me up. Or added Pictures for certain interactions. Maybe its possible to add commands to AGI/SCI games or mods. Then you could use both screens for certain scenes. Or maybe take full advantage of the screen.
