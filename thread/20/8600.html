<br/>
<br/>
The Nintendo DS web browser (powered by Opera) will be shipping in Japan with an RAM expansion card that slips into the unused GBA slot. This will help to make your time spent on the web a lot smoother. CVG talked with Nintendo to discuss if the RAM expansion will be used to help out DS games in general?
<br/>
<br/>
We asked Nintendo whether we can expect to see DS titles utilising this additional RAM in the future but were told no plans are currently in place.
<br/>
<br/>
As was mentioned earlier, there is no official release date for the web browser anywhere outside Japan, but Uk?ers and Americans alike are keeping their fingers crossed in the hopes that something will be confirmed soon.

That's why you use an M3 or SuperCard. It has the 32 MB RAM expansion (although no byte writes) and the CF interface.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Is the M3's RAM expansion limited to the GBA port's limitation? Wouldn't Nintendo's add-on have the same limitation? If so, I really don't see why it would matter much anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
But since the DS card encryption has been cracked, actual DS flash cards could probably be made, so needs for GBA flash carts would probably be in the past.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

nice one! :)
<br/>
<br/>
but uhm.... I heard some rumors that there will be a GBA expansion cartridge so you can update download things to it...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Oh .. I found another thing :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As details trickle in as to the full extent of Nintendo's browser plans for its increasingly-essential DS portable, fresh information on the technology underpinning the Internet software is starting to trickle out.
<br/>
<br/>
To enable a smooth web experience, the DS will receive a RAM upgrade, via the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot. The add-on will be bundled with the Opera browser DS cart, the whole package costing just a shade under 20 quid in Japan. No US or European announcement regarding the surfing software has yet surfaced, though something is expected within the next fortnight.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo has not disclosed how beefy the injection of RAM will be for the DS, nor has it opted to comment on possible future applications for the memory upgrade. Speculation is rife the the DS will follow in the footsteps of the Nintendo 64, which successfully deployed a RAM upgrade used in games including Perfect Dark, Zelda: Majora's Mask, Turok 2 and Banjo Tooie, though Nintendo declined to comment on the possibility at time of press.

There's a difference between changing a few lines (skip WMB signature check) and adding completely new functionality, like replacing pictochat with a UDP/IP based version. I think the point MaHe was making, is that you'd need pretty much the original source to add a download function.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

You need to talk to some ROM hackers. It's amazing the things people can do with only a precompiled binary if they just take the time to learn how it works. Hell, the amount of new features people have added to Super Mario World alone is crazy. Ability to play other games' music and simple MP3s, new compression formats, removal of nearly all restrictions of the original programming, customized objects and enemies, new powerups, you name it. A lot of games have also had variable-width fonts added. Heck, I myself am working on a Pok?mon Silver hack with, already implemented and working:
<br/>
<br/>
-Debug and music select menus
<br/>
-Added game stats such as number of steps taken
<br/>
-Ability to use the GBC's features (tile flip/priority, added RAM, double CPU speed)
<br/>
-More map tiles (normally you have 127 different 32x32 tiles, each composed of any of 60 different 8x8 tiles, to build maps with; I've increased it to 255 32x32 tiles composed of 256 different 8x8 tiles)
<br/>
<br/>
And more new features in the works. (Map compression is almost working.) It's really not that difficult, once you learn how the game is programmed. Most of my code just uses what's already there. :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But with that level of hacking, why not develop a new game engine from the ground up to bootstrap the code away from Nintendo's copyrighted codebase, as was done during the early stages of the <a class="postlink" href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/about.html" target="_blank">LAME project</a>?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
