    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
My idea was to use a data Directory for all homebrew that needs extra data on the SD/CF. So far as I know homebrew can't detect from which folder it has been started and that is why every data folder has to be in the root of your SD/CF. But why doesn't all homebrew use something familiar with Documents and Settings in Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
/data/DSOrganize/ instead of /DSOrganizeand 
<br/>
/data/MoonShell instead of /shell
<br/>
/data/NDSMail/ instead of having config files in root
<br/>
/data/linux instead of /linus
<br/>
etc. etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try and post this everywhere I can please support I think this makes some things a little bit easier and nicer to look at.
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great idea!
<br/>
Id love to see less duplication about the place and shareing resources too.
<br/>
<br/>
eg.
<br/>
Moonshell already has plugins for media formats....wouldnt it be great for other things (DSorganiser) to use the same files ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A predictable directory structure would help make this possible.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, it'd be kinda nice if every app didn't need stuff in root and could share common code/resources. The big problem is how do you agree on a directory structure? For example, I'd like all my images in \Image, but maybe others want them in \Pictures or something.
<br/>
<br/>
What might be done is to have all programs use one config.ini or something in the root telling them where to store their data and where things like other apps can be found. Heck, you could have them store all their settings here, but I'd worry that one glitch (which seems to be common enough when writing to memory cards) could wipe out the file.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In my opinion, I think it would be best to have the program's "home" directory be the directory of the .nds file.  This way you can rename (the home folder) "DSOrganize" or "DSO" or something.  The program's root directory would somehow be passed to the program when booting so it knows where to look.  And of course, you would want linking so that you could put all your executables in a single directory; maybe a special .nds template that boots another .nds?
<br/>
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">/
<br/>
/_BOOT_MP.nds       (link -&gt; /dsorganize.nds)
<br/>
/dsorganize.nds     (link -&gt; /dso/dsorganize.nds)
<br/>
/moonshell.nds      (link -&gt; /mshell/moonshell.nds)
<br/>
/dso/
<br/>
/dso/dsorganize.nds
<br/>
/dso/dsorganize/[system files and directories]
<br/>
/mshell/
<br/>
/mshell/moonshell.nds
<br/>
/mshell/shell/[system files and directories]
<br/>
...
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and so on for all your applications.
<br/>
<br/>
The home directory for programs would be similar to Linux (where "~/" is home).  The default directory would be home, too, of course.  The only problem with this that I see is if the programs normally access the root directory themselves instead of using relative paths: the programs would have to be modified to use the tilde-slash instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good one. I suggest an additional directory named
<br/>
<br/>
/data/settings
<br/>
<br/>
which contains settings files for all applications. That's the way the Mac does it (there, it's ~/Library/Preferences). DSOrganize's settings file would be called /data/settings/DSOrganize.whatever, for example.
<br/>
<br/>
Makes separation of read-only and user-modifiable content much easier.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

well the project name folders wouldn't be in Spanish, because they don't have special Spanish names

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please, let's stick to standardized (English) filesystem names, otherwise writing programs to use them will become a nightmare. Apple handles it this way. They present internationalized names in the file manager ("Bibliothek" instead of "Library", for example), which is trivial to implement if there is a clean filesystem standard.

I think we should clearly write the preposed systems down logicaly, weigh the pro's and cons.

a folder named /data/settings to store configuration in (preferably in a common format, as Mrshlee suggested -- XML?)

keeping simple .nds applications wherever

keeping .nds applications inside a folder with the .app extension, like on MacOS X, if they require read-only resources stored in the file system. Those would be bundled inside the same app folder.
