    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've searched around a bit, and found quite a bit of complicated looking code and stuff (for me, anyway), but haven't found (if it exists) a way to fix my f'd up touchscreen calibration.  I've got a v7 flashme'd ds lite with an ezflash IV for my homebrew.  my calibration is messed up with all my commercial games as well as homebrew and commercial backups.  any programs or different firmware that will let me calibrate my ds correctly?

thanks in advance for any info :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think there's no such tool available in the homebrew scene. It would be nice though, wouldn't it? Anyway, the best way to fix this is to simply REFLASH your hardware. I used the one from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.monroeworld.com/ds/hacking/files.php#hardware" target="_blank">MonroeWorld</a> and it calibrates just fine.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hmmm... reflashmeing doesn't work, and I have no idea how I could have damaged my touchscreen... I used my DSHeavy way way harder and the calibration was fine... oh well, guess I'll have to go wal-mart another one.  sucks because I gotta order a passthrough device, used a friend's last time.
<br/>
one last question, any recommendations for a cheap passthrough device that I only need to flash my firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the replies so far :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Try this: Go to the calibration tool (the built in one) and select inside the first two boxes, and in the middle of the third one (the one that jumps to the middle just before the calibration is complete. Yes, the DSLite only uses three points, it\'s supposed to.) If your calibration is successfully wonky, but you find that you can get to the outter areas now, you are in the same boat as me. Apparently, the DSLite likes to cut off the edges of the screen just a bit when you calibrate it correctly. It would be nice if a tool would ask you to press in the absolute corners a couple of times and calibrate from there, but I dont know if such a tool exists.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?
