<br/>
 You have made innovations using the Nintendo D(eveloper's) S(ystem) and I am a fan of all you. However, I do not have the knowledge to make programs or codes but I have some ideas that if they be accomplished then people will face more attention to our fantastic handheld system.
<br/>
 So, with your permission I will post today and other days some of my ideas that came across to my mind and maybe yours, too. I hope not to open threads that already exist. Comparing your abilities are so strong as ones of some developers in the gaming industry.

 Fans of Nintendo are pleased that their wish of connecting a Official Nintendo! High-Quality Camera to their DS is a reality but I think they want something more... One great application could be a photo program that will allow photos to be stored from the camera to a Slot-1 Flashcart. Really, I do not know how difficult or easy it could be: I just saying my idea.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
