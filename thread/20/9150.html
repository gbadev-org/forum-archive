<br/>
<br/>
the _RAW.zip is the raw dump direct from the card
<br/>
the _M3.zip is the untrimmed M3 SD bootable version run through the 3.14 game manager.
<br/>
<br/>
Rom size is 16mb.

figured it needs to get out there, and as they ARE demos, it's no different than capturing the demos from Wifi... at least this way it provides a way to do it yourself.

you can't run the station...

altho if you have something that can run roms,

then you can use a regular ds to download the demo's :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

It's still pretty interesting, but I'm not sure if a system without Flashme could download the demos you would send with it though...I seem to remember something about games that send stuff via WMB relying on the encrypted secure area somehow (presumably something to do with the RSA stuff), and if it's unencrypted as a ROM dump would be...
<br/>
<br/>
I could be totally wrong though.  I kinda wish that I'm wrong as it would be cool to be able to send some of this stuff to others.  Don't have a way to test this information myself, so like I said it could be off.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For that batch you need the program called in the batch, 'attachsign'....although, someone might be able to do it manually as the 
<br/>
sgn file is there.  Must be that has something to do with the RSA signing.  
<br/>
<br/>
I learn new stuff every day. :)  I wouldn't get too worked up yet though, I think I've seen this in the filesystems of other games as well (the SGN file), so if it was that easy someone would probably have done it by now.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Or not...I just went poking around and can't find where I thought I saw this.  I'm too tired to look anymore. :P  I'm probably just missing the one game that has it or something.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by The 9th Sage on Fri Apr 07, 2006 4:53 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
I have an M3 SD

So I did the RAW capture, copied that to my computer, zipped it and uploaded it.
<br/>
<br/>
I then took the RAW capture, used the m3 3.1.4 game manager, and did a NO TRIM 1x transfer, and it loads perfectly fine and sends demos, on my M3SD.
<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, It works for me, the raw version SHOULD be patchable to whatever you use, if not; then I'm at a loss, as it works fine for me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's why i zipped the m3 version too, so people could use a 'patched' verison if you have an m3 sd.

Perhaps if someone figured out how to do that, chism would be more willing.

i was so stupid just trying flashme with it too but it failed :-/
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think there are two test:
<br/>
<br/>
first test is after sending the rom this causes the DS to automatically shut down (the ds is still in the download software) then before starting the demo there is another test which i think is a test of the demo (i bet RSA) this causes DS to turn 2 white screens and show the nintendo logo
<br/>
<br/>
(i am just writing down what happens, this all could be crap i dont know i'm a complete noob on ds ...)
<br/>
<br/>
I tried my best but I'm just too noob to get anything to work so good luck other guys maybe somebody will be more successfull!! I hope so for everybody.

What I managed to get to work was:
<br/>
(I extracted everything with ndstool)
<br/>
in data/ds_demo/ you can rename the files switch around it will load them no problem you can put in other files it will transfer but not load them...so thats kind of how far i got...easiest file to exchange is ANDEdemo = Brain Training!<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware:

<br/>
<br/>
Step By Step
<br/>
<br/>
1. Download the latest EFA software from <a href="http://www.efa.cc" target="_blank">www.efa.cc</a>
<br/>
2. Download the raw dump of the Download Station
<br/>
3. Extracted It
<br/>
4. Run the EFA client software
<br/>
5. Clicked Search then Format Card
<br/>
6. Checked the NDS Loader checkbox
<br/>
7. Clicked The Add ROM button
<br/>
8. Browsed to the Download Station File ( A7AE01.NDS ) and Clicked Open once I selected the file
<br/>
9. Clicked Write ROM button to upload the file to the DS
<br/>
10. Turned on my DS
<br/>
11. Selected the DDS_VOL1_US option
<br/>
12. Beheld the glory of it working
<br/>
<br/>
Simple as that...I just use the file as is...no patching...unless the EFA Client does something to it...
<br/>
<br/>
It may be worth pointing out that I use PassMe 1</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now THAT is interesting...I guess that means the compressed demos are exempt from that problem.  I'd think then other signed demos could possibly be inserted (after being compressed) and be downloaded normally...hm...actually, if the SRL demo kiosk downloader in the ROM is being affected by the lack of a secure area in the ROM, and we know the NDS version of it released is properly signed, what happens if you insert the NDS in place of the SRL in the ROM?  The file format should be interchangable at least.

Also, I don't know if this matters at all, as I see newer systems are downloading w/o flashed:
<br/>
<br/>
I brought my DS into work today again, and ran MY version of the download station - we have TWO launch ds' that are for our instore kiosk, obviously unflashed. They are I believe firmware ONE.
<br/>
<br/>
What I had them do was download the ds download station 'browser' (the one that was released independantly, that LOOKS for demos to download) -- then quickly shut off the ds download station, I then booted MINE (the one I captured) and was able to successfully serve demos to the two unflashed v1 ds'es.
<br/>
<br/>
The only catch was they had to have that loader from the original DSDownload Station, but the demos ran fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I then shut the two kiosk DS'es off, and tried serving the download browser via my ds, they locked up as all non flashed ds'es do when downloading from a rom, at the nintendo logo.

Yeah, I tried sending the Polarium demo through WMB and the loader didn't find it. So it's not just an alternate Download Play interface.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and to those asking for a version that can run through WMB: The ROM is 16MB. The DS has 4MB of memory. Not gonna happen!
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I noticed some interesting text strings in the ARM9 binary:
<br/>
"Please connect power adapter" - now how would it know if the adapter is connected? Or does it just show this when the battery is low?
<br/>
"AVPT" - a few instances of this appear, always aligned to a 4-byte boundary. The first time I found something like this - "MIO0" in an N64 game - it turned out to be a compression format. The second time - "TKMK" - it also turned out to be a compression format. This is the third time. Anyone want to guess what it is? ;-)
<br/>
4E 49 4E 54 04 00 00 08 45 4E 44 4F 10 40 2D E9 - in ASCII, this is "NINT....ENDO....". "NINT....EN DOi" also appears in ds_demo_client.srl. In fact this file seems to contain a lot of garbled text. (Compressed maybe?)
<br/>
<br/>
Also the text "sgn" doesn't appear in either binary, which suggests that it doesn't read that .sgn file at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, it's definitely using one of the LZ01X algorithms. And the only one that comes as close to the original file size is the LZ01X-999 algorithm... I'll wait and see what Chism comes up with.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.ndscene.net" target="_blank">http://www.ndscene.net</a>

<br/>
let me simplify tepples words :P,
<br/>
buffer overflow,
<br/>
basicly means (in this case)
<br/>
if the ds can't create a rsa signiture because the filesize is to BIG,
<br/>
for it to handle...,
<br/>
<br/>
if this happens,
<br/>
it May cause it to forget about the rsa signiture and just run the code...
<br/>
which would be a VERY good thing :D
<br/>
(IE OverflowME)
<br/>
<br/>
(of course it could always just not run the code..., but i don't think nintendo would make it do that :P...)

(P.S., tepples you should add that to your posible homebrew running list :D)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, random idea here... Isn't there like potentially 64 bytes unused in the browser's header (if we were to remove the logo and description, if you can even do that without affecting the signature)? That's probably enough for a Wifime-like hack that would just patch a byte or two and then jump to the real entry point, and one patched byte (or 2 or 4, it all takes the same amount of code) would probably be enough to kill the RSA check. It still wouldn't work on FW4+, but it's something.
<br/>
<br/>
Swimgod, replacing the save chip won't do any good, but it's always possible that some game won't check the size of some data being read from its save file, which could cause a buffer overflow. BTW, Wikipedia probably has info describing just what a buffer overflow is (it's not just a convenient "oh that file's really big I'm not going to bother checking its signature" bug). I'd link to it but the site seems to be down. O_o</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

there not in there, they are in the demo's menu,

Did you try compressing a demo?  Something that is RSA signed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I heard the dumper dumps games wrong sometimes. Any fix for that? Any other dumper that is working on M3? And why did the dumper disappear from M3's site? Because of this error? Will it be updated? Does anyone know?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It apparently only works right if you are booting from a PassMe of some sort.  (it seems like people who have gotten it working have used PassMe to get it working from what I've heard)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No.  Only wireless devices with rt2500 chipsets work.  I don't think there is a driver for OSX yet, there is a linux driver that may be usable some way.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just realised something. What about compressing WiFiME (RSA signed)?
<br/>
Sure, it wouldn't work on the new DS, but this at least means WiFiME on the go - in case you want to flash your friends NDS ...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hasn't had this idea ! :) I'm going to try ...
<br/>
<br/>
But wait ... Wifime isn't a NDS file ... It contains arm9.bin, arm7.bin and header.bin that can be turn (I think) into a NDS file, but what about rsa.bin and beacons.bin ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
