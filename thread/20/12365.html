Thanks a lot.
<br/>

Sorry, I`m very new to this, so I don`t know how that patching actually works. Where can I get that R4 DLDI driver? Is it the one in that topic you posted?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I need some help again. I`m trying to patch nethack.nds with a r4 patch and the dldi patcher, but it says: ""Trying "r4tf.dldi" nethackds.nds does not have a DLDI section." I have the original ds-nethack and the version found from that topic flyfishing posted. I don`t know what I`m doing wrong. I have the patcher, the R4 patch, original ds-nethack and the new version in the same directory. The new version is in some strange 7Z-file format (nethackds.nds.7Z). I also tried to remove the .7Z from it so it would be .nds but it didn`t help. I have tried to patch them all: original nethackds.nds, nethackds.nds.7Z and the renamed nethackds.nds but I can`t make it work.
<br/>
<br/>
Help is highly appriciated. Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Edit: Oh, I`m stupid! It was the 7z that had to be unzipped. I just didn`t know there was such file format. Now it`s patched. Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
