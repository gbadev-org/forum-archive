    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">If you want to use the official Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector as a standard SoftAP or put it into Infrastructure or Ad-Hoc modes, then you can download the drivers from here: <a href="http://users.on.net/~kabeyas/nin_wifi.rar" target="_blank">http://users.on.net/~kabeyas/nin_wifi.rar</a>
<br/>
Before you continue, make sure you have removed the Nintendo software and drivers as they will no longer be needed. 
<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Drivers folder of my RAR file, you will find modified Buffalo drivers. Install these drivers for the USB Connector. Then download the ASUS software from here: <a href="http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip" target="_blank">http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip</a> and install that. When it prompts you to restart, select No. I have found that there is no need to. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now from the RAR file I made, extract the six EXE files in the into the ASUS folder (default: C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities). Make sure you overwrite the existing files. Then click Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; ASUS Utility -&gt; WLAN Card -&gt; ASUS WLAN Control Center. You will get a dialog asking if you want to use the Windows configuration utility or the ASUS one, select the option that uses ASUS one and disables the Windows one. Then there will be a wizard. Click Cancel to close the wizard. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now copy the file "C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities\Driver\WinXP\AP\rt2500usb.sys" to "C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers". Make sure you overwrite the existing file. Right-click on the ASUS software icon in the System Tray (bottom-right corner of screen) and select Wireless Settings. When the settings dialog opens, on the left select Config, then go to the SoftAP tab, and select Soft AP Mode. Then un-tick the Enable ICS checkbox. Then on the left click Apply. You will get a message box asking if you really want to change to SoftAP mode, click Yes. A message will come up saying something like "add the adapter to the network bridge", just ignore it and click OK. If all has gone well, there will be no error messages. Now close the ASUS Wireless Config utility or it will start conflicting when we manually set ICS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now go to Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections (this may have opened automatically opened up when you Applied the SoftAP settings). Right-click on the Network Adapter you are currently accessing your Internet through and open the properties for that connection. Go to the Advanced tab, and click "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". Then click OK. If you get an error message saying the IP address is already in use, disable the Network adapter you are trying to share then try again - be sure to enable it again afterwards. It can take a long time for ICS to be enabled so wait patiently. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now right-click on the Wireless Network Connection and click Properties. In the middle of the dialog there will be some protocols, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and then open the properties for that. Windows would have assigned a static IP address if ICS was successfully enabled, check to make sure this IP address does not conflict with other IP addresses on your network. Also, it should be on a different subnet to the Local Area Connection (for example, my computer's IP address is 192.168.0.2, I assigned the wireless network connection the IP address of 192.168.1.1 - which is on a different subnet). If it is on the same subnet, ICS will not work correctly. 
<br/>
<br/>
With that done, open the ASUS Wireless Config utility again. On the left select Config, in the Basic tab set a SSID. In the encryption tab, select Shared for Network Authentication and WEP for Data Encryption - I have found that this works with the DS. Now enter a WEP key. Go back to the Basic tab, and at the bottom click on Advanced, change the 54g Mode setting to 802.11b only. Click Apply on the left to save the settings. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now turn on your DS, play a Wi-Fi Connection game, go to the Nintendo WFC Settings, and select Manual Setup. Enter the SSID and WEP Key (both of these are case-sensitive) you entered to the ASUS Config utility before. Select No to Auto-obtain IP Address (you must do this because the Nintendo DS doesn't seem to DHCP correctly with ICS for some reason). Now give your DS an IP Address (this must be on the same subnet as the USB connector, I gave my DS the IP address: 192.168.1.2). For subnet mask enter 255.255.255.0. For gateway and primary DNS, enter the IP address of the USB connector. Now try and test connection, and if all has gone well the connection should be successful! 
<br/>
<br/>
Now with the ASUS Wireless Config utility, you may want to hide your SSID, and use MAC Address filtering to improve the security of your wireless access point. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a different USB adapter that uses the RT2500 chipset (there is a list here: <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a>), install the normal drivers for your USB adapter. Then get the PID and VID numbers from Device Manager - right-click on the device and click properties, then go to the Details tab. The device ID would look something like this: USB\VID_0411&amp;PID_008B. Now follow the steps above until you get to the point after where you have copied my six modified EXE files. Open them in a HEX editor and do a search for "USB\VID_0411&amp;PID_008B" (without quotes) and replace all search occurrences you find with the VID and PID of your own USB adapter. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Also, like it has been said, this is only for a soft AP, not homebrew. It also seems like it would have made more sense for you to bump the topic this was original from, rather than making a whole new one, but that is just me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To clarify you can't stream applications to the DS with them, but you can go online with homebrew applications with the SoftAP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow.. talk about a lot of confusion over nothing.  Cliff Notes version..  If you have an Official Nintendo USB adapter, you can "convert" it from being Nintendo only to a standard USB SoftAP.  That's it.  It really has nothing to do with the Nintendo DS or what you can do with it.  When you get done, it'll work like any other AP.  So, even your WiFi enabled laptop will be able to use it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Edit: or perhaps it's best to uninstall the old ones first, and point Windows to the new drivers when you plug the device in and Windows needs drivers for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Which in turn doesn't work for installing stuff on the DS via the air (wifime style), but there are special drivers for that if someone should wish to use that particular function. I don't think they work for anything else though.
<br/>
<br/>
DHCP doesn't seem to work with SoftAP btw, but that's a minor issue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Try installing the application before connecting the USB device (which btw I had to do to get it running, although I never had it asking for that file).

There are also drivers at ralinktech.com.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, there seem to be some people that have difficulty installing the drivers. The correct way to do this is as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
Extract the <span style="font-style: italic">Drivers</span> folder from the RAR file.
<br/>
Open <span style="font-style: italic">Device Manager</span> (<span style="font-style: italic">Control Panel</span> -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic">System</span> -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic">Hardware</span> -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic">Device Manager</span>).
<br/>
Under <span style="font-style: italic">Network Adapters</span>, right-click on your USB dongle, and select <span style="font-style: italic">Update Driver...</span>.
<br/>
Depending on the way your system is configured, you may get a dialog asking if you want to search Windows Update for a driver, select No.
<br/>
Now select <span style="font-style: italic">Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)</span> and click <span style="font-style: italic">Next</span>.
<br/>
Select <span style="font-style: italic">Don't search. I will choose the driver to install.</span> and click <span style="font-style: italic">Next</span>.
<br/>
Click the <span style="font-style: italic">Have Disk...</span> button. Then click the <span style="font-style: italic">Browse</span> button and go to the folder to where you extracted the drivers from the RAR file before, and select the INF file. Then click Next and follow the rest.
<br/>
<br/>
If when installing the drivers, you are prompted for "rt25usbap.sys" on the CD for the official WiFi USB connector, then you have done something wrong!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Waffle on Mon Jul 17, 2006 1:03 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

It is possible to make the USB dongle function as a SoftAP (which makes it behave much like a normal access point). Under SoftAP, you can play online WiFi enabled games (such as Mario Kart DS, Tetris DS, etc.) and use homebrew apps (DSOrganize, SylphAMP, DS2Key, etc.). Also when it is functioning as a SoftAP, other devices such as PSP and laptops, can connect to the access point.
<br/>
<br/>
To use WMB with the USB dongle, it needs to be done under Linux. Another option is to use VMWare and set up a virtual machine of Knoppix, that runs in Windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
