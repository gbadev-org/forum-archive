That button to swap the image viewer screen would probably be Select. (Perhaps it could be the same for everything in Moonshell?). It would definietly be a nice feature.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Select, I notice that there's now a timer on that button so that it is possible to use it to switch screens that video is playing on without having it constantly alternate screens every frame for as long as Select is being held down. Is there a way to change this timer, or remove it altogether so that it only swaps screens once, each time Select is pressed?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Alright, thanks. My image looks fine in 8-bit though, so I won't need to do this.

<br/>
Tip for anyone else changing the wallpaper: 640x480, 800x600 etc are all a 4:3 ratio... so is 256x192. Which means you can scale down just about any desktop wallpaper to the DS's resolution, and it won't be horribly distorted. :-) (Unless the program you do it with sucks.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only problem I'm having with it is 20 minutes into an anime episode the picture blurs and freezes while the sound keeps going.

Actually I would use MoonShell for playing my DVD movies and not the hardcore ones in that picture. This HDD does not have any other video clips at this time. Maybe I could make some tests with my movies when I get back to home.

For some strange reason it does not load when it has 100MB video clips in it (full DVD movie). Is this a bug in G6 flash or bug in MoonShell?

-Default volume level stored in INI
<br/>
-Pressing B with no file open goes back a directory; in the root directory it shows a shutdown prompt.
<br/>
-If at all possible, some way to jump to the firmware's various menus, Pictochat, WMB etc would be pretty neat.
<br/>
<br/>
No rush though, I know what you mean about needing a break. I've made some rather complicated programs myself. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does it give you an error message (in gibberish or japanese, of course) when you run it? If it does, and it has "64K" in it, it means the files in the IMFS exceed the limit. 
<br/>
<br/>
If this IS the problem, to fix it, go to ChangeCodePage\chgimfs. The number in each file name in this folder is the IMFS size limit. Select the one you want, rename it to _BOOT_MP.nds, and replace the default one with it.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
First of all: Great Work, Moonshell !
<br/>
<br/>
Now for the Probs:
<br/>
<br/>
I converted a complete episode of ENTERPRISE from a PAL-DVD with DPGEnc resulting in a file of 80 MBytes in Size.
<br/>
When playbacked in Moonshell (I'm using M3-CF) Video freezes at around 15 Minutes, while Audio still goes on.
<br/>
The only workaround i've found: Pressing UP on Controlpad when the Picture is frozen.
<br/>
Is this a Bug in Moonshell or am I doing something wrong ?
<br/>
Anyone found an other way around this ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just tried the file info test 2, works nice but I found a few more small bugs.
<br/>
1) Genre shows as "?||g?|" for some MP3 files.
<br/>
2) The file info window stays on-screen after the last file in the directory is played.
<br/>
3) Setting MusicNext:PowerOFF doesn't work with the lid closed. The DS stays on until the lid is opened.
<br/>
4) The text viewer's line number still doesn't change when scrolling with the stylus. (Sorry I didn't notice that before.)

The problem is actually the letters being rearranged near the right edge. Notice how "Light OC Remix" becomes "Light OC Reix" (missing the M) and "transformation" becomes "transformatioi". (Sorting would be nice, though. ^_^)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for making this. The main reason I got a DS was because I knew someone would make a cool program like Moonshell. Really makes you wonder why Nintendo hasn't released an updated media player that uses the DS's power.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
First of all: Great Work, Moonshell !
<br/>
<br/>
Now for the Probs:
<br/>
<br/>
I converted a complete episode of ENTERPRISE from a PAL-DVD with DPGEnc resulting in a file of 80 MBytes in Size.
<br/>
When playbacked in Moonshell (I'm using M3-CF) Video freezes at around 15 Minutes, while Audio still goes on.
<br/>
The only workaround i've found: Pressing UP on Controlpad when the Picture is frozen.
<br/>
Is this a Bug in Moonshell or am I doing something wrong ?
<br/>
Anyone found an other way around this ?
<br/>
<br/>

For some reason global.ini was not "for all". I personally use EXFS, so MoonShell freezed. After I figured out the setting it started to work.
<br/>
In my opinion these stuff with make_interface.bat should be in the moonshel package itself (someone needs to make dos command based menu for codepage select). Another solution if that some codes an interface to run these scripts.

crashes MoonShell now.  I think it must be crashing when it tries to get MOD file info since it played fine in all previous MoonShell versions.  Can anyone else confirm this crash?

Also, I want to thank MoonLight for adding in IDV3 reading and alphabetic sorting of the file list.

MoonLight, it's a shame you do not want donations. I still feel guilty for getting such a great application for free.
<br/>
<br/>
I do have a request though. When the cap is shut, shut the screens off completely, don't just shut the backlights off. It would save on more power.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the video game "Daigasso! Band Brothers!" has a feature where if your cap is closed, the music continues playing...But there is no sound out of the speakers. There is sound ONLY if there are headphones connected to the Nintendo DS. Is this feature possible for moonshell? It could be a good feature to have, and would save from embarassment on the bus when I accidentally pull my headphone cord off. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

sorry. It was made to wait very for a long time.
<br/>
Perhaps, the problem that the DPG reproduction stops was corrected. (This problem of stop 12 minutes.)
<br/>
<br/>
The DefaultSongLength item was added the SPCPlugin section to global.ini.
<br/>
When the SPC plug-in became a no sound for one second or more, it was made to judge the stop.
<br/>
<br/>
The backlight turning off time is revokable in the BacklightTimeout section of global.ini.
<br/>
When 0 is specified, it always lights.
<br/>
<br/>

I have G6 flash U-Disk, is that the right filesystem for it?
<br/>
<br/>
I tried with 608Mb (76MB) movie file and MoonShell freezed when I selected the file and tried to play it. Is this a bug in G6 flash CART or in MoonShell?.. Maybe I am doing something wrong?
<br/>
After I shutdown DS and started it again MoonShell started directly, weird. G6 has internal menu system that can not be removed. Normally nothing is started directly. After few reboots it fixed and boot to menu.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: When MoonShell freezes it shuts the backlights and DS starts to blink the green light. Nothing buttons helps.. only reboot.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Does that work if you just replace the numbers? You can just replace them with %1, %2 etc, which means to use the value of the first, second etc parameter. Example:

If you name this test.bat, and run "test 4 3", it'll show "p1=4 p2=3". It'd be difficult to make an actual menu with just a batch file, though.

You do this by just turning off the amplifier, IIRC. It'd also save more power when the lid is closed, as I doubt many people will have it closed if they're using the main speakers. ;-)

About the UTF-8 font.
<br/>
I want to adopt the font of 9 point size.
<br/>
However, it has a lot of characters to which the top and bottom cuts.

Which is legible? (Should I partially use 8pt?)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I think a mix of 9pt and 8pt could work..
<br/>
<br/>
a-z, A-Z, ???: 9pt  
<br/>
and ???: 8pt
<br/>
<br/>
Someone else that have these letters in their alphabet think this could work ?</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
ok. the alphabet uses 9pt.
<br/>
What do you think of 0-9 and "!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./, :;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`~" ?
<br/>
<br/>
As for the ideographic script of each language, I am not well informed.
<br/>
Does "???" or "???" mean only 3 characters?
<br/>
Please write all the ideographic characters.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

LOL!
<br/>
<br/>
In general, "ideographic script" means logograms such as kanji (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/jouyoukanji.html" target="_blank">examples</a>). In general, to write ideographic characters, you need a pixel size twice what you need for alphabetic characters.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm guessing from context that "ideographic script" was a mistranslation of a phrase that simply means the letters used in each language. As for those, I seem to remember that Chishm's FAT driver supports only ISO-8859-1 ("Latin 1") characters, and those are listed in two Unicode charts: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf" target="_blank">Basic Latin</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf" target="_blank">Latin-1 Supplement</a>. Also available are <a class="postlink" href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/" target="_blank">charts for other scripts represented in the Unicode standard</a>. (Adobe Reader or other PDF viewer software is required.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
Your guess is correct.
<br/>
I was misunderstanding the ideographic script and the letter. (character=letter?)
<br/>
<br/>
I had made a mistake in the size. A standard size is 7pt. A large size is 8pt.
<br/>
<br/>
About UTF-8(CP100).
<br/>
All alphanumeric characters (0x7f or less) are 8pt.
<br/>
"???" are 8pt.
<br/>
All other characters are 7pt.
<br/>
<br/>
About UTF-8test(CP110).
<br/>
All characters are 8pt.
<br/>
It is a test font to request the Unicode number and the size.
<br/>
<br/>
Chishm 's FAT driver doesn't treat Unicode in the long filename.
<br/>
It is a code that I added. There is a possibility in which the mistake is found.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I trief different combinations and my problem with the sound was that the volume was &lt;100% if you put it e.g. on 99% there is no sound but on 100% there is sound.
<br/>
BTW because this is my first posting I wanted to tell you MoonShell that your shell is great and the best I have worked with for now on the DS and I believe that your shell is a milestone in DS Homebrew. I hope you won't give it up. I am already thinking about great things that would be possible with this wonderful tool.

I was wondering if it is able to change the design of MoonShell I was messing with global.ini (the color settings) and I did make new MoonShell.ds.gba but it did not change a thing (it did change the other stuff).</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by arlow on Sun Jan 29, 2006 9:50 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

There is a size limitation in the text viewer.
<br/>
It depends on the amount of the memory to convert your language text into Unicode.
<br/>
<br/>
The size limitation can be unlimited by synchronous(streaming) reading.
<br/>
However, I do not make it because it seems that a synchronous reading is very complex and very slow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree with all of those, except I dont think WMA is possible easily.
<br/>
Also, Win95 looks better then XP :p
<br/>
(custom background would be nice though..you just keep it in a folder)
<br/>
<br/>
This is a big one, but how about supporting extensions?
<br/>
<br/>
You could have a folder called "programs"
<br/>
Then,
<br/>
For instance anything with *.nes could open the program "NES_nesds.nds"
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell would simple look at the first leters, and if they matched it would trigger the correct program. (and would be very simple for the user to set up various programs for different extensions).
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this wouldnt load the correct file into the program...it would be upto the creators of NesDS, or such for that.
<br/>
<br/>
But I dont see that would be much work for them. You could just leave the route to the file in an standard place in ram, which DS homebrewers could learn to access.

Can people stop making crazy requests?   :P   This is one guy in his sparetime making this great software...  so getting a load of people saying "Can we have a noise filter" when he has said many times he wont add features to the video encoder and "Can we have WMA" when only a few posts ago he said something like "no". And for those that missed it.... he has said very clearly that he wont/cant add multi file support - ie, load a text file/pictures and listen to music at the same time - doing so would mean a big code change as far as I know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Method 1.

Your absolutely right of course, we are asking too much.
<br/>
Moonshell is already by far and away the most usefull portable app on just about any format ever :)
<br/>
<br/>
But about text and music...it already does it,effectively.
<br/>
Theres a little box that gives you the help and such..you can still read, move and scroll that while music or even video is playing.
<br/>
<br/>
Thats why I assumed it wouldnt be too much effort to add.
<br/>
Thinking about it, I guese it would require interface changes to select two files and such. That may be the big code change.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That help and version info is loaded into memory when MoonShell starts. <span style="font-style: italic">Before</span> MoonShell starts, even.
<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to speak about things I know nothing about;
<br/>
<br/>
In older versions of MoonShell, I suppose text files are loaded into memory entirely, and depending on the size of the file, that might not leave enough memory to play music at the same time. In the newest version, it seems only a small part of it is in memory and it reads the next parts from the CF/SD as you scroll. This might leave enough memory to play music, but it would be tough to read a text file and music from the CF/SD at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not impossible, but it would be a lot of work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It is an exactly correct opinion.
<br/>
<br/>
ARM9 CPU? It suffices enough.
<br/>
4MByte Memory? It suffices enough.
<br/>
CF/SD reading speed? It suffices enough.
<br/>
<br/>
Architecture of the entire MoonShell? so bad.

It is very difficult to change a basic design.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have some non-crazy suggestions for TextView:
<br/>
<br/>
1.) In header of TextView window - filename (or part of it if filename is too long), % of text like "13,86%" and time like "21:18", updated every scroll or minute.
<br/>
2.) Possibility to switch off scrollbar or/and header - to read in "real" fullscreen.
<br/>
3.) Make TextView screen switchable (SELECT?) and turn off the light on second screen.
<br/>
4.) Tweak controls (maybe like this) :
<br/>
	A/B,Down,ShoulderL,ShoulderR, tap on the touchscreen - Next Page
<br/>
	Up - Previous Page
<br/>
	Left -1% of text position
<br/>
	Right +1% of text position
<br/>
	X/Y Close current file
<br/>
	Select Swap Screen
<br/>
5.) Next Page should be "real" next page - not minus one line of text like now
<br/>
6.) SELECT should act like other buttons - with keyrepeat and so on</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is it possible to be able to show or hide the Help and About windows while Moonshell is running? I have them hidden (as I prefer my screen as clean as possible) but sometimes I want to be able to show them for a minute, and re-building the .nds file to change the settings is inconvenient.
<br/>
<br/>
The only other thing I can think of to ask is to support .m3u playlist files. They're very simple, just plain text lists with some extra info in them. Aside from that, Moonshell does just about everything I'd want it to. :-) (And it's nice to finally have a portable device that can play SPC files. 64KB .spc &gt; 1MB MP3 by a long shot.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MoonShell currently does not have in-program configuration.
<br/>
<br/>
However,
<br/>
<br/>
You can now edit the global.ini with a DS home brewn "Text file editor".. because the Shell directory is now "installed" on the flash card. Restart MoonShell and it should take effect. I don't know how one would do this with a non-CF/SD based card.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
<br/>
When making requests you may want to remember that MoonLight/MoonShell can not read English very well, so using short hand grammar and such will make it very hard for him to read.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell :
<br/>
<br/>
I think you are doing very well with your English. Its not easy understanding another language.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is another idea for the shoulder buttons. When the lid is closed. 
<br/>
<br/>
- hold down L and press R to skip/next song.
<br/>
- hold down R and press L to pause/play.
<br/>
<br/>
Would that be very hard?
<br/>
<br/>
When reading text in Moonshell, when you close the text, the current position can be saved to the .ini file. Because Moonshell is not creating a new file, it should be safe. When you open the text again, you can go back to where you were using the .ini
<br/>
<br/>
Again, is that very hard?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, MoonLight, when you're better, here are some bugs that need to be sorted out:
<br/>
<br/>
Old bug: "Random" (now called "Shuffle") needs to ignore music it's already played before, as to not get constant repeating music.
<br/>
<br/>
Old bug: "Random" (now called "Shuffle") does not play different file formats. If I play an MP3 and the next file is random, and I have OGGs in the same directory, MoonShell will ignore the OGG files and keep playing MP3s randomly. If I am playing IT files and there is an MP3 in the directory, MoonShell will ignore the MP3 files and keep playing IT files randomly. etc.
<br/>
<br/>
New bug: some IT files are crashing MoonShell. Specifically, this one: <a href="http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/FF7Stuff/FF7DS/ff7ds_sfx_cursor.it" target="_blank">http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/FF7Stuff/FF7DS/ff7ds_sfx_cursor.it</a>
<br/>
<br/>
and this one: <a href="http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/FF7Stuff/FF7DS/ff7ds_sfx_ready.it" target="_blank">http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/FF7Stuff/FF7DS/ff7ds_sfx_ready.it</a>
<br/>
<br/>
IT files also have a break up in the sound. I suspect this is a buffer problem perhaps?
<br/>
<br/>
Feature Request: more Zoom Out options on pictures. Full Screen image resizing would be nice. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Take a long break before considering these,  though. Get over your virus. Being sick is not fun.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

anyway about this 0.99: are files displayed alphabeticfally or in the order they were viewed on the pc? Because if is it so, i could order the file like i want on the pc and then view them in the same way on Moonshell.

- you forgot to include the "space" between the both screens (doesn't relly bother me though) ;)

Ah, so that's where this skin came from originally.  Thank you for that.  I actually never really thought of making a skin for MoonShell until I saw that.  
<br/>
<br/>
In that case, what do you think of the file info position in this version of it (http://www.angelfire.com/realm2/zdd2/MoonShl/CurveShell_v099.zip)?  I was kinda going back and forth on it, but I decided I liked that better than having the larger, 'fat' file info window randomly stuck into the middle of the screen (not so cluttered maybe) since MoonShell's much more accurate with the touch screen now and the scroll bars are much easier to use.  Heh, changed my mind overnight apparently about where I placed that window.   So if anyone did download it yesterday, it's 'new' and 'improved now. :P
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don't mind about putting that up here.  ^_^  I might have asked had I known where it came from in the first place.  Btw, if it's of any use to you, feel free to use anything from that zip in your 'official version'.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is stretched to fullscreen. However, there's no filtering, so anything but 128x96 looks pretty ugly due to oddly stretched pixels. I kinda wish there was a 1:1 (no stretching) mode where the video just has a black border around it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would like to test if G6 flashcart works like M3, because it is a real U-Disk and should act like M3.

I can not see why it should not work.

<br/>
<br/>
I just downloaded the version 0.99 and I find it great. But one thing is not perfect for me. Now that all config and skin files are external to the NDS file, I can't use moonshell anywhere else than on the root of my SD card. I was used to put all moonshell files in a subfolder and now I can't. It will use the default config. Could this be modified in a near future ? And picture viewing is good, but can there be a feature to see the entire image on the top screen (resized to fit the screen). Of course, a limitation for too big images can be added. Is all that possible ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your attention and hope these features will come out =)

If you would rather it called them something else, just open the _BOOT_MP.nds file in a hex editor, search for the string "files." and replace it with a six-character string of your choice.

But I confirm what I say, the exact same MP3 (Mozart's Requiem, Dies Irae) encoded in 160 kbps sounds great on my PC, the choir and the strings are well rendered, whereas on my DS the sound (and I'm not some kind of purist, seeking the perfect quality) seems distorted, choir and strings are like mixed together.

Is EXFS required for SD versions of SuperCard and M3? I thought it was just for dedicated flashcarts. Here is what I did:
<br/>
<br/>
1. I first insert my CF card into the reader (SD card should be no different here).
<br/>
2. It automatically detected it in WindowsXP and assigned it as drive "F:" (I would hope that Linux would do this too).
<br/>
3. Then I ran Setup.exe and chose it to write to drive "F:" (if your card isn't assigned as a drive letter, try selecting "C:" as this will put the "_BOOT_MP.nds" file at the root of the drive and create the necessary "\shell" folder at "C:\shell\".
<br/>
4. I left "/shell/global.ini", "/shell/desktop.bmp", and "/shell/startup.mp3" checked as those get copied from the "\SetupData\files\shell\" subfolder from where Setup.exe is running (you can also replace those files with different ones as long as they carry the same names and the desktop.bmp file must be 256x192 and a 256-color indexed palette).
<br/>
5. Since I didn't need any additional language settings, I just unchecked the box to copy a new one over.
<br/>
6. I also unchecked the SuperCard option since I have a GBAMP. You might want to make both files and see which works better.
<br/>
7. Clicking OK wrote everything out to the CF card without a problem.
<br/>
8. For the skins, I just unzipped one of Moonlight's skins and copied the "skin.ini" file and all of the bitmap files into the "\shell" directory on the CF card.
<br/>
9. Replaced the CF card in the GBAMP, put it into the DS, started it up, and    viola! Skinned Moonshell v.99!
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I'm not sure how much is applicable to the SuperCard SD or Linux, but I wouldn't think that it would be too far off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
I just got to thinking about something that I would like to make a request for. There are settings to "Hide" the About, Help, and Date/Time windows in the global.ini file, but it's either on or off. What about a "minimized" setting where they can become small icons that can be moved around and be re-opened back to full size again. There are cases where I do want to hide the window, but I want it to come back later. It would be most helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
And is writing to the CF/SD card or flashcart planned for Moonshell? Writing settings to the global.ini file from Moonshell would be very useful as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

<br/>
EXFS wasn't needed, and setting it to output to a drive seemed to make a version which loads the config off the card's /shell dir. It also saved me the trouble of having to run the CreateNDSROM_for_EXFS.bat step.
<br/>
For what it's worth, Linux sees the card when I put it in the card reader, but wine, which runs the setup.exe program, isn't configured to see it (I generally have no need to use it from windows programs.) I just had it dump the nds files in my home directory and then copied them over, similar to your suggestion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just coding skills needed (no source codes needed).
<br/>
There can be an interface that chooses settings/files for you and makes dpgenc.exe to encode them and finishes when the OK button appears (pushes automatically it) and starts to encode another one.
<br/>
<br/>
Or we can wait if Moonlight will integrate it. It is his decision, not ours.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I am hoping to see dpgenc.exe that saves the settings to a file dpgenc.ini (does not loose them).

Transfering large video files take lot of time, and sometime those videos turn out very bad.  Then I have to delete and convert new ones, waste all the effort.

Anyway if you want you can try dpeg decoder, which creates one m1v and wav file from the dpg. So you can test the quality from the pc ^^

2. It automatically detected it in WindowsXP and assigned it as drive "F:" (I would hope that Linux would do this too).
<br/>
3. Then I ran Setup.exe and chose it to write to drive "F:" (if your card isn't assigned as a drive letter, try selecting "C:" as this will put the "_BOOT_MP.nds" file at the root of the drive and create the necessary "\shell" folder at "C:\shell\".
<br/>
4. I left "/shell/global.ini", "/shell/desktop.bmp", and "/shell/startup.mp3" checked as those get copied from the "\SetupData\files\shell\" subfolder from where Setup.exe is running (you can also replace those files with different ones as long as they carry the same names and the desktop.bmp file must be 256x192 and a 256-color indexed palette).
<br/>
5. Since I didn't need any additional language settings, I just unchecked the box to copy a new one over.
<br/>
6. I also unchecked the SuperCard option since I have a GBAMP. You might want to make both files and see which works better.
<br/>
7. Clicking OK wrote everything out to the CF card without a problem.
<br/>
8. For the skins, I just unzipped one of Moonlight's skins and copied the "skin.ini" file and all of the bitmap files into the "\shell" directory on the CF card.
<br/>
9. Replaced the CF card in the GBAMP, put it into the DS, started it up, and    viola! Skinned Moonshell v.99!</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
