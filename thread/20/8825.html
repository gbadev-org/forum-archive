<br/>
<br/>
and if there was one to be made, I wouldn't expect it to go to all that detail like makin your own room and stuff, just the basic walk around and chat and features like that.
<br/>
<br/>
if anyone's up to this, it'd be GREAT! :D

Sounds like Zelda Online. I'm for it. ;) I have a bunch of <a class="postlink" href="http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/Zelda64Stuff/" target="_blank">MIDI files</a> you could use if you wish as well. (That is, if you have a MIDI player for your game running)

I really dont want to get into details on the forum yet, but its not Zelda Online, I'm just using quite a few Zelda graphix, mainly as "placeholders"
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing that what Thundrestrike wants is a avatar-based chatroom (judging by Habbo Hotel, which I visited around 5 years ago). 
<br/>
<br/>
The game I am working on *will have* online elements (similar to Animal Crossing, minus the friend codes) (will have as in, not yet, I havent  found any tuts about wifi on PA_Lib yet, but I havent looked because I want to finish everything else first). 
<br/>
<br/>
The game will allow users to comunicate in one way or another, just dont ask for something as complex as Habbo Hotel on the first release ;), remember that those pages weren't built in a day (or even a month), but have been the results of years of work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, Habbo Hotel is alot of detail, creating your own rooms and stuff.
<br/>
I mean just the basic maybe 5 rooms or something, the other way would take up a TON of space!
<br/>
<br/>
and its kinda funny they want money for clubpenguin, i never payed :P
<br/>
<br/>
it will be REALLY cool when someone makes somethin like this :D

Thats part of the problem, taking screenies of black screens with garbled text wont help much. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently testing some code I got from Sata's Rain, and I havent worked on the GUI at all, GUI is the last thing I'll work on, after I make sure that all the math and problems are solved.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: If you really are interested, we can arrange a way to contact each other (through MSN or such), so I can give some more details. I need all the help I can get (graphically, at least, but wouldnt mind coders or people giving me ideas)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Besides mine?
<br/>
<br/>
I doubt anyone wants to build their very own habbo hotel for the DS Hombrew community, specially if itll be dead in less than 5 years and most probably wont be used by more than 300 people :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
