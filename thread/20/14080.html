    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have here a 1 GB compact flash card that I want to use. The trouble is that it does not work with a basic USB flash card reader, and I lack one that will read it. The only CF reader I have that will read the thing is my Supercard CF. My other two flash cards work fine with the usb reader.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems the best way to transfer these files would be to boot a wireless file transfer program on one card, then swap over to the 1 GB card so it can be written to. DSFTP is not cooperating, unfortunately. Is there anything specifically built for hot-swapping the storage device?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds to me the best way to do what you want to do is use a two slot system, DSFile would work, as I think (but am not sure) that the SCCF is natively supported in Libfat.  You'd need a microSD or SD based Slot-1 card like the R4, M3DS Simply, or Games n' Music.
<br/>
<br/>
A swappable system would be pointless because transferring a 10MB file would involve swapping the card maybe 4 times.
<br/>
<br/>
The only other possibility is WiFi, though DSFTP would be the way to do that, there may be a network transfer app in DSLinux you could try too.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSLinux was my first thought, too, but the trouble is it dies the moment it loses the flash card. DSFTP is unable to access files if I insert a different card than the one it was booted with.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess this is a bit of a niche thing, but maybe someone else has bumped into this exact bother.
<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, you reminded me of the DSLinux stand-alone NDS file build. Maybe that one has (or can run) ftpd and has a magical resilience to having a mounted drive yanked out and swapped for something else... (And then, maybe it can still use the flash card for some reason. I shall find out shortly!)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I knew how to hotswap cards, I'd add it to DSFile.  The problem is I have a GBAMP, so you have to hotswap the whole cartridge, not just the CF (take GBAMP out, remove CF, insert new CF, reinsert GBAMP).  I was trying to add support for this but couldn't get it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the easiest thing might be just to buy a supported reader or a Slot-1 card (such as Games n' Music, my friend got it for $20, I payed that much for a basic USB 1.1 CF reader), boot a SCCF-patched DSFTP or DSLinux with it, then stream the files, but you might need to use something like DSFile to copy the <a href="http://ftp.conf" target="_blank">ftp.conf</a> file to the CF so that DSFTP will boot properly on it.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, my evil brother has a slot-1 card. I can borrow it from him and try DSFile. (Looks like an excellent program, by the way. Thanks!)
<br/>
<br/>
I have a vague memory of booting DSO on one card and swapping another one in moments before it figured out the file system. It may be possible to create an <a href="http://ftp.conf" target="_blank">ftp.conf</a> file and boot DSFTP in the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I've remembered that Moonshell has a great feature allowing for hot-swapping, where if you hold Start it will load the binary into memory but not boot it until Start is released. This way, I can safely swap the card without the new program having any trouble.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
