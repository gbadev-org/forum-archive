    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello.  I recently purchased a Nintendo DS Lite (about a month or so ago).  And I was wondering what I need to get it to boot homebrew games, play mp3s/movies.  I've read a lot about PassMe, FlashMe, Supercard and all this stuff but I'm yet to find any sort of step by step instruction for noobs like me.  Starting from square one, what's the easiest way for my DS Lite to boot homebrew apps/games?  I did a quick scan on the forums but I couldn't find much on there.  I'm sure you guys get this sort of thing all the time, so if you can't help or don't want to, if you could point me to a place that might be able to it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Flashcart(M3, G6, Supercard) + Media Card + Passkey/NoPass. Then flash your DS so you don't need to use Passkey/NoPass anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
