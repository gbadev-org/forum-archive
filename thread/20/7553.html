Why is it that Nintendo doesn't want us to post our Friend codes on forums and such? Can people do anything with them?

<br/>
No, they don't want people posting their friend codes on the NINTENDO message boards. They don't care what you do with it outside of their own servers. And it's probably some legal crap. They don't want to be in any way responsible if some kid gets cyberstalked or kidnapped or something because they gave their friend code away on an official Nintendo message board. Though, there's not really anything you can do with the info, atleast as far as I can tell.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lol, these dang problems  =(
<br/>
I must have just missed you about 20 minute ago, but I had some dang trouble with my DS connecting through my wireless router. Everytime I want to go online with my DS, it doesn't work, but when I use an available connection slot to see if it find an Access point, it finds one, then I test my original settings, and it then it starts working.......I hate my router....but it works very well when it is functional....
<br/>
<br/>
Today, I tried connecting with my cousin via WFC, and he couldn't come to my town either. I think it might have been the same code too.....
<br/>
<br/>
Error code &lt;86420&gt; is "Unable to establish UDP connection to the game server."
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it is using a different connection method than MK:DS, since I connect fine with that afaik. Gonna check through Nintendo's help sections about fixing this problem (if it is a problem on my side).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't rule out the possibility that there's nothing wrong on your end.  It just so happens that <span style="font-style: italic">before</span> I tried to connect, I couldn't get online with my computer for the life of me.  My PC is also wireless.  I decided to play AC for the purpose of testing the connection.  When it couldn't even connect to the router, it confirmed my suspicions that the router itself was at fault.  I mean, I couldn't even ping my router, yet somehow my WNIC could connect to it...
<br/>
<br/>
I've been a fan of D-Link for a while now, but I've head some people complain about them, and when I worked (sniff... got laid off...) at a computer store, our wireless D-Link would go down usually once a day.  So when I replaced my DI-514 (which is NOT compatible w/ N's WFC), I decided to go for a LinkSys router.  So far, this is the only time it's acted up.  But my D-Link <span style="font-style: italic">never</span> acted up, except for the time when it decided to stop broadcasting the SSID, prompting me to hardwire into it.  And another time I couldn't connect to the net reliably 'cause my landlord put in a buncha new equipment in his room directly above me and caused enough interference that I had to put tinfoil on the router's antenna to get reception.  Damn, I still can't believe that actually worked!  Still, only 2 problems in 1 year is good, compared to 1 problem in 2 weeks with the new LinkSys.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I'm rambling.  I guess the short of it is that my new router may not be all that great, so if everything looks good on your end it's probably me.  But I won't speak on behalf of your cousin.  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I done a whole bunch of things to my router when my DS is trying to work with it, like giving it a static IP address, setting that IP address as a DMZ server so the firewall does not affect anything between my DS and the internet, as well as other things. From what I see right now, my "Test Connection" and WFC Connection seem faster now.

<br/>
hehe, I'm not much with networking either, but once you starting tinkering with things, it starts to make sense.
<br/>
What I did was I went all out on pieces that MIGHT work. Here is what I did for my router (don't think it will be the same for yours, but worth a try if you can find all the things)
<br/>
<br/>
On router settings...
<br/>
- Set a reserved IP address for the DS. (You've done this with making sure the MAC address is the same as on your DS?)
<br/>
- Set that IP address as the DMZ server (You did this too)
<br/>
- Disable SPI firewall (if you can).
<br/>
- Port Forwarding:
<br/>
--- Set UDP ports 1 to 65534 to your DS IP Address (If you have other games using specific UDP ports, you may have to work around the used ports)
<br/>
--- Set TCP ports 28910 to 29920 to that IP Address
<br/>
<br/>
On the DS...
<br/>
(Most likely your router has SSID broadcasting enabled, so by Searching for Access point, it will find your router, filling in the SSID, and, if it is requiring, enter the WEP key)
<br/>
- Enter your static IP Address like you did on your router
<br/>
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
<br/>
- Gateway: 192.168.0.1 or whatever you use to get into your router settings
<br/>
(By now, "Auto-obtain DNS should be set to No)
<br/>
- Primary and Secondary DNS: These can be found under your Router settings under "Domain Name Server". Some people report that using 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.3 work, but for me, they don't
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully that helps.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I'm thinking that each time you connect to the WFC, your drawing of Blanca's face is uploaded each time, and is randomly sent out to people.

He's got the 'net going into a router, going into my wireless router.  So I logged onto it and put my router into his DMZ.  He's got some crappy MS router that has no options, so I figured that was the easiest way to remove any roadblocks it's causing.
