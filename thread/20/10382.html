<br/>
-----------------
<br/>
For the past few weeks I have been working on a game I call, Super Snake DS and it is now at a point where it's actually a game.  ^^  Super Snake DS is yet another snake game, but with static and moving obsticals, mini games, and boss levels (Not implented in this pre-release version). 
<br/>
<br/>
Object of the Game
<br/>
-----------------
<br/>
The object of the game is to meet the requirements of the level for each sublevel before deing.  If you die before you've met the level requirements, you lose a life or posibly get a Game Over.  Also, there are 5 sub-levels to a level.  Finally, after each level, you get to play a mini game to gain extra points and or lives.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This Version...
<br/>
-------------------
<br/>
At the moment, there are only 7 levels ( which comes out to 35 sublevels), and once you beat level 7, you just end back up at level 1.  Also, there is currently only one minigame (A nice Card Matching game), but in the future, there will be Triva minigames concerning the level just played and others which I haven't come up with yet.  Also, I have a few ideas for Boss battles, but I haven't started implenting them yet.
<br/>
<br/>
GamePlay
<br/>
-------------------
<br/>
Gameplay is pretty self explainable.  In the final release, there will be a short in game tutorial :)  Also, as for the question of what is good and what is bad.  Look for hints in the level Objectives Message on what you shouuld be tryign to eat and what you should avoid.  Sometimes it's said directly, sometimes it's not :-P
<br/>
<br/>
Download
<br/>
-------------------
<br/>
You can download my game at the following link.  Also, if it says file not found, I appologise.  There have been some issues with my host and they are transfering to a differnt server..so...if they haven't already done the switch, the file may be lost.  If that's the case, i'll have it up again as soon as posible :)

<br/>
<br/>
Bugs, Suggestions, and Comments
<br/>
-------------------
<br/>
My main reason for releasing this at this point in time is mainly to get comments and suggestions for the game while I sort of take a week off from working with the game.  Any Mini-Game ideas, boss level ideas, gameplay ideas, suggestions, etc. are greatly appreciated.  Also, there is a bug i'm trying to track down that I haven't been able to figure out that involves the game just suddenly freezing for no apparent reason.  Even worse, this seems to happen almost never and I can't reproduce it.  So, if the game freezes for you, please take note of the Debug Number in the top right corner of the screen, your score, level, and how many bodies you have.  This information would be very usefull for me if you run accross this bug.  Also, any other bug reports are appreciated as well. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion
<br/>
-------------------
<br/>
Also, i'm curiouse as to what scores people are able to get by level 7.  In the future, there will be time bonuses at the end of each level.  Also, i'd like to adjust how fast things should get more difficult to be more reasonable to the average player (i've been playing this game quite a bit...so..it's a tad ahrd for me to judge what's easy...).
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, i'd like to note that all the graphics and coding were done by me with a few exceptions.  The Kun Kun level is a level derived from a background a friend of mine made by vector tracing (he's liste din the credits).  All the other graphics (except for the pac man level and Blue Screen of death level, which are screenshots for the background) were made by me either from scratch or by looking at somethign else for ideas, then making it myself.  The only real exception is the DS Girls level...which...i just had to do...i'm sorry to the original artist of that picture...i have no clue who you are and...i ahve a feeling whoever did it doesn't speak english.  :(  As for the music, it is listed in the credits and is by variouse artists with their music licenced under the Creative Commons licesnse for non-comercial use.  The current sound affects were all done with my voice....most of them are subject to be redone.
<br/>
<br/>
My First Project
<br/>
-------------------
<br/>
I diden't want to mention this first, but this game is actually my first C Programing project and First Major Programing Project (other than a IRC  bot I did in BASH shell scripting...which..is amazing it actually works ...decently).  I just started C at the beggining of June by reading "The C Programing Language 2nd eddition" (I did a little C before...but, i never got realy into it due to other projects) and I started this game as my practice project, which turned into a bigger project when I found out about the NeoFlash Compo.  Anyways, I will release the source code after the compo..but, some of it is realy messy.  Finaly, I wanted to say that PALib is more trouble than it's worth and i wish I diden't start off with it....this will problay be the only project I do with PAlib ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
What Works, What Doesn't
<br/>
-------------------------------
<br/>
Works:
<br/>
1.  7 levels with music.
<br/>
2.  The Classic Snake Mode (This was something I did AFTER the intial snake game by the way...it wasn't what I started off with, if that's what you thought :) ).
<br/>
3.  Card Flipping Mini Game.
<br/>
4.  Other Random Things...
<br/>
<br/>
To Come
<br/>
-------------------
<br/>
1.  High Score Saving
<br/>
2.  Posibly Game Saving (i'm debating on this...)
<br/>
3.  More Levels
<br/>
4.  Boss Levels
<br/>
5.  More Mini Games
<br/>
6.  And more?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post :(  Anyways, I hope you all enjoy my pre-release of my game.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Compatability
<br/>
----------------------
<br/>
Currently, I have only tested it on the gba MP.  However, it should work jsut fine with other devices.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2:
<br/>
I almost forgot.  The way I have it set up now, there is a 105 body limit for the snake.  If you by some chance get that many bodies, you should get a little dialog box that comes up and says you broke the limit.  If you did, please tell me.  I haven't been able to break it myself and I don't think it's very posible with the higher levels...but, you may have a chance with the first level.  In the final eddition, there will be a nice Point Bonus if you break that. ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT3:
<br/>
I have absolutely no clue what's going on over at my host...this is the first problem i've had with them for the month's i've been with them :S  Anyways, if the links arn't working above, use these links.  However, word of warning, these files are hosted on my personal server at my house..it's very very slow.  Sorry :(

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is 2 thing wrong: One thing is you need to put pause so you can press START button to pause game, and you also need to put CF card saver (you could store the saver file in the /saver directory).
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that this game is pretty good<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Saving and High Score saving is on the to do list :)  Also, Select pauses the game.  Maybe I should make it be the Start button instead of the select button?  But yeah, if you press select, a menu will pop up allowing to to quit the game and go back to the main menu or continue playing.  You can either just press select to close the window or press A while you have the continue item selected.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Yeah...after thinking about it for a minute, I think i'll make Start pause the game instead of Select.  Even as I was playing it, I would sometimes press Start instead of select to pause the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">mmm...multiplayer...I had it in mind...but, I wasn't totally sure excactly how to do it...  Also, I'd need to do some reading on sockets and what not.  Though, I think I have plenty of time to pull it off.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe have both people playing at the same time?  One on the top screen, one on the bottom.  Another idea would be to have both people playing at the same time...though, it seems like that could get a little comfusing and it seems a tad more difficult to create int he first place.  I don't know.  Any ideas are welcome.  
<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to note that, any sort of multiplayer would be the last thing I do and only if I had time.  More levels, more mini games, and minor tweaks come first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
like cutting eachothers way so it gets stuck in a death end, and then the game is over.
<br/>
it doesn't even need to be over internet.
<br/>
id love to see it happen at one ds, so player one uses the D-pad, and player 2 uses the A, B, X and Y buttons! its quite possible, and i think it would be great fun. as theres only 1 ds needed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, two players on the same DS...seems like it woudl be sort of a squeeze having two heads and hands at the DS trying to play :S  Though...if I were to do online playing, taking that idea and implenting it first woudlne't be very difficult since it would work the same way as multiplayer.  
<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about online multiplayer and lag and I think it should be able to work out.  Anyways, i'll start working on Super Snake DS some more in the next few days to finish up the main game...I need to think of some more levels, trvia, and mini games. :S  Also..it's been requested by a friend of mine that one of the bosses has to have a mohawk &gt;_&lt;
