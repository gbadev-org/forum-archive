what a brilliant application, at this moment, the DS is becoming a worthy opponent of my high-end MP3 player.

CF is very cheap
<br/>
DS battery is great

navigation is great

Sound quality is close to great

<br/>
VBR at what average bit rate?

I can't recall what VBR level it was, but it was fairly high.  I tried one that I think was somewhat lower, then one I know for a fact was a pretty high average bitrate.
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, and I know what Joint Stereo means.
<br/>
<br/>
I have to say too, loading up a bunch of episodes of 8-Bit Theatre and reading them on my breaks at work is pretty sweet as well.  Converting them to PNGs because JPGs seem to have a slight bug at the moment where you have to restart after loading one before it'll load another...might be fixed now though, haven't tried the most current version.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just thought I might help out with a few tips:
<br/>
Because of the way GBAMP_CF searches for files, the directory listings will be in the order that you put the files onto the card. So if you have any particular play order for your MP3s, put them on the card in that order (even though it doesn't automatically advance yet).
<br/>
The time is displayed in MoonShell, but it is hidden. It is about a 1/4 of the way from the bottom, hidden behind all the other windows. Just drag those windows out of the way (off screen if you don't need them) and you can see it.
<br/>
You can change the background picture. Edit files/.shell/desktop.bmp then run WriteFile.bat . Copy the new _BOOT_MP.NDS onto your card.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by chishm on Sat Aug 13, 2005 5:59 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

Extract the files to your drive (desktop..whatever) .
<br/>
<br/>
first you need to put your MP3's that you want to listen to in the "files_gbfs" folder; theres a TEST.MP3 in that folder also ready so delete that and put all yours in there. in the end this will make a massive file with all your MP3's in it.

<br/>
Run the "WriteFiles_gbfs.bat" from a command line and it will generate the following file;

<br/>
_BOOT_MP_gbfs.ds.gba

Not going to happen. The GBAMP has 512KB of flash and that's it. The last time I checked, MoonShell is larger than that. Besides, with the number of updates being made it is easier to just over write the NDS file on the CF card. About the speed: As soon as you can see MoonShell (even the startup screen) it is fully loaded. It takes so long to start after that because it has to decompress the fonts and background.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded the newest version, well I hope he fixes soon. The thing that makes no since is that I have small jpegs that I transferred from my mobile phone that It can't display correctly, but there?s much larger files that I created in MS Paint that do display correctly. When I click on the pictures from my mobile phone the DS freezes. There?s an 8mb file jpeg that I open and it doesn't freeze but I don't see anything its just a giant black window.
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be hard to implement a play list feature or possibly the ability to automatically play the next song when the previous one has finished?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oops I was off actually it was a 800kb file ha-ha, the resolution is pretty big and I understand you can scroll and I can scroll through the image it just that all I see is a big black image instead of the image I?m suppose to be there. The Resolution if 1600x1200 I know its an extremely large file, but since I can open I was wondering if maybe its a bug rather than the fact that the image is to big, because I tried slightly larger files and those won't even open period. It would be great to have scaling feature and be able to run at least 1.5mb files in my case for the fact that my digital camera uses compact flash so I can view the pictures I taken via NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
My mobile pictures are like 32kbs or less and the max resolution of some of them is 600x480. I do notice under properties in the summary tab it does have an extra Property its called color presentation and the value is sRGB.

Erm, ok...on a hunch, I deleted the folder, re-extracted it from the zip, and prevented windows from writing a thumbs.db into it because of the bitmap in there...and now it works.  Not sure exactly why this would work this way, but why complain?

Ah ok, I got it now...there's a filesize limit.  That makes sense.  Try reducing the color depth of your bitmap to save space.  Here's mine:

Replace the .bmp file then run the WriteFiles_IMFS.bat file this will update the _BOOT_MP.nds in the same directory, flash the new _BOOT_MP.nds to you GBAMP then your done

It sounds like the problem I had.  The files you are writing to the ImpactFilesystem are too large.  Try deleting the NSF in there, make sure windows isn't putting a thumbs.db in there if you're using XP, and if all else fails reduce the color depth of your image (which should cut the size of the bitmap pretty well).
<br/>
<br/>
I assume this is happening because Moonshell requires a certain amount of free ram, so going over a certain size with the NDS binary would cause problems.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't exactly know what you mean with "grid like noise pattern " but video-output looks slightly better on the upper screen cause it hasn't the grainy look of the touchscreen.
<br/>
And wouldn't it be better to have the videoplayer-controls on the touchscreen while video itself is displayed on upper screen?

You make a movie with your digital camera and expect that the sound is good?It's pretty normal that the sound IS crappy on digital cameras(exept very expensive cameras w?th "good" micros).Maybe the sound is even compressed.
<br/>
<br/>
Download any movie(for example a game-movie from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gametrailers.com/" target="_blank">gametrailers</a>) and convert it to AVI with the free software "<a class="postlink" href="http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm" target="_blank">RAD Video Tool</a>".

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think this CODEC has great potential.  It already seems to be around GBAMP level, and sound sounds much nicer on the DS than it did via the GBAMP's regular software.  I tried around 5 anime openings/endings I had on my HD, they didn't look bad for the most part, although the grid-like artifacts made one of the videos really odd looking.  Oh yes, and I'm pretty impressed by the fact that you can move the video window around and the video still plays, heh.  I wasn't expecting that to work. :)

grrr...
<br/>
YOU are talking about the video itself but I am talking about the screen.
<br/>
The lower(bottom) screen looks slightly(just a little bit) grainier than the upper screen because of the touchscreen-feature.
<br/>
<br/>
Like shackynews and dozens of others posted:
<br/>
[quote=shackynews]The bottom screen is not as clear, but for good reason; it?s the one you touch. Because of that, it appears slightly grainy and not as bright. It might not even be worth mentioning if it wasn?t for the top screen shining brilliantly above it.

I have a whole bunch of AVIs encoded in DiVX...they work just fine.  O_o  The only codec I had problems with is the lossless HuffyUV codec, but I've found that codec can be a little odd outside of a program such as VirtualDub anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Wow, I probably need to adjust the FPS a bit because the audio desynced some in the space of the seven minute clip, but I just tried a widescreen clip of the movie Spirited Away at the highest resolution at I think it was 8 FPS...this looked superior to GBAMP in my opinion, very cool.  The grid artifact isn't that noticable at higher resolutions.  I did find a small bug though...on that clip at least part of the top of the screen wasn't covered in a black bar like it was in the lower res clips I also made...some of the video window in back of it was showing.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wow, sounds like he fixed the bug with the black bars in Widescreen video mode also..this fellow's fantastic. :)  What a jack of all trades also...getting into video compression/decompression, porting an MP3 library, just all the functions of Moonshell...I wish I knew how to program all these things.  I'm just a newbie though. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
