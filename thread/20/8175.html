    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just not sure where to start or if I should.  I have some decent experience with c++ and java programming, haven't done much visual programming, a bit with java.  I see there is some good tutorials written up, but I wouldn't really know if it's too difficult until I got some hardware and started trying some code out.  I have a EZF advance card, 256 one already, probably enough for general homebrew stuff, probably more than I would ever need anyway.   I don't have a ralink card, so I would either need to get one or a passme,  is it safe to just go ahead and get a passme2 or do I need to determine which ds version I have first and go from there, I have fw1.
<br/>
<br/>
So is it really hard to program on the ds or would I be fine with some c++ and java courses under my belt?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm 99% sure you're fine with a passMe2 on all hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS is fun to program for and you'll be fine with some C++. It would help a lot if you've programmed for something where you were a little closer to the hardware at some point, like an 8-bit home computer, but that certainly isn't required.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually finishing a game is a LOT of work, which is why the homebrew coders to homebrew games ratio is so bad. And the documentation is often incomplete or wrong, so if you're easily frustrated that might be an issue. But as long as you have realistic expectations I say go for it. If it turns out you aren't having fun you can probably just sell the passMe for about what you paid anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay cool, we learned some assembly in school, it was more about the hardware and basically just doing some basic programming stuff.  I've done some mapping for cs:s, and some 3d modelling as well, basically only dabbling in it, don't really know if I would make a game, but you never know, I wouldn't try jumping into programming for the ds with the expectations that I'm going to make mario kart ds or something lol.  Start small work my way up.  Thanks for the advice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are interested in developing for the ds, I say go for it. Things are only difficult if you don't know what your doing. Once you learn, those same things become simple. If you already know some c, then you're off to a good start. When I started coding for the ds my c was rusty at best, but I picked it up quick. Its all about dedicating yourself to something. 
<br/>
<br/>
  Getting started can sometimes be confusing, but once you get anything compiled and running on hardware you should be good to go. The devkit comes with a good amount of example code with everything from "hello world" to 3d tech demos. Plus, it is so much more satisfying to see your game running on an actual nintendo system than it is to just code something for the pc.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I also started programming.

Whats the main differences between libnds, ndslib and PA_Lib(which i've been using)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Compare ndslib/libnds and PA_Lib "Hello, world" examples and see for yourself ;) .</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ah, alright. 
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where I can find a good ndslib/libnds tutorial? 
<br/>
I'm currently using Aaron Roger's PA_Lib tutorial, which helped me make a cheap version of tic tac toe. 
<br/>
<br/>
A friend wants me to make a port of Halo Zero, so I'll need as much help (tutorial wise) as I can get.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's a completely different thing. You can't <span style="font-style: italic">PORT</span> it.
<br/>
You can only <span style="font-style: italic">REMAKE</span> it.
<br/>
<br/>
And try to code something better than just a TicTacToe game. Heck, I bet Halo Zero remake COULD be made for DS on PA_lib.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll only get frustrated by other libraries in case you aren't an advanced coder.

Yeah, well, call me stupid, I meant remake it from scratch and obviously not Port it :P
<br/>
<br/>
I've been working on stuff, but nothing too complicated. 
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldnt consider a newbie in C++, nor Java or Vis Basic, but I am not a Pro either. Im confident that I can make this work. 
<br/>
<br/>
The link you gave me seems to be down, or it must be my internet connection... 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help btw, Ill try it using PA_Lib, which was my first choice.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
