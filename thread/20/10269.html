    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't seem to get ANY GBA code to run on the M3 SD. I've used the GameManager every time to put them on my SD card, and have tried all combinations of options.
<br/>
<br/>
On the DS, I've tried running the games with both the start and A buttons, right after boot-up and also after hitting start to go into pure GBA mode.
<br/>
<br/>
Every app hangs, and I'm usually left with a black or white screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? Am I missing something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm...have you tried not using the Gamemanager?  As a rule of thumb I don't think homebrew and the gamemanager work well together...you shouldn't have to patch them in any way anyway.  (whoa...any way...anyway...that just sounds weird :P)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah you need to FAT32 format it
<br/>
<br/>
I also noted a small speedup in well everything when I did it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Snowy: I formatted my card to FAT32 as soon as I got it, so I think I'm okay in that department.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">E21 seems to work fine for me with PocketNES and GoombaColor. I used GameManager 21b to copy them over and everything is fine. I even got saved states to work 95% on GoombaColor with the M3 RTS patch. It works, but the video gets corrupted after a restore. I can get the video back with "restart" from the L-R menu.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
