    <h4>#48968 - headspin - Sun Jul 24, 2005 10:15 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are two original authors of STSpeech, namely A.D.Beveridge &amp; M.N.Day. It was ported from Atari ST 68k by a fellow named Stefan Stenzel. No ARM optimizations have been done yet, I really released it earlier than I wanted to and ran out of time to do any great improvements specifically for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Previous to this I had ported an old unix voice synth that uses phomeme contatination. The results are rather poor, but you can check it out yourself <a class="postlink" href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeaxs/ds/DSSpeech-concat.zip" target="_blank">here</a> and source is <a class="postlink" href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeaxs/ds/DSSpeech-src.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the source to STSpeech/DSSpeech, you must understand permission must be granted by the original authors, even though Stefan practically re-wrote the synth engine. I do not know if he is still even in contact with them. I have posted Stefan an e-mail requesting the source go public, and we will have to wait for a reply. I'm quite happy to give it away, but you have to respect all that have contributed.
<br/>
<br/>
The source was not simply handed over to me by Stefan. I gave Stefan detailed correspondence regarding my intentions for the port. The problem here is commercial use of the code, which is against Stefan's wishes (I guess). He was very gratious to spend so much time e-mailing back and forth with a "homebrew" author. He wen't on holiday after sending me some of the code (parts were missing), he got back and was ill for a short time. I started to reverse engineer the binary to get important phoneme data structures! He came through eventually and sent the .def files. After a bit of tweaking I got it compiling in Visual Studio 6. Then I ported, quite painlessly, to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
There is more to the story, but not really relevent to your question. But I was determined to get a friggen synth that didn't sound like Max Headroom on steroids. I think DSSpeech nearly gets there. But Stefan is the true genious behind this. I really should have a readme.txt with the ROM to explain all this!<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's what I want to do eventually, yes. The only tile based keyboard I've seen that I like is the DSLinux one by Pepsiman. I think I'll make one along these lines.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">headspin: I just checked out the DSspeech demo and its pretty cool. Reminds me of the old Speak &amp; Spell I had as a kid. If youre into that suff, the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.research.att.com/projects/tts/demo.html" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Natural Voices</a> are awesome. Check out Audrey (the UK Female voice). It almost sounds like a real person. It would be cool if these TTS engines could be used in a game to produce on-the-fly speech for say an RPG title. If the game characters were robots, for instance, it could make sense and add a cool feature to the game.  Oh, and the DSGoo was pretty cool too, I just wish it worked in real-time.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am definately into speech synths of all types and quite like AT&amp;T Natural Voices. Like you said, they are getting really good at sounding real now.
<br/>
<br/>
You should hear the synthesized woman on our Telstra phone service here in Australia, it's really good and the voice recognition system is damn accurate (finally). I'm not sure how it handles accents or speech impediments though.
<br/>
<br/>
DSGoo does work in realtime if you change the pen size to small. But I havn't got around to optimizing it yet, so perhaps I can release a faster version in the near future.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I really like this thing..though I do have a couple suggestions.
<br/>
<br/>
The keyboard's buttons should dim, or darken when they're clicked, and there should be a click sound similar to the NDS firmware's keyboard.. I just think it would be better (it felt weird typing and not hearing anything)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway this demo is really neat. It would be awesome to actually have a voice synthesizer kinda like Microsoft's Agent's, but that's probably impossible. Perhaps in the future if you do add different engines though, you can give the ability to choose between voices (or engines i guess would be a better way to put it)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, awesome demo :) I love showing these things off to my friends and have them go like, "Oh my god..that kicks ass, now I want a DS"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice ideas about adding the sound and highlight of the keys. I will add that when I get some spare time.
<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn't be too hard adding either, since the sound is just playing a sample, and the highlight is just switching palettes for the appropriate tiles.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=warhawk" target="_blank">Warhawk DS</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mmll" target="_blank">Manic Miner: The Lost Levels</a> | <a class="postlink" href="http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=tdg" target="_blank">The Detective Game</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
