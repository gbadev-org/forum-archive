    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm working on a game which is called Ninja Scream (right now), and would like to get some comments and ideas for it. 
<br/>
<br/>
You can download the demo here, and also read a bit about what is planned so far.

<br/>
In short the current demo allows you, as the ninja sensei, to walk around the map (use the touchscreen) asking, via the microphone, ninja students to join you  (I like to scream NINJAAA), and then, after they have joined, you can find a panda and ask a ninja student to mount it (I like to scream MOUNT!). The speech recognition is really really simple at the moment - you can say anything, and the game will just guess what it is. Be sure to look at the student you are talking to though, or he wont hear you. 
<br/>
<br/>
Comments very welcome :-)

Oh, and the L-button is used for throwing shurikens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just put some work in the textures, no offence, but they're kinda "spartan".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Maybe his brakes are broken though, I dunno, he just seems kinda sluggish (going from walking to standing)
<br/>
Still, the controls were quite nice.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I liked the control scheme and the fogging effect :).  I was getting strange mic readings though; I actually didn't have to yell into the mic to get the ninjas to join me, or for them to mount the pandas, they just kind of did it on their own.  The avg mic reading was at 125 while I was silent, so maybe something was funky with my hardware?  I'm running it off of WMB, if that's any help.

Keep up the good work!  Your description of the future work looks especially cool.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, that seems to be a normal reading for the mic.
<br/>
<br/>
But nonetheless, it's a great first step... of course, the fact that I screamed "TURNIP" to recruit ninja disciples and whispered "BANANA" to get one to mount the panda made it kinda funny...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WHICH IS MY SUGGESTION: Make it humourous... I love games that don't take anything seriously...<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e", 
<br/>
7 is not a "t", 
<br/>
1 is not an "l",

Looks like a more dynamic average is needed for the microphone readings. I just used 128 for average / silence.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
