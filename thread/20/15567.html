    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now, I'm messing around with a hex editor on my DS, decided to run ds linux really quick, used the whole DF command to check memory and it found two files. so on the hex editor, I decided to experiment. Those two files (/dev/rom0 and /dev/dldi1) were able to be opened in the hex editor, and I was wondering what those two files actually are seeing how I don't have a director of /dev, nor any files named rom0 or dldi1. I noticed in the rom0 there were alot of lines in ascii that said rom* (* meaning a different number each time). Would the rom0 file be the firmware or rom on the games N music card, or just a file temporarily created on the SD card? Just wondering if I found anything special xD<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So its nothing special? darn :(
<br/>
<br/>
edit: well... the reason I thought I coulda found something special was because (even though for what ever reason, my DS is being stupid and is having problems with telling the amount of memory used and saying there is no memory left on the card) they both had a memory number. One was I do believe 400 some kilobytes (or bytes... I can't remember, which was the rom0) and the other had 120mb (about 122000kb as it said, which was the dldi1), which is the exact memory number on my SD card.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

I'm guessing you're right because that sounds like what it should be, so I'm going to go with you on that one :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

<br/>
<br/>
But I have a question that has nothing to do with linux, I have a hexfile of the DS firmware, is there anyway to turn this into a .nds file to mess around with? :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

In order for modified firmware to recognize a hot-swapped DS Game Card, it would have to include a dumper. Right now, the firmware relies on a dumper hidden in a double-secret part of the BIOS.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The firmware can be read, as an application called fwver uses it to check the version and also print a cake on the users birthday :-)
<br/>
<br/>
/dev/rom0, as pepsiman said earlier, is the romfs which contains all the applications that are needed for DSLinux before the DLDI device is mounted.  This is appended to the end of the dslinux.nds file during compilation and gets loaded into RAM during boot.

You can't use cp to copy /dev/firmware because it doesn't work like that.  Try using dd instead.  Post a new topic over on the DSLinux forums if you want more assistance</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
