    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Been watching the forums for awhile &amp; I've got a bit of a problem.  I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to run the DS Wireless Multiboot on a Mac?  I would love to try out some of the DS Demo Station downloads.  If it can't, I'll just wait until I get a MacBook Pro and instal Win XP with BootCamp.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you should not use wifime. I don't think it's possible on Mac, and PassMe is good. Wifime costs around the same price as passme and a gbamp: 
<br/>
<br/>
WifiMe=$30+, lots of hassle, can't take it anywhere. 
<br/>
<br/>
PassMe and GBAMP=$43-ish, very little hassle, can take it anywhere, homebrew bliss.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But then you need to buy another DS at a pawn shop if <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/#takemeout" target="_blank">TakeMeOut</a> on your DS goes yellow or magenta.

The Tetris normal demo isn't much to write home about, and Tetris Push is equivalent to 2-player t*tr*s that lowers the other player's ceiling (and raises yours) when you make &gt;=2 lines. Pokemon Trozei is Ditto's Cookie.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
