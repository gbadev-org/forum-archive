Is there a place that I can look to figure out, specifically, what routers / settings the NDS Wifi Lib works with?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had success with a Linksys WRT54G router, and if so, how?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
I tried to connect to my neighbour's unprotected (read: public access -- according to Windows!) wireless router, but it seems to have recently been changed to having Mac filtering, so I can't use it as a test anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
<br/>
Nope, still can't connect.
<br/>
I'm on 128-bit WEP, and I have tried both with and without DHCP.
<br/>
WifiLibTest.nds tells me that it can't connect almost instantly...
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... it seems to be replacing my ASCII WEP key with a few numbers followed by a bunch of zeros. I wonder if that's right...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an Linksys WRT54G, and with the DS Wifi test application,
<br/>
<br/>
I also get the error COULD NOT CONNECT TO AP (only when using WEP).
<br/>
If I do not have WEP enabled, then it works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
In a current project I am working on, I managed to authenticate (with WEP) and associate with the Linksys WRT54G, and ping the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
So, something in DS Wifi lib is causing this bug, and I'm not sure what exactly it is. However, I'd say be patient, I'm sure this will be fixed sooner or later.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I just got a bit impatient with all these amazing apps that I'm reading about, hence this :)
<br/>
Good to see that the problem isn't just mine... and that this router is somewhat common.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

You will need a PC to retreive settings off
<br/>
<br/>
Start --- Run  --- cmd
<br/>
<br/>
type "cd C:\"
<br/>
Press Enter
<br/>
type "ipconfig /all"
<br/>
Scroll down to Local Area Connection
<br/>
<br/>
On the DS
<br/>
<br/>
Go to settings on your Wifi connection
<br/>
<br/>
Click no on Automatically obtain IP address
<br/>
Type in what you see in the correct selections copying what you see on you PC
<br/>
For IP address add 5 onto the last number
<br/>
<br/>
Start your program and it should work
<br/>
<br/>
Worked for me anyway (on beup, dissonance and wifi lib)<br/>_________________<br/>White DS --- Supercard SD --- Passcard ---

<br/>
Are your routers the Linux versions or the other ones?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what hardware versions are they?
<br/>
Mine is... the newer one... which brings me to the off topic portion of this post:
<br/>
Is Linksys run by apes? They have one router model name which applies to what I believe is 5 hardware versions, with the latest version (my version) being incompatible with Firmware Upgrades for lower hardware versions.
<br/>
Does anyone else think it's a bit idiotic and confusing when the end user is left referring to what could be 2 totally different routers by the same name?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the wifi lib.
<br/>
So... I guess I'm the only one with a wireless router but no online homebrew :(
<br/>
Oh well... looks like a known missing functionality, anyway, since it's figuring out to give up instantly.
<br/>
(Either that or a nutty bug... seems a bit odd, nonetheless. Maybe it's telling me something!).
<br/>
<br/>
I recall that I had managed to connect with my router without WEP once using the older Wifi Lib Test.
<br/>
I didn't explore much beyond that, though, since there weren't many/any homebrew apps at the time using it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Leaning out a window connected me successfully to my neighbour's "public" wireless Internet -- just needed a decent signal for that one.
<br/>
...So that's a bit of pain relieved.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I may as well bump this thread to spread this bit of good news.
<br/>
This was recently posted on Slashdot: <a class="postlink" href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS6352077661.html" target="_blank">http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS6352077661.html</a>
<br/>
A group has managed to create a software hack to put the Linux firmware on the v5 WRT54g router (versions 1-4 used Linux, but v5 does not). What this means is that the router can now be modified to be much much better.
<br/>
These links should give you a good idea of what all this means, why the Linux firmware is so much better, and why this router became so popular even though it seems to be the only thing that doesn't like the nds wifi lib:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3562391" target="_blank">http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3562391</a>

<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is:
<br/>
Is there a chance that this router with a much better firmware would still be having those troubles with the wifi lib?
<br/>
I haven't yet gotten around to trying it out, but maybe someone else has :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suppose you have a router from the good old days before Linksys cut the RAM and storage space in half and put on their much hated proprietary VXWorks firmware. (Which is the reason why the hacked version 5 router needs DD-WRT Micro, which is a special, lightweight firmware and still isn't the same as the older ones).
<br/>
<br/>
Still, good to hear that problems like this are fixable through firmware!
<br/>
Once the various people with whom I share this router get back, I'll somehow persuade them to try this. (We all hate the thing, so I'm sure nobody would mind if it got bricked).
<br/>
Oh, and no: It was not me who made the foolish decision to buy the VXWorks version as opposed to the WRT54GL :(<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
