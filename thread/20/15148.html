I assume you're talking about the following procedure: <ol type="1"><li>Insert R4. </li><li>Run Nitro Hax. </li><li>Eject R4 and insert an <span style="font-weight: bold">authentic</span> Nintendo DS Browser card into SLOT-1. </li><li>Select a patch for Nintendo DS Browser that allows it to use a third-party RAM pak in SLOT-2, such as SuperCard or EZFlash. </li><li>Boot SLOT-1. </li></ol>
<br/>
Such a procedure would <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> work for a GBA Game Pak. Here's why: Official GBA Game Paks with SRAM have 32 KiB of RAM. The Nintendo DS Memory Expansion Pak has 8,192 KiB of RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
Why are you trying to use a RAM pak other than the Memory Expansion Pak that came with your <span style="font-weight: bold">authentic</span> Nintendo DS Browser card? Is it that all copies of Nintendo DS Browser in your region have the smaller Memory Expansion Pak for DS Lite and you have an original style DS?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry guys, i know it may look like piracy but no. I understand what you think though. I use mr R4 purley for homebrew. When my friend lost his RAM card I asked him if I could have it because I thought there may be some way to fix it being that I like DIY projects, but I suck at programing which is primarily why I subscribed to this forum. Being that I dislike the fact of feeeling unwelcome to this forum I wish to clear up this subject.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if this were possible, we'd do it just because we could, all questions of legality aside.
<br/>
<br/>
However, like others have said, it's not possible because GBA games are made of read only memory (aside from the very small section of SRAM for saving), so it wouldn't be possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Along these lines, Neo Geo Pocket carts apparently actually are using some kind of flashable memory to hold the game ROM as well as the save memory and there was some work done on turning commercial NGPC carts into flash carts, but it never really came up with anything since there's some protection bits set on the majority of the memory that won't allow you to re-write the chips without a hell of a lot of work.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Speaking of which, I was thinking about something the other day. What does Opera use that RAM for? If we can hack it to use the RAM of some other slot-2 card, with 32MB instead of 8, I wonder how hard it would be to hack it to use all 32MB, or if that would even do any good?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Fair enough. You have two options: <ul><li>Buy a replacement RAM card from Nintendo. (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Nintendo+DS+Browser+Memory+Card+original+site%3Anintendo.com&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" target="_blank">Search</a>) </li><li>Buy a SLOT-2 SuperCard or M3 (which also lets you run homebrew) and use <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14039" target="_blank">Chishm's booter</a>. </li></ul>
<br/>
As far as anybody who has posted here can tell, Opera uses that RAM to cache the downloaded documents that make up the page.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
