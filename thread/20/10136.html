    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been wondering about this for awhile. Darkain's <a class="postlink" href="http://www.darkain.com/nintendo_ds/nifi.php" target="_blank"> site</a> says the DS uses a subset of 802.11b, as it uses only 1 - 2 Mbps and only short preamble.
<br/>
<br/>
But then wouldn't that be under the 802.11 Legacy standard? Or did Legacy only use long preamble?
<br/>
<br/>
It always seemed to me that one of the reasons the DS does not have perfect compatibility with WLAN hardware could be because it was using Legacy, and not actually 802.11b. Or is the fact that it only uses short preamble enough to cause this, as short preamble was only optional in the B spec (but then, 802.11g has to support both long and short, so that would not explain why some G routers don't work).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interesting article. From what I can gather the DS does use 802.11b, only cannot do TCP/IP (unless the game takes care of this itself, like the online titles do), and only short preamble. Titles that can be played wireless but not online use the Ni-Fi thingamabob, and don't need a router at all (perhaps for supporting more players?).
<br/>
<br/>
Do some 802.11g routers not work at all with online DS games, even if they are configured properly? If so there might be some problem with the TCP/IP programmed into the game?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So it is a software option as Darkain suggests? Does it change between short and long preamble when going from local to WiFi mutiplayer? Short preamble for speed in local multi, long preamble for higher router compatibility?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
