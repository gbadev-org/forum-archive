<a href="http://www.cncds.worldoffokkers.nl/" target="_blank">http://www.cncds.worldoffokkers.nl/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody know what happened to it?
<br/>
Looked like a great project but the forum went dead mid to late 2007.
<br/>
Somebody pickup this project or somehow contact who was working on it to see if he can post his source code and binaries.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be an awesome homebrew game!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i have him in my MSN messenger, will ask what he has done to the project when he comes online. But he's working for a game developper and is doing this project unpaid in some spare time, i think that's the reason he stopped developping it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
