    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no generall discussion for DS anymore. There is only DS Development, and Flash Equipment. 
<br/>
<br/>
So this section would be about generall discussion while the DS Development is now strictly used for development related discussion.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The original DS general development talk is now renamed. It was becoming to cluttered with threads that didnt really belong there (IMO), but still didnt fit into the DS Flash equipment forum. This might be a temporary fix. We will see how it works out :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A mapping from GBA forums to the corresponding DS forums might be helpful for people to understand the new forum. For example, start with something like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Coding, Beginners, Graphics, Audio -&gt; DS development
<br/>
Flash Equipment -&gt; DS Flash Equipment
<br/>
<br/>
The old one was easier because it corresponded directly to (GBA) Flash Equipment.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is good. Now I can read the development forums again without secretly wanting to stab someone. I'd like there to be a clear seperation between actual development topics and suggestion/request/idea type threads. But I guess this should do a good enough job of that.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think its a good idea to split off the forum sections, but just adding a DS misc section doesn't seem to fit some of the posts. My suggestion is to map the sections out like this:
<br/>
<br/>
DS Development: For posts about actual DS development, coding questions, dev environment setup, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
DS Hardware: For posts about Flash equipment, PassMe, FlashMe, new products like M3, G6, etc. 
<br/>
<br/>
DS Software: For homebrew releases, downloads, questions/suggestion about existing software, ideas for new games/apps.
<br/>
<br/>
DS General Chat: For posts that dont belong anywhere else. This would include posts like "Should I buy a DS?", general DS/Nintendo news, discussion of commercial games ("Metroid Hunters is the Shite!!!"), and other chat topics. 
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the topics moved to this section dont exactly belong here either and it seems like it may cause some confusing to new users. The 4 sections I outlined above would solve both problems and be a good solutuion for the time being.
