    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi
<br/>
I have a problem with my ds, it won't boot, no green light, nothing
<br/>
I tried with the ac plugged in, no success. The battery does charge (orange light) but the ds doesn't.
<br/>
I never tried to flashme, I took good care of it but it stopped working right after I plugged in my brand new m3 (but the m3 didn't have any sd in it, I just wanted to see how it fitted in
<br/>
I bought my ds in France, now I'm in the us, do you think that the problem can be because of the different volt?
<br/>
Do you think that buying a new battery will work?
<br/>
Do you have any idea of what I should do?
<br/>
Thx
<br/>
<br/>
PS: This is a grey ds, old firmware</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If you are, then remember that the battery may need a fair amount of charging before the DS will switch on. If the battery was at zero, then just plugging in AC is not enough, you need to leave it to charge 10-15 minutes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think that may be the problem but the ds seems to charge, there is the orange light and the charge stops when it's full.
<br/>
I tried with the charger plugged in, it didn't work
<br/>
I don't know what to do, it looks like I'll have to send it back to nintendo</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

North American AC power runs at half voltage (115V in NA vs 230V in Europe) and it might confuse your adapter. Find another source of 5V.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
