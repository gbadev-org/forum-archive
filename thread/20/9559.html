    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Im using the dpgtools to convert avi to dpg.  When i convert it, the audio comes out of sync on the final product.  audio is in sync in original avi, avi is in 23.96 fps if that helps at all.  I thought maybe if i played with the settings in dpgtools would help, but i cant find anything to work.  
<br/>
<br/>
also, if anyone could tell me some optimal settings to use, ie fps, bitrate, etc. that would be greatly apreciated
<br/>
<br/>
I tried searching for these, got through 5 pages of search results, didnt find anything.  
<br/>
<br/>
also tried demuxing audio, conv to wav, then using dpgenc to encode video and audio, same out of sync result.  the video is also very choppy, size doesnt matter so any settings for better quality are ok with me
<br/>
<br/>
thx in advance[/img]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have the FPS really high it is going to be choppy.
<br/>
<br/>
the settings I have on there right now are: video width as 256, bitrate as 192, FPS as 18, audio bitrate as 160.  I know these work and the video runs fine...just try tweaking it to find the right balance for you.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Only audio was playing ~1sec out of video (<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9492" target="_blank">look here my results</a>). EDIT: Tough, it's not fullscreen, only 256x96 playing at 24fps.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
