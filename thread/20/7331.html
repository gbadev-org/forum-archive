    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wow very nice,  i've noticed your using an out of date cf driver and hence theres no m3 support for this game.  I like the fact that all the assets are loaded from the cf card that should allow for some serious customisation/expansion potential.  With a little work i can imagine this'll be a mainstay and quite a few peoples ds's</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

@Chetic sorry i should have put set up instructions in the download folder after downloading and unraring the main file unrar the break out folder inside to the cf card so your sf card shold look like this.
<br/>
<br/>
root.....
<br/>
break out 
<br/>
and all the other folders on your root
<br/>
............
<br/>
<br/>
then inside the break out folder all the breakout reasources.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can you set it up so that all of your folders aren't in the root? Perhaps have a BreakOutMania folder or something, and then have all your other folders in there. Just a suggestion, because I have a bunch of files on my CF card, and having to add 9 more folders to the root for a single game is most undesirable and would render my folder organization less usable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, in that case, off to load it on my CF card. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, that didn't work. I extracted BREAK_OUT_MANIA.rar to the root of my CF card (so all the resources are in the BREAK_OUT_MANIA folder), and the top screen is black and the bottom screen is white. Tried it through Moonshell, and even renamed breakoutMANIA.nds to _BOOT_MP.nds. Same results.

The folders look correct. In my root directory there's a folder BREAK_OUT_MANIA, and then in that folder are the resources. You mention level1 without a file extensions. All of the level files in the levels folder have .txt file extensions.
<br/>
<br/>
Trying it on a clean, freshly formatted CF card ...
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this time I got two white screens. Maybe using the new CF libraries will help. I'll wait and see if those fair any better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That worked for me. :)
<br/>
<br/>
But I had the problem with the paddle, where if I hit the ball on the right side of the paddle, it only went straight up. If I hit the ball on the left side of the paddle, it would bank to the left.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
unfortunatly the paddle problem is one of the areas that the first version was better im using fixed point sin and cos and im losing a little precision the ball should bounce like this.

<br/>
<br/>
i was thinking of using a tilemode insted of doublebuffered pixel ploting but i dont know much about the tilemodes on the ds or the gba.
<br/>
<br/>
i also tried dropping all my sprites in oam but i could only get a max of around fifteen 16bit sprites before they started going a little funny and stoped drawing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If you have any experience with curses or conio on the PC, and you want to learn about Nintendo's tile modes, I'd suggest starting on the GBA using either ansi_console or agbtty.
