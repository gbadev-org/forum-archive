    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm using a pci wifi card to get my ds and my brother's online and it works without a hastle (I also use it for mine and my gf's laptop). But when I want to play Animal Crossing: Wild World with my brother through NWFC, the visiting player gets an error, saying the DS can't connect to the WFC network or some 80430-error, thus undocumented. I've tried a lot of things in the Kerio router software we use, but nothing seems to help. 
<br/>
Both DS'es get a IP I assigned to them with the router software, but even this doesn't matter, if I reserve no IP or set a static ip on the DS the problem stays.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone here has an idea, what I'm doing wrong? I noticed both DS'es have the same name (NintendoDS) maybe this could be a problem, but I would find it to stupid to be a problem ;).
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want the answer: use ds-to-ds because I have some online friends who visit in my village and then my brother likes to join us.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nah, it's a problem in WFC itself ... Should be fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways why don't you use DS to DS?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Got the same error code (80430). It was the firewall itselft so was the problem, I opned so ports and allow UDP. Then it worked.
<br/>
The best way to fix the problem, is that you visit a town, instead that you open your town to visit.
<br/>
<br/>
But when I search after the error code, it stood this:

Error Code: 80430
<br/>
<br/>
A network communication error occurred during the matchmaking process. 
<br/>
What to do (Home): 
<br/>
<br/>
If this error occurs only once in awhile or if you are at a Hotspot location, it is likely due to congestion on the internet or a connection problem being experienced by you or the other player(s). 
<br/>
<br/>
To ensure the connection isn't dropping on your end, check the following: 
<br/>
Low battery power on the Nintendo DS (the light changes from green to red when battery power is low).
<br/>
Signal strength from the access point is low. Move closer and try again.
<br/>
Check for wireless interference. Devices such as cordless phones and microwave ovens should not be in use.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are experiencing this error every time you try to connect, there could be a problem related to your firewall. For more information on firewalls and the Nintendo WFC, click here.

<br/>
And what ports did you open? In the firewall I allowed _all_ traffic on the DS'es addresses but then I get the other error. Well, it did work one day, I dunno why, but now I (obviously) got the problem again.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
