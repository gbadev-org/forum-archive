All audio/video to one DS screen, right?
<br/>
<br/>
Actually it seems to be for DS and Lite. Look at the picture.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm guessing it runs on the DS in GBA Mode.. which isn't really all bad.. I mean.. the screen is only a little bit bigger than GBA SP res..
<br/>
<br/>
But, that doesn't mean it probably couldn't be hacked into a DS device with homebrew code running.. that is.. if you can directly access the hardware or someone hacks the hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wow, not much different than the thing I already have
<br/>
this is just a remake of something old for the GBA
<br/>
<br/>
It pretty much turns the GBA/NDS/LITE screen into a TV. You can plug in the 3 cords (yellow, white, and red cord, that plugs into TV's from consoles) into the gba cartridge and you can play any console using your handheld as a TV. You still use that consoles regular controler, and try to look closely at your small gba screen and play<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">they should think of doing it backwards i mean theres not realy a point who wants to play ssb on a little screen with 4 ppl?
<br/>
<br/>
by backwards i mean make the ds show on a tv/projector thus allowing recordable online matches in games like mario kart.
<br/>
<br/>
kind of like this but not in such a retarded way i don't know wtf they were thinking when they made this device i could do the same thing with a camera and some duck tape

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't mind having one..  I can't think of a real practical use, but it'd be nice for testing video equipment like VCRs, or that VGA to Composite video cable you (by you, I mean ME) just bought and can't seem to get the video card timing right for it to work and don't want to go upstairs to hook up to a real tv every time you make and adjustment.
<br/>
<br/>
Or.. another somewhat nice idea would be to hook up your auto DVD player into it so that you get your own screen for people with a single 7" display.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
