<br/>
<br/>
yes, i EVALUATED filesystems, but i never intended to create one.  and from my evaluation, it looks like i will probably be using FAT (or a close derivitive thereof) in the near future.
<br/>
<br/>
and isntead of waiting on others to do things, why not do it yourself now?

Or a better use for at a party would be as a remote control for Winamp....  (much safer than letting drunk people mess with the expensive PC that might be playing the music!)
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe show a jukebox-style view - album art/track list on the top screen, playlist and UI on the bottom? - could be neat.
<br/>
<br/>
Or for those with modded Xboxes, it could make a nice XBMC remote, so you can use the Xbox for mp3 playback without a TV?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am also interested in making a DJ app/game for the DS. One of the features that would be awesome would be to actually scratch on the touch screen to scratch a record. Elekoplankton has real-time sound filters (where you record a sample and distort it) so I'm sure it is possible on the DS. There are a bunch of things that would need to be coded, heres my list:
<br/>
<br/>
- An MP3 player for the DS (which may require some sort of file-system)
<br/>
- Pitch control (to slow down or speed up the MP3)
<br/>
- Real-time sound filtering (to simulate scratching, fx boards, etc.)
<br/>
<br/>
This will probably be the first full featured app I will create for the DS, but I have a lot of learning to do before I can get to that point. All my work will be open-source so maybe we can work together to get this up and running.

Price is just like 10?... what is like... uuhh... about 8 or 9USD

Just rip off that cable and you'll have sound Input/Output directly to your DS.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the link. Modding that device may come in handy. It could be used for live MCing (aka rapping) over the live mix. Maybe with a little work you can mod the headset to send the left signal to the headphones and the right to aux output. That way you could cue up on the DS but ouput to your PC, stereo, DAT recorder, whatever. It obviously wouldn't be pro sound equipment, but it may be a really cool bonus to an already solid portable.

The headset jack next to the headphone jack on the front of the DS is just a normal line-in connection.
<br/>
<br/>
If you connect it to either a good microphone, or a line-in (which is then connected to an MP3 player, stereo, etc) the DS turns off the built-in mic and uses whatever is connected.
<br/>
<br/>
Using this concept, I built both a headset for the DS (usless since an offical one will eventually come, but I was bored) and more importantly, an adaptor to connect a standard 3.5 mm jack to the DS headset port.
<br/>
<br/>
I used it to feed Electroplankton audio.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah, now that is a bit of a story.
<br/>
<br/>
I started with the audio cable from a CD-ROM drive (2 conductor, two male ends). I cut it in half lengthwise, so that I had two plugs each with 2 conductors.
<br/>
<br/>
I then slowly filed the plastic down until: A. the bottom side of each conductor was exposed through the plastic shell, and B. the plug actually fit into the DS's headset jack.
<br/>
<br/>
It is a bit hard to describe, my one digital camera can't focus on it because it is too small, but I'll try to get a picture with another one and see how it comes out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
