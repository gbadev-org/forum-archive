I still have some tweaks I want to finish up before releasing the binaries, and I also plan on releasing the source sometime soon too.  Until then, thanks again for all your help!

Absolutely!  I plan on drawing the automap there.  I also plan on moving the status bar to the bottom and putting the top in full screen.  You could then click on inventory and hopefully weapons to change these.  I currently have touch screen "mouse look" similar the the Metroid control.  However the X component seems noisy and jumps a little. (These two things are some of the tweaks I am working on)

I started from the source right off the Raven website.  I have not looked at the Doom source at all, however Raven licensened it from Id so I am sure they are very similar.  I did this as a learning experence of profesional game engines, so I did not use anybody else's previous source ports.

I will do more of this when I start a webpage.  I just took the Heretic source, broke it down into smaller pieces and started compiling it for DS, modifing expecially the drawing routines.  At one point, I will probably write a section on major items I ran into during this project (there were many).

Right now I believe it is running just below full frame rate.  I have not had it calculate the actual framerate yet.  I am worried about what other speed drops may incur when I add the automap.  I may be able to optimize my drawing routines, and I have also been thinking of ways to better utilize the ds hardware.  Right now it is a direct source port, so no hardware acceleration.

I have actually downloaded and looked over the Q2 source.  As much knowledge I had about game engines when I started this project, I currently have about working in 3D.  Although it is something I also want to explore.  However, I want to take this project to completion before I start anything else.

<br/>
I can understand your eagerness for this.  There are just some issues I would like to clean up before I release it.  It is just not quite the quality I want out there.  There are still some textures that are not loading up right, you can not progress through the levels, and not all actions are available through the ds controls (like changing weapons).  Rest assured though, I would not have posted yet if I was not close to releasing something.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by jmva16 on Fri Jul 29, 2005 11:11 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

I am doing this a little right now, but it is still not as good as I would like it.  The Metroid control is so good and smooth.  Mine has stopped jumping so much, but now I don't feel you have as fine control as you should.  How fast you can sample the touch screen?

Heretic and Hexen both use modified Doom engines.
<br/>
Duke Nukem and Blood use the Build engine.. Last I checked, Blood's source wasn't available. Duke's source is available, tho.
<br/>
<br/>
Cleaned up versions of both codebases are available under the GPL. Honestly, it'd be nice to see one of the more advanced Doom engines ported to the DS, which supports Doom, Doom2, Heretic, and Hexen. There's a few that can handle the whole set. Not sure if a comprehensive engine like that would be fun to port, tho.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Doom2 had very little different on the core engine side. Mostly content differences. A lot of stuff done for Doom2 code-wise was also released for Doom1.
<br/>
<br/>
There were some different effects from some of the new monsters, and there was the double-barreled shotgun, but these differences are trivial.
<br/>
<br/>
This is reflected in the fact that pretty much all ports of Doom can run both 1 and 2 as long as you have the data for each.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I don't recommend trying to work this from scratch on the Hexen angle.. There are already ports out there that have been cleaned up to make the tree more platform independent. I can't recall any offhand, but I know they're out there. And that's not including the trees that manage all four games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

FYI, I actually started on a Hexen port after I saw someone was doing <b style="color:#FFA34F">Heretic</b>. I'd been trying to think of a project and it struck me as a good idea.

Runs alright in most areas, but a bit too slow for comfort in more complex ones. Also need to get the controls nailed down, add support for savegames via sram, and whatever else comes up. Just thought I'd mention it so I don't suddenly release it in a couple weeks and make someone feel terrible for spending all of their time on a port.

Anyway, I am using Mode 5 when drawing.  I set aside some space in VRAM to write the view in, then copy it into the screen VRAM space.  Is there a way to write to a back buffer and fip it to the front instead?  This way I would not have to do the copy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Two possible ways:
<br/>
1. Change the data offset of the BG between two different memory locations
<br/>
2. Use two separate BGs and turn them off/on</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's nice to see that someone has gotten it work, I was planning on starting it this weekend when I had a decent amount of spare time to go over everything.  How far through is it all?

Well, like I said, still slow in some areas and lacking specific functionality. I haven't really had the chance to work on it since I made that last post, I'll probably start working on speeding it up this coming weekend.

I'm really looking forward seeing <b style="color:#FFA34F">Heretic</b> and Hexen running DS!!!
<br/>
I love both games just as much.
