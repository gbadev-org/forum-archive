It will need the same wifi-card and driver used for wireless downloads to the ds. You will need 2 DS transferring data in pictochat to test, since the pc does not actively communicate, it does only sniff the packets.
<br/>
<br/>
NO USE to test it with only one DS !
<br/>
<br/>
And, the Pictures will be scrambled a little .... See the decoded.bmp file

Same here, but if you run FreeBSD or don't mind a bit of porting, you can give pictosniff 
<br/>
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/pictosniff/" target="_blank">http://freshmeat.net/projects/pictosniff/</a>
<br/>
a try. It's on Freshmeat and GPL. I haven't tried it, but I think, you can trust that (and/or read the source).

Intresting ! I did not know this already exists.
<br/>
Could someone get the source and post it as .zip?
<br/>
<br/>
I will upload My source here:

<br/>
you have to be on channel 1, room A. (both ds !)
<br/>
The RT2560 Driver by Tim Schuerewegen must be installed.
<br/>
<br/>
as soon as "raw data found" shows up,
<br/>
see the decoded.bmp file. (double click it)
<br/>
<br/>
New hack does "auto-open" the picture, 
<br/>
and doesent break when some packets are repeated or missing.
<br/>
<br/>
Large pictures get cut. Bug is known.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by paco1234 on Fri Nov 25, 2005 1:41 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Yep, this would be intresting, especially if he releases the sources. 
<br/>
A sniffer is much simpler to build than than a "server".
<br/>
<br/>
But, when sgstair manages the tcp-ip on the DS, and maybe releases a lib for the DS, we will see the instant message clients running on the DS with no need of a PC to translate. This will be a lot better than pictochat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I worked a little in the wmb for Linux and it seems that the begining of the Pictochat connection is the same as a wifi download (Auth then Assoc ...).
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know were i can find a connection capture beetween 2 DS for a pictochat ???
<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if we could make a pictochat server =)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT : OKi i modified my sender application for pictochat and the connection procedure works well !
<br/>
Now i have to send specific datas to the DS for it to know my name, etc ... but i don't have any pictochatting capture ...
<br/>
The keep alive procedure seems to be already working and of course it's logic (Beaconing) 
<br/>
So i'm in need of pictochat connection capture files !!!
<br/>
<br/>
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP =) !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
