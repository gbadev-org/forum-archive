    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">COLORS! issues....
<br/>
I went to their FAQ page and it read that all my .png files would be in the "colors" folder.. 
<br/>
Getting scared cause there is NO colors folder on the card. 
<br/>
<br/>
I can save on the DS..playback on the DS... but once i look at the card on my puter there is nothing there.
<br/>
<br/>
Help! :(

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First, you should probably contact the Colors! creator, not post here :p But is your Colors! Dldi patched? and, do you have the colors folder set to hidden? if you have it set to hidden, make sure your computer is authorized to view hidden folders?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):
