Right.. and then he'll want to see the code for it too, won't he?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd much, much rather see a new wifilib, beaup, snezzi, or batchdpg than have someone waste their time on this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Guys, he's not asking for US to hack it, he's asking if we know of an instance where someone had and possibly a video for proof. He probably saw the Mario Kart track hacking and thought this would be a good place to ask if we knew of something like this. He didn't say 'Would one of you hack Metroid so I can prove a point to my friend?' Just a simple 'No, we don't know of any time where anyone has hacked the game, but that doesn't mean it can't be done' would've been fine. I just don't want this guy coming off as bad when he wasn't requesting any work to be done from us, only knowledge.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Given that the other moderators allow the DipStar topic to remain open, you probably know the answer to that question :-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.
<br/>
-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think MPH is as easy as replacing the level data...I tried that, didn't work.  Did on the demo, but not the normal 'full' version of the game.  I need to try again sometime, I'm sure I might figure something out.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
