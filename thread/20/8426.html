    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have seen a demo for an swf player on the DS. It got me thinking - what if you could play SWF games on your DS and set the controls using a good interface. Some flash games are not big and do not require that much memory. I believe that the DS is fully compatible of this task. I tried having ago at programing but I am completely useless so I was wondering if any of you amazing DS programmers could maybe program a app to do this, it would be a break through and would increase the dimensions of the hombrew world to a whole new level.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S Which flash game would you play on the DS

Madness Interactive has trouble running on lots of computers, so we'd probably have to put up with about 6FPS on an interactive video.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Have to disagree as well... and point to our game "Heliattack3" <a href="http://www.miniclip.com/heliattack3.htm" target="_blank">www.miniclip.com/heliattack3.htm</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The main problem is the lack of real bitmap video support in flash players below version 8. Too much action on the screen will kill the flash players speed quickly. 
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you are looking for an easy way to code games for the DS and don't want to use too much action it might work...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wasn't really able to get too far in the game you linked, but I like the idea. TickleGirl was originally a flash game I ripped and remade for the ds, so yes, it is entirely possible.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, off the topic of adult-oriented content, and back on topic of Flash in general.
<br/>
<br/>
Kevenc: your demo is awesome. If you could somehow get it to show at a smoother frame rate, and perhaps have sound, that would be awesome. Since flash uses MP3 audio streams mostly anyway, can't you just use libmad like MoonLight did for MoonShell?
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be awesome if say, this code could be adapted for moonshell so that, if say, someone played an SWF file in MoonShell, it would actually playback the flash animation. Action script isn't too important, but things like basic action script should be implemented, if only so people can navigate the Flash menus. :) Are you still working on this project? I for one would LOVE to see this completed. It's too bad you couldn't somehow get antialiased, or at least mid-quality-styled vector-based drawing working at a decent framerate. Ah well. It's still a really cool demo.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Yes, I have played your game, and I liked it very much.  That's where i get the idea porting this h-game to DS.  I'm not a programmer therefore all i can do is asking people who good at programming like you guys to help porting this game.  I think it's a very good for DS, if you do program it, could you please spost it on your website.  Thank you first.

BTW, did you say Powerpoint presentation?  A Powerpoint presentation would be awsome, then i could put all me college lecture into my DS.  It's a pain in a butt to print them out.  A pewerpoint for DS is really really really awsome</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The problem being, the actionscript library isn't exactly small. And it is enough that one or two functions aren't implemented for it to get stuck at the loader (heck, I've seen loaders using sin and cos inside a class!). And, of course, ignoring the fact that the flash spec *loves* floats, and we all know how much the DS likes them. Heck, Flash 4 only uses strings that should be transformed to floats! I think full actionscript was definitely meant for higher end machines.

Antialiasing for flash is a pain in the ass. Think about this:
<br/>
When you draw a white circle over a black background, you can AA the borders without problem. Now cut the circle in half. When both parts are drawn, you'd expect it to look exactly as when you drew the whole circle. But when you draw the first half, the inner border gets AA'd, and when the second half is drawn, the second inner border gets AA'd <span style="font-style: italic">over</span> the first one. Meaning that you get an ugly darker line in the middle of the circle where the cut was. Almost all paths are like that in Flash. Though it does give you ways to solve that (each edge contains info about what color is at each side), but I never managed to do it fast enough. Or maybe it's just that I suck.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and about the decent framerate: the demo wasn't optimized for the DS at all :); I still hadn't got my Supercard. It might run faster after a few tweaks (I've managed 15 fps with <a class="postlink" href="http://calicoelectronico.com/capitulos" target="_blank">Calico Electronico</a>!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's good to see that it's something you're interested in doing. Even if actionscript is impossible, an SWF player on the DS would still rock hardcore.

It would be a load of help if somebody could make a nds actionscript library (it doesn't have to include much although the bigger the better). By the way getting flash animations on your ds is not hard:
<br/>
1. Download a SWF to AVI converter
<br/>
2. Encode AVI to DPG
<br/>
3. Watch on moonshell
<br/>
<br/>
The only problem is that some animations have menu/loading screens. DOH!<br/>_________________<br/>White DS --- Supercard SD --- Passcard ---

Not bad.. If you could select between qualities with the select button, that would probably improve performance on the animation a bit..
<br/>
<br/>
I can see where the library doesn't..handle the layering very well. Ah well, It was quick so what should one expect :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Setting quality would improve smoothness of animation.

Im sure the sound would be possible if it could dump it into a pre-encoded stream..<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

Ditto that one :)
<br/>
<br/>
Be good for batch testing.
<br/>
Also, wouldn't it let you use larger files?
<br/>
<br/>
I think as far as action script goes the real needing thing is just pushing a button.
<br/>
So it needs to understand:
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">"on (release) {
<br/>
gotoAndPlay("Lazer",1);
<br/>
}"</span> and simerla things like it.
<br/>
<br/>
That's a fair step to take, but I don't think we need the whole action script working, just commands to do with starting/stopping and moving from scene to scene.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I mentioned that before, but apparently a lot of flash uses all sorts of actionscript in even the most basic menus. Though I wonder how well they would work if all the unsupported functions were just noops.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">GPLflash1 is quite limited, it contains features up to Flash 4. Here what the  README says:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">FEATURES
<br/>
--------
<br/>
<br/>
Limitations :
<br/>
  - The plugin and the player use XShm extensions, so remote display is not possible.
<br/>
  - Not all features in Flash &lt; 4 implemented (but no crash on Flash 4 files).
<br/>
<br/>
Not functional :
<br/>
  - No Morphing.
<br/>
  - No vertical anti-aliasing.
<br/>
<br/>
SOUND SUPPORT
<br/>
-------------
<br/>
<br/>
Limitations :
<br/>
  - No sound envelop. So no fading or balancing effect.
<br/>
<br/>
But the main feature is here and sound can be enjoyed.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
So no ActionScript available, though buttons work in SWFs I tried (like Xiao Xiao 5). Another problem is severe memory limitation. For example, Xiao Xiao 3 would run out of memory and not play.
<br/>
<br/>
Other open source flash projects are Gnash and GameSWF (Gnash is based on that) -- both use SDL and some OpenGL, so they would be harder to port.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't tested it, but movies could run smother if they weren't full screen on the DS. Also, it seems the less shapes are used, the smoother the play. For example, Trogdor runs pretty smooth because of relatively few shapes. Xiao xiao 5, on the other hand, is quite slow. It uses more shapes even though it looks simpler (visually) than Trogdor. Badger SWF slows down when there are many badgers on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
So, overall, GPLflash could be used for really simple movies on the DS...
<br/>
Maybe for game intros, etc.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it runs fairly smoothly already actualy..its just limited in what it supports.
<br/>
(I think I spotted fadeing dosnt work either).
<br/>
<br/>
The way forward with memory can only be reading directly from the flash medium. Possible (as proved by a few emulators that work fine), but its another layer of complexcity.
