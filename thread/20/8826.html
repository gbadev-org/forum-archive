If you're unsure, click on Start -&gt; Run -&gt; and type "cmd"
<br/>
<br/>
Once the command prompt is open, type "ipconfig /all"
<br/>
<br/>
You'll see gateway, DNS, and everything. 
<br/>
<br/>
Port 8888 should be open, and all traffic should be allowed, be sure to disable stuff like the pesky windows firewall, and norton internet security or blackice</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I meant to say that you should open and remove Windows firewalls, and open port 8888 there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have DHCP for IP on my router. What should I do about DS IP? I have selected an open IP, and it works for DS Linux.

<br/>
If I send text, the screen in use changes to a block of matrix looking code.

I'm at a complete loss. I know Win2DS won't work because of no WEP.<br/>_________________<br/>Back.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
No, wireless is enough as long as each has a different IP. 
<br/>
<br/>
I havent used pointy remote in a while, but If I recall correctly, the.se are the instructions:
<br/>
<br/>
Turn on Server.exe thingie
<br/>
Open Command Prompt and type "IPconfig /all"
<br/>
Grab your NDS and execute pointyremote.nds or .ds.gba
<br/>
Configure your access point, set IP similar to your computers (example, if you PC is 192.168.0.1, then set your DSIP as 192.168.0.X), set the mask same as your PC's (normally its 255.255.255.0), set your gateway same as your pc's, and DNS same as provided from IPconfig /all. 
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, click on Connect on the DS. it should connect automagically, and if not, press B or Start or A or X or Y :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, Pointy said that.

Open both just to be sure, but its most definitely UDP, knowing that TCP doesnt work yet ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
