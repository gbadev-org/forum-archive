This actually enables the DS to play GB and GBC Cartridges, but one of the steps allows you to <span style="font-weight: bold">double</span> the WiFi range.

Not too sure about the effectivness of the extended wifi range, but it is only a normal socket in the DS to connect to the antenna, there is nothing to stop you running a small cable from the antenna socket inside the DS to the outside and hooking it up to an external antenna, you may have to build it I haven't looked into it all properly yet</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I remember that hoax.
<br/>
It wouldn't have been that simple because the GBC used a different chip, which was the co-chip in the GBA.
<br/>
GBC had 2 chips, for GBC and GB
<br/>
GBA had 2 chips, for GBA and GBC
<br/>
DS has 2 chips, for DS and GBA.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that's what it was anyway. The GBA might have played GB games too, but i don't think it did.
<br/>
<br/>
Also attaching the antenna to your ground is likley to short it out and wipe out your DS's wifi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope. GBC had 1 chip, for GBC. The GBC functionality was designed to be a superset of the GB functionality.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, recently every nintendo handheld has only had *1* chip for the processor &amp; internal hardware (video/etc)
<br/>
<br/>
The way additional compatibility is added is the chip has multiple sections on the die, to support the different kinds of hardware (GBA only has one main cpu/hardware chip, as does DS - these chips can be switched to different modes by various means - on DS it can be done in software, on gba in hardware.) - sometimes the chips have sections that are used by both older and newer modes (DS's 2D video cores are nearly identical to the gba's video core.)
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally yeah - the "DS Gbc compatibility" mod is a hoax. and if you have performed it, note the following: of the connections made, one is a non-connection (connecting cart ground to system ground, this is already connected) - and the other one is connecting the RF antenna to ground (this is VERY BAD, it can damange the transmitter circuitry! The wifi may still work with this connection made but it's very likely to either (1) introduce LOTS of RF noise into the power system, or (2) Damage the transmitter's amplifier chip, or both. If you have made the mod I would suggest removing it immediately.
