    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I searched and saw nothing on it and i posted on the "DSgame port" thread and didnt really get a response, so im wondering would it be possible to make a BMS player for ds (beatmania simfiles) because i think it would be pretty awsome and better then the gameboy ver. of it =p, i dont know the first thing about making this, so im just wondering if someone has tried this or has thought of this before.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It would be possible, but how would you map the 7 keys plus scratch of Beatmania IIDX? Or are you talking about 5-key simfiles only?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well you could map it out with dpad and a, b, x, y buttons for the keys and the L or R trigger for scratching with 7key simfiles, it might take a while getting used to but i think it would be worth it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes it could be done, if someone had the time. However, because the DS doesn't have enough RAM to hold all the key sounds at once, the key sound system would need to either be rewritten to use ADPCM compressed samples, use samples played back at multiple pitches, load samples from the file system into RAM during playback, or all three. The MP3 background music might need to be replaced with something less demanding as well, such as MP2 or GSM or even just ADPCM.
<br/>
<br/>
But what about 3-key times 6-player, where the Control Pad switches players, and once you play two measures of one player's part with no misses, bads, or poors, it sets the next 11 measures of that part to autoplay? Imagine a drum track, a bass track, a guitar track, a piano or synth track, a voice track, and a sixth track of some sort, with just a repeating hi-hat in the background music.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
