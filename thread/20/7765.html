His DS came with the Metroid Prime: Hunters -- First Hunt demo, which didn't come with <span style="font-style: italic">his</span> brother's DS (also purchased new).  Is the presence of the MP demo mean that my friend's DS is an <span style="font-style: italic">old</span> firmware?<br/>_________________<br/>null</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
