<br/>
<br/>
I have and old NDS with a broken case. I am wondering if you can move all hardware inside a NDS Lite case ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess not. While the opposite might be possible (lite =&gt; fat, ie. something small in something bigger) it seems highly unlikely that the DS fat electronics fit in the lite case (or nintendo would have made it a lite from the beginning ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not possible. Even if it could fit, the button placement is slightly different, so the contacts would not batch the holes in the case. The motherboard hardly uses any wires, so other IO stuff like volume control, headphone jack and the charger plug are all directly soldered on the motherboard, so those wouldn't fit either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
