I can't, because i've scoured the internet for a (rom) of it and there's none to be found.  Doesn't each one also have it's own special code? or is that a code you make up yourself for all games?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm, well someone must have a pre-release copy (is this just an official copy of the game given out early?  if that's the case it probably has a manual)  since Loopy was able to fix up FlashMe pretty quick.  Heh, and really, I wouldn't mind messing with it...although I doubt it would work well with my slow internet connection.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
