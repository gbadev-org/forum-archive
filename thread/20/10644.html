<br/>
<br/>
We could try to port some games...
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=soft&amp;words=Football+Manager" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=soft&amp;words=Football+Manager</a>
<br/>
<br/>
SourceForge has some excelent Football Manager games, and they are all open source, so maybe we could port one of them, they all seem so so so cool.
<br/>
<br/>
The one i think its best for the Ds is this <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bygfoot" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bygfoot</a>
<br/>
It has easy interface, and has a pack with all the real name for players and teams...
<br/>
<br/>
So....Lets do it ?

<br/>
<br/>
Also: I haven't seen anybody on dsdev.org to make/port a game after somebody elses idea (except Chaos DS). Learn to code. ;)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
