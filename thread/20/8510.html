    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At random intervals, when I try to use WMB, it stops after it recieves authentication and the DS just shows a download error message. Just now, when someone else in the house started using NWFC (I have a wireless router for the Internet, and a wifi card for WMB) it started doing that every time. (Interestingly I also picked up two other signals in the neighbourhood - with WEP off :-D - but the signal strength was always &lt;3%. They never showed up before, and stopped appearing when the other DS disconnected.) Now that the other DS has disconnected, it works again, though that doesn't explain the random failures, plus it's a huge pain when I'm in the middle of developing something. Is there some way to fix this?
<br/>
<br/>
For that matter, is it possible to boost my router? I only get 62% signal strength sitting right next to it. :-/ Bigger antenna maybe? (Can't modify the router itself though, it belongs to my ISP.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
