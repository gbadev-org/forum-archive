Are you sure it won't use Nintendo servers? I seem to remember that one of the Opera variants uses Opera's servers to reformat the pages to be more easily parsed by the device:

In the UK, Nintendo's wifi partner is thecloud.

At one of thecloud's hotspots I can connect to the AP with DSLinux.  DHCP works.
<br/>

I can do DNS lookups, but all web access is redirected to thecloud's website for payment.

conntest.nintendowifi.net resolves to an address inside thecloud's network.

I was referring to the Japanese version. I've taken two years of Japanese in college, and I'd rather have the version with the Japanese text input support, even if I don't expect to use it often.
<br/>
<br/>
I've played other Japanese games on DS before, and I've only had trouble wth RPGs. With the browser, I doubt it's going to be difficult to figure out, and it beats waiting another six months. I've been wanting this since it was announced in February.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No. I'm pretty sure you can't write with japanese characters in the english-language versions of Mario Kart and Tetris.

You can use Japanese characters in the English MKDS and Tetris, and they can both be played across different language versions.

(first time you boot up your DS you have to go through the setup screen where you pick a colour, enter your birthdate and USERNAME etc). i'm pretty sure there's a full character set there with english, hiragana and katakana as well as european special characters as well as punctuation and symbols....or it might only apply to those DSs which need them (my DS is imported from Japan, US and AU DSs might be different)

oh, and just having a single version of a game/program with all translations built in is sure to annoy Japanese and US buyers, since they're not used to having to wait for the European translations to be done

Worst case: Japtcha, where you're given kana in a sentence and you have to draw the kanji on the touch screen. But I don't think any developer is ready to go that far to region-code its DS games.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
