    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I have finally finished Super Snake DS after a (unfournately) not so long Summer. :-P  The final version includes 11 differnt levels, 60 sublevels, and 5 differnt mini games.  For the full details, refer to <a href="http://www.cybernetresources.com/content/super_snake_ds.html" target="_blank">http://www.cybernetresources.com/content/super_snake_ds.html</a> for the download links and how to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you find any bugs (though, you shoulden't (hopefully) since i'm thurorly tested it for bugs and fixed everything i found), please try to contact me about them before Tuesday, since I'll be leaving for Costa Rica for my Half Sister's wedding.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, any comments and or suggestions are appreciated.  I probally wont release a new version for a long time if I ever do (with the exception of bug fixes).  Also, this will be submitted to the NeoFlash Summer Compo (if you want to save my bandwidth, find my entry on the neo forums and download from there :-P ).
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I'd like to thank everything and everyone who made this posible.  This was actually my first major C project (...realy..it was my only project of any use....and also considerbly much much larger than anything else i've ever written) and my first major Programming project in general (2nd largest would be the IRC chat bot I did in BASH shell scripting ^^ ).
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: By the way, <a href="http://www.cybernetresources.com/content/super_snake_ds.html" target="_blank">http://www.cybernetresources.com/content/super_snake_ds.html</a> has a bunch of screenshots also ^^  We all love screenshots :)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2: Umm, there shouldne't be a problem, but if there are problems having the files being created on your DS for the High Scores and Save Game features.  Create two blank files (snakehighscores and snakesave).  It works fine on the GBAMP..but...i'm not completely sure about the other devices out there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You have a life only shows up if...you have a life left...otherwise you get the game over screen.  I don't know, i'll think about it.  I'll reupload everything and what not tommrow afternoon on the neo boards and my server :)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: heh...I think I probally will change it to You Lost a Life. :-P  Oh, and thanks ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seems like a good game, but for now i stay with Pizza Worm DS, as the movement is much better because i can go 360.
<br/>
and it has multiplayer, thats just much more fun with my friends and family. but i think you did a way better job then pizza worm ds though.
<br/>
so well done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All the files were updated so that everything should now work with all the SD devices such as the super card SD and MK SD.  Enjoy. :)
<br/>
<br/>
By the way...apparnetly, the word "programer" can be spelled "programmer" or "programer" according to dictionary.com ..but..i changed it to programmer anyways. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The person who refered me to Rein's modified FAT lib only mentioned it worked fine with the Super Card SD.  Orginally, the game would lock up when it tried to use any fAT functions on SD bassed media.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but there isn't much i can do for the M3 SD I guess untill support for it is aviable. :(  No saving or high scores for M3 SD.  However....it could be just you.  I have the same message that appears (The "No Fat Support :-(" message) when FAT fails to intialize and when it tries to see if it can read the filesystem.  Maybe there is a filesystem problem?  Does other hombrew which writes data to your card work for you?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A new version that uses the same modified FAT Lib as doomDS is uploaded.  Try that..hopefuly it will work. :)  Thanks to Nikolas and GDF in #dsdev ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, we noticed that things are a tad slow when writing to the disc on the M3SD.....sorry :S  Either don't use auto save, or just wait a little bit for it to do its thing.  When I get back from Costa Rica, I can probally make things a tad more effiecent, but it will still be sort of slow sometimes.  Everything is fine ont he GBAMp :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
