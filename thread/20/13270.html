    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there piece of DS homebrew software to help you learn words in other languages? I haven't found anything... It should not be to difficult to make and I'd love to see someone do it! It would be great if it could take file input in a simple format, for example something like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
<br/>
title=Lesson 1
<br/>
apple/Apfel
<br/>
tree/Baum
<br/>
green/gr?n
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

There should be a choice in which direction the program should check your knowledge (German--&gt;English or English--&gt;German). There could be different modes: One where you have to input the correct translation with an on screen keyboard, another one where you can reveal the correct answer with a button press. The first mode could keep scores and in a more elaborate version even measure your performance over the course on a few days and remind you to repeat certain stuff after a while. Overall it should be functional and flexible. Support for Japanese letters would be cool because that is a language many people in the gaming community want to learn.
<br/>
Anyone up to the challenge? I want to motivate my little brother to learn Latin for school. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like a good idea, but instead of making it just a language learning program it could be a flash-card program. Heck people could even draw their own right on the DS!
<br/>
<br/>
But... until you ask if I wanna do it, go ahead and look at the sentence in my signature, particularly the second part.
<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless I think it's a great idea... I'd use it!<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

It's functional, but work on it is kind of halted since I'm really busy and haven't had much luck figuring out unicode support and variable font sizes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes please! And if you found it in your heart to do a simple DS-based editor using the touch screen as a drawing pad, that would be cool too. (so many polyatomics to memorize, so little time :P)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
