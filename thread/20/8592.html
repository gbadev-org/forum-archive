Actually, according to <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/688/688911p1.html" target="_blank">IGN</a>, the top screen can be configured to display the zoomed in area surrounding the pointer, and the bottom screen can be showing the entire page. Not much unlike many homebrewn-browser ideas that people threw out there a while back.
<br/>
<br/>
The two screen vertical page option is also there, so hopefully it's all configurable. I personally can't wait. I wonder if they're also working with Macromedia to include a mobile version of Flash, or with Adobe to have PDF readability. That would rock hard-core.

Ah yes, I forgot that Adobe is slowly engulfing the entire media world.
<br/>
<br/>
With many many many websites using Flash though, why would they not include support for Flash Lite? Especially if Nintendo is charging money for an otherwise free web browser?

Unless Opera wasn't free.

Wasn't Nintendo themselves boasting how cheap the DS Cards were to make? Why else were they giving out free Zelda trailer DS Cards at E3? Not to mention the Metroid games that came with the DS's for a limited time..
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, if all this is going to do is web browsing without any special web browser features, why would they be charging 30 dollars for it?
<br/>
<br/>
Opera must be licensed-based, yeah.

<br/>
EDIT: anyone checked out Opera's <a class="postlink" href="http://my.opera.com/community/forums/forum.dml?id=1406" target="_blank">Nintendo DS forum</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
A few things one can learn when going to this forum:
<br/>
<br/>
-Confirmed: Flash/PDF are not included, RAM expansion is confirmed (there's a specialized one for the DS Lite), Top screen zoomed in bottom screen full page view feature is there for sure.
<br/>
<br/>
-Everything else: unconfirmed :P The NDA is preventing the author from talking..though you can seriously tell he really wants to spill the beans. ;) ..still no word on RSS/Java/Javascript or what not. Is Java even feasible?
<br/>
<br/>
-Video of it running: <a href="http://ghardhentai.hp.infoseek.co.jp/nintendo_wbs.avi" target="_blank">http://ghardhentai.hp.infoseek.co.jp/nintendo_wbs.avi</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo's going to have the browser go through a proxy server which would do a lot of the heavy processor-intensive work on the DS server-side. It would also be a good way to prevent people from visiting 18+ adult websites. Seeing as how Nintendo WIFI games require friend codes and such, it's very much Nintendo's style to regulate where people can and can't go on their DS, especially since children may be using this tool.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I realize that, but you can't deny that it kills compatibility/ease of use by forcing people to buy different expansion carts. This also means that if someone trashes their normal DS and decides to get a DS Lite, they end up with an incompatible RAM extension. (Thus, it would have been better had they planned ahead, or designed expansion carts which fit nicely into both systems, which appears possible since the current NDS has a good chunk of extra casing over slot-2).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

It doesn't support the JavaScript? language per se, as that's a trademark of Netscape. Only Firefox, Seamonkey, and Netscape browsers support JavaScript. Likewise, IE supports the JScript? language.
<br/>
<br/>
The generic word you're looking for is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" target="_blank">ECMAScript</a>, an international standard that JavaScript and JScript implement. I tend to use "ECMAScript" in writing because sometimes I find a reaction of "what the hell is that? I'll go look it up on Google.com and find the Wikipedia article and learn about the naming issues" better than confusion with Sun's Java? technology.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

IF there will be a homebrew browser, I am sure it wouldnt *need* a ram expansion.
<br/>
Like others have pointed out, Mobile phones with less ram can handel it ok.
<br/>
<br/>
My guese would be that a browser would be "smart" when it comes to loading pictures. If theres a huge jpeg on the page, it only loads(or keeps) enough data to display it at the DS's resolution.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, if the user wishs to display it fullscreen, on its own..they can click on it. (then it reloads)
<br/>
<br/>
I think less ram just makes things harder, purhapes slower, but I dont think youd have less features.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have used Opera Mini in my Nokia phone for months. Yes it does use proxy server that modifies the pages.
<br/>
DS version will have memory expansion.. I don't know why, but I feel like they are making a real browser with no proxy at all. Maybe the extra ram is for pages with big image files and stuff.

Will there be java or "ECMAScript" support? 
<br/>
Will there be integrated chat in Opera?

Will there be support for PNG images?

And even then it wasn't even optimized.
<br/>
<br/>
Given substantial development time, a flash player could play at full speed on the DS. :) Probably with sound, too.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS has a substantially less display area than a PC would, so people who say it won't work need to realize that if Flash WERE used in a DS browser, it wouldn't be displaying the stuff at full frame. I don't know about anyone else, but flash files ran a lot faster when they were "resized" to a smaller display area, for me.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">ACE: Who approached whom to create this software? Did Nintendo approach your company, or did Opera pitch it to Nintendo? 
<br/>
<br/>
O: Nintendo came to Opera and requested that Opera work with them to port and optimize our browser for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
ACE: Was it difficult to develop an Opera web browser for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
O: Not that porting to any platform or device is easy work, but Opera has done this before and has succeeded in becoming a modular and flexible Web browser. The DS provides a unique form factor with dual screens and touch-screen technology and many of Opera’s core technologies come into play very nicely in this setting, such as Small-Screen Rendering (SSR).
<br/>
<br/>
ACE: How much functionality from the PC version of Opera will make its way to the DS version? Will Opera’s email or pop-up blocking features be present on the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
O: We will leave these details to be revealed by Nintendo when they are ready.
<br/>
<br/>
ACE: Will any sort of features be included in the browser to protect users from viruses lurking the web?
<br/>
<br/>
O: Opera is a tremendously secure browser even on Windows. On the specialized OS in the DS, Opera should be even more protected from malicious code intended for desktop browsers.
<br/>
<br/>
ACE: At this point, the Opera DS browser has only been announced for Japan.  When can we expect to hear about a North American and European version of the software?
<br/>
<br/>
O: Nintendo is still deciding on its global launch plans. Of course Opera would like to see this browser solution for DS available to people everywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
ACE: The PC version of Opera tends to get updates every so often, currently at version 8. Will the DS version see updates for the software as well, either available through download or at retail?
<br/>
<br/>
O: Unfortunately, we will have to defer to Nintendo to address this question when they are ready.
<br/>
<br/>
ACE: How powerful is Opera’s DS browser? Can it display flash, or streaming audio / video footage?
<br/>
<br/>
O: The version of Opera we have been working with Nintendo on for the DS can surf the full Internet, but the <span style="font-weight: bold">initial</span> version does not include Flash support.
<br/>
<br/>
ACE: Opera will make use of the DS touch screen as a means for users to type via a keypad. Are there any other ways that the software will take advantage of the DS’ twin screens?
<br/>
<br/>
O: Opera for DS has two display modes: Fit-to-width and DS mode. In fit-to-width mode, Opera uses both screens for scrolling up or down a page with both screens completing the view. In DS mode, an overview of the Web page is displayed on the lower screen and a pink square can be moved around an area of the page. The area you have selected is shown on the upper screen. This is a unique way to deliver the Web to take advantage of the DS hardware configuration and Opera has worked closely with Nintendo to optimize this experience.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

I dissagree, to say that says software can not contain inventions, or anything that is invented is worthless.

The only problem with software patents at the moment is the people granting patents havnt got a darn clue about technology and seem to be completely ignoreing "prior art".
<br/>

They also dont seem to understand what a "method" means, so you even get stuff like massive prime numbers being patented, or DNA code, for that mater...

One difference between copyrights and patents is that a patent holder still has grounds to sue somebody else who independently invents the same process. (The sick rationale behind this is that all engineers are deemed responsible for reading all subsisting patents and watching uspto.gov for new patents that issue.) This hurts software more than other fields because independent invention is rife in software.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

no.
<br/>
Copyright is no where near good enough.
<br/>
For one thing, it could be translated to another computer language, yet function in an identical way. Copywrite covers merely whats<span style="font-style: italic"> written</span>, not what it <span style="font-style: italic">means.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
A computer program is a method, it is NOT merely mathematics.
<br/>
Mathamatics is to do with relationships between values.
<br/>
<br/>
Methods, patents, programs, deal with the manipulation of data or objects. (often using mathamatics, but its not the same as)

Not really a difference though, if someone "Independantly" wrote something identicaly to someone else, (and published it) they could still be sued for it.

<br/>
The spirit and purpose of patents is the encourage original development, and to reward those that find a better way of doing things.
<br/>
While independant invention may be very common in software...that dosnt mean by a long short that the common things should be patentable.
<br/>
(and certainly not retro-actively).
<br/>
<br/>
If I casualy invent something Id have to be pretty darn sure it had never been done before in order to go to the bother of patenting it.
<br/>
I think the case's of that will actualy be quite rare.
<br/>
<br/>
Especialy as it (should) have to be a new method thats patented, not merely an overall generic bit of software. Or worse, a format...a format shouldnt be patented, its nothing more then a protocal, an order of data.
<br/>
<br/>
And if anything is patented, at no stage should the patent be proof that the concept was original. If someone comes up with evidence they were first, patent rights have to be handed over.
<br/>
<br/>
Software patents should purhapes have a short life then regular patents, and also, any software patented would have to be open-source. (else how can it be checked?).
<br/>
But I think we should reward original codeing methods, because I dont see computers reaching their potential software limits even if hardware stood still.

Well, you said <span style="font-style: italic">a sorting system that is 40% faster then any other sorting system divised</span>. That sounds to me like an algorithm for sorting which in average case is 40% faster than other sorting algorithms. Since algorithms are an application of logic, are systems based <span style="font-style: italic">"on deductive reasoning, starting from axioms and definitions"</span> (reduceable to lambda calculus), and are definitely involved in "quantity" and "change", I'd say they pretty much fit into "maths" :)

Even if they invented it on their own? Inventing new algorithms that can be reduced to existing ones is not hard.
