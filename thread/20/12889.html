    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DeSmuME: "Error this file is nds"
<br/>
iDeaS: Will be done downloading in 12 minutes. WTF? 0.1KB/s? An older version I have crashes 3 times (!) upon loading the file.
<br/>
Ensata: Runs, but obviously no FAT support, so doesn't get anywhere.
<br/>
Dualis: White screens.
<br/>
DSEmu: Black screens.
<br/>
No$GBA: "The ROM image has crashed."
<br/>
Searching the forum: Nothing.
<br/>
Searching Google: Those 6 emulators.
<br/>
<br/>
Anything? :-/
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] Whoops, the server I was downloading iDeaS from just died. And that was the backup server, which I was using because the main server was dead. -_-<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's gonna be near impossible (well, more costly than impossible I guess), because MS 1.71 uses ARM RealView Development Suite, which is very expensive.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Oh, this is a good one. No$GBA is claiming the ROM has crashed even if I don't have it automatically started, and if I have another ROM running beforehand, the screens aren't even cleared of its image. So the ROM has crashed without even being run? &gt;_&gt;<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does it realize that newer versions of MoonShell put their skins in /moonshl/skin/? Try moving it to /moonshl/ or even /shell/.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Moonshell is open source, and using raw framebuffer as display output. Shouldn't be too hard to make a .png/.bmp writer.

...pause...

Forget what I said, Moonshell has abstract code, no mortal can figure it out<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.
