I meant in reguards to the homebrew community.  Having a playable game is more important than not.  And when it's in reference to a game copy anyway?  I mean?  If he redid all the graphics himself, it wouldn't be called Zelda, now would it?  Which, suprises me that you haven't brought that up..
<br/>
<br/>
In other words.. it's free people.. If you don't like it, don't play it.  If you have useful feedback, then provide it.. but complaining about sprites doesn't help anything... Unless you want to provide sprite you made yourself..

As soon as this is made skinnable, I might consider contributing a few replacement sprites in order to bootstrap this project away from Nintendo copyrights in the same way that LAME was bootstrapped from the ISO MP3 example code.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
