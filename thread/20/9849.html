I guess wifime doesn't work with DS lite.  My old passkey doesn't seem to work either.  What do I need to do to flash the firmware?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
WifiMe exploited the fact that although the code and data was signed, the header wasn't. The execution address in the header was changed to the GBA slot, but as the header wasn't part of the signature, the validity of the file wasn't affected. Later versions fixed this, checking both.
<br/>
<br/>
NoPass solutions contain valid code and headers as per offical games.
<br/>
The DS sees this as an offical game and so loads it.
<br/>
The code in the Datel NoPass (MAX Media Launcher) displays the Datel logo and then jumps to GBA slot.
<br/>
<br/>
The PassMe Upgrade was the only cart to contain an offical game card. It was however still a PassMe2 and required a GBA device with SRAM.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

PassMe2-Z and PassCard 2 use roughly the same tech as this "upgrade". Like other PassMe2 solutions, they don't work with the GBA Movie Player v2 CF (which lacks GBA SRAM) and they create issues with homebrew saving on some cards (can't use SRAM because the passthrough is using it).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

There were other devices similar to the PassMe Upgrade?
<br/>
Thanks for the correction.
<br/>
I was only aware of the PassMe upgrade.

I haven't been keeping track because I don't need a PassMe 2.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

Carts aren't signed, just encrypted. There's a dump of the MML floating around that you can send through WMB, but it's not signed.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Of course it's much easier to buy a nopass like Max Media Launcher and you don't need a device with SRAM for that, so it will work wtih GBAMP.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1024 bit, actually. And that's the maximum possible amount of time it'd take. Maybe we'd have the key in just 5 minutes ... or in 60 years.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The way <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA" target="_blank">RSA</a> or any other public-key encryption algorithm works is that it uses one key to encrypt and a separate key to decrypt, and these keys are mathematically related in such a way that it is a Really Hard Problem? to calculate one from the other. Nintendo distributes the decryption key in every DS but keeps the encryption key locked in a vault. So there are exactly two ways to find the private key: 1. break into Nintendo headquarters or 2. take several hundred years to compute the answer to the Really Hard Problem?. Or are you talking about a brute force checker (like distributed.net) that runs on the DS and can be installed into the firmware so that it runs while you're using PictoChat?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
