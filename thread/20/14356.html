    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi. I just bought an R4DS card and would like to make the most out of my new DS with homebrew. Before I go out and buy a Slot-2 card, I need to know which is the most cost-effective and compatible for a browser that could save files. My eye is on the 32MB cards listed for DSLinux, but which one would work best for me?

<br/>
There are browsers that can cache files, so how about just permanently saving all the cached files on a flash card? One could pick out the save-worthy files. Not as elegant as ?save as?, but still effective.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">personally, I think the m3 lite perfect is the best slot 2 card out there
<br/>
<br/>
it's also the most expensive
<br/>
<br/>
if you're just looking to add some extra ram, then the ez flash3-1 is the best choice</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for your response. The EZ Flash 3-1 looks good! Perhaps I could just buy the slot-2 memory expansion and use it with my R4DS? Would a browser be able to write to the flash chip on the R4DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention that a filter could be used which only caches larger files (main images and HTML) on the flash and smaller stuff in RAM. This would reduce the chance of wearing the memory card out prematurely.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use a Supercard SD with DSLinux and it works pretty much flawlessly.  Also in DSLinux you get dlditool which along with unzip allows you to download and patch DS homebrew without having to touch a PC.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  With DSLinux it will cache as much as it can in the extra RAM in Slot-2, not the storage media.  This means that you do not have to worry about your SD card wearing out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
But is there even a DS browser capable of saving files?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only experience I have with DS browsers are the ones that run under DSLinux.  Opera DS doesn't have the ability to save.  All of the browsers included with DSLinux (links, retawq and ViewML) have the ability to save to media in either Slot-1 or Slot-2.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Thought it can save if you click on a file (e.g. mp3 or whatever), it saves it to the DSOrganize/Cache Directory, you need to search a big file and rename to what you like. This is the only way to to this exept for DSlinux' Webbrowser.
<br/>
<br/>
It works fairly well, and Dragon Minded even thinks about implementing a "real" saving system for the browser one day (atleast that is what you can read out of his  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dragonminded.com/dsorganize/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#Minor_Features" target="_blank">wiki</a>).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dslinux with <span style="color: green">links </span>or <span style="color: green">retawq</span> allows you to save files..
<br/>
<br/>
In links, select your download link, and tap the "d" key. It will open a download dialog, and save the file you've chosen into the "Dslinux\Home" directory...<br/>_________________<br/>Soon Blubb in 3D !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Similarly, with Retawq, tap "d" to save the current page as an HTML file, shift+D to download the selected link to your card, and CTRL+d to download a file from the url you specify to your card.  You can save it to the root of your card by prepending "/media/" before the filename.  Since Retawq doesn't have a download status meter, type "ls -l" (lowercase L, not number 1) a few times until the filesize stops increasing.  Links has a status meter you can watch and use.  
<br/>
<br/>
Since the unzip command has been broken in DSLinux for a while to the best of my knowledge, if you use this method to download zip files I'd suggest using the DSCompress program to unzip them.  This requires a few more reboots, but it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The dev's of DSLinux are fully aware that the busybox unzip command is non functioning at the moment.  I have submitted a patch to fix this but there's two reasons why it hasn't been committed yet:
<br/>
<br/>
1. It may just be easier/better to update the whole of the busybox toolset
<br/>
2. Some of the dev's are totally anti-warez and don't want unzip enabled lest DSLinux gets turned into some Warez downloading platform.
<br/>
<br/>
If you compile your own builds I can supply you with a patch to fix unzip if anyones interested.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  Isn't DSCompress just for GZip files?  My mistake, it does zip too</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by sonny_jim on Tue Oct 23, 2007 12:44 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

If I remember right, you uploaded the file to a thread at DCEmu but I had no idea what to do with it.  I can create my own builds if I need to, but I'm not a pro at doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, DSCompress only compresses to Gzip but can uncompress both GZip and Zip files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
