    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In case you didn't notice already, Google recently released a cleaned up version of the Tesseract OCR engine developed by HP between 1985 and 1995.
<br/>
<br/>
By all accounts it's a damn good OCR system...
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone think this could be used to develop a general purpose writing recognition library for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't taken a look at it yet, the release is source code I believe. Certainly seems like something to look into, though...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wonder how fast it will run on the DS. (I don't think it will run that fast, honestly.. :()
<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather see a fullblown (yet, easy and small) gesture system. That would be useful to a lot of homebrewers! *drools*
<br/>
<br/>
Nice find anyway! Thanks,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you could be wrong...
<br/>
<br/>
Things to keep in mind...
<br/>
<br/>
Tesseract was developed between 1985 and 1995. Hence, I somehow doubt it was targetted at machines boasting ridiculous levels of processing power.
<br/>
<br/>
The specific scenario on the DS would involve processing only one or two characters at a time. Take a look at the Opera DS stylus entry system and you'll see what I mean...
<br/>
<br/>
While an HW recognition system would be nice, I think this could be a good place to start looking, since HWR is a similar problem to OCR in many ways (You could say that one is a variant of the other...)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm going to grab the Tesseract source now and just see what the documentation (If any) says...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I've downloaded the source and consulted the docs. They're pretty sparse, to say the least. So I've emailed the project leader at his SourceForge address. If/when he replies, I'll post the details here :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

In other news, Ray Smith, the lead coder maintaining Tesseract at the moment finally got a chance to reply. Printed below is my original mail with his replies to my questions inlined (I have removed my own name. I'm paranoid :-) ). Enjoy :-)

Hi there, hopefully I'm not bothering you with this
<br/>
email...
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed the Tesseract OCR release thanks to Slashdot and
<br/>
headed over to grab a copy. I was immediately interested in
<br/>
the possibility of using Tesseract to develop a character 
<br/>
recognition library for use by homebrew Nintendo DS
<br/>
developers. However, I'm still not certain whether this is
<br/>
viable, Hopefully you can answer some of my questions on
<br/>
this matter?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here goes.
<br/>
<br/>
1: What kind of processing power does Tesseract require?
<br/>
<br/>
The NDS features a 33mhz ARM7 secondary processor and a
<br/>
66mhz ARM9 primary processor. If Tesseract were to run on
<br/>
the NDS, it would probably run off the ARM9 (Since the ARM7 
<br/>
is used mainly for input handling and sound). Furthermore,
<br/>
Tesseract would probably be used to recognise characters
<br/>
one by one, in a sequential fashion.
<br/>
<br/>
An example of a possible input interface is illustrated the 
<br/>
following image from a commercial NDS program:
<br/>
<a href="http://files.myopera.com/DotEd/albums/89050/dsbrowser7.jpg" target="_blank">http://files.myopera.com/DotEd/albums/89050/dsbrowser7.jpg</a>
<br/>
<br/>
While the interface in question actually demonstrates 
<br/>
hand-writing recognition, it does give a good basic idea of
<br/>
the kind of input system.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, do you think Tesseract could function on the NDS?
<br/>
Would it be able to do so in real-time?
<br/>
<br/>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Ray Smith wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
<br/>
<br/>
Real-time relative to what kind of input?
<br/>
In 1998, on a 200Mhz Pentium II, it managed about 100 characters per second.
<br/>
It has been run successfully on both big and little-endian architectures, but not
<br/>
on 64 bit yet, so you should be OK there. 
<br/>
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">2: What are the memory requirements of Tesseract?
<br/>
<br/>
The NDS features 4mb of primary memory, a pretty small 
<br/>
amount. It is possible to extend this memory via externally
<br/>
attached devices, to a maximum of 36mb, including the
<br/>
built-in 4mb of memory. The extension memory does not
<br/>
function at quite the same speed, however, and so treating 
<br/>
it as being entirely contigious and uniform would be
<br/>
problematic.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you think Tesseract would be able to function in the
<br/>
low-memory environment of the NDS?
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Ray Smith wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">The memory requirement is heavily dependent on the size of the input image and number of characters it contains. You could probably run it in as little as 4-8MB, but for a full letter page of 4000 characters you will need more like 20-30MB. Somebody is working on some hacks to make it easier to run on an embedded system, which you might find useful.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
3: Assuming Tesseract could be adapted to work on the NDS
<br/>
in an efficient manner, do you think it would be possible, 
<br/>
at all, to adapt it to the task of hand-writing
<br/>
recognition. I realise this may not be possible, but it is
<br/>
nevertheless something I'd like to be sure of before
<br/>
embarking on any kind of project involving Tesseract and 
<br/>
the NDS...
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Ray Smith wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Unlikely. From the look of your screen-shot you are interested in online handwriting recognition and Tesseract has no mechanism to make use of the time domain information that you have available. If you could constrain the users to isolated handprint and make them go through a training phase, then you might stand a chance at static handprint recognition, but people hate to write that way and there is grafiti for that any way. That said, I have never tried it with handprint, and would be interested to know if you could train it to recognize handprint successfully. You will need the trainng system, which is not yet available, but coming soon.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
