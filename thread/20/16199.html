    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I made some DS demos that bypass libnds to better grasp the hardware.  They work in nocash and ideas but when I finally got a media card and tried them on hardware they were totally blank.  In making these demos I compared my code with libnds code to make sure things would work.  Then it hit that I forgot to check the arm7 file.  So I just want to ask, is proper start up of the arm7 necessary to run on hardware, or could it be a different problem?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Emulators tend to be forgivefull for that, while the actual hardware would still be not available.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://nintendods.desperate-programmers.com/doku.php?id=wireless_io_map" target="_blank">Trying  to bring more detail into understanding the wireless hardware</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
