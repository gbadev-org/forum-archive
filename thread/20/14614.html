    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK so i have a ds lite and i was going to install flashme on it, so i did the normal setup took off the back, had my tool and such... Then i turned on the ds lite and put my bridge on BEFORE i ran the flashme startup, and i think i accidentally hit the vr so it shut off the ds i tried to turn it back on once and the screens turned white then it shut off! But a llittle while later i turned it on and the ds warning sign came on then it turned off? So did i brick it, is it possible to brick it before even installing flashme?
<br/>

p.s. Maybe just the battery's died but sadly enough i lost my charger so i havn't plugged it in yet.<br/>_________________<br/>Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you were able to see the warning screens, even for a split second, then it is probably the battery running on a sliver more than empty. The warning screen, afaik, means that the BIOS is still intact. You probably should go get a new charger, and let it charge for a while before attempting anything else on it.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
