    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Without any flash equipment, no.  Unless your computer has a Ralink chipset (which is unlikely, most WiFi cards use Broadcom these days), you need to buy some flash equipment.  With Ralink cards you can use WiFiMe.
<br/>
<br/>
For flash equipment, I recommend the Datel Games n' Music, which is a cheap device that is available in stores (Best Buy, Wal Mart, etc) for like $20 to $35.  They aren't the greatest quality cards out there (slow microSD port, slots tend to break, etc) but they include a USB reader and microSD card (128MB) in one package.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

There's no place like 127.0.0.1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
