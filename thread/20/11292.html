    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Guys!
<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to make a quick announcement. I've been in several nds, coding scenes for some time now, and i allways noticed, that alot of good coders, lack to own a webserver, and have to upload stuff to megaupload and stuff like that! Now, my thought was,"hey, i have a 200GB root server, why not help" So thats what i did, here ya go, you can upload anything todo with nds or gba coding! May it be homebrew, source codes, pictures, savegames, whatever! Or Maybe you just want another safe mirror for your file - Upload it here! And totally free =)
<br/>
<br/>
here ya go! Hope i could help somehow.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is true that the developers often upload to temporary servers, but that's really because the scene websites like Dev-Scene, QJ.net and ds-scene all provide a mirror just a few minutes after announcement of a release. Nevertheless, it's really kind of you to provide this service! Nice website by the way.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hope you don't mind if I use this to upload my copy of "Grid Wars" even though it's a PC app... but I'm uploading it for the sake of sharing its source code for the "GeometryWars DS" idea someone had (<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11262" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11262</a>)

EDIT: uh... it keeps telling me I'm missing a field or something like that, even though I've filled in every one O_o.  Are .7z files not accepted or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
