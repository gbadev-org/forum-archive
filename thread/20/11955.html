    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've encoded a bunch of movies and shows using BatchDPG and only recently has it started to act up after seeking to a point in the file. It doesn't seem to be an issue if you just let it play, but as soon as you seek, the audio gets out of sync.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, this only started to happen recently. Any ideas as to what might be happening?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well the new Moonshell 1.5, released this month, introduced a modified DPG format, called DPG2, that adds info specifically for seeking in the video stream. Maybe the seeking in older DPG0 and DPG1 formats was negatively affected by the changes introduced in Moonshell. Bug?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've never had any encodes go out of sync with BatchDPG, even with the very long Star Wars movies.
<br/>
And there's no bug in Moonshell, I've played older encodes with 1.5 and 1.5 beta3 and they play fine.
<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don't know why you have this problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a/v sync set to 1 or 0 in global.ini? While I don't lose sync with either setting, maybe it can cause it when set to 0.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
