No I don't have. And I don't have drum drier or any machine to wash my carpets. And no space where to wash my carpets. I have very small apartment and I'm very poor without a real job (still trying to find one. very hard to find any in my country).

EDIT: If you like to see what my country looks like, just watch Conan O'Brien's TV show.. he just visited in my country (Finland).<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

<br/>
Says its designed for the special mobile phone-digital tv network thingy.
<br/>
<br/>
Which always strikes me as a waste of time.
<br/>
Why not just recieve normal digital tv broadcasts :?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two reasons: <ul><li>Demodulators and decoders for digital terrestrial broadcast television are not yet small enough to fit in an Option Pak. Phone TV receiver hardware is designed to fit in a handheld handset from day one. </li><li>The 8VSB modulation used for ATSC television in the United States is very sensitive to the Doppler effect, which means that it's not suitable for the moving bus or train environments where the DS is often found. The TDMA-based modulation of GSM is designed to work from a moving handset from day one. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Those kind of appliances are expensive, so some people may not have them. Or, even if you live in an apartment and there's only one washing machine/dryer per building, it'd be completely inconvenient.
<br/>
<br/>
Laundromats also rock if you have many loads and only one washer at home, in which you can wash garbage bags full of clothes all at once.
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic though, I haven't heard any thing about it but are there plans to include A/V ports?<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

sounds like it will use the same tech as 3 Mobile uses here in Australia<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But I bet you have to pay to watch each show, and that it's way expensive, given that it uses cell phone networks. ...Ah who am I kidding, they'll just force you to buy a phone and some plan you don't need like they do with everything else. &gt;_&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
