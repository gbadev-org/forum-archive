Im sorry I just dont understand the problem with HtheB's link the same as he obviously didn't see a problem with posting it. Can someone explain what is so bad about linking to files that a free anyway?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Im very confused about why you have been shot down. Did you link to a site with warez or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Legit sites might have the Duke3d demo, but not the full version. Some source ports may be able to use the demo's data.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Another great urban legand.
<br/>
<br/>
"What do you mean I have to pay for it, it's 11 years old, they can't make any more money out of it!"
<br/>
<br/>
Wikipedia:
<br/>
"Under copyright law, copyright owners have the right to profit or not profit from their creations; there is no requirement for a copyright holder to use the copyright in commerce."
<br/>
<br/>
So, until the copyright expires (some 70 to 120 years) it's still illegal whether they can make money from it or not.
<br/>
<br/>
Also even though the original publisher/creator may have gone or stopped selling the software, other companies may have bought the rights, like many Atari games.
<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say all games are protected, some companies have <span style="font-style: italic">given</span> permission (rather than it just being assumed due to the age) for the game to be given away, and in some cases even released the source code for it.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">(*erased link*)some sites have games available for download wich is no longer supported by their developers or whom-ever bought the software name, even the company that bought the software name have their own page where they are distributing a old product for free or a demo.. If a game is still making money this site wont give you a place to download the game, except it gives you a link where the developer or whomever bought the name with a link to where the game is still being sold for a dirt cheap price (includes box, book and everything)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personaly, I see Abandone Ware as fine to use, but I put a much tighter definition on it:
<br/>
<br/>
Software that no one is claiming money for.
<br/>
<br/>
(eg, the developer is long gone, and the publisher has not showen any trace of interest in it, and theres no way to buy it currently in a legitmate first-hand form).
<br/>
<br/>
So basicaly, my view is AW is stuff technicaly in copywrite, but that no one is there to chase after you about, or that no one is going to lose money over.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
