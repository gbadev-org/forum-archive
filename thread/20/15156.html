    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I chose maybe. It depends on the position they offer:
<br/>
<br/>
- Will it be a learning experience, or do they treat me like a free employee?
<br/>
- Is it a small or big company? Bigger companies will have more resources to help me learn and more uncritical tasks for me to fulfill. (I've read that EA internship rules!)
<br/>
- How free is "free"? Will I have to pay for coffee/tea/lunch/bus/train?
<br/>
<br/>
The way you say "part time intern programmer" sounds to me like "free employee". Maybe you should call it a huge opportunity for gaining real world experience at an established game studio as a programming intern.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Many big companies want a few years experience, and for your reseume to show that you have done some work for a certain time even if part time helps. EA is another story which many news articles have talked about  how bad the employees are treated.

Some companies offer online jobs so you can work in your PJ's.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
