    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In everyone's opinion, which is the best IRC client for the DS? I know fo three, IRCDS, SylphDS, and the IRC in DSOrganize.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Supercard Lite if it matters, and was wondering which was the best. If any one of them has multi server connection, that'd be awesome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using IRCDS and it works really well. It is a very polished, responsive and attractive program.
<br/>
<br/>
Bitchx in DSLinux works pretty well, too. It has the bonus of being a fully developed IRC client which you can run while listening to music / browsing the web if you have a build with virtual terminals!
<br/>
Only problem, of course, is that it is text-based. If you can get past that, it's excellent!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, the DSlinux one does sound nice... I tried IRCDS and it IS nice, but the touchscreen code is really bugging me. It's keeps getting things all wrong. But I like it, so I'll put up with it. Does the DSLinux one support multiple servers?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I tried Bitchx, and am now convinced IRCDS is the one for me. I couldn't seem to use short commands in bitchx like /nickserv or /oper or /rehash, which I need. IRCDS does all those, so I'm happy with it so far, just wish the keyboard code was better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
