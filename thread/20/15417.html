    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can anyone help with some kind of explanation on how these layers of network join together - I'm a newbie to this arena but not totally an alien to programming and network communications (non-PC though)
<br/>
<br/>
My objective is to get my laptop to communicate with my NDSL using the Netgear WG511 pcmcia card running in Ad-Hoc mode - to FTP files direct to the flash card in my M3Real adapter. 
<br/>
I don't want to have to reconfigure my wireless router to 'no security' and unplug the world every time I want to transfer a file to the flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
Some history.. (these forums are so good !!)
<br/>
<br/>
Downloaded wifi_lib_test.nds - runs fine, finds things, can connect to someones unsecured wireless server. - mode g ch 6
<br/>
Configured my NDSL network settings with Tetris. 
<br/>
Downloaded DSFTP-2.6, configured, connects to server OK.
<br/>
Downloaded Filezilla client for my laptop.
<br/>
Connected my laptop to same unsecured server.
<br/>
Whoopee, I can FTP to my NDSL and put files on the card - excellent.
<br/>
<br/>
So now I want to stop using someones server and don't want to rip my own server settings up - should be easy - just go PC to NDSL direct. All I have to do then is save a profile in my laptop for a dedicated connection to the NDS - no such luck.
<br/>
<br/>
Configured the Netgear pcmcia card to Ad-Hoc mode.
<br/>
Chose channel 9, mode g, tried WEP off, tried WEP on with a key - wifi_lib_test fails to get past authentication. 
<br/>
Tried DHCP on and DHCP off, manual configure for all.
<br/>
Manually configured the IP settings in the network connection.
<br/>
All to no avail.
<br/>
Frustratingly the wifi_lib_test detects the transmission from the Netgear card and all the settings seem to change in line with my reconfigurations.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I found a Sam Neiland (know him?) guide - DS WiFi-Connection with RT2500 series Manual 1.1 which seems to be pointing me in the same direction - as I don't have the RT2500 chips I didn't think I can use that driver - but it looks like all they have been used for is to set the wireless card up the same as I have been able to do with the Netgear front end.
<br/>
<br/>
So, am I missing something on my laptop I need to 'serve' the connection.
<br/>
Or is my Netgear pcmcia card not behaving itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a forum which has got me from nothing to here in about 6 hours - fantastic, although my wife now thinks I am a nerd.<br/>_________________<br/>Andy..
