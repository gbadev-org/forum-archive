    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, I have an old first release jap unit I switched with a shell replacement case. After installing the case and screwing it all back together, when I press the power button the unit just gives a little chirp and the green light goes off after about half a second. The same thing happens when Its plugged into an outlet.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this bricked or something else? Any ideas how to fix. Ill sel it if anyone needs it and I cant unbrick her.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Almost sounds like it has a short.
<br/>
Take it all apart again, put it on an insulated surface and see if it starts up.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you dropped a screw in there or something.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Definitely a no go there. I desoldered (and actually lost) the connector to the battery on the mainboard. I though that the short would be in there. So I soldered two wires in place of it and holding them to the right points on the battery does me no good.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking does anyone know if theres anyplace to solder, that could bypass the need for the battery, and just run the ds off the ac power?
<br/>
Im fairly certain its somewhere near the battery connectors place thats messed. As I plug in the ac, and the amber light goes on for a sec still. 
<br/>
I unhooked both screens as well at this point. Just using the mainboard for this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
