    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Depends on what the slot-2 device is.  If it's the EZ-V 3in1 expansion pack, something like that called NDStation already exists.  Rudolph's tool can also load GBA binaries to the 3in1's RAM and launch them.  The Supercard DS has a built-in function to run GBA binaries when a non-Rumble slot-2 Supercard is inserted, and I believe the CycloDS Evolution can do the same when paired with a slot-2 CycloDS product.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're referring to the Opera RAM pack, I don't think it's possible to execute GBA binaries from it, though I could be wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That said, you cannot boot GBA code from the Nintendo DS Memory Expansion Pak. The GBA BIOS expects code to start at 0x08000000, but the RAM pak starts at 0x09000000.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
