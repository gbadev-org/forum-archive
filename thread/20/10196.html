    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Agreed, I've installed it on 30+ GBA MPs without issues..  And, being that the GBA MP is so cheap, worst case is you have to buy another one to fix the one you have.  As you can take a "damaged" one (as long as the actual hardware is fine) and repair it with a good working one by swapping in the "bad" one when prompted to update the firmware from the "good" one.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">buy anotherone?? pfft. I had a minor problem once, bit i fixed it, very simple. one time (after the patch) i used gbamp on my sp, tried to watch amove, it told me it wasnt a proper gbamp!!!! so i ran the official upgrade again (e19) then the patch again, and everything works fine and has sinse.
<br/>
so if there are any problems at all, the e19 update should fix it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Of course.. if the GBA MP will "boot" into the update utility when it finds an update.eXX on the CF card.. But, if it doesn't (which means the GBA MP is really screwed, which I have done. :) ) you can do the swap I just refered to and recover your GBA MP.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
