    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently got a Black DS lite (European) and all the Wi-Fi enabled homebrew just won't work on it. On my "phat" DS everything works just fine!
<br/>
<br/>
Even the "Wifi_lib_test" by Stephen Stair doesn't work on my DS lite.
<br/>
It boots, but it won't find any Access Point -- neither in "Wardriving" mode nor in "Connect to an AP" mode using "Use Nintendo WFC Data"!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry if this is a known issue, but is there any way to fix this?
<br/>
Wi-Fi enabled commerical games and the official Nintendo DS Browser all work fine!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">90% chance that it's caused by an out-of-date wifi lib which is incompatible with the DS Lite's WiFi hardware.

<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, that should be added to <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10320" target="_blank">this thread</a>, shouldn't it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had homebrew wifi working fine for NDSMail, and DSLive Weather and DSLinux.
<br/>
<br/>
Then one day out of the blue, they all stopped working. I deleted all the apps, redownloaded the latest version, and patched them with the correct DLDI (I have a M3 Simply, so I used the R4 Patch)
<br/>
<br/>
However, nothing works anymore. Any clue why? What Can I do to correct this?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, my ds lite is the new batch.  All my regular games work fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They are made with dswifi03.d and will work.....

I can find a lot more APs with my DS Phat than my Lite sitting right next to it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a DS Lite from June 2006 and I have a hard time connecting with Wifi in homebrew using DHCP. Commercial games are no problem and I have a workaround for dslinux. 
<br/>
<br/>
For example, using dswifi_lib_test (0.3d version) I can see APs when searching for them, but cannot connect. I do not use any WEP or hidden AP (no problem around here...). When capturing packets I see the association and authentication and the beginning of a DHCP negotiation, which subsequently fails with a DHCP NAK reply from the AP.
<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that this problem is different from some of the problems above, so my guess is that there are several different bugs left in the dswifi code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
