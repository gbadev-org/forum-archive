    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's me and this is written somewhere but I can't seem to find it. Is there already a TCP/IP library or header or whatever available like the normal socket.h in C/C++ ? There's a LOT of activity on the WiFi stuff in general but I cant figure out about protocols and such. Also I noted the DS Linux project, but I dont want to run a whole linux kernel just for the network modules.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be wanting to use the DS as a wireless interface to some computers on a W-LAN with a very specific monitoring application running on the DS. Any suggestions?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx in advance..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty sure the TCP implementation hasnt been added to sgtairs's wifi lib yet, in the next full release apparently tcp is working so you can either use linux or wait till the next version comes out</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
