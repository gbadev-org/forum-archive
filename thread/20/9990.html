    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Before you get too excited, I would like to mention that this is a progress check of what I've done, not what I'm working on. I was going to release a fully working demo on the 31st, but that ain't gonna work, as I'm going to Florida and my working time will be severely cut.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically I've omitted shooting(in beta), 2 levels(very glitchy), and bots(having some trouble).
<br/>
<br/>
The official website can be found at <a href="http://lierods.com" target="_blank">http://lierods.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Once I come back from Florida, expect a much better demo to come soon.

I've got pretty much a solution for customazation(on every cart) but I hear GBAMP doesn't support GBFS. Is that true?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA Movie Player v2 CF supports everything but the find_first_gbfs_file() function. You'll have to load your GBFS file into RAM using one of the following methods: <ol type="a"><li>(for GBAMP and FlashMe+WMB) Include the .gbfs files into the program using bin2s when you build the ROM. This will require you to distribute at least the object code, the bin2s program, the assembler, and the linker. </li><li>(for GBAMP and FlashMe+WMB) Include a .gbfs file containing a large zero-filled file into the program using bin2s, and then have your builder overwrite the data starting at the "PinEightGBFS" signature. </li><li>(for GBAMP only) Load the .gbfs files from the CF card into RAM using Chishm's FAT driver. </li></ol><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
Anyways, It'll most likely be choice <span style="font-style: italic">c</span> unless I can write a really good frontend application so people new to DS homebrew won't get confused by the console output during the process.
<br/>
<br/>
But I will distribute source to Liero once I'm done anyways.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
