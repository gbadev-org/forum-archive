Of course the real question is does it serve any purpose to homebrewers? ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] I poked at the corner in other WFC and firmware menus to see if similar buttons existed, but didn't find anything. The WFC menu looks and acts the same if your DS is in Japanese (the menu is even still in English).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's it. I just tried with a japanese game and there is a third button with a weird icon. When I touch it, it goes to the green-thing-spinning screen and then fails.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It has a nice icon :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you guys were right, it's nothing exciting, simply a different connection method which is only used in japan. I guess they didn't completely remove the code for it in the north america/europe versions. see here for info:
