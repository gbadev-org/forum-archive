    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, here's what I was wondering. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, how hard would it be to make something SLIGHTLY like moonshell that works on games n music (meaning DLDI patch)? I don't want it to be re-skinable, so it'll be a solid style, as well as I would like to ask where I could find out how to code it (as I'm a guy that just wants to get it done without learning a bunch of other crap).
<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much, I want to make myself a moonshell (yes, I wanna do it myself to learn the basics of window drawing and all that kind of stuff) that only launches games. Guys got any suggestions on where to start learning?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

If you want to build your own media player app, you'll have to get down and dirty with codecs, especially getting them to run in real time on a CPU comparable to <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486DX2" target="_blank">1992's state of the art</a>. Have you ever worked with audio and video compression on a PC?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Without knowing your requirements and your current knowledge, it is hard to rate.  Sometimes tasks can be completed easily if you know how, and they can be created with great difficulty if you don't know what you are doing.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that... to the extent you are asking, I'll give it a 10.
<br/>
If it is actually lower than that, you will know.
<br/>
To the extent you know what you are doing, I'm sure it is much lower than a 10.
<br/>
<br/>
Google the codec specs you intend to deal with.

So you just want to code a launcher? That's not _that_ hard.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it's just gonna launch games, it won't be too difficult I don't think. The only fiddly bit will be the actual execution of programs, but that's been done by many people so you've just gotta look for code. I'd got for a 4/10, assuming you know what you're doing!
<br/>
<br/>
Playing videos and making some kind of multimedia app however is completely different kettle of fish. It's pretty thankless and you'll never be happy with the result :-) 10/10.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
