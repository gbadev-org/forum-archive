    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone
<br/>
<br/>
First, you're going to see a lot of me in the next few hours, because I just received my Datel NoPass and i'm excited like a flea (well, what animal do you compare yourself with when you are excited, in your anglo-saxons countries?)
<br/>
<br/>
Then, after booting up my DS with the nopass inserted, I was surprised to see that it launched itself automatically. I knew this was allowed (especially for those demo carts) but how do you bypass it?
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a M3miniSD (though I suspect the same behaviour from others M3) and seen for the first time its DS screen. It has a first one much like its GBA counterpart (but labeled M3 NDS Movie Player) and same options (save that you can load .nds files). But you can access, by pressing Select, to what I suspect to be an earlier version of Moonshell (0.9?)
<br/>
<br/>
So I downloaded the latest version of moonshell (1.3finalbeta2), launched the executable, and copied files to my SD. I now have some folders added, and a _BOOT_MP_m3minisd.nds .
<br/>
<br/>
the questions are, how can I load moonshell on startup? I tried to rename _BOOT_MP_m3minisd.nds to _BOOT_MP.nds but with no luck. Do I need to always pass through the M3 menu? If so, how can I upgrade its internal version of moonshell?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It always seems the best third-party game accessories are the worst quality in terms of hardware, and often software. Case in point: the concept of Gameshark is awesome, but using one... ARGH. The N64 ones especially, they had a software bug or something (which never got fixed) that would cause them to sometimes corrupt their flash chip (which contained both the firmware and the codes) when editing a code. The result was usually if you tried to enter the code list it would freeze. Sometimes you got lucky and it was near the bottom of the list while you were playing Banjo-Kazooie, so you could still play half your games with it, other times you were screwed.
<br/>
There was 2 ways to fix this: Connect it to a PC's parallel port and reflash the firmware, or send it to Interact (now out of business, the former US reseller for Datel) for them to do the same.
<br/>
<br/>
Now if you think a game has ever pissed you off... I had one way back in the day, but I had absolutely no access to a computer capable of running the flashing software, nor a short enough cable (too long and it'd time out), so when this happened I always had to send it back in, and it always took SIX MONTHS for them to plug it into their computer, run a program (which takes about a minute) and send it back. (I guess that's how long it took them to get it to boot up. ;-)) So one glorious day I finally recieve mine in the mail after so many months of waiting. Start it up, start putting my codes in (the update installs a default code list)... IT CORRUPTS ITSELF AGAIN AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH
<br/>
<br/>
Which, incidentally, is why I have yet to buy any Datel product since.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I used to use mine all the time (hacking codes and what not).  I guess I'm lucky this never happened to me.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
