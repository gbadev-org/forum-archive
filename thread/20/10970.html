Nit: "Mist" would be German for crap. The english word "Myst" is similar in pronunciation to "Mist", though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
but it might be a bit to big: 700mb and all these movies!
<br/>
<br/>
and how could we play the movies? we need a new codec for ds... uhh, to much work for just 1 game...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lisenceing one of the lovely working movie codecs (see: Metroid, or Dragon Lore) would probably be cheaper then liesenceing the game itself :p
<br/>
<br/>
Actualy, movies wouldnt be that hard, use the DPG format moonshell uses....run the game from a 1Gig CF card.
<br/>
<br/>
Remember, everything resized to the DS's screen will reduce size a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
Id say a port is perfectly possible thinking about it...but the time and work required wouldnt be worth it, imo.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Myst is the only one of the Myst games I didn't get through, sadly.
<br/>
I loved all of them; Myst 4 especially... and Riven was in a class of its own; I just like how the puzzles somehow worked as the player trying to learn about a civilization instead of just trying to work around mehanisms built by some idiot with a lot of time on his hands.
<br/>
It's a shame how different Myst 5 was... though it was still pretty good, I suppose, if I forget how well the previous developers did. (Even more of a travesty that the developer to make that imperfect finale was Cyan themselves). Still, it did have that nice animation work... especially with the faces. And the ending wasn't bad except for the disappointingly ugly view of Releeshahn. I don't see why they couldn't do FMV characters as before, since all the cutscenes had the game take control of the camera.
<br/>
<br/>
I have to play the original Myst some day, and it will have to be on the DS or some other small thing because playing stuff at low resolutions on my PC is just unbearable.
<br/>
<br/>
Riven would be great, too. Not sure if the DS could handle that one, but it could be possible...
<br/>
The only problem in that case is storage space.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised Cyan hasn't released their engine for those games. Presumably it's a little program that reads from a data file, and there's probably nothing totally revolutionary in the program itself.
<br/>
They could get completely legal unofficial ports to all sorts of platforms, and still make money from people buying the data files!<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Sony bought Psygnosis, developer of Lemmings, one of the first side-view real-time sims. When it terminated CLI?, Sony also became the only console maker not to have a handheld system with a stylus. (Microsoft has Pocket PC, and Nintendo has Nintendo DS.) Don't you love it when Sony shoots itself in the foot?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
