    <h4>#175694 - MichaelMossman - Tue Jan 18, 2011 1:08 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In all the examples and tutorials, I have never seen a makefile which allowed the emulator of choice to be automatically RUN after compilation, in the same way that BUILD and CLEAN are used.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some deep-lying technical reason for this or is it just that nobody has considered it necessary ?
<br/>
<br/>
I am not that good with makefiles and I would appreciate any help from the more experience developers.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Mike</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No 'Run' in makefile, I usually define a Tool in programmer notepad.
<br/>
Go under Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Tools and you can define yours.
<br/>
I did 'run in no$gba':
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">command: C:\no$gba\NO$GBA.EXE
<br/>
folder: C:\no$gba
<br/>
parameters: $(ProjectPath)$(ProjectName)
<br/>
shortcuts: ALT + 0</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and similarily also 'run in DeSmuME'...
<br/>
<br/>
so you build and later run the resulting .nds in the emulator. Easy :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That nearly worked but I must have done something wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
NO$GBA loaded but came up with a message "Cartridge Not Found".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I think I've got it ?
<br/>
<br/>
I went int NO$GBA and in the File menu I clicked on Reset Cartridge. This seems to have done the trick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe that didn't work so well, after all.
<br/>
<br/>
I now get to open in the correct folder but NO$GBA still won't recognise the file but keeps looking for a previous nds file which it has opened before, albeit in a different folder.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I still need help please.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyways, since I discovered CodeLite, I never wanted to use any other editor. It even beats out MSVS's editor IMO.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://rel.betterwebber.com" target="_blank">http://rel.betterwebber.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Problem solved due to basic error.
<br/>
<br/>
I renamed the folder and I renamed the .pnproj file but I omitted to change the project name in the Project window of Programmers Notepad.
<br/>
<br/>
What fooled me was that the project name was shown as 'template' and I just didn't realise that this was actually supposed to be the Project Name - I thought it was just a generic word to describe the project hierarchy shown below.
<br/>
<br/>
Its always the silly things that catch us out !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
