    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Using DSLinux and the Retawq browser, you can download straight *.nds files to your card (pressing Shift+D is the equivalent to "save target as" or "save link as").  If you have additional RAM available, you can also use the "unzip" command to uncompress some files, though I haven't had too much success with that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

AWW CRAP!  Ours is called SLURP.. screw it.. I'm not changing the name now.. Anyway, we're working on getting a concept released soon that will do what I think most people would like.  We'll just have to wait and see.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
it definitely be nice to have a really reliable way to move files to and from the DS and save wear/tear on the cards (mostly the mechanism on slot1 card)

I find DSFtp to be pretty flaky for me :\</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dunno exactly what HTTPexec is, except what its used for, does it download to card or does it just execute the .nds? And it seems like just editing the URL would be too easy... like you would have DNS problems or some other conflict with the router...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With HTTPexec, it downloads the *.nds file from the specified url, writes it to (root)\bootme.nds (or wherever you specify in the config file), and attempts to execute it using GrizzlyAdams's bootloader.  I believe it uses the same HTTP library as DSLurper, but I could be wrong.  
<br/>
<br/>
I usually only use it to transfer files when I don't feel like card-swapping, so what I do is specify in the HTTPexec config file to download from <a href="http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/asdf.nds" target="_blank">http://danthemanms.googlepages.com/asdf.nds</a> every time.  Then when I wish to transfer a file, I just copy it to my desktop, rename it to "asdf.nds", and upload it to Googlepages before launching HTTPexec.
<br/>
<br/>
In theory, you could find the url of the .nds file, open up a DS-side text editor that will edit the HTTPexec.conf file, and change the url to download from before launching HTTPexec itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
