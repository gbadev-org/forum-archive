While I know you don't want to use Moonshell, it does offer the stuff you are looking for (to an extent).

The fast-forward and rewind on it are slow, but what it does have is a time bar that let's to go straight to a certain time in the video. Also, it won't save the exact place you left off, but it knows what video you last played, and will automatically play that one if you shut off the system.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DPG Videos for MoonShell can have fast-seek included if the encoding person includes the GOP List when converting movies (in most videos its not included, so the seek function is very slow).<br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">m3's new sakura firmware has the ability to continue DPG playback where it left of, so it's very possible.
<br/>
<br/>
sakura was/is developed by the cat who did moonshell to begin with, in conjunction with the m3 team. 
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the Sakura firmware is only for m3Real, and has only made release in the confines of japan. having said that, though, Sakura has also been "hacked" and translated to play on a few other misc. flash-cartridges, and I believe there might even be a .nds version floating around somewhere-abouts. not sure how compatible it is, though..
<br/>
<br/>
my point is, it's possible.
<br/>
<br/>
also, it's worth noting that seeking in moonshell (or sakura, for that matter) works faster with videos that were encoded with more recent versions of DPGEnc. newer version (dubbed DPG2 or DPG3, if I'm not mistaken) will seek almost immediately, without any visual "glitching" so to say, whereas the older vanilla DPG format will usualy take a second (even upward of a full minute) to seek to the desired spot, with another few seconds before what you're seeing makes any sense.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that seek function exists, in an infant stage, but is very much possible, as well as a resume function.
<br/>
<br/>
egads, I'm VERY pleased with sakura's functions. I'd recommend checking it out. google.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I'm going to fool around with this. I'll just replace Moonshell for a bit and see how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm having problems actually... I tried replacing it with the _DS_MSHL.NDS file and I'm getting a ROM compatibility error. It says something about making sure DLDI was patched correctly. I have an R4, which means I know nothing about DLDI patching. I tried repatching it myself, but I'm getting the same error.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows my problem please help me...
<br/>
EDIT: Got it. The SYSTEM folder is needed.
<br/>
One more thing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wow, I haven't converted DPGs in a while. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think version 3 is the most recent, although I could be wrong. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to hear you were able to resolve things. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm able to run .nds files on sakura, but I'm also using m3 real, which is what sakura is designed for. I know little to nothing about how sakura runs on other cartridges. I've tried a few homebrew, but I know nothing of it's ROM compatability, and this would be far from the place to discuss that. 
<br/>
<br/>
everything that works on my m3 real normaly works on sakura. and, as it were, things that DON'T work on my m3 real (stillalive.nds, for example) still won't run for me. oh how I wish I could play that game..! :(
<br/>
<br/>
anyhow, sakura is BEAUTIFUL as a standalone media player, which is mostly what I've used it for until my DS stopped working. it just turns off AND ON randomly, even turning on in the middle of the night. oi, I don't know what to do about that. I'll eventually buy a freaking new one I guess... I made a post about this in this forum, and was astounded that no one had any ideas to troubleshoot the problem. the post was basicly ignored all around. sadness. :/ (/whining)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no no, you did great. I didn't read it correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
and, yes, tepples is definately right (der). been a while since I got rid of my r4, so I couldn't remember what to name the file to be auto-booted.
<br/>
<br/>
as far as running .nds files, I imagine it might have to do with DLDI.
<br/>
this is all just my speculative guess:
<br/>
you're using an R4 card, but accessing it through sakura firmware. the SYSTEM folder for sakura might have the m3's version of DLDI in it somewhere that you might be able to replace with the R4's. I know my m3 auto-patches, so sakura might be trying to auto patch for a DLDI that is incompatible. if you can find a way to make sakura auto patch with r4's DLDI file, quite possibly disco.
<br/>
<br/>
like I said, this is all just speculation. I wouldn't know how to replace sakura's dldi file, or where to actually begin. perhaps someone here can shed some light on the situation.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: curiosity got to me. I opened up my version of sakura's SYSTEM file, and behold there's a file called DLDI.m3. it's aprox. 11kb in size.
<br/>
looking at my list of dldi's available, it appears that the DLDI file for m3 real is also aprox. 11kb. from there one might deduce a simple swap, but the extensions are different, and thus I'm not sure if it's just as easy as renaming m3real.dldi to dldi.m3 and replacing the file in question. I don't have an arfor (R4) to test that, so I can't do more that speculate. again. sorry, I'm trying to help, though!<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, the Sakura that has been hacked for the R4 has only one file with dldi in the name, dldibody.bin. It is 2.22 kb. Guess the size of r4tf.dldi. 2.22 kb.
<br/>
<br/>
I opened both in a hex editor and they are the same. The exact same. I think, however, that this is used for some of the important firmware files that needed to be patched. Not nds binaries.
<br/>
<br/>
Tockit: This is just a guess, and it probably won't affect anything, but can you tell me the exact directory of the DLDI.m3 file. Maybe this file was just removed and maybe I can rename the R4 dldi in the directory where DLDI.m3 was and get something to happen.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I think this is that I think the firmware freezes up when it can't find the DLDI.m3 file.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's try that.

    <h4>#161881 - Tockit - Sat Aug 16, 2008 8:58 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">okay, here's the story:
<br/>
<br/>
when m3 made the sakura firmware, they also held a release party for it. at the release party they gave a few flashcards away as door prizes. the card included a few sample homebrew binaries to enjoy. since they were making a public release and throwing a "party" of sorts for it, they wanted to be as legit as possible. thus they appended the 2mb limit to the booting of binaries. for obvious reasons. they, thereupon, made a tandem release of sakura that could boot files over 2mb, for whatever reasons you might want. THAT version of the firmware is only available on the japanese sakura website. 
<br/>
<br/>
the hacked version of the firmware that I'm using (dubbed the itouch-sakura-m3 trippleboot or some kinda crap) has the ability to boot all my files with no problems. I didn't have to modify anything at all. although I did find a fancy blue skin to take the place of the existing froofy pink one.
<br/>
<br/>
let it be known that NO OFFICIAL version of sakura has been released for the US as of yet. on that note, let it also be mentioned that the makers of sakura contacted the person(s) involved in hacking the english version and asked if they could use their work to start on an english release. charming, huh? when the official english version comes out, I doubt it'll have the tandem release as mentioned above, as it's not likely they would consider a release "party" of sorts in the states. thus it'll likely just be ready to go as is.
<br/>
<br/>
as far as slillalive goes - that has never been able to boot on my m3, regardless of firmware. dunno why. I keep hoping the author will address the issue with a new release, but no disco.
<br/>
<br/>
anyhow, I'm glad to find you can use your sakura to it's fullest now. I had a feeling it was something about the dldi function. 
<br/>
<br/>
let it be known any mention of binaries &gt; 2MB on my part are strictly limited to HOMEBREW binaries. I can't speak for ROM compatability (nor would I) as I have no interest in anything beyond homebrew and media with my flashcards. both of those seem to work just dandy though.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
