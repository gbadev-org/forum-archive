    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At one point, deep in the mists of time, I used a set of cygwin tools to provide bash and asociated linux style tools. This caused incredible problems with other cygwin based tools, especially with official toolchains that supplied their own version of the cygwin environment. Using msys instead was the best solution at the time since it avoided all the conflicts I had been seeing.
<br/>
<br/>
There have been other problems since running the devkitPro tools within a cygwin environment with segfaults for no readily apparent reason. I was never able to determine what particular alignment of the stars was causing this but removing cygwin from the path *always* fixed it.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that makes devkitPro toolchains faster than their cygwin based equivalents is that they are win32 native and not reliant on external dlls which perform path translation amongst other things. This also means that they will not recognise either cygwin or msys mount points which can lead to difficulties when using cygwin make. I haven't tried the devkitPro build system within cygwin but I suspect it will run foul of the mount point issue.
<br/>
<br/>
Something else to consider here is that not all devkitPro users have the same competence level. In fact a very small minority actually understand makefiles or a lot of the underlying architechture which makes things relatively easy for the complete novice.
<br/>
<br/>
Programmers with a lot of experience may well prefer their own particular system and that's a perfectly valid approach. On the other hand, the build system I created has a few features which sometimes even seasoned programmers gloss over. The auto dependency generation in particular is something that many people have problems getting to work right in their own systems. Over the years I've seen quite a few projects where "bugs" were "fixed" by performing a clean build.
<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not you agree with the approach I've taken you must admit that homebrew is a *lot* easier than it once was.
<br/>
<br/>
I may get anal on occasion about the use of the toolchains but it's only because I've seen newbies tying themselves in knots trying to follow the advice of seasoned "professionals" :P<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I understand that you like your own tools and you may even be capable of fixing problems that you find. It's not <span style="font-weight: bold">you</span> that ends up having to fix the mess when inexperienced users try it.
<br/>
<br/>
The dependencies generated are incompatible with cygwin's make because devkitARM is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> a cygwin toolchain.
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, while I'm interested in such issues, I have to take the route which leads to fewer support requests.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

I must say, wow, censoring my post here is something I consider really bizarre behavior. I wasn't encouraging people to use that hack, I just mentioned how to get around the problem. Inexperienced users wouldn't be able to take my comment and implement it into a build-system anyway.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would you like to take over devkitPro support for a while and see just how much people manage to destroy things while attempting to "fix" their problems using, in most cases, totally unrelated code fragments? Still, I guess it wouldn't be tech support without the odd horror story and a couple of "twelve o'clock flashers" breaking things :P
<br/>
<br/>
It's <span style="font-weight: bold">great</span> that you can use devkitARM under cygwin and I have a great deal of respect for someone who obviously knows their tools as well as you do.
<br/>
<br/>
If there's one thing I've learned from creating devkitPro it's that the majority of people out there aren't "just like me". People like to follow "steps", they like to be told what to do and if someone with apparent knowledge and authority tells them they can fix a particular issue by doing a particular thing they <span style="font-weight: bold">will</span> do it. They'll do it even if they don't have that problem and even in some cases where they aren't even using the same software.

<br/>
Anyway, I'm splitting this off now, I just noticed that I missed jandujar's reply  due to the topic drift, oops.
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the alternative approach would have been to split these posts off sooner and hope that your sedfu got buried before someone noticed it. It's always an incredibly difficult decision to make and not one I take lightly.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

Cygwin's libc is under the GNU GPL, with the so-called "viral" provision in full effect. Any third-party tool available for Cygwin is going to be available under the GPL for you to port to MSYS.

Actually, the tools I'm talking about is already GPL. In fact, it's another GCC-build for some other piece of hardware - I just never managed to make MinGW builds of GCC myself.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don't really find your point to be generally valid, as porting can be a lot of work. Cygwin provides an easy way of porting from unix to something that can be run under windows, and imo that's a good thing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Much agreed.  Maybe add a huge warning that it will mess up a system or something, but to just delete it?  Ahh well.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Just to chime in again with my experience of it,
<br/>
- the makefiles never work for me under cygwin, but I always write my own anyway
<br/>
- the tools *rarely* segfault (only gdb for me, when I do certain things)
<br/>
- the path mapping (ie /cygdrive/c/ versus msys' /c/) is the only major problem, but you get used to it
<br/>
<br/>
Tbh I don't really know why I use cygwin...but I've used it too long to bother changing to msys!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This may be GDB related as I have had GDB seg fault and not step correctly when talking to on hardware and desmume GDB stub. As mentioned elsewhere on these forums, GDB version 6.6 behaves much better, i.e. I have not seen it crash.

This is running under Linux by the way.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
