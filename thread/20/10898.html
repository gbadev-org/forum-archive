    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm new to these forums but I have read them for a few months and I came across the LED mod for gba carts. So one day i decide to do that to my GBAMP and now my DS won't turn on. The only sign of life I get from it is if I plug in the charger and then the charge light only stays on for about 2 seconds. If I turn on the DS while the light turns on all I hear is the LCD's fire up or it crackles and then immediately it turns off help needed!!!!!! also this is a firmware v2 phat DS. Also PM me if you need any sprites done :)(I do sprites :D. Please anyone !!! I need help I'm chewing on my tongue right now I need a fix or I can't do anything in the HB scene anymore I'm broke :(.<br/>_________________<br/>eat more potatoes! its starch! yay starch!!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

After that, the ds wouldn't turn on and when I did the same thing with trying to use the charger and turning it on, you get a weird sound. The only suggestion is to get a new ds.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So did you even check the broken fuse? It's not that hard to fix. It's just one little tiny piece of wire that is blown, and everything else should be working fine still. Seems kind of dumb to replace the whole DS if it's just the fuse.

That's like when you blow the breaker at your house, buying a new house instead of flipping the breakers in your basement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you are any good at solding SMT parts, replacing the fuse would be best.

Or maybe you could mod a small <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker" target="_blank">circuit breaker</a> into your NDS unit (An idea which I like).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: blue">Blue NDS v4 (FlashMe v7) - GBAMP V2 CF</span>

because I bridged the fuse and it's working, but I still need a line of defence so my DS doesn't go x.X .

Or try and read the values on the fuse?

I know they're small but they still have a value painted on (normally anyway).<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE
