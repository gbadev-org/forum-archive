<br/>
<br/>
Some thing like this with a black screen. There are some wrong operations of &lt;a href="http://www.dsgameruk.com/"&gt;&lt;font color="0000ff"&gt;R4 Card&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maybe cause this problem. You can fix them easily.
<br/>
<br/>
The Wrong kernel file. 
<br/>
<br/>
You must make sure you download the right kernel from the official website. There are mamy &lt;a href="http://www.dsgameruk.com/"&gt;&lt;font color="0000ff"&gt;R4 Cards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. R4 3DS card. All of  them have different kernels. Can?t use the same one. And many official sites have very similar name.So you must check the URL on the package and download the right kernel.
<br/>
<br/>
(PS: many site provide upgrade patch,don?t use them. If you can?t make sure, ask your provider first)
<br/>
<br/>
Old cards which are blocked by the Nintendo New System.
<br/>
<br/>
The latest block action was on 2013.8 . So if your R4 cards was bought before 2013.8 or You buy the old cards Maybe your device will show this error message. 
<br/>
<br/>
YOu should upgrade your R4 Card on a lower version 3DS(XL) or 2DS,DSi/DS console. Download the upgrade file from the official website. Some cards inlucde the upgrade patch in the Kernel file. If you don?t know how send mail to  your provider.
<br/>
<br/>
Bad or fake micro sd card
<br/>
<br/>
Many fake sites provide fake micro sd card or bad card to customers. These micro sd card can?t work well. Maybe casue this problem. Please change a original micro sd card and format to FAT32.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
