    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does ANYONE know if someone has developed a wireless app for the nintendo DS that allows it to act as a receiver for a wireless cam?
<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of something where I could drop a mini-wireless-cam somewhere, get just within range, and open my DS and view the screen.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hasn't someone created an app that turns the DS into an Access Point?
<br/>
<br/>
I just thought for sure that someone had already done this, and if not, maybe someone will see this and go "hmmmmmm... that could be fun."
<br/>
<br/>
It would be wonderful to have something like this, so I guess I'll just cross my fingers and hope a DS homebrew dev-guy thinks like I do and makes one. I'd buy it!<br/>_________________<br/>I'm cuckoo for contraband!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately no...
<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for a way to discreetly drop a cam off somewhere, then pop my DS open and view that(those) cam(s) live... choppy, still images spaced seconds apart, whatever...
<br/>
<br/>
Something like this could be use for a limitless range of possibilities...
<br/>
<br/>
But I would like to take a look at this DSCam.
<br/>
It sounds interesting.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm cuckoo for contraband!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
