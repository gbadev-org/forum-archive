    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I suggest that everyone who homebrews or enjoys a good homebrew moves out of wherever they are now, and we do a hostile takeover of Hawaii, or Japan, or Australia, or Vancouver Island, or something like that. (Some kind of island).  Then we'll just homebrew until the cows come home.  This would suggest that we send the cows away first.  And since cows can't swim...
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, yes.  Lonely bunch.  I would agree with that, at least on my part.  :(  But that'll change someday, right?  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What about a homebrew multiplayer game that uploads itself onto the ram of the cartridge-less DS that your friends have?
<br/>
<br/>
Much like the Mario Kart DS game, where you only need 1 cart for 8 friends to play locally</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
