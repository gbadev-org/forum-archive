    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good day to you, I hope. 
<br/>
<br/>
Today, I completely screwed up my compact flash card. 
<br/>
<br/>
It may not seem like much, I think I can get a new one, but meanwhile, Im stuck with transfering homebrew via WMB (and i still dont know how) (I just flashed my NDS, so it is possible). 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, It seems that Windows wont let me format my flash card, fdisk wont touch it, and several norton utilities wont help me either. 
<br/>
<br/>
What I need is a simple app that will let me delete certain files and if possible, format the card. 
<br/>
<br/>
According to one of the many utilities I used, I screwed up the track 0. I can still see the files there, but I cant touch them. Can't add new, can't delete old. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, is my compact flash gone? Or is there any way to restore it (recover track 0) or something? Magnets, screwdrivers, loading apps via Dloadplay?
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help me, I'll really appreciate it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks! Ill definitely try this one!
<br/>
<br/>
CubeGuy: Im not sure, but i'll try if the hex editor doesnt work. 
<br/>
<br/>
Sebbo: I do have an old PPC, I'll try that one third. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone! Ill try everything suggested!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Well, I tried the editor. It wont let me rewrite, so I lost all faith in the card, and Ill buy a new one first chance I get. 
<br/>
<br/>
The error it gives me is: Unable to write sector 0. The device might not be ready, locked, contain bad sectors,  or require user permisions...
<br/>
<br/>
Ah well.. I'll still try the other 2 methods, but I dont think either will work...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm still not completely sure on how I managed to do it, but it can happen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Stupid but worth a try use the HexWorkshop method by natrium42 above make an image to your harddrive of the card open image blank to all 0's and write it back... although I'm thinking you'll get the same outcome
<br/>
<br/>
You can also run error checking on the drive in windows
<br/>
<br/>
And I think this program might be of use to you

<br/>
<br/>
I tried F-Secure image recovery, with no result. 
<br/>
<br/>
I tried my PPC, with no result either. 
<br/>
<br/>
HexWorkshop won't let me touch it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell wont help me either. 
<br/>
<br/>
I tried all Windoze and Norton utilities with no help. 
<br/>
<br/>
The reader still works, with the new card, I placed a bunch of MP3s and the new Lost episode (2x11), and with Moonshell, everything is working fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Ill give it a try with Media Recover's software. And I'll post the results. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback everyone!
<br/>
<br/>
And Josath: I'd be interesting to know how to destroy the track 0, as to know how to not destroy it :P
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: Tried the Media Recover with no luck :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ill try the Xbox thing when I get the chance. I dont have an xbox, but a friend does. 
<br/>
<br/>
Second, I dont think formatting is possible, I tried with fat and fat32 with no luck, I'll try running Knoppix or Ubuntu live and attempt to format it from there later. 
<br/>
<br/>
Im back to listening MP3s and reading my ebooks on my NDS thanks to my friend's compact flash card.
