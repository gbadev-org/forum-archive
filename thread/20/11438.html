<br/>
Anyone got a working Master Code for it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure about Pokemon..but here are the steps I took to get Castlevania DS (jap) working:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Download Dipstar 5.11 or 5.12ff
<br/>
<br/>
2. Write dipstar.ds.gba to G6 as a GBA rom with the game manager with no options ticked. 
<br/>
<br/>
3. Drag and drop your ds rom onto m3dip.exe (located in the m3dip folder of the extracted dipstar package), a DOS window will pop-up and press Enter. 
<br/>
<br/>
4. Write your dipped ds rom to your G6 with the correct settings that works with the game. 
<br/>
<br/>
5. Turn on NDS, goto MyCard&gt;GBA folder and scroll down to Dipstart.nds.gba, Press X button ONCE. 
<br/>
<br/>
6. Go back to NDS folder and load the desire game then quickly press and hold the L button. 
<br/>
<br/>
7. Dipstar should load. 
<br/>
<br/>
You have 8 slots to enter codes. Each slot is for each button (A,B,Start,Select &amp; directional) 
<br/>
<br/>
Press the desire button where you want to save to codes in then enter the codes.
<br/>
Press Start to save the code. 
<br/>
<br/>
Reboot your NDS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Goto MyCard&gt;GBA folder and scroll down to Dipstart.nds.gba, Press X button ONCE. 
<br/>
<br/>
Go back to NDS folder and load the desire game then quickly press and hold the button where you saved the codes in (ex. if you saved the codes in directional UP, then hold UP while the game is loading). 
<br/>
<br/>
You can try the cheat codes in the G6 installation folder first, just to make sure everything works.
<br/>
Hope that helps!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem that I keep getting is the last part: running the ROM.
<br/>
<br/>
Every ROM that I drag onto m3dip.exe always comes up as 2 blank white screens, with dipstar loaded and without dipstar loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
Any fix?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also not sure I'm converting the ARDS codes into dipstar codes correctly.
<br/>
I'm using ARCrypt, as I understand that's the tool needed.
<br/>
I uncheck 'expert mode', as I'm not an expert in any means.
<br/>
I paste the ARDS code into the left box and hit the proceed button. I assume the code on the right is dipstar.

if you're using dipstar 3.3 then you must hold down the button for like 10-15 seconds when the pie is loading b4 the game actually loads</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What I did was I kept holding down the key I assigned a cheat to and it loaded the game, but 2 blank white screens and nothing else.
<br/>
<br/>
Before I start, I just want to get on record that I've read every thread on dipstar from several different forums, and they're all useless. No solid information.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm very confused with this dipstar program, I can't seem to find any straight answers.
<br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is this:
<br/>
-Master code. I know all games need one, and I know how to get it using ndsmas, but how do I use it? This could be why my games don't load.
<br/>
Where do I put it?
<br/>
<br/>
-Codes. When I load dipstar and choose the button I want a code to be on, there are always a whole bunch of values already in. What do I do? Clear however many lines I need for a certain cheat?
<br/>
<br/>
-txt2dip. What the hell is this? Here's an example of what I put in a blank .txt document
<br/>

This is for Tetris DS. I found that code on the Codejunkies website.
<br/>
I load it in txt2dip and select a slot (which I assume is the button I hold). What file should I 'write' it to?
<br/>
I've been writing it to dipstar.ds.sav then converting that .sav to a .0, but the G6 manager won't let me copy it because it's not 1MBit.
<br/>
<br/>
I basically just want to know how the hell to use these codes...it shouldn't be this difficult but apparently it is.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm also not sure how the heck txt2dip works on the G6. basially, I just enter the code manually!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
to get mastercode using ndsmas, type ndsmas *.nds (*=name of file)
<br/>
I believe only 1 MasterCode is needed for each game..if you found more than 1 MasterCode..try them 1by1 to see which one actually works.
<br/>
<br/>
and you need to convert the AR code to dipstar format b4 u can use it, with the exception of PacMan3? orginal AR codes on Codejunkies works on that game without conversion.
<br/>
<br/>
as for tetris, try to type this on your assign button to save the codes in

0--&gt;2

1--&gt;1

2--&gt;0

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ooh, okay, so I put the master code in the same button code as the cheat?

I'm going to try that now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried every master code that ndsmas found and got blank white screens on all of them. Maybe I didn't enter them right?
<br/>
<br/>
I loaded dipstar in code mode (L trigger), chose which button I wanted to activate, entered the master code (only 1 at a time) on the first line and the cheat on the next 2 lines.
<br/>
<br/>
I also saw on the Codejunkies website
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Must Be On
<br/>
03807d3c ebafd8b0</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
as the first code.
<br/>
Thinking that could be it, I changed that to
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">23807d3c ebafd8b0</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and that didn't work. Same blank white screens.
<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, yes I am loading dipstar every time I try to run the rom, not just to enter codes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I dipped Brain Age and flashed it to my G6.
<br/>
Loaded up dipstar and manually entered in a master code I found with ndsmas and a code found on Codejunkies.

<br/>
When I start the rom (with dipstar loaded) and do not hold the code button I get 2 blank white screens for a few seconds, then the game boots up fine.

When I start the rom (with dipstar loaded) and do hold the code button I set (select) then I get 2 blank white screens for a longer while, then 2 blank black screens and then nothing else, so I powered off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
