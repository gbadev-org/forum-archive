    <h4>#118212 - HyperHacker - Sun Feb 11, 2007 2:00 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh I could name a few.
<br/>
<br/>
-Top screen touchable. :-p
<br/>
-GBA link port, even if not useable in GBA mode, it would still have some use.
<br/>
-Built-in GPS and tilt/motion sensors. I know these have been done with external cards (though I don't think GPS was ever actually built into a card like NDSMotion was, probably because it's so expensive). It'd still be cool to have them built in though.
<br/>
-Some sort of adapter that would allow reading GBC carts (using external battery if necessary, or possibly it could "splice in" to the DS's battery by connecting to the pads in the battery socket - does it provide 5 volts?) - from there, emulation would allow true GBC support. I've seen crazier (same thing done on GBA, with NES carts) so why not?
<br/>
-USB host port. Yeah it'd kill the battery, but still...
<br/>
-A/B/X/Y button "rotation"; some sort of chip that would remap the buttons to act as if you just rotated the entire thing 90?. Finally play GBA games the way they should be!
<br/>
-Camera!
<br/>
-Longer-lasting battery; ability to determine battery life in software.
<br/>
<br/>
One hack I've considered is a DS robot using the NDS Motion Card. Put a DS on a remote control car and have it control the motors. You could use another DS, PC, PDA etc to control it, or have it just kinda wander or travel preset paths. The motion sensor would tell it how fast it were moving, and allow it to know when it runs into something; from there, it could essentially build a map of the room, and "learn" where things are and avoid bumping into them. (It'd also be able to tell you via wifi or beeping if it fell over, one of the motors stopped working (it's running them but not moving as fast as it should be), etc.)
<br/>
Maybe it could even fly a toy helicopter, if you could get one strong enough to carry the DS. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
Only problem is, I don't know what such a robot would <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> aside from make people go "oooooooh". For it to go fetch me a beer, it'd need to be able to climb stairs, which would mean either an aircraft (in which case weight becomes an issue) or legs (not coding/building that thanks), not to mention be able to open the fridge and reach the can. There's really nothing downstairs I'd want it to grab, and I rarely have a reason to be upstairs. Maybe it could race or something. Turn it into a remote lawnmower/pooper scooper? Do stunts for movies? Heck, maybe just design a car for it with a slot-1 adapter and sell it as a toy. :-p<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by HyperHacker on Mon Feb 12, 2007 2:30 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
Have you seen Mash-Mods' DS Chip Advanced (search Google)?  It lets you use the DS's Y and X buttons either as Turbo B and A or as L and R (which is great).  You should contact Mash and suggest adding a mode where Y and B act as B and A, he'd probably do it.  Only downside is that he can't fit the chip into a DS Lite.

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Beast:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Dimension-wise it's the same size as the entire underside of the DS, depth-wise it's probably half the depth of the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
What's inside?
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>32mb of RAM
<br/>
</li><li>microSD card slot
<br/>
</li><li>USB slot
<br/>
</li><li>FPU
<br/>
</li><li>An additional ARM9, maybe two :-)
<br/>
</li><li>IR
<br/>
</li><li>BlueTooth
<br/>
</li><li>RS232 Interface
<br/>
</li><li>10/100 Ethernet port
<br/>
</li><li>Internal battery for powering the above
<br/>
</li><li>AC Power input
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
In the realm of reality? Probably not, although I imagine you could integrate at least some of those and still have space for a battery and AC input (Both of which I think would be necessary for keeping the goodies happy)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

other than that, the current ds lite is probably one of the best pieces of kit I own

...how is it NOT the same way?  Are you one of those people that lined up your thumb on top of both the A and B buttons at the same time on the Game Boy?  I always thought it was designed for you to place your thumb in-between A and B so that it's perpendicular to them.  Then you can rock your thumb back and forth.
<br/>
<br/>
Or if it's something like Mario Kart: Super Circuit, you could center your thumb on A and then rock it to the left to hit the B button.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd say that the next unit from nintendo could definitely do with a ram/speed increase. However, I'd also really like to see a divide operator and an FPU, so the 3D doesn't quite look like it's on a PS1. ^_^
<br/>
<br/>
As for extra hardware, I really don't see the point of having both screens be touch screens. I can see it for added flexibility, but really games only function properly with the bottom screen for touch and the top screen for statistics and such, or a map, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't mind a camera, but few people would ever use it. Now, what would really make me happy is an improved Wifi interface. I would like a nintendo account to be linked to my DS, and I would like official games (liek mariokart, for example) to let me post scores and replays, and then let my friends download them, etc. This way, I could let my friends see my replays without having to be in the same room.
<br/>
<br/>
Improved speed on Wifi isn't really going to happen in any decent way-- you've seen how badly SSBB can lag on the Wii, and it's got decent Wifi as it is. The internet itself is really too slow to do it without any issues.
<br/>
<br/>
Bluetooth would be really neat, assuming that the next generation of Nintendo console is going to use bluetooth controllers again. (I hope so, the wiimote works really well.)
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I'm sure I DON'T want is motion controls built in. In select instances, motion controls are neat with a screen attached to them. In most cases, I think motion controls would get in the way of playing. Think about trying to drive a car with the screen in your hands-- you'd have to tilt your head to see where you were going. Not a good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm also sure I don't want the next DS to become a cell phone, or let me download music, etc. Those things are reserved for iphones, I don't want to pay for one on my DS. (As for homebrew MP3 players, we need more, they are wonderful things. ^_^ My DS outperforms my dad's ipod, it's so neat!)
<br/>
<br/>
I definitely want to see the return of the touch screen in general, I think it was an excellent idea. I wouldn't mind making it multi-touch, although that seems a bit silly for gaming, it's more useful for applications and such. I DEFINITELY love the stereo speakers, they are such high quality that it makes me all happy inside.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I wouldn't mind at all is a joystick of some kind. Better quality than that of the PSP obviously, but it would allow a greater degree of control. I think that the current folding design also makes a joystick easier to house in such a way that it cannot be damaged easily, so we may see one. I'm tired of d+pads, really I am. No matter how easy it made snaking in MarioKart, no matter how much fun I have winning on Wifi because of it, I think D+pads are out of style. But that's just me.
<br/>
<br/>
I've ranted long enough now. Next!

<br/>
To me, the PS1 look comes from the lack of texture filtering more than from some sort of geometry bottleneck that you seem to imply. The DS games I've played sure have a better frame rate than PS1 games (except for Animal Crossing, which for some reason runs much slower than the GCN version).

I agree about mobile phones to an extent, but there's nothing wrong with downloading music if a system can download other user-generated content.
