    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well i really don't no if I should do this. Anyways, my friends dad knows the private RSA key, and I might be able to get it from him for homebrew and ask him to build wifime2. The chances of him saying that he can get it for me are really about 15% out of 100% because one, he probally doesn't want to get fired, and two, he might say no. So if I get the chance to talk to my friends dad, and see what he says about it, I'll let everyone know right away.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd say there's a 100% chance your friend's dad will get tracked, fired and sued by Nintendo. You might have had a better chance if you hadn't made a public topic about it.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, yeah, go ahead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well thats the thing though, I don't want to make this topic plublic, but since people are wanting to know it, I'm not sure yet. So on the poll, if I get the highest, then I'll go with that, except for who am I again, that means no. Also, if the poll results in no, then please lock this topic for end of discussion mods. Anyways, the polls result right now is 4 to 3, Yes.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by dshacker on Mon Aug 07, 2006 6:19 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If I were you, I wouldn't ask him, because that can seriously damage the relationship with your friend. Also, your chance of getting the key are not 15%, but close to 0% if your friend's dad has at least a minimum amount of common sense (imho, ymmv).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
