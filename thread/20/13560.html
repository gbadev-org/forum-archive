    <h4>#132970 - Creebo - Mon Jul 02, 2007 8:55 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I know most of you aren't, but CreeboMe is coming out of beta/alpha stages. This time I am coding it from the beginning, scrapping anything that was in the previous version. Hopefully most (if not all) devices will be supported with the ability to boot a DS game card without even flashing your DS. As of now things are going according to plan without many hiccups.
<br/>
<br/>
Things going to be added include:
<br/>
-4 backlight modes for DS lite
<br/>
-Every feature will be available without flashing
<br/>
-Fixing the bug that will not let you use the failsafe when a DS card is inserted
<br/>
-User friendly installer that notifies you with sound when the flashing is complete
<br/>
-Hopefully faster everything as I am redoing the menu
<br/>
-Touchscreen support
<br/>
-RTC support
<br/>
-Ability to change your settings
<br/>
-The skin now looks almost exactly like the original firmware
<br/>
<br/>
For the devers out there:
<br/>
I will be booting homebrew, gba, and ds carts with assembly code. Last time I made the mistake of using only tilemaps. Now sprites will be used for things like all of the buttons and icons. Hopefully this will leave me with more than enough space for a WifiMe type application.
<br/>
<br/>
I might have this done by September but it is not official.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would probably only consider it if it had some of these features:
<br/>
Obviously DS/GBA/DS-thru-SLOT2 booting.
<br/>
Some kind of useful Wifi feature, whether its multiboot, or save using FAT (possible from firmware?)
<br/>
No power-cycles (between firmware features, obviously not after booting DS/GBA)
<br/>
Original Pictochat
<br/>
...maybe the ability to pack-in your own .nds before flashing, provided its small enough, and then execute it from the firmware. Maybe you would provide a few small things for us to select? Calendar, calculator, notepad, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to access FAT on a card from the main firmware, provided it had a DLDI driver? I would love my file-browser to be my main firmware, and be able to cut my cards firmware entirely.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

I think a multiboot thing would be possible, but saving to fat would never work. FAT support greatly increases the firmware's size and I am already having trouble with the 256KB limit put on me and many things still have to be added.

I am not exactly sure what you mean by that but I am going to assume you would like to keep the DS on as long as possible. For example, say you wanted to test some homebrew you just created. So you boot your homebrew. Oh no, some work still needs to be done. Normally you would turn off the DS, transfer the file and boot it again.
<br/>
   I am hoping to figure out how to reset the DS back to the firmware via software. If I can accomplish this, you would be able to put some code in your application that would allow you to reset. I haven't researched this much, but I think it's quite possible.

It would be pretty useless to have only 256KB available for your own homebrew, but I am planning on having different versions based on different embedded applications. Oh btw, the calendar will be on the topscreen like the original firmware.

As I said before, this would unfortunately increase the size of the firmware beyond the 256KB limit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

if a firmware supported one or two fat devices that are typicly installed, then the firmware could read the reast (some modules) of what it needs from the fat device, no?

how about loading .nds via ftp or http or file sharing or similar, with remembering the last couple files loaded.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A firmware replacement might have its own .nds loader that bypasses the flash equipment's menu, especially if the flash equipment's menu has defects in its .nds loader.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
