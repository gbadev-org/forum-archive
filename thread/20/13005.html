Do a search for Freecraft and take a look at what happened to those guys. Blizzard DOES NOT play nicely with people who don't want to mod within their own limited frameworks (Ie. Level editors...)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

The FreeCraft project lives on, just under a different name ("Stratagus"). In fact, the PocketPC version use the Stratagus engine, it's even being mentioned in the first sentence of the that forum-post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
