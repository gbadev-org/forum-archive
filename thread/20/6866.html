Super Puzzle Fighter II isn't Rare; it's Capcom. It's not really all that lowercase rare either.

Well, Hello all the community, I'm new here ;)
<br/>
No, there's no gap between the two screens, but I don't think it will be very bad playing pacman without this functionnality.
<br/>
Also, I have some problem with Miss PacMan, It don't want to start with the bootleg proms ... I don't know why. Perhaps the malloc of 64K is too much for the DS ?
<br/>
I am also in search for a very very simple and easy unzip engine. Does someone know where I can find one ? I'm just using gbfs and all the roms unzipped for now ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Might want to look into the LZSS compression built into the DS. Or, you can look at <a href="http://www.ibsensoftware.com/products_aPLib.html" target="_blank">http://www.ibsensoftware.com/products_aPLib.html</a> (i've used it, slower, but better compression. compiles easily on DS.) Search for 'compression gba' on some search engines, i think there are some other ones out there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Will you be implementing gbfs the way you did it with your colleco emu?  If so is there anyway you could make it work on the gbamp as currently it doesn't.  Check the thread here for reasons gbfs doesn't work from the gbamp:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, sorry but yes ... I will use the same method because roms are copyright and I can't embedded them with the executable.
<br/>
It was not the same problem with VectxDS, we can use roms so I embedded them in the .nds and .ds.gba  files.
<br/>
If some have a methode to know how to check the gbamp and to use gbfs with it, so please tell me :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'v written a simple gbfs injector on my site <a href="http://gpf.dcemu.co.uk" target="_blank">http://gpf.dcemu.co.uk</a> on the left nav bar under Utilities download gbfsinjector.rar
<br/>
<br/>
doesn't do any error checking, it just searchs for the gbfs pineight string in the nds file and start replacing from there so if the new file is larger then the embedded it probably wont work. But the source is there if anyone wants to add that to it.
