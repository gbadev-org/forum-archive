    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello I was wondering if anyone knows how to get a DS rom made with DevKit Advanced to run on a Nitro(the official DS dev kit, the blue ones).  The thing is I don't have access to this Nitro someone remotely wants to run my ROM and see.

I thought Devkit Advance 1. was no longer maintained and 2. came with only GBA scripts. Try porting your program to the latest version of devkitARM first.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm not an authorized developer because I don't have office space and a prior commercial PC title, so I can't help you. But I predict multiple issues: <ul><li>Apps built with devkitARM have an integrated .nds loader for ds.gba mode so that it'll also work on more SLOT-2 homebrew cards. </li><li>Apps built with devkitARM usually have a smaller header size. From ndstool's help text:
<br/>
</li></ul></span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">  Header size          -h size
<br/>
  A header size of 0x4000 is default for real cards, 0x200 for homebrew.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"> <li>IOS is the input/output system running on the ARM7 CPU when in DS mode. (Wii uses a similar system; homebrewers didn't know the name "IOS" until the Wii was cracked and "IOS" showed up in update partitions.) Homebrew uses a different IOS from the ones that Nintendo's development tools expect. Libnds prior to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/devkitarm/devkitarm-libgba-libnds-libfat-dswifi-and-a-big-surprise/" target="_blank">two weeks ago</a> was designed to work with a bare-bones IOS, and most homebrew apps that played sound or used the Wi-Fi radio customized it thoroughly. More recent libnds works with a bigger IOS that "now contains interfaces for dswifi and maxmod along with a fifo based command system." But if you use non-Nintendo IOS with Nintendo dev tools, you might get fireworks, and I don't mean the kind you see in FantaVision for PS2. I've been told the official PC-based emulator used by authorized developers doesn't even emulate the ARM7 CPU but instead uses <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_emulation" target="_blank">high-level emulation</a> for IOS. <br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sorry, discussions of the Nitro SDK are outside the remit of this board and anyone with the knowledge to answer your question would be breaching their NDA by doing so.
<br/>
<br/>
If official developers have an interest in allowing devkitARM to work with the official kit then please contact me privately. I believe some modifications can be made to allow this while working blind but obviously this will need someone with official access for testing purposes.

As far as I'm aware the term IOS only applies to Wii.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
