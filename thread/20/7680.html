I won't give examples, because some may find the intended humour I would be using as offensive to the concept of this "e-meter".

But don't take it TOO seriously.  (Anyone who takes Matt or Trey seriously needs help).  I just like the way they explain it.  You can also find out about Mormons, Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and more from other episodes (although if memory serves, Mormonism and Scientology are the only ones they explain to a greater degree).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think that the tone of a thread is essentially unknowable to the reader. Descartes' take on dualism has nothing to do with this, but I mention it for the sake of saying a name that sounds French.
<br/>
<br/>
Whereas Ryle or Armstrong, the former being a logical behaviorist and the latter a reductive materialist, are more or less, the polar view to dualism. They, in fact, don't believe in the soul or the "immaterial mind". And this, of course, also has absolutely nothing (or, perhaps, if taken conceptually abstract, to a lesser degree, infinitesimal) to do with this topic.
<br/>
<br/>
I will, however, say the names Spinoza and Leibniz, who both were very influential rationalists. This has more to do with the subject that has nothing to with this thread's subject, in fact, than this thread's subject.
