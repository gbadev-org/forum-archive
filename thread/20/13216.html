Do you have a complete map of all the menus and data structures used by MUGEN? If so, we would have a requirements document, and we would be able to reimplement a fighting game engine for the DS. But you would still have to be near an open access point in order to play multiplayer.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

All the instructions of character data files comes with it. The characters you can change a lot, unfortuneatly you cannot change the menus and other stuff as much as I would like it to be. Does it have to use all of the exact same menus anyways?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, Mugen seems pretty crappy anyway.  Mugen always feels like the very low-end of fighters from the early '90s, like Time Killers or something.  I don't know if this is just how it has to be in order to be so expandable or if the fighting engine could actually be designed better.  BUt I don't think I'd have any joy playing Mugen on my DS.  Well, maybe some, but certainly not pure or utter joy.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I particularly liked the Killer Instinct SNES port as it seemed to me that the fighting engine was identical to the arcade version, right down the the bugs!  
<br/>
You can do 'missed' endings to combos but I think the 99-hit combo bug with the firedude wasn't present in the SNES version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
