    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember the gba had a Bible homebrew (In KJV) on the gba.  
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to utilize the DS' two screens as one Big page so that text could be larger and more easily read?
<br/>
<br/>
If any developer could make "BibleDs" with a table of contents (books of the bible) a search function and with bookmarks, I would be deeply obliged.  I do not want to use old gba apps!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure this would be quicker than flipping through pages of the book.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: red"><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">**EDIT** 9/9/06:  Since, nobody appears to have made any effort to create such an application, I downloaded the entire KJV bible in .txt format, and divided it up into books.  Here is the file if anyone is interested.
<br/>
<br/>
For best results, use DsOrganize to open up each text file (you can view across both the top and bottom screens)  using the "y" button, and use the "a" button to bookmark.</span></span>

just about every old book predicts something, nostradamus (spelling?) is said to have predicted loads of stuff that came true, however he did this in the form of poetry, wich by its nature can be interprated any way you want. some people see meaning, some people see emotional words. Unless the bible actually says, "There will be trouble in the middle east in the years 2005 through 2006" then im afraid you're wrong.

I've been wanting a good ebook reader for sometime... the M3 and Moonshell's txt reader functions are decent, but really don't give you a good reading experience - a two screen reader would do wonders, as well as having it rotate-able to give that feeling of reading a book.
<br/>
<br/>
One other note on the HTML front - it *could* be used to implement pictures as well, which would be useful as a LOT of the books I have have a small picture for every chapter beginning, which would be nice to see, giving the user more of a feeling of reading a book, yet again. Making an actual ebook reader (like Microsoft Journal or Adobe Reader, for .pdf files), might be too cpu intensive.. basic formatting in HTML would allow it to run very quickly.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

With a normal text search, searching for something like "Job" to begin with would probably bring up a LOT of results - what about if you wanted to search chapter titles only? or just search the TOC, etc... You'd have to change chapter titles to give it a different style of header... Probably could be easily done with .xml but then we'd need the proper .xml parser alongside that.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

RELIGION:

Now, I already know what people are going to say to this; "What about the crusades? And George Bush's war?" I submit that these people are using religion as an excuse to do what they want. It's not religions fault, but if the "crusaders" didn't appeal to at least one section of humanity, they'd probably be completely rejected.
<br/>
IN SHORT: For murder, religion is usually the excuse, not the reason.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

DS:
<br/>

If you added a two-page system when the DS is held sideways (like in Brain Training) added basic text, HTML maybe even .rtf support, and a bookmarking system to save your place in a file, it'd be amazing! Also, perhaps you could use the touch screen to highlight certain things in the text files (and obviously, have a way to move ONE page at a time so it's possible to highlight things on the non-touchscreen page). Obviously this would be a lot of work, but that's my vision of a perfect ebook reader.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <h4>#96969 - takieda - Mon Aug 07, 2006 2:04 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">To be totally honest a very versatile ebook reader would probably be the best idea for this, that way, among other reasons, you can have whatever version of the bible on it you like (as opposed to creating DSBible with a copyrighted recent KJV, or other bible - using gbadev.org resources to help create it wouldn't be allowed due to its infringement of the copyright). Furthermore this would also open up its usability for other religions. I would actually like a compilation of the Q'uran, Bible, Bhagavad-Gita, Tanakh, Tripitaka, among others, that is easy to access at any given time. Any highly religious person would benefit from such a creation as it would allow that person to be more familiar with others religions so they can relate on a more knowledgeable level - something I strive to do.
<br/>
<br/>
It might be good to have a specialized ebook reader with extra functions such as ability to search for specific verses, or passages, within the books; be able to look for all passages relating to a specific theme (love, for example); display passages in both original and translated languages (some books rely heavily on this - the Bhagavad-Gita, for example). Perhaps it should even allow for the addition of handwritten notes (imagine a sermon being given with the DS as the reference source, with notes scrawled onto it that can be hidden down to a button that's easily placed in between words, or somewhere on the page and brought up with just a quick click (fatlib anyone?).<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <h4>#96974 - takieda - Mon Aug 07, 2006 2:33 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">tepples - good point, but there are two alternatives to this issue.
<br/>
1 is to use unicode. MOST foreign languages can be easily transliterated into either an English text, or at least a unicode style text. The bhagavad-gita itself generally has the original sanskrit, a latin transliteration, a translation guide (word for word), the actual translated text of the verse, and then a purport (or discussion) about the text.
<br/>
<br/>
Using a standardized form of this method (say transliterating everything into Latin (which I'm intimately familiar with pronouncing), or just to use unicode text in general) would allow most texts to work in that facet (I'd assume, I've not read much beyond the Bhagavad-Gita, and some of the Bible and the Qur'an). Even the Tripitaka uses sanskrit and/or Pali (very similar language, but Buddha spoke Sanskrit, so I'm going with that one), which is the same as in the Bhagavad-Gita.
<br/>
<br/>
The other alternative, and perhaps an easier one for some, would be to just include images (perhaps b&amp;w gifs) of the original text. I wouldn't expect most older languages to have a working Unicode alphabet, and some even require right to left support. This would, however, not allow for the searching of the verses/passages, which would be useful to find the different meanings and usages of some words (like love - I keep saying that because that's a central theme with a current discussion I'm having with some of my Christian friends).
<br/>
<br/>
I think, in the end, a hybrid use of that would probably be the most useful, allowing anyone to use whatever they have to do the job. (consider having pictures for the original language, and unicode transliterations of that).<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

<br/>
I'm guessing there might be some way to use the "sword" project as the text repository.  And looking at existing software for readers or perhaps developing something like "bibletime" or "gnomesword" or whatever your favorite bible study software uses.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the trouble in finding the actual bible versions (translations) that aren't copyrighted, I believe we should just find out how projects/programs like <a class="postlink" href="http://e-sword.net/bibles.html" target="_blank">e-sword</a> got all their Bible translations? They seem to have worked out deals with the publishers. Maybe got them free? We should simply check out if we could get them free as well?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But concerning the actual BibleDS project, I think it should be built as a generic e-book reader that is flexible. And worry about what books we want to read later on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good idea for separation of church and state^W^W^W text and reader. Now let's map out the requirements: <ul><li>To support texts such as <span style="font-style: italic">The Adventures of Pinocchio</span>, reader will need only one level of division: Chapter 1 through Chapter 36. </li><li>To support texts such as <span style="font-style: italic">Holy Bible</span>, reader will need two levels of division: Genesis through Revelation, and numbered chapters in each. </li><li>Divisions can be referred to by a number or an optional title. </li><li>Line breaks at a word break when possible. (Not MoonShell style.) </li><li>Text in UTF-8. </li><li>Full text indexing. </li><li>Latin has first priority; Greek and Cyrillic have second. </li><li>Font sizes? </li><li>Hebrew? Devanagari? Arabic? </li></ul>

<ul>
<br/>
01. Genesis (KJV)
<br/>
02. Exodus (KJV)
<br/>
03. Leviticus (KJV)
<br/>
..</ul>

This would A) allow sorting on book number, B) allow sorting on version and allow the user to pick which versions he wants to mix.[/list]<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Being able to use a book reader to reference different books would be a great idea... i.e. have several different files, one for each text, or html (or whatever) file that link to each other... But as nice as the idea is, it also does bring out a problem. What if you open your book and want to do a text search for a specific phrase - unless it has some damn good parsing, it's not going to be able to search from file to file, etc. It would basically have to parse through the links found in the first file, to the next file, and know not to search back through other links through files that have already been searched. This method would also probably be pretty slow (considering the DS's actual power) - but I'm not completely sure. Someone might be able to pull this off.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life
