I'v attempted to port this directly to the DS, iv done a port of pdcurses lib to the ds, and have got it compiled, but can only get it to display the retawq about screen, I had loading html files and displaying it working but while trying to get wifi working also, I broke that :( . 
<br/>
<br/>
All of the opensource browsers that i have looked at use file descriptors for all there socket work, and thats not available in the wifi lib and maybe someone who has more knowledge of wifi and sockets maybe could get it working.

GPF, I did a little research for you about sockets using file descriptors. I found an excellent reference at <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/arpanet/6/cc.htm" target="_blank">http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/arpanet/6/cc.htm</a>
<br/>
Based on this guide, it seems that converting to and from file descriptors and BSD sockets (a la wifi lib) is very easy to do. Hopefully this makes your port more possible. Good luck!
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Relationship Between Sockets and File Descriptors
<br/>
<br/>
Socket handles are integer values. In UNIX, socket handles can be passed to most of the low-level POSIX I/O functions. For example:
<br/>
<br/>
read(s, buffer, buffer_len);
<br/>
<br/>
In the above example, s could be either a socket or file handle. Calling read on an open socket is equivalent to recv and recvfrom. However, if the socket is UDP, then information about the sender of the datagram will not be returned. Similarly the write function call is equivalent to send and sendto. UDP sockets may call connect to use send and write. It's always recommended that the socket library functions be used instead of the file I/O equivalents.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
You can do this with Win2Ds (a vnc type application) and Opera for windows (which includes an option to perform small screen rendering so developers can check their sites compatibility). Just resize opera to the DS's screen resolution, and browse away. Even though sending images of web pages to the DS is pretty inefficient in terms of bandwidth, it will render web pages a heck of a lot faster then the DS seems capable of.
<br/>
<br/>
I hear you can also setup Win2DS for access outside your wlan so that you could do this on the road, but in my experience Win2DS doesn't perform well with medium-ish latency.
<br/>
<br/>
GPF, I would love to see you get Retawq running on the DS as a standalone application. Considering the cpu and screen resolution of the DS, a text based browser actually makes more sense then a graphical browser on the DS in my opinion.
