<br/>
This great online puzzle/text game will be great for the DS. :D 
<br/>
<br/>
So far I've just started it. I almost have the letter twisting done, and next up is loading an array of words (from within the program for now).
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is willing to help me with some of the tougher portions of the program, that'd be great.  I need someone with knowledge of reading/writing to storage and wifi would be good too.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using PAlib
<br/>
<br/>
Some Screenshots: (looks alot better on hardware...)

Do you know about DAWGs?  Have you seen Graham Toale's website?  There's some very good stuff out there...anyway, let me know if you'd like some of my code.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Blahh, are you still working on this? Because I was going to do the same thing, except if you're still working on it, I'll back off; we don't want two of the same program out there. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just curious though, what kind of data structure were you using for the word database/dictionary? Linked List is definitly out of the question since that would take massively too long to traverse. I was thinking a hash table but those things tend to slow down considerably when there isn't enough RAM (which there isn't much of on the DS). I was actually going to do something like an array with each element representing the first letter of a word. Each index points to a new array, each representing the second letter of the word, null if there is none. That way, the traversing is quick. The question is, how do you load that to the DS's memory, which is the same problem with the hash table? I'm not quite sure what the DS's virtual memory system is like (from what I can gather, it is quite non-existant), so I'm still baffled as to how I'm going to manage all of this. Possibly, I store each "array" in a separate file, and I should only have to load 6 files or less at any given point. Do you have a better way of going about it? 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you don't respond, I think I'll go ahead and start on my own version. 
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Someone else already made Word Wrap ( <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13038" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13038</a> ) for DS homebrew which is pretty much the same game...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://viewsourcecode.org/" target="_blank">viewsourcecode</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
