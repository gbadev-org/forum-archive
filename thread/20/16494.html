    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My grade 1 DS obsessed son is learning how to write his letters at the moment and it would be fantastic to have an application that shows a letter form on the top screen and uses the bottom screen to copy that form and check the start, trace direction and finish points of the character.
<br/>
<br/>
This could be my first foray into NDS programming if it's never been done.
<br/>
<br/>
It's not handwriting recognition, just simple touch, trace and check.

Maybe the rewards are 'credit points' that can be traded with Dad for treats.<br/>_________________<br/>Andy..

I had a look at a 'brain train' junior commercial release which is supposed to have something like this built in - just a drawing program, no pass/fail criteria applied to the tracing of letters<br/>_________________<br/>Andy..

I'm not sure that giving honest feedback to a first grader is a good idea.  Many if not most kids have horrible handwriting when they first start.  For that matter, many adults have horrible handwriting.  So far as I can tell, Doragana gives encouragement so long as it can recognize the character.  (Never played it, but from what I could gather from the commercial.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it would be at the point that they would recognize it was being evaluated.  Doing things in my mind is easy, actually getting them done is another. ;) In theory, better writing would unlock "games" to play.  I've struggled with just getting to the point I am at.  I haven't even begun working on a real "game" framework, but I have it all set in my head. :)  Right now, it is just quick and dirty.

BTW, I just uploaded V.02 with Capitals and Lower case..  Adding Cap/Lower cursive should be easy, I just need to do the grunt work for the gfx.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Given the attention spans of small children, I'll agrue that having to unlock games is silly.  I think mom or dad would end up unlocking it most of the time, and they (probably?) don't need the writing practice.  This is my experience after observing a couple of friends and their child.
<br/>
<br/>
You might want to pick up a copy of Doragana just to see how they do it, seeing as you are making more or less the same thing.  It does have games, so far as I can tell.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll consider your opinion some more and see if I can figure out a way to make it a little more fun.

I think lower case letters are a little more important than making the program pretty, but I do think some colorful fun art would help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I didn't have to do the GFX grunt work because I had already done it before.. and just forgot.  The only hold up was the day it took me to figure out how to add the options. (yes, it took me a whole day of struggling to figure it out).

So technically, it's usable as a mini trainer of sorts.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's not really about presentation and style for someone of his age, it's more about functionality and reward. The attention span is only a problem if there is no tangiable reward. Don't forget that they learn to write on paper without much more than 'having to do it' as motivation. Even a 'ping' and an increasing number of stars displayed would be enough.
<br/>
<br/>
As for recognition - this is where I run out of technical speak - but.. The idea could be to copy a character into a 'lightly greyed out' wider representation of the character on the tough screen. Basically that's just drawing between the lines, not special recognition as such - more like testing the lines are not crossed over.
<br/>
<br/>
The perfect program would have a target 'start point' where the pen is first dropped and then a direction of trace - this kind of stuff is defined in something like 'edumax educational products'. they produce a paper version showing where the pen touches, and which way it should go.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Lynx for this i'll give it a try and let you know what the feedback is from the small, but all time consuming one. Too late tonight to get into it !! Downloading tonight,<br/>_________________<br/>Andy..

Honestly, I was going to call it "Pre-K" or something like that, but PhoenixRising suggested that I don't make it grade level specific as there are adults that could use such a program (not just because they write sloppy, but if they are learning English) and thought I shouldn't lower the user level to just kids.  That, and Toddler was supposed to have colors, shapes, etc. added to it.  But, since my kids grew out of it before I could implement it, I no longer have the desire to add them.

Well, what we have been talking about is using vectors.  I don't really get it myself, as it is beyond my programming skills, but we will see if "my help" actually does anything.  But, from what I understand, is that we have vector addresses for each step from when the pen hits the paper till you lift it off, and like you are saying, there would be a percentage off the line allowed.  Also, if we get to this point, we will be able to show the letters being written.

It's funny you mention that.. I forgot about it, but I already have that stuff.  I'm going to add it to the top screen next, before I attempt to pretty it up.  I noticed that with some of the cursive stuff, without a guide, how would anyone know which way to write it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lynx on Tue Mar 24, 2009 9:28 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

This is what parents and teachers are for.  =P

Way too hard to implement, but it would be neat if you could link a couple DS units so the parent/teacher/tutor could watch the kid write the letters.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess, if we get to the point of using vectors, PhoenixRising said we should be able to animate a pen drawing it on the screen to show how it should be written..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lynx - Your drawing is very close, if you like, I'll scan a page of some school homework layout and send it to you if you send me your email address, assuming this does not violate some forum rules. So I don't get autogenerated junk here is most of my email address. (.tuck$talk21.com) replace the $ with @ and put andy in front of the dot.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall comments are - very good as a first implementation. I tried it on my son and he (age 6) used it without any real prompting. Admittedly he was not held by it for long, but there is lots of potential here.
<br/>
<br/>
Now some of my comments on the implementation so far :
<br/>
<br/>
It would be good to move the first letter in from the right a little more (indent).
<br/>
<br/>
When in 'drawing mode' use "X" to index to the next letter rather than using start - my son struggled with this approach a little, as start is usually a big change key in a game.
<br/>
<br/>
Have two examples of the letter on the touch screen to copy. (It's all about repetition, he was quite happy to copy over the trace but got distracted when he had finished)
<br/>
<br/>
No more fancy fonts are required !!
<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of recognition (or not) and practicing letters...
<br/>
<br/>
You could limit the 'allowable' drawing to the dotted letter +- a number of pixels - simple, just dont let the trace keep working if the student wanders too far away from the dotted lines.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A summary point - this has really high potential keep it really simple, it's what it does at a basic level that is important, it's useable, useful etc.. even as it is.<br/>_________________<br/>Andy..
