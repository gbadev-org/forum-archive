    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is there a text editor (possibly with an on-screen keyboard) for DS? 
<br/>
<br/>
ideas come to me constantly for movies and what-not and i always have my ds with me, so obviously it would be a good way to get some note down on-the-fly... 
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a DLDI build of Txtwriter somewhere.  There's also DSOrganize, plus DSLinux has the Vi and Nano text editors.  There's probably more that I'm forgetting though.

I know you said for the DS, but there's also a good one called DanTE Advance for the GBA, which utilizes a unique keyboard system to improve typing speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i've had a tablet pc for two years now, and I've come to solely rely on saving any kind of information in it's handwritten form. Although the handwriting recongnition is quite sophisticated (likely much more than a ds version could ever be), it's still cumbersome to actually use. And why would I safe somethin as plain text, when handwritten notes allow me formatting, formulas, drawings etc?
<br/>
so in the end a sophisticated note-taking tool would probably be more useful in the long run than handwriting recognition. I.e., if i only had paint and not journal, i'd probably not use the stylus input at all.
<br/>
maybe a simpler alternative would be someting like this: <a href="http://networkimprov.net/alphatap/" target="_blank">http://networkimprov.net/alphatap/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, Ant6n, would something like DSNotes be what you're looking for?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">possibly (can't test programs on hardware at this point). But it looks to be bitmap based, which is much less accurate than vector based stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The PIXIL GUI in DSLinux has a 'scribble' mode that kind-of works.  It's still quicker to use the onscreen keyboard though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
