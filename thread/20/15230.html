<br/>
its a small device that can controll your itunes or winamp music collection. 
<br/>
It displays the acutal title, you can adjust the volumen and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
what about a software on the DS with that functionality. Probably with a cover flow function like the iphone offers. 
<br/>
<br/>
greetings,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's SylphAmp, which actually streams the music directly to your DS (though you can also run the standard Winamp output at the same time to have it come out your computer speakers as well), and using this you can control the playback.  There's also a homebrew app that specifically acts as a remote control for Winamp, but I cannot remember the name of it at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">anyone started work on this?, sylphamp is good and everything but winamp sucks in the way it deals with its music. is any work being done on this? i know itunes has a built in streaming function where the music library is sent to another pc (with itunes on it) or device and when needed the content in question is streamed.
<br/>
Are you attempting to make something that is compatible with this function? That would be great! You need to find out how iTunes recieves the libraries and streams from the other computer using itunes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you use Linux (or can find a windows version), you can use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.musicpd.org/" target="_blank">MPD</a> on your PC and use <a class="postlink" href="http://hem.bredband.net/kaw/ncmpc/" target="_blank">ncmpc</a> bundled with DSLinux to control it.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also take this one step further and output via <a class="postlink" href="http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/overview.html" target="_blank">ESD</a> to a ESD server running on the DS, meaning you can listen and control the music all from the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
There's more information on the DSLinux wiki <a class="postlink" href="http://dslinux.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/UsingDSLinux#head-37006ed1ea1b6576a700cd2aa9814959b0d83ae7" target="_blank">here</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
