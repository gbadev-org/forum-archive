    <h4>#81460 - ghazi - Sat Apr 29, 2006 7:31 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure why this hasn't been brought up yet (or maybe it has), but it occurred to me today, while I was listening to an internet radio station, that we really haven't had any programs capable of streaming audio.  If this has already come up and I?m just wasting time, I apologize!
<br/>
<br/>
Think about it ? instead of loading up your poor CF card with lots of space-consuming MP3s, wouldn?t it be more convenient to utilize a wireless connection to listen to your music while you?re not at home?
<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the biggest issue is probably the complexity of getting an app to be compatible with many different methods of online streaming.  On top of that, there are even more problems when it comes to the format ? MP3, RealMedia, Windows Media, Quicktime, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
So, in an environment where we have the ability to remotely control our own computers with a DS, what if we instead focused on streaming a homemade standard that fits best (and stream the sound that our computers are already producing)?  Just like the other computer-connecting apps, a little server-side program would process the signal to the most efficient format, and then it could be sent to the DS to be played.  
<br/>
<br/>
Not only could you tune in to your favorite web broadcasts, but you could also queue up your own playlist and have access to your entire music collection!
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess you can consider this sort of a project proposal.  I?m an IE, so I don?t know how difficult something like this would be to create, or even if the DS is capable of a task like this with its memory constraints, but I do think that it would probably be the easiest method and it would certainly be a very efficient way to let people have access to more than just the 50 MP3s they have crammed on a card that?s already full of homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I want this so I can listen to talk radio when my real radio isn?t getting any reception!   =P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's quite an ignorant way to think. Did the OP mention he wanted to listen on the bus? There are quite a few scenarios that this could be utilized for such as travel (not <span style="font-style: italic">while</span> travelling, however), work and school. Instead of a proprietary app on the host machine, however, I would say a good method is  to write an application for the DS that can handle shoutcast streaming radio, and go through the normal setup required on the PC side to get the stream running.

Houston is home to some of the shittiest reception, radio wise. With that said, I'm connected to an AP right now.
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, every time I see this type of question asked (streaming audio/video), the response is always the same. If you don't know how to do it, then just say so instead of getting defensive and saying it can't be done. Technically I believe it <span style="font-style: italic">can</span> be done, but I'm pretty sure streaming 128kbps audio will not be possible for a very long time, if at all.
<br/>
<br/>
As much as I'd like to write an application that could do this, I'm still a newbie. Never say never.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I love moonshell, and use it quite often. I can see the use for streaming audio, however. The main point I'm trying to get through is that it isn't impossible. It won't happen overnight obviously, but just because it isn't a do-able thing right now doesn't mean that coming up with ideas or suggestions on how to do it should be taboo.

That really only supports my point, though.  By adding a small layer of complexity (streaming from your home computer rather than directly from a ShoutCast station or something), we can avoid all of the patent rubbish by simply choosing a compatible form that works with the DS.  I don't know what that is off the top of my head, of course, but that's sort of why I wanted to throw this idea out there.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the bit rate of the stream goes, many internet streams (and they're increasing in number) probably have too high of a quality for the DS to handle.  This is another reason why the simplest solution (even though it's admittedly not the most elegant) would be to stream from your home computer - a standard bit rate that we know the DS can play well.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as authentication goes, that means you can't use any of the other online programs on your campus either - so either the point is somewhat moot or you can do what I did and spoof your DS's MAC with a laptop to get it running.  =)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don't know how many users it would really benefit, because maybe they don't work or go to school in large metal buildings that block out a lot of radio signals.  Maybe it would be sort of a niche market, huh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I didn't mean to cause a huge argument, so I'm sorry for that!  I just sort of wanted to give an idea to any devs who were considering this sort of streaming thing and didn't know where to take it.  I really appreciate all the input!  It's opened my eyes to how large of an undertaking this might really be.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way:  Thanks, waruwaru!  It didn't occur to me that I could do some Linux and have an easy solution.  It might still be nice to see a more simple method, but I'll have to look into mplayer for my own purposes!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

To do this, you'd need a shim driver similar to Total Recorder, and those don't work 1. with restrictions-managed audio played through the Secure Audio Path or 2. on Windows Vista 64, which requires all driver authors to pay 500 USD per year for a VeriSign certificate.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But lots of software can record all the sounds the PC makes to a wave file ('record moniter' function on creative recorder, for instance)...surely you use the techique as that, only you stream the output somewhere else?

And, if that dosnt work, you could always just ask people to put a two-way phono cable between the LineIn and the Speaker ports :D :D

That sucks for you, but all the APs on my campus are freely open. Just because it doesn't work for you, it shouldn't be made?

What is your hang up with doing this while moving on a bus, and roaming between APs? Why can't you just listen to streaming internet radio sitting still?

What if a person would like to listen to internet streams from their backyard, or when working out? I could see a lot of uses for this software, and would definitely make use of it myself.

Did I say that? If it works for you, then good for you; just don't take my lack of use for a given program as lack of dedication to the platform.

Where there is open Wi-Fi (i.e. no captive portal or WPA or 802.1X) near me, there is an open PC.

What the hell have you got in your walls?

I can get a wifi signal in my back garden and that is through at least three walls.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

You're entitled to your opinion, but personally, I can't stand MP3s through the DS's internal speaker, so I have to use headphones.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
