    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll admit that I'm a bit paranoid about wireless security; the whole "you can crack WEP in two minutes" thing convinced me to bump my router up to WPA and to buy a cheap Nintendo USB WiFi Connector second-hand to continue getting my Tetris DS online fix. I'm not really sure where else to ask this, so I'm coming to you guys -- how bulletproof is the DS USB dongle to an attacker? I realize it's got some quirky DS-friendly interface, and I don't see it at all when I scan for networks with my XP SP2 laptop but I assume that someone who knows what they're doing would be able to see that shit just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
If the dongle <span style="font-style: italic">were</span> compromised, what is vulnerable? Just the traffic sent from my DS, my entire computer, my network, what? I guess I'd just like to know what I'm risking by using it.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't the WiFi dongle require that the host PC allow's requesting devices access?
<br/>
<br/>
As for not seeing it on wireless networks, hmmmm. I reckon it's possible that for dongle traffic the DS uses a custom header and so forth for the wireless packets that doesn't confirm to the standard 802.11b layout...
<br/>
<br/>
Or something...

I don't know, maybe someone else has more useful info on this?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, it does come with a little cute and bubbly-ass Nintendo branded utility that lets you to allow devices to connect. Chances are that it wouldn't be any sort of target for an attacker since there's a good shot that other easy WEP targets are sitting around ripe for the picking.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I'm still curious just how much is actually at stake -- since it uses your PC's internet connection, would breaking into the dongle allow an attacker to see everything on the PC it's attached to?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit surprised this hasn't been explored before. Am I the only one who picked up a dongle just so I could bump my router up to WPA?
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, does anyone know what channel the dongle broadcasts on? I've got mine positioned fairly near my router, and I'd hate to create anymore interference than is absolutely necessary.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">Enamel Navy DS Lite <span style="font-weight: bold">||</span> FlashMe v7 <span style="font-weight: bold">||</span> SLOT-1: R4DS (Kernel: v1.06) w/ A-Data 1GB microSD <span style="font-weight: bold">||</span> SLOT-2: G6 Lite 4Gb/512MB (Manager: v4.6D, Loader: v4.6C)</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Nope, you can definitely sniff the traffic using standard hardware and software (it just doesn't broadcast SSID, though the SSID is identifiable because it follows the format NWCUSBAP[bunchofnumbers]). From the cursory look I took at it a while back, I remember it as being standard WEP as well. I would guess that the "authentication" process where you authorize a DS for it just sets up a MAC filter. Since it also broadcasts your DS name (like "Ryan") in plain-text after you auth with it, it may use that for some additional authentication.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That NWCUSBAP[bunchofnumbers] is actually "NWCUSBAP    %05d%05d%05d%05d".  The 4 numbers are 15 bit numbers, ranging from 0 to 0x7FFF, and are generated psuedorandomly from the system time.
<br/>
<br/>
There must be some non standard protocol that nintendo uses to query for the existence of the AP, then gets the current SSID transmitted to it.  It may even be possible that only the SSID has to be transmitted, then the DS generates the correct WEP key from that ID.
<br/>
<br/>
Your own ds nickname does not matter when it comes to playing online, just the mac address does, so mac spoofing should be possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
