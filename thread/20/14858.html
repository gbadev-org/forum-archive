    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Good morning everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
For my second project, i was planning to port the flash game "Bloxorz"
<br/>
to the DS. You can find this awesome flash game <a class="postlink" href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/games/bloxorz" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
I contacted the author, asking for permission to do so. This morning,
<br/>
he replied to me that he was already working on it with some people.
<br/>
So i was about to announce i started re-coding it, but it appears it's
<br/>
already on the rails =)
<br/>
<br/>
PS: As this stems from a private email discussion, i cannot quote his
<br/>
reply. But i thought i could pass on the information, as Bloxorz is
<br/>
already an existing game available everywhere, so there's no NDA
<br/>
around, i guess...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
