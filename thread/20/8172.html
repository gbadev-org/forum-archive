anybody know what this is? It followed in a package with earphones to my DS. I think it is a connection to my computer. The one end is to fit in the DS like the charger and the other end a usual computer prot. So, with this
<br/>
cable i can see some folders in my DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's nothing more than a USB charger for your DS. Since the USB standard has the same voltage as what the DS uses, people started making their own cables after, or even before the DS came out.
<br/>
<br/>
It should also work on GBA's as they use the same voltage, as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Read what he wrote again, this time more carefully. Especially the part where he says it's a charger. As in charging batteries. Specifically the battery inside your DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its a nice little cable, especially if you imported your DS and don't want to buy a stepdown converter. plus it only sets you back a couple of bucks

would be funny to use with armadus's memory extension if he included a usb port, lol (see DSLinux about the memory extension)<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It just sucks power from your USB port to charge your DS. The DS's power port only has power and audio out (for those GBA SP headphones), no way to do any communication through it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unless you write some sort of software modem of course; then you could try dumping ROMs through the analog hole ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
