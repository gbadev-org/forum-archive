    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a Nintendo DS with the upper screen ripped of. I thought of using it for experiment and later maybe a wireless remote (via WLAN) for my home cinema. But the DS won't boot if the upper screen is missing.
<br/>
<br/>
There is a short flash of the backlight and the power LED goes on if I switch the device on. But northing else.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone now a trick to fool the firmware so it thinks that the screen is there? I read something about a resistor somewhere but I cannot find it anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody help me?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>

The DS's power management unit turns the DS off when the top screen's backlight is enabled, so that could work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you for reply. I got it running by soldering an 1k6 resistor to the upper screen's backlight connector. If you are interested:
<br/>
<br/>
you find the Backlight signals on the main PCB at the upper left side of the display, there are two testpoints marked LEDA2 (anode) and LEDC2 (cathode). They have just the right distance to solder a 1206 restore to them. :-). If you like you can also attach 2..3 "case modding" LEDs to these pins instead of the resistor.
<br/>
<br/>
Also there are two testpoint SPR0 an SPL0, these are the speaker right/left pins. The speakers should be connected between these pins and ground which ist easily availabe at the housing of the power connector.
<br/>
<br/>
So, now the thing is up and running. What do I do now with it. Check a nice hello-world program would be nice. So I will read the forum to find out what I need therefor. I don't even have a game cartridge now.
<br/>
<br/>
bye
