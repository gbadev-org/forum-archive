    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Confusing title I know but here is the thing. I'd like to know if it is possible to get 2 DSs online using the same router and play a game. Nintendo claims that the USB adapter lets 5 people connect but what about a direct connection?
<br/>
<br/>
Presumably Mario Kart DS for instances uses certain TCP ports hence if 2 people are online their TCP ports will clash and neither game will work. Any ideas?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That should work (I think an average AP allows up to 128 computers/DSs/PSPs/whatever).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK let me rephrase. I know that the Router allows any number of connections however - if the DS isreceiving requests on a specific port does that explain why my other DS won't connect at the same time as my first one.
<br/>
<br/>
That is to say they will both connect to WFC but whilst one is online the other cannot find any opponents and will not show up on the friends list as searching. I was just wondering if anyone else had found this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#62905 - BLKGHOST - Tue Dec 06, 2005 9:22 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it's because only 1 port is used for each mode (friends, rivals, regional, worldwide). Can anyone confirm this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I know during Friends mode I have trouble seeing my brother's DS if we're involving certain third parties.  As in, we can join some friends together alright, but some people have trouble seeing both of us.

We've actually even had a Regional match together, but we've never been able to have another.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">make sure both of you are locked together, that increases the chances of seeing each other</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#62935 - tssf - Wed Dec 07, 2005 12:37 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They SHOULD be able to.
<br/>
<br/>
Look at PCs. See how they each are able to use MSN or IRC or even browse the web all at once?
<br/>
<br/>
The Routers will give each DS their own IP address, and of course will distribute the web traffic accordingly toward those IP addresses.
<br/>
<br/>
But I've had my DS's connect to the same router before. There's no problem with it..if only just a little lag since they were connecting to a server that is on the other side of the continent.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

That is almost eactly my problem. I can connect to the Nintendo server and search for rivals, friends whatever and my firend icon says that my brother is online and looking for friends but it won't let us link up and play... Yet you say that you've managed it so it all seems a bit random to me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it depends on the game (network design of the game)..  Back in the day, I had to configured RTCW to run on different ports to be able to have mutiple machines on a LAN connect to the same server on the internet.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
