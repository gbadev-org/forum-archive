    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I never actually seen something like that, so that's why I'm making this toping ( in hope in never been talked before )
<br/>
<br/>
I use for school the Gmail Calender, wich make my life much much easier. But I would also love to use my DS as a Calender ( DSOrganise )
<br/>
<br/>
So do you guys know if there's a program that could work as DSOrganise ( at least the calender fonction ) but that could connect to my gmail account and transfer or upload my thing I wrote in my gmail or in my ds and transfer it to each others...:S
<br/>
<br/>
Or if it dont exist for gmail, well anything that could do the same thing with another calender application. 
<br/>
<br/>
And while I'm at it, I would like to know what is the best homebrew for watching movies on my ds ( use gbamp but the quality isnt very good )
<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance for the answer</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah DS Organise have a good base on what I would like to have. Only thing missing would be a way to transfer info in beetween the DS and Google Calender
<br/>
<br/>
This way, if I'm at home, write something in there, It would also transfer it on my ds right before I go to school. 
<br/>
<br/>
And vice-versa, if I'm at school, write something in the calender, then open my ds and it transfer it to google calender
<br/>
<br/>
I would love to try to do it myself but I just know nothing about those things :S I was hopping I wouldnt be the only one to love such a program and maybe even find someone who already made such a thing</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
