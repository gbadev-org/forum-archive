I've tried the latest version I could find of Etool (3.13) and EtoolSMS (2.1) to no avail. (I've tried using the save before and after running it through the ETcreate.exe program that comes with Etool)

I've only used ETool once, for backing up my Castlevania save so a friend could borrow it (only 3 save slots... wtf?), and it worked fine, but Castlevania's save is only 64kbit...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you're on Linux, there's a way to append a read-only FAT rom to the file ... ask tepples for more specific info.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
