    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It certainly wouldn't <span style="font-style: italic">kill</span> it, partly because tunneling never gets fully mainstream, partly because it requires a PC running and the right wireless card, and it also wouldn't be as convienient. Plus the tunneling isn't a proof yet, it could be unreliable, laggy, or just never come to fruition like previous attempts. Still, optimism is a virtue.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

nintendo didnt disable those features just to spite us, they're missing for a reason and thats most likely due to its not stable enough/too laggy.  i doubt this is a decision that was taken lightly and was grudgingly made due to time constraints.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Either way, Nintendo isn't going to stop their WiFi games (sold to millions) because the homebrew community can tunnel (which could be what?  Thousands, 10's of thousands at most, I would guess).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tonelling *is* a problem, because Nintendo themselves said the local LAN multiplayer code is nearly entirely different than the WFC multiplayer code.
<br/>
<br/>
The communication in local wifi is far, far more reliable than through the internet, and the latency is *much* lower. They don't need to do much motion prediction (if any, they could probably get away sending play buttom presses as if the other DS'es were controllers), and they can send tons of data without most of it getting lost.
<br/>
<br/>
I doubt the local LAN mode could work at the same latency rates that affect the WFC mode. It would probably throw errors and lose connection as soon as the latency got above a certain mark, or the game would run as normal, but with major synch problems due to lag.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the only viable way to tunnel DS games is through emulators, and even that might be difficult, since people are already having problems emulating the GBA link cable. Maybe when someone emulates two consoles on a single machine, link the two together, and do a kaillera-style tunneling on the input on one of the machines.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What about turn based games, like advance wars. That game alone would be worth it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well the wifi has to worry about things like packet drops and interference to begin with, so perhaps the latency would have to be kind of low for those checks anyway.  Lets see how sgstairs is doing with the beta testing and work off of that</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MK:DS only uses the nintendo servers for finding matches. During the actual race, the communication is all Peer 2 Peer UDP (not going thru any servers). 
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any kind of traffic sniffer (ethereal, etc) you can see where the people you are racing, are from! (in as much as their IP addresses will tell you, usually you can get the general area)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
