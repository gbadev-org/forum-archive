This is a bit off-topic, but I'm sure the guys in charge of the school network would laugh if I gave them my NDS's mac address.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I'd tell them its my laptop's mac, and give them the NDS's (then clone its mac to make the router thing my laptop is the NDS).

On topic: The lib about picking up APs is fine as it is, don't worry about it, I'd prefer (And so would all of us, honestly) if TCP was finished (and released) soon!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Say it's your PDA. If you have <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8468" target="_blank">dsorganize</a> installed you'd even be telling the truth.

I dont think they'd accept it, I know one of the guys that is in charge of that dept, and he IS an (whatever I say here will probably be censored anyways). 
<br/>
<br/>
Seeing how the network is (currently) open(no need to register macs, or use WEPs, or anything for the matter), I dont worry though.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I forgot to mention that I do use DSOrganize and the NDS as a PDA with games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
step 1: change your laptop's MAC address to be the same as your DS's

step 2: log on to the captive portal w/ your laptop (which authorizes your MAC address)

step 3: turn off laptop, turn on DS</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
