    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've tried both of these emulators on my GBAMP with FlashMe, both work great, but neither will save properly. nesDS simply won't save anything; SRAM, save states, or configuration. (Is it supposed to save to CF?) Goomba Color saves SRAM fine for some games, but won't load it on others. Pok?mon Silver saves and loads fine, but Red won't load the created .sav file, acting as if none existed (just New Game/Options). (Ironic; real Red cartridges often did this too, due to faulty hardware...)

(And hey, shut up, they're the only GB ROMs I have that use saving. &gt;_&gt;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
