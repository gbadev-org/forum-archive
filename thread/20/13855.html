    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What's the best way to encode DPG videos?
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried both dpgenc and BatchDPG, with dpgenc I can encode full screen videos at 24FPS, but some of my videos don't convert.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to do the same using BatchDPG, with the settings:
<br/>
FPS: 24
<br/>
Profile: VeryHigh
<br/>
Width: 256
<br/>
Height: 192
<br/>
Bitrate: 320
<br/>
Max Bitrate: 320
<br/>
Passes: 2
<br/>
[check]KVCD Matrix
<br/>
Audio:
<br/>
Bitrate: 128
<br/>
Samplerate: 32000
<br/>
[]Mono
<br/>
[X]Joint Stereo
<br/>
[X]Normalize
<br/>
<br/>
It came out very clear, but the FPS is most certainly NOT 24, and I set it to 24.  Is there a way to record smooth full screen videos with BatchDPG, because it supports more formats than dpgenc.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

 If you want a bit less low level then EZBuilder is likely for you.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Speaking of BatchDPG... for some reason, whenever I convert AMV Hell 3, it ends up locking up in moonshell on my DS right before a scene change (where the TV comes up and does the "static" image and sound)
<br/>
<br/>
Yet, it worked just fine on my old supercard CF when it was working. O_o  In fact, I tried using the exact same video file from it and it STILL didn't work.  Yet, other videos ran fine like the original AMV Hell...
