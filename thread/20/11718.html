    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to make a post here (I hope this forum is ok? please move it if not) to let all developers know that we are currently interviewing homebrew developers on thier games and applications. If anyone would like to be interviewed then please send me a pm or contact one of the administrators of ds-scene.net and we can set you up an interview!
<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning on releasing a game soon, this is a great opportunity for you to show off what goes on behind the scenes. We know alot of you put your hearts into the projects you develop and we know our readers would like to hear more of your achievements and a little bit more about yourselves.
<br/>
<br/>
The interviews can be conducted at a time of your choice and take place over MSN messenger. They take approximately 30 mins + to conduct depending on your willingness to share information ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Lick - If you read this, we have tried contacting you several times about your interview but do not seem to have a response yet? If you are still willing to be interviewed then please let me know personally and I will set the time aside.
<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else - you can check out our current interviews at the link below to decide whether this is for you or not and of course, if you wish to remain anonymous (other than your nick name) then this is fine but please let us know in advance.
<br/>

So please have a look at our work. We can schedule around you. We have a thriving community that is interested in hearing about what you do and how you do it. You can show off all your dev shot as well.
<br/>
<br/>
PM retrohead, casco or myself here at gbadev, or on <a href="http://www.ds-scene.net" target="_blank">www.ds-scene.net</a> and we can schedule a time. You will get a decent run as a sticky on <a href="http://www.ds-scene.net." target="_blank">www.ds-scene.net.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Great for announcing competition entries and even exclusive info.
