    <div class="postbody">This also seems to work with my Belkin PCI card, apart from the Internet bit, the drivers install and work perfectly and I see that my card has sent and recieved stuff so that's good. It doesn't seem to share the internet though, the Ds can't find the connection, but it can connect to the access point. I right clicked on the LAN connection and set it to share my internet, but it told me to choose a home networking connection, it didn't have my internet there so I chose the wireless, was this right?<br/>
<br/>
[EDIT] It works! That's a mistake in your guide, you're meant to right click your Internet Connection, not your Lan connection, and share it, that's how it works. It works perfectly with my card too so I think any card with a RK chipset will work</div>

Hi! I have been trying to configure that card in Access point mode but I didn't find anyway to do it. The drivers support infrastructure mode but that means that they can connect to an access point, not that they can become one...

I don't know if there is some other solution out there...

I've been trying to get this to work with two wireless cars, one set up with the SoftAP driver to receive the DS (and the DS does recognize it) while the other one I have connected to a hotspot as the internet connection doing ICS. 
<br/>
<br/>
I keep getting the error code 52000 and similar ones telling me that it's unable to obtain an IP address. Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: To clarify, I have a Linksys WMP54G card using the SoftAP driver for the DS to connect to, and I have a Airnet AWD154 card using the latest Marvell driver to connect to the hotspot. I looked through the other thread again and saw someone suggesting the bridge connections as opposed to ICS but when I try to bridge either card I get a "To create a Network Bridge, you must select at least two network connections that are not being used by Internet Connection Sharing or Internet Connection Firewall" error. The thing is that neither ICS or ICF is enabled on either card...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you have to select both cards. Select the first and press CTRL and klick on the 2nd. Then you have both selected. And you can try it again.

This reminds me of how I tried to got my girlfriends computer connected to the internet using my computer.

Eventually I gave up. I don't know. Maybe I was to lazy to get it running. Or creating a wireless connection with 2 computers is difficult.

<br/>
<br/>
I am getting MK soon, but I don't have wifi at home, and we use WPA2 at work. 
<br/>
Getting a router is out of question, because I'm not going to happily pay 2~3 times the money I spent on the game to get it on the internet. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Nintendo USB dongle is also off-limits, because I'd need to buy it directly off their site. I don't think they ship to anywhere outside USA or Canada, because I was forced to use a dummy US address to even register an account there. 
<br/>
<br/>
In case they *do* ship it over here, it would cost me a virgin princess due to the shipping and eventual hideous customs import taxes. I say "would", because I don't have any international credit cards, so there would be no way for me to pay for it. (It would be nice if they sold that thing through normal retail, that way I could get my hands on it via 3rd party importers).
<br/>
<br/>
So, buying a nice, cheap, small and readily avaliable USB wifi adaptor would be perfect (since I could carry it around wth me to use in the various places my nomad life takes me to). But now it seems it's impossible to use those to connect the DS... geez.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just found one nice store not too far from here that got them in their list, and it'll cost about the same as MK itself (cheaper then a router, being a lot smaller). They don't have it in stock, though (I'm waiting them reply me e-mail to tell me when it becomes avaliable).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got the Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-AI working with the Nintendo drivers and software. It's pretty easy actually.
<br/>
You can get a patch at <a class="postlink" href="http://blog.goo.ne.jp/panyawo/e/a17bec15c884bda0fe8504f3ba99c3ee" target="_blank">this blog</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The patch replaces the device ID's and makes a change to ICSAPI.dll backing the old up as ICSAPI.BAK.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly the WLI-U2-KG54-AI does not patch totally correct. 
<br/>
In the [RALINK] Section you need to change the last digit to 7 wich makes USB\VID_0411&amp;PID_0067. I guess he accidantly used the same ID that he used in the WLI-U2-KG54 patch. You also need to change the ID in the INST.INI (i think this is only needed for winxp since the id is only in the XP section). 
<br/>
<br/>
After the changes are made the setup.exe should work like it's the original nintendo stick. It installs the drivers and set's up connection sharing. If anything goes wrong after the drivers are installed the USB stick is not the issue.
<br/>
<br/>
If it did install the drivers you see Nintendo Wifi USB connector in the device manager under network devices.

This is what my network setup looks like.
<br/>
<a href="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y240/Laintsurge/softapsettings.jpg">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It can't Acquire the network address. It just tried to for a minute then gives up and sets some random one manually.
<br/>
<br/>
To clarify things ...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in softap mode.
<br/>
Set to "802.11 B Only".
<br/>
Tx Rate is 1Mbps.
<br/>
There is no WEP set.
<br/>
I put my MAC address into the driver config.
<br/>
<br/>
My error on my DS has changed a couple of times as I've fiddled with my options but. I'm currently getting 51300 with no signal on the test connection.This is when on my computer it says acquiring network address. I also get 52000 where I do get signal on my test connection but it suddenly dissapears and displays an error. This happens when on my computer the ip and subnet is set to random digits and I click repair or when the computer sets a random one.
<br/>
<br/>
I have got broadband, but is it because it is dial up is that the problem ?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know much about networking and wifi but I'm learning ...
<br/>

I couldn't get ICS to work. I used the bridge method and all is well. Just make sure ICS is disabled on both cards and then select them both (hold CTRL), right click, select "Bridge Connections" or "Add to Bridge", can't remember the wording right now. That works fine for me. 
<br/>
<br/>
If only I could get the DS and SoftAP to work with WEP.... I tried 64 and 128 bit keys, nothing. The DS can't connect to the AP. If I disable encryption, it works fine, I even played a round of MKDS and got my a$$ handed to me by some Japanese player. I verified that WEP works with my laptop, but the DS can't see the AP if I turn it on. I'll just have to keep an eye on it I guess.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, also, DHCP didn't work on the DS either, again, my laptop worked with it just fine. I had to manually assign a static on the DS along with the subnet mask, gateway, and DNS server.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have a problem here:

I`m in LAN, using ADSL (cable) connection. My wi-fi card (MSI PC54G2) sends "stuff" but it doesn`t recive it. The problem is an IP adress - my router can`t "see" that card so it also can`t attribute it any adresses. I tried to do this manually, but it still doesn`t recive anything .
<br/>
DS can connect to it but error appears

Is there a way to make it works?

Centrino can be put into master mode in both Linux and Windows with the standard drivers, so it would work as a soft AP.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how that works into Darkwind's guide, since I didn't actually read it.

<br/>
But when I was working on my own Wireless Networking guide, I tested Centrino (under Linux) and had no problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
