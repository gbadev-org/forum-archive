    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only risk of your DS for flashing FlashMe would be bricking your DS by losing the power during the flash. I believe every phat firmware is supported now so there shouldnt be a compatibility problem. Do yourself a favor, don't ask for anymore examples of risks, just flash it asap. You will feel so much better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I had to develop some wifi code on a second DS and this required me to use a slot-1 card (which I didn't want to do at the time) plus stabbing through that health screen is annoying.
<br/>
<br/>
So, by votes go for the health screen (essential if you're gonna do some Real Programming on the DS) and the slot-1/slot-2 bootage.

As of v8, recovery works with both slot-1 and slot-2..  But your device experience may very, so do a little research on it specifically.
