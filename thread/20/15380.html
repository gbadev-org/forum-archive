    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I posted a little while ago about me making 3d models for people to use in homebrews, but not to many people probably read it. This isn't the same thing in any way, so don't worry.
<br/>
<br/>
First off, I was wondering how hard would it be to make a 3d homebrew? I love 3d modelling but I can't find any little teams that are actually working on a entirely custom 3d homebrew. I'm a scenic artist type person so I could make levels for 3d homebrews and all that, but, like I said, no one seems to be interesting, or currently making, 3d homebrews, only 2d ones. This is mostly to ask if that's why there are hardly any out there, and no one working on it.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, I was wondering if anyone would be interested in me doing 3d modelling for them? I've got nothing better to do seeing how I can't hang out with my gf every day, and she's the only thing that I have any real reason to leave my house for, so I could work on 3d models quite a bit. If anyone would like to see what I can do, I can probably post up a link to some low polygonal objects, like the DS handles, of mine (with a very low vertice count, also)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still not entirely sure if this belongs here, or somewhere else, so it could be in the wrong place.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">be assured, there is 3d hb in development. ;^)
<br/>
keep looking and eventually someone will contact you.
<br/>
did you post any <span style="font-weight: bold">images</span> (links to them) in your post? i can't remeber.
<br/>
that would help getting people interrested. make sure you post a shaded model, as well as wireframes of it (side by side) from interesting angles - one or two per model.
<br/>
<br/>
good luck!
<br/>
<br/>
ps: when i hear of someone looking for a modelling artist, i'll think of you - at least i'll try to remember. ;^)
<br/>
<br/>
btw: i think this would be best posted in "Help Offered".</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
