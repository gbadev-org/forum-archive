TheRain first had the idea of using the DS as a MIDI controller and created the DSMIDI, a DS cartridge that added a standard MIDI port to the DS that could be used by homebrew DS software.
<br/>
<br/>
But since making a DSMIDI requires soldering skills and is rather dangerous, we came up with another idea: Using the DS as a wireless MIDI controller. The MIDI signals are sent to the computer via Wifi, and a server program forwards them to MIDI applications. 
<br/>
<br/>
So what is DSMIDIWifi exactly?
<br/>
DSMIDIWifi consists of
<br/>
<br/>
    * libmidiwifi
<br/>
      An open source library for DS homebrew development that makes it easy to write DS software that acts as a MIDI controller.
<br/>
<br/>
    * DSMIDIWiFi Server
<br/>
      An application that runs on the computer and forwards the MIDI messages received via Wifi to MIDI applications. The DSMIDIWiFi server is open source and is available for MacOS X (intel/ppc), Linux and Windows (guess who's the ugliest)
<br/>
<br/>
    *  DS MIDI Keyboard acts as a MIDI keyboard, including pitch wheel / MIDI control adjustment by sliding the stylus vertically/horizonally.
<br/>
    * Kaos DS is an XY controller similar to the Kaoss pad. You can use the stylus or your fingers to adjust MIDI controls.
<br/>
    * Pulse DS turns the DS into a MIDI synthesizer that uses the DS's PSG (programmable sound generator) to produce Game-Boy-like sounds.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do I need?
<br/>
In short, you need:
<br/>
<br/>
    * A computer of some sort (OSX, Linux, Windows will do just fine)
<br/>
    * A wirless access point of some sort
<br/>
    * A Nintendo DS, obviously
<br/>
    * A game that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (needed only once)
<br/>
    * DS homebrew hardware of some sort
