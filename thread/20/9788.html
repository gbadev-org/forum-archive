    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it be possible to backup and restore GBA savegames from/to CF-Card?
<br/>
<br/>
Especially flash-type savegames like the Pok?mon ones would be great.
<br/>
<br/>
The following Win32 app can backup and restore all kinds of GBA savegames without causing savegame errors (unlike the F2A software etc.). It sends a multiboot binary to the GBA which seems to do all the work.

<br/>
(It can also dump ROMs and write to Flash Carts, but I don't really need that, I guess. Would be a nice addition for people who don't have flash linker devices, though.)
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some skilled developer can look at it and port it to DS with CF-support instead of having to use a computer and a link cable? That would be some crazy helpful application.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heh, you should plug it though...it's a good piece of work.  I've used it several times myself, seems to be pretty reliable.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
