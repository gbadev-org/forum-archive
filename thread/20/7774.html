    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, could some please answer the follwing questions:
<br/>
<br/>
1) What is the screen resolution on the ds?
<br/>
2) How much SRAM do I get?
<br/>
3) How many colours do I get (eg 15-bit, 24-bit etc)?
<br/>
4) How many bits does an int have? (32 or 64?)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">1) 256x192
<br/>
2) Err... it's RAM I think is 4 MB. As for SRAM: that's something entirely different.
<br/>
3) 18-bit (260,000 colors)
<br/>
4) Whoa... is that integer bits? I am not qualified to answer such questions. *cue gong noise*<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

7 is not a "t",

1 is not an "l",

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">correct me if im wrong but a standard unsigned int is +32 bits a standard signed int is +-32 bits but of course you can daclaire diffrent sizes for the ds i.e.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i always thought the stanadard int depended on ur processor, for 16 bit CPUs int was 16bit , 32 is 32bit, it has to do with the fact of its faster to deal with solid chunk, instead of having to break it up to read the information<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/knight0fdragonds</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think you can call the DS 32bits.
<br/>
After all, Nintendos advertise's the GBA as "32Bit" (look at the box)
<br/>
<br/>
Its mostly meaningless.
