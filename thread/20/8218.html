    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've searched through the boards and tried to understand everything, but I really can't make sense of all this mumbo-jumbo...so if you could put things into simple terms for me and break stuff down to the bare basics, that would be awesome.
<br/>
<br/>
What I have:
<br/>
A Red Mario Kart Nintendo DS
<br/>
A Gameboy Advance Media Player 2 with update e19
<br/>
A 512 MB Compact Flash Card with reader
<br/>
<br/>
Now, my question is...what exactly can I do with all of this? Can I run homebrew .nds and .gba roms? What exactly do I need to do/use without completely screwing over my DS or my MP2? x.x; Sorry if you get this a lot, I'm completely lost here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you need a passkey, passme, a flashed DS or a WLan card with a rarlink chip for the homebrew .nds games and this hacked FW version of GBA MP(dunno know the link to this anymore)
<br/>
you can run most of the homebrew gba games on your gbamp.

They have to be multiboot (.mb or .mb.gba). Rename them to .gba and toss them in any folder on the CF card, then boot your DS in GBA mode.

If you bought a red DS in a Mario Kart bundle, you'll likely need a Supercard and a PassMe2. Check the <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/DS_Firmware#Checking_the_Firmware_Version" target="_blank">color of your firmware</a> so that we can explain the best method that corresponds to a given firmware version.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried renaming two GBA homebrew files that came as BIN files "BustaMoveGBA.gba" and "BustaMoveGBA.mb.gba", but I don't seem to be able to access them in the main menu of the MP2. Am I missing a file or an update or something to run them?
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I followed the instructions on that site: I got the dual yellow screens.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If they came as .bin files, then they're probably not multiboots. If they're larger than 250 KB, then they're probably not multiboots. Homebrew programs larger than 250 KB need to be rewritten to use the features of the GBAMP instead of the features of a typical (NOR) GBA flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
If ejecting a DS Game Card during Pictochat gives yellow screens, then you have DS firmware version 4. To run DS homebrew on firmware version 4, you need PassMe2 from dspassme.com or natrium42.com.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
