    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The homebrew community is nothing like the big gaming companies, so, needless to say, things don't just "get" ported, like theres a bunch of people behind their computers doing whatever their boss tells them to. Rather, individuals and sometimes small groups decide what to work on, whether its a port or an original project, and then they work on it, and hopefully finish it. So the appropriate question would be to ask if it has already been ported, or if anyone is working on it/considering working on it.
<br/>
<br/>
Not really trying to correct you, well maybe I am a little, but not in a harsh way.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, usually when someone's working on a project, they announce it here, and I haven't heard of anyone doing anything of the like. Do you know if its one of those PSP Lua games? If so, porting should be pretty easy for a decent programmer. Otherwise, I would recommend posting in the 'Help Wanted' forum, where you will most likely be respectfully told "Do it yourself".<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The fact that there are Tycoon games for the DS commercially available means the DS can do it.  Remember, things aren't just a strait port.. can you imagine what a game designed for 800x600 or 1024x768 would look like on a 256x192 screen?  All that stuff has to be scaled down, and in doing so, reduces the amount of RAM that it requires.. That, and you can always swap it in and out of RAM from FAT.
<br/>
<br/>
As with any other port, I'm sure it's possible, but that doesn't mean it will be playable.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OpenTTD seems highly portable. My Palm LifeDrive PDA runs it, even my SE m600i smartphone. The "screen size-issue" isn't realy that big considering all the small-screen devices it's been ported to before. I've played it on both my phone and my PDA, and it is possible. The DS has two screens, so with some modifications, it would be a perfect game for the DS! 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't too much about it, but the DS' RAM-size, <span style="font-style: italic">would</span> on the other hand be an issue(?).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
