I like to load up my fav podcast on my DS, set the volume high, and slip it under my pillow while I lay in bed at night.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSOrganize also plays music while closed, but it forces you to listen through the headphone jack for some reason :)
<br/>
(It's both a cool feature and completely pointless, since plugging in headphones shuts off the speakers anyway. It's nice that software has control over that, though).
<br/>
<br/>
That would be great in combination with a giant stable local wireless network so you could stream internet radio via your DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I often use music to get to sleep. Also, when you're just sleeping, there's usually no reason you can't plug it into an AC outlet (unless you're sleeping in a car on the go or something).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
