Really, all you need is a graphic editor and some code... it's not like making GUIs in Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] Pooh, it doesn't turn local URLs into links... you get the idea.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">But you can still link to a Free graphics editor... -- mod</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

might handle your needs - Someone creating a scriptable GUI interface for the homebrew community would be pretty awesome but most people seem to be doing there own thing.

DSLinux would always allow X (or something X-like)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
