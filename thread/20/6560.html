It's funny you should mention MoonShell...I just found out about this earlier today.  Pretty neat stuff.  It's picture viewing is cool...kinda flawed IMHO because of the way scrolling works though (are my hands just shaky or something? O_o).  I hope the filesize limit for MP3s is improved sometime (must be some way to stream it...easy for me to say that though lol)...heh, most of my MP3s are bigger than 2 megs.  Seems to have very good decoding though...even took the VBR Full Stereo (not joint stereo) MP3 I threw at it with no problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Er, sorry to get so off topic, just wanted to comment on this...it's awesome that I have this GBA Movie Player and it's gaining more functions because of the awesome homebrewers. :)
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Wait...I thought there was a filesize limit from what you were saying...  I just Playing an MP3 that was around 3.2 megs, and it played through to the end absolutely fine....I tried another too, 7.2 megs...seems to be working fine also (seems to fail if I flip around in the file menu a lot though).  I guess there is no limit on whatever this version is?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

VBR at what average bit rate? And "full stereo" vs. "joint stereo" shouldn't have much difference in the CPU load of decoding, as "joint stereo" just means to switch to sum-difference representation of the two channels for audio segments where the sum is much louder than the difference.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

He sent me an email saying he used the file in one of his projects (as per my simple request). He also said that he modified it to work for NDS, which was true at the time because I hadn't done it yet. Unfortunately the email was in engrish and I didn't quite understand everything.

I then sent an email back saying that it was good that he found a use for my code and to keep an eye on this forum for updates. He must have kept updating it as I did. I am not complaining too much, as he has translated the readme to Japanese, thereby bringing it to a wider range of coders. I guess without his translation Moonshell might not have supported the GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
If he had claimed them completely as his own work I would have been annoyed. Anyway, I am not too worried, as he has kept my name in the files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

theres only on way to find out!

"Where do I put the mp3s / jpgs I want to include, and which executables do I run?"
<br/>
<br/>
put the mp3s where ever you like just copy and past them anywhere on your cf card.  Its already compiled so just simply rename moonshell.nds to _boot_mp.nds as usual and away you go (assuming you have a gbamp of course!)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
