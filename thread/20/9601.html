    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everybody!
<br/>
GL2D(previously 2DGL) is a library for 2d graphics using the DS's semi-3d hardware (OpenGL),which results in pretty fast 2d rendering,and nice effects(being added with every version).
<br/>
<br/>
This is the final preview before the real v0.1 of my lib:) It has some pretty good features, such as gif loading and tinting textures, etc...
<br/>
So I wanted to know what do you guys think of this.
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:
<br/>
1) Paletted Textures bigger than 128x128 aren't working now(will be fixed next version)
<br/>
2)There aren't any examples yet, but there will be with 0.1(if you can make something, show it to me)
<br/>
3) There will be a demo with v0.1, to show off the features of this library.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry for the lack of documentation, but this will be solved defenitely with v0.1.
<br/>
<br/>
And thanks a lot to DynaStab for hosting the library(there are some problems with my ftp)

<br/>
Sounds good. I'll look into it when I get some spare time on my hands.
<br/>
Could you mention a few of the "nice effects" you incorporated?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Right now, I've got screen fading,tinting, and scaling in the version available here, and you can always draw the same sprite more than once.
<br/>
I could've added rotation and alpha, but they're not yet THAT stable(they're definitely by next version).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
