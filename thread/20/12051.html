Someone asked for a DS version of a popular word jumbling game, so here it is. It's a very early version so there's some bugs and issues with the word generation / selection and the touchscreen. 
<br/>
<br/>
It uses 2of4brif from the 12dicts zip file for the words.
<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to patch the .nds file with a DLDI patcher so it will work with your flash card - assuming there is a DLDI driver for you card. Have a look at <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/</a> if that last sentence made no sense whatsoever.
<br/>
<br/>
Tested on a m3sd and Dualis. wordlist.dat and the .nds need to go in the root - haven't tried it from a sub directory.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You can add extra words to wordlist.dat using a text editor (needs Windows linefeeds) - just be careful with the memory. :)

You should patch the .ds.gba version, and the wordlist.dat file must be in the root directory.

Due to emulator bugs and switching to the latest devkit and libnds, I've built this version as a single file .nds. Maybe I'll add FAT word list support back in if there's enough demand.
<br/>
<br/>
What's new....
<br/>
<br/>
- Built with latest libnds - touch screen should be better.
<br/>
- Single filed the code - word list is now built in. Should run from any directory on your card now.
<br/>
- Word generation is a lot faster.
<br/>
- Fix for valid words being skipped in certain circumstances during generation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It'd be nice to see some graphics in there.  Maybe even make in skinnable.  Just need a backdrop or two and 26 letter tiles.  You could make some nice skins for it.
<br/>
<br/>
It would also be nice if all the found three-letter, four-letter, etc. words were displayed on the top screen in alphabetical order instead of the the seamingly random (after the first letter) way they're displayed now.  This is how the version I've played for Windows worked and it was awfully helpful when you get down to the last few words.  Maybe that's why the feature isn't included in your version, though: makes it too easy.
<br/>
<br/>
I also find myself hitting the NEW button every now and then when I don't mean to.  Maybe it could be moved to the top-right corner or something.  Or maybe I'm just spastic and no one else has that problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making this game.  It's another addition to my "permanent" homebrew list.

The words end up sorted in an order - you can guess words once you've worked it out.

I'm currently implementing some different game modes - e.g. a time attack and an endless mode (basically the current game). I have changed it so that you can only only do 'new' once you've unwrapped the source word. I may add another mode where you can just go through and do puzzles without having to unlock the next word.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be possible to make it use German words. You'd need a list in text format with each word on a new line. Spell checking dictionaries are good for this.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there are currently two issues. The first is I've switched over to version that has the word list built in - I'd just need to build the new version with the DLDI fat code. The other problem is that the font I'm using doesn't have the extended characters you'd need for German like the umlauts or that 'B' which is an s sound. So some of the words would have characters missing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nah, that wouldn't be too much of a problem for the "?" one can use "ss" and the umlaute can be exchanged with two letters "oe" for "?" and so on.
<br/>
<br/>
i'd really like to see a german version. if i can be of any help, let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
i just put a little review to your game up on my page <a href="http://www.homebrewelt.com" target="_blank">www.homebrewelt.com</a> and i am sure, many germans would like a version in their language. if only it was a little prettier to look at  ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

German also uses compounds more often than some other languages. And are spell checking dictionaries Free?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
