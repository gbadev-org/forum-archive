    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Please HELP!
<br/>
My Nintendo DS Lite cant use WiFi anymore.
<br/>
It crashs in the WFC Setup when i select Look for AP. Even the Wifilib v0.3 rom does not find any AP(but it does not crash).
<br/>
<br/>
I tried the WFC Setup in MK DS(i own this game) and <span style="font-weight: bold">(avast ye)</span>.
<br/>
Both with the same result. even download play or anything like this do NOT work!
<br/>
<br/>
After that, i get to the main menu.
<br/>
<br/>
I own a Nintendo DS Lite (Black Europe Edition) and flashed it with FlashMe v7(Lite edition). Before i began flashing, a warning appeared and told me, that this firmware version is unknown.
<br/>
<br/>
Ahh, jeah, i allready tried reflashing my lite(with stealth and normal one) without a change!
<br/>
<br/>
Please HELP ME! what can i do??!?!?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ?hr on Sat Jul 08, 2006 4:42 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sounds like a new firmware / firmware chip thingy?
<br/>
<br/>
Try booting DSLinux and use its firmware checker.
<br/>
You could also do a firmware dump with that and give it to someone who knows what he's doing (not me) :P
<br/>
<br/>
Also, have you done the colours test?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I had the exact same warning when I flashed my DS Lite.. so I'm really interested in knowing.. was it -right- after you flashed your DS, or did it just occur.. after awhile?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh YEAH! I fixed it!
<br/>
<br/>
I dont know what it caused, but now it works perfect again!
<br/>
I wanted to replace it, so i installed noflashme. i had FW 6 after this installed. the original firmware! I couldnt enter Download-Play, Settings or Pictochat(starting games worked). So i tested in Mario Kart, if wifi does still not work but it did work again, so no need to replace it! YAHOO! So I flashed it back to Flashme v7(Lite Edition). Now everything works fine again! even pictochat and so on! When someone has the same problem as I do, he should know what to do.
<br/>
<br/>
Ahh and now i know why my first Lite didnt start anymore. I had Flashme on it. But there were some dead pixel and a light bug, so i wanted to replace it. Uninstalled FlashMe. Everything was fine. Had FW6 after this. I took out the lite battery to delete every setting, but you know, after uninstalling flashme, you cant enter the settings anymore, and it was the same here again! when you start the nds the first time, you have to enter your name etc. but it wasnt possible, because it always crashed on loading the menu of the settings!
<br/>
<br/>
If you have contact to loopy, tell him that theres a new DS Lite firmware out(and maybe send him this thread)!
<br/>
<br/>
But after all, id like to thank you all!. fast replies, good ideas and friendly poster! thank you!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
