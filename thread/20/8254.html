Maybe if there was exact controll mapping that varyed on a game-to-game base's. But frankly, I think piracy will happen, but never be pratical on the platform.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would be much too easy to bypass.
<br/>
<br/>
Besides that, RSA signing only applies to wireless multiboot.  Also, no$gba expects encrypted secure areas, if both bioses are completely present, and decrypted secure areas, if the arm7 bios is absent.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, none of the official games, (at least the ones I tried) work in it yet.
<br/>
<br/>
I will quite likely be using this emulator to reverse engineer some stuff, once emulation becomes compatible enough to be able to run the games, and sound support gets added.  (specifically, I wish to further reverse the sdat format used by most (not all) official games.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here is the code that was used to dump the bios completely.  The bios protection is based on the following.
<br/>
<br/>
Code executed inside secure area (0x0000-0x1203) may read the secure area data.
<br/>
Code executed inside bios area (0x0000-0x3FFF) may read bios range (0x1204-0x3FFF).
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Those conditions are only true after some code within the bios turns on the protection unit.  The protection unit is turned off at powerup, to allow for the required table to be copied out during firmware decryption/decompression, and then to allow the bios to read the secure area of the ds game cards, and decrypt it. The tables are then destroyed afterwards, and protection unit is turned on to prevent its readout.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one more thing.  Pepsiman's dumping utility does not dump to saveram, as the released source suggests, but rather to compact flash.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, I just knew what the function was supposed to do, and tried that. It's not even using a register that they forgot clearing or something similar. There are no other obvious SWI's that return something based on input.
<br/>
<br/>
I think Martin used custom firmware replacement to read BIOS. Loopy,Costis,CaithSith etc. found that LDR instruction.
<br/>
Joat once said he tried pretty much everything to find such instruction. Therefore me and others gave up early.
<br/>
Oh well, it doesn't really matter. But it would have been more challenging to crack the DS card encryption without having the BIOS dump :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Please excuse the noobness.....
<br/>
I'm confused... the MK4 looks like a straight forward passthrough device (I.E. like a max media launcher or Superkey card)  Is this essentially what it is?
<br/>
<br/>
If thats true, I guess what I was wondering is if there was a card that fit into your DS slot with a built-in SD/mini-SD slot attached so you could do homebew without having to purchase a GBA type card.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys... this is great stuff.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I'm looking at the M3 description and it says:
<br/>
"MagicKey3 can boot from ANY Flash cart. "
<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean?  You still nead a cart of some kind in the GBA slot to fire this thing up?  Or am I missing something? 
<br/>
Thanks,</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would imagine that the MK2 and MK3 use a special program, then stored as a ds.gba or .nds file, to boot the card. In the MK4, this program is on the MK4. You boot the MK4, swap to the MK2 or MK3, and then press a button.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well.. there is a supposedly nds flash cart called Ultra FlashPass. it was linked to in a DSLinux thread. I'm not goind to link to it directly b\c they link to none-homebrew nds material, so you'll have to search for it.
<br/>
<br/>
but I myst warn you.. the whole site + the shop seems a bit shady imho.<br/>_________________<br/>go back to coding and stop screaming wolf :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Huh that seems kinda backwards.  I figured since the MK2/MK3 had the SD slot you could just slap that guy in there and run anything off the SD card without having any GBA device inserted in the DS at all.  
<br/>
<br/>
So since you still need both the MK2/MK3 + GBA flash cart.. is there a benefit to using this method over say a Superkey (or variant) and a GBA flash device?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
He should get in contact with mic the dualis author, he was gratious enough to help with adding support of the FAT lib to desmume., or maybe Normmatt has the information he could share?
<br/>
<br/>
Without FAT lib support no$gba is kind of useless for most of my homebrew coding. Unless I rewrite everything to use my romfs and appended it to my nds, for applications that use my romfs they work great in no$gba.
<br/>
<br/>
The debugger does sound interesting if its a gdb type source code debugger otherwise I wouldn't know what to do with it. and will await the wireless gdb debugger thats being developed for hardware debugging., otherwise if it is a source code debugger I will see if i can buy it :)

If the time flies are helping Martin Korth maintain a useful emulator, we had better keep the insecticide put away :-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
