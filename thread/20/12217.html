    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I'm new to the GBADev forums, sorry to ask something in my first post. =/
<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to run the Image Viewer homebrew with my G6 Lite for quite sometime, but with no success. I already tried to patch the .nds file with the G6 DLDI file provided, but still nothing.
<br/>
If anyone did run this homebrew successfully with the G6 Lite, please could you explain the process, what to do?
<br/>
Also, I don't know how to use this DLDI files, all I did was make the G6 .nds file with the MakeNDSRom.exe and used the generated .nds file to patch with the corresponded G6 DLDI file, I also tried to use the .nds directly (not patched with DLDI), but with no success.
<br/>
Do I need to use the U-Disk Manager with Do Fat R/W to run Image Viewer, or I just need to copy direcly to my G6 device ? I am adding the files (IPK and NDS) in the root folder of G6.
<br/>
<br/>
Please, if anyone could help me with this, I would be very gratefull.
<br/>
Thank you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You may want to try patching that generated nds with this DLDI, <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/downloads/g6fl.dldi" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/downloads/g6fl.dldi</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the answer, Firon. =)
<br/>
I already tried using the DLDI from this page before, but still no success.
<br/>
Is there anything else I should do after copying the .nds file into the G6 ? Like, create a directory, or the .INI file, or the .IPK file, anything else ?
<br/>
Your flashcard is G6 too ?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Ah! One thing else, when I try to run the .nds, I just get a Black screen and nothing happens. =/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've never actually used ImageViewer myself.

<br/>
It's not normal that you get a black screen, though. Does the G6 have any option to boot a ROM as homebrew, or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
No, the G6 doesn't have any homebrew option that I know of, all the others homebrews I used, I just copied it directly into the flashcard and them worked fine.
<br/>
Thought so, I copied the coverted image IPK file with the .nds, I think it should have shown the thumbnails of the IPKs, but I just get this black screen. =/
<br/>
I tried more than 4 kinds of IPK, but with the same result. Maybe it really doesn't work with the G6 Lite. &gt;.&lt;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, but I don't have any idea of how to convert the .nds file to a .gba file with ndstool, could you give me a hand?
<br/>
I tried searching for some kind of tutorial on Google and on gbadev also, but couldn't find anything usefull. =/
<br/>
If you could do this for me, you can find the Image Viewer homebrew on this page:

<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
I tried converting the .nds file to .ds.gba with dsbuild, but now I just get a white screen. =/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
