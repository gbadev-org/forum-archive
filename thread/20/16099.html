    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know how a new DS model could block all homebrew cards. I've explained it <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=145524#145524" target="_blank">here nearly a year ago</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=979495&amp;cid=25223473" target="_blank">recently on Slashdot</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Even non-users of homebrew might be disappointed. DSi appears not to be compatible with the following products that carry the Official Nintendo Seal:
<br/>
<ul><li>GBA Game Paks </li><li>More than 33 percent completion in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl </li><li>Nintendo DS Browser powered by Opera </li><li>Face Training </li><li>Arkanoid </li><li>Guitar Hero </li></ul>
<br/>
As for WPA support, that would probably require the chipset to have a virtual Wi-Fi chip connected to a real Wi-Fi chip through a virtual bridge, so that existing Game Cards that support only open and WEP networks can still work. I don't see that as worth the cost per unit, especially given that 26-digit WEP + MAC filtering is good enough to redirect virtually all wardrivers to your neighbor's open network.
<br/>
<br/>
But did Nintendo buy the DSi trademark from Destination Software Inc. (now called Zoo Games), publisher of budget games for GBA and DS?

With the one inside the hinge, you can make photos of yourself, but this one have 0.3 MPixels, while the one on the backside is used to make photos of other people and things with ~3.0 MPixels.

I'm sure, that the WiFi Hardware of the DSi doesn't have the 2 MBit Limit. It's possible that it will throttle down automatically to 2MBit and switching to 802.11b Mode when playing "old" NDS Games over WiFi.<br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

The 3.0MP figure is bothering me. It's a bit high for me to believe, but 0.3MP is completely worthless. At the same time, the sources I'm more apt to believe are reporting two 0.3MP cameras while others are reporting that the exterior one might be 3.0MP.

So far no one is arguing differently. The camera quality is important because of that. I'm not sure when additional resolution in the camera no longer makes a notable difference in the final image quality, but I have found that 3MP is where digital cameras begin to take pretty pictures at useful resolutions. (On that note, it's a shame that display hasn't been bumped up to 18bpp while they were at it, but that'd be too much hassle I suppose.)<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">According to Nintendo's own press release, the camera only has a resolution of 300,000 pixels:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/conference2008fall/presen/e/02.html" target="_blank">http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/conference2008fall/presen/e/02.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
That's 0.3MP. Although I think that's an estimate because it's also been reported that it takes pictures in 640x480 format. Multiply it out and you get 307,200 pixels. Mind you, this is still higher than the screens are capable of. So I think that the external camera is only 0.3MP and the internal one is the same or less. Besides, considering that the increase in price is only about $50 and there are 2 cameras on it, I doubt they would include a 3.0MP camera. It's not meant for high-quality images.
<br/>
<br/>
You got to take what some of those tech blogs say with a grain of salt. I saw some that had the screen sizes wrong. They went from 3" to 3.25", while some places were reporting 3.5" (typo, maybe?).<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Yes, I was aware of that. Unfortunately the platform doesn't seem to be ready to accommodate higher modes. But it hardly matters since the cameras are almost certainly worthless (to me)--as a result color quality is not a big deal (except that it makes hue rotation look fugly.)<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not quite sold on that. When I first read the article, it read: "and a camera of indeterminate resolution on the outside of the shell", but what's there now doesn't contradict that, it just omits the "of indeterminate resolution" bit. Of course, no one will be surprised to find that they're both 0.3MP.

It's a bit early to judge. There is almost certainly something in the way of more processing power, and better WiFi (which is a bit weak on the current model tbh) and probably some RAM. Until we know exactly what these are it is really hard to compare since they could make no difference or all the difference in terms of capability. And (see the other thread) the battery life might not be as bad as it looks. Even if it is, assuming they're using the same battery, 0xtob points out that those extra hours are being put to some kind of use.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The battery life of the DSi will be about -4 hours of the DSLite battery.
<br/>
<br/>
And the DSi will not be the successor of the DS, the real successor could be announced not before 2010. The DSi will be (at the moment) the second (not third, the GBA is no more supported by Nintendo) handheld system side-by-side with the DS(Lite).<br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

I honestly don't get it.  I can see them trying to market for a "video phone" using the internal camera.. and I see theming going "well, everyone is going to want to be able to take pictures of stuff, if it has a camera" but.. it just seems like it would have been a better idea to put the camera at the top and allow it to twist for front/back pictures.
<br/>
<br/>
But, pretty much all cell phones have cameras in them already, and a lot of people already carry them around.  We all know these cameras suck, so I can't imagine one on the DS would be any better...  I don't think it's worth $10 more for the cameras.  Now, if the WiFi is better.. that and the built in browser might be worth the $50 price increase<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

CPU and WiFi upgrades also seem likely IMO, if they want it to be used for web browsing and image editing. Fairly interesting overall, and if it supports WPA I'll probably have to get it.

Ah ha! The "not" seems to have been lost in the automatic translation. Although it still doesn't specifically say whether WPA/WPA2 will work with regular DS games or not. From this translation, it seems to imply that it will work, but be limited to the old transfer rates of the DS and DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
You know I wonder if the software cares about the network settings at all? Maybe it just internally uses an API that just tests to see if Configuration 1, 2, or 3 connects and then selects the first that does. Then all references thereafter go through the API and it does the work.
<br/>
<br/>
The only place where it might have a snag is accessing the settings in an old game. The DS's firmware only stored the settings, but not the menu, right? If I remember correctly, the menu was stored on the games themselves. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) So I wonder what will happen if you access those settings on a DSi? Hopefully Nintendo had the forethought of a hardware revision that would change the WiFi chip and left a way for it be be updated.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the info. I've been thinking about it a little bit more and realized that maybe I was wrong. While the DS devkits have APIs that do handle the work, it's still written for the old DS hardware. I was thinking of it in terms of an OS at first, but that still has drivers and other things that handle the hardware interface. I don't think the DS itself really has that much room in the firmware to handle that kind of abstraction of hardware, so it would probably still come down to the original SDK written with the original hardware in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it all comes down to how wireless connections are established on the DS. This seems like it would be the same for both official and homebrew games in that sense. However, I don't know how it's done in the WiFi library for connecting to a wireless access point. Is it something where the stored settings in the firmware can just be parsed to the hardware and it establishes the connection on its own, or is it fairly more involved than that? Yeah, I'm probably over-simplifying it, but it seems like this would answer the question.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

That would require to either have two seperate wifi systems in the DS or a very customized one that can be put into hardware limitation with no software command resetting it.
<br/>
<br/>
It's much more likely that because of the init routine build into existing wifi enabled games that the explicit set the transfer rates to 1 or 2mbit/s. (as REd by sgstair) and thus only a higher speed aware software that sets the correct speed identifier would be able to take advantage of the new speed limit.

That's a good point. I'm a bit baffled that a new version isn't available yet. It's been expected RSN for quite a while and I'm a bit worried that the time it takes to release will be doubled if it's not released before the DSi comes out.

But this is no reason to complain. The new version is slated to address  some important issues and that's most important.

That won't prevent piracy. A copy of a game published by Nintendo can be smaller than 1/40 of a MB.
<br/>
<br/>
Now that Nintendo has stepped up the cat-and-mouse against homebrewers (see today's IOS changes), I just might stick with a slim PC and a Pandora PDA instead of trying to run homebrew on a Wii and DSi.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Apparently flashcarts tend to  boot, but can't launch anything. That sounds wrong to me, but that's supposedly the news from China. Taken at face value, I'd say they failed to launch any warez for sure, but it sounds like homebrew should work in principle. It also contradicts the whitelist/blacklist theory. 
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they just have a (selective) feature lockout for unsigned code? That could be a boon to homebrew if it still leaves the system more or less fully functional. One of my impossible DS-related wishes has already been granted (Phantasy Star Zero), so this doesn't seem so unlikely to me at the moment. (Imagine--no need for flashcarts at all, SDHC, extra storage and extra RAM built in.)<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, no one seems able to answer this question: Will new DS games only run on the DSi? Or rather, will DSi games only run on the DSi? If so, then I can see them going all crazy with a new RSA encryption method and the mentioned whitelist.
<br/>
<br/>
If not however, and DSi games are planned to be able to somehow detect the DSi and use its new features, or detect that they are on an older DS and disable their new DSi features, then I have doubts about a new signing method.
<br/>
<br/>
What also needs to be answered is what to do (from a developer perspective) about games that don't need to use the new DSi's features, or games that are almost completed that were not developed with the DSi in mind. If it is a whitelist indeed, it would need to be constantly updated with "new" old DS games, or it would need to have some way to verify them. So if there is no automatic updating, it is very likely that a whitelist is not being used. There's also the possibility that Nintendo is simply blacklisting the homebrew carts, although that seems like it would be easily undone, and considering that they seem to be responding to wii homebrew quite effectively, odds are something more complex is at stake.
<br/>
<br/>
How does signing on old games work? I know its an RSA encryption key, but is it just for the header, or is it for the game as well? How does current homebrew spoof this signing process in slot-1 cards to make the unsigned code run? Its entirely possible that Nintendo can simply detect the current method of spoofing that signing system, and that there is subsequently a more simple fix for hombrewers.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just worried that my old DS is not going to be able to play the new games. If I need the new DSi for Mario and Luigi 3, for example, I might be tempted. If not, I'm planning on sticking with my current DS phat until a homebrew solution is found.
<br/>
<br/>
And of course with any new console, there are already fakers. There has been at least one report of someone running unsigned code on the thing, so no telling how many minics will show up...
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have reports of any homebrew carts that actually do work? (Only 10 were mentioned in that report.) Also, do the Action Replay and other unofficial carts also fail to load? (I know nintendo blocked the GC action replay with a Wii update.)
<br/>
<br/>

RSA on old games applies only to DS Download Play. The only crypto on existing DS games is a symmetric cipher on the cart bus and the second pass of symmetric cipher on the "secure area". The going hypothesis nowadays, based on the reported behavior of homebrew cards in a DSi (game starts to load then dies with an error) as well as the Wii IOS version system, is that it's an ARM7 whitelist.

So long as the point is to get homebrew running and not piracy we talk about it plenty. As to why: mostly speculation, although it's probably close to the truth. I'm really hoping that we can just go in through the SD slot and forget supporting the piracy business. (OTOH, I hope we can still use DSerial, etc.)

<br/>
That happens all the time and has, generally speaking, very little to do with the DSi.
<br/>
Developers have to follow internal protocolls in order to be able to publish officially licensed software. If a developer misses something, the software will be rejected, sometimes even only for using a deprecated and now unsupported version number of a library - even if that wouldn't change anything in the game itself. And this isn't about Nintendo only, I hear that's something "everybody" does in the console market.
<br/>
<br/>
So, that might be the case here as well. The developer might have done something that is unsupported and therefore, the title got rejected by the testing department. Right here, right now, we can't know any better, so, why bother going into details any more?
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that says anything about the DSi, which is, as stated before and available "all over the net": fully backwards compatible ... minus slot 2.

You know, CPU clocking isn't everything, as the NDS' design had only a 33 MHz bus that was reducing the overall performance from what the CPU is able to deliver. Only when using TCM and the cache, one could yield the true power of the CPU.
<br/>

I can see Wikipedia has some nice infos out. I wonder what the sources are? ;^)

I bring you some confirmations of what it has been said here.
<br/>
<br/>
The DSi has its cpu <span style="font-weight: bold">[censored --MOD]</span> and its RAM at <span style="font-weight: bold">[censored --MOD]</span>. Wifi chipset, microphone and sound has been improved and <span style="font-weight: bold">[censored --MOD]</span>.
<br/>
Now, It could be possible to build intresting 3D engine and at least, why not, shaders.
<br/>
<br/>
Another intresting facts is the softwares for DSi. Aparently, there's more than one type of softwares :
<br/>
DS Software (works on all DSL / DSi)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">[censored --MOD]</span>
<br/>
Exclusive Software ( will work on DSi only, region-locked).
<br/>
<br/>
But for now, Exclusive Game will be use for DSiWare, in the first time. I think when the DSi will be as selled as the DSL, Exclusive software will be apply for Packaged Game.

Good and Bad news imo. Good in that we can do homebrew on it soon. Bad because it allows continued piracy with the way it works. All I really wanted was to continue my own homebrew developments and run others' homebrew stuff without getting commercial games to run the same way, like from the SD slot on the side.

As far as changes in the hardware, only the CPU and possibly the microphone were the two from your list that we did not know were confirmed changes. Still, if you got that unreleased information in the same manner as silent_code got it (who hasn't given us such exact information :P ), then you might be at risk. If I remember correctly, the DSi Wikipedia page "said" some time back that it had double the CPU speed, but checking recently, it has since been removed.
<br/>
<br/>
About the 3 styles of software, we knew about the 1st and 3rd. The 2nd is interesting, but not anything new that we haven't already seen in the past. Games for the Gameboy Color (and the Super Gameboy for the SNES to an extent) did something similar, allowing certain additions to be accessed on the new hardware while still being able to run those games on the older hardware, just without the kind of features that the newer hardware had. Still, I'm pretty sure that there were very strict limitations when allowing that kind of compatibility to work both ways.
<br/>
<br/>
I may be thinking too hard on the subject matter, and this sort of limitation may not be so "limited" with this generation of hardware.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It was there. The CPU info was probably removed for lack of a clear source. I did some poking around and found someone claiming some JP page was their source for the CPU speed but the page didn't have any numbers so I didn't really check it out too much.

This is what bugs me. AK hasn't really said anything about whether it gives access to the DSi stuff, and my guess is that it doesn't. Some other team mentioned that they couldn't get access to the SD slot. It seems like it's still no farther ahead than the rumored image exploit as far as DSi functionality goes.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe spend some time converting code to take advantage of some of the more obvious things like 4x the RAM, etc. In time, better support for the new hardware in the flashcart (or even homebrew SD) will emerge and, hopefully, low-level documentation on the new DSi features. Oh, and an updated emulator would be cool so I can continue coding during my lunch hours again :)

That is certainly true, but then, it depends pretty much on a lot of other factors, too. E.g. if there's only 2k primitives that can be rendered and the bus is only so fast and the FIFO has only that many entries, a faster CPU won't hurt, but maybe besides faster skinning routines and maybe realtime shadow volume computations, you can't do much graphics wise.

Those both worked on the original GB as well as the GBC, which leads me to believe that they used a trick with the third channel (for which you could specify your own waveform) rather than a new digital sound channel.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I really do think that digital sound wasn't truly added until the GBA days. Perhaps by the time the GBC had come out, they had just figured out how to do the trick to play recorded sound and decided to advertise it.

And yes, I did play MK4. For about 30 seconds. After which I had to stop to go puke on something.

Actually that's not true anymore. Several Wii Ware games (My Life as a King comes to mind) offer downloadable content.

<br/>
Sorry, but that's just absurd. Emulation requires a minimum of 5-10x the processing power of the CPU being emulated, and that would easily push that CPU's processing power over the 'supposed' 133Mhz ARM9 CPU. It's illogical to have the sub processor faster than the main processor. It's far more illogical for emulating anything within 1 generation of hardware, let alone the same generation of hardware.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well that begs the question of whether GBA games used Thumb instructions. If so, the ARM9 could run those natively. Here's an excerpt from the Wikipedia entry on ARM architecture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Thumb):
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Embedded hardware, such as the Game Boy Advance, typically have a small amount of RAM accessible with a full 32-bit datapath; the majority is accessed via a 16 bit or narrower secondary datapath. In this situation, it usually makes sense to compile Thumb code and hand-optimise a few of the most CPU-intensive sections using full 32-bit ARM instructions, placing these wider instructions into the 32-bit bus accessible memory.
<br/>
<br/>
The first processor with a Thumb instruction decoder was the ARM7TDMI. All ARM9 and later families, including XScale, have included a Thumb instruction decoder.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if there is enough parity in the codebase between the ARM7 and ARM9 whether it would fully need to be emulated, or if most instructions could be remapped and use less CPU time.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I really hope the ARM7 core is still in the DSi. It is still possible given that the previous DS versions had both cores in a single chip. But I don't think anyone really knows outside of Nintendo at this point. Anyone that does isn't letting on.

As for new information, I haven't seen any. These are the only teardowns I've seen besides Bunnie's:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it has already been mentioned, that commercial DS games use a common ARM7 binary, and use an interface to functions for sound and wifi on the ARM9. Couldn't it be the case that these functions are provided by other hardware now so the ARM7 binary is remapped by the DSi (or a new replacement binary is loaded from a segment of the firmware somehow?)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

While it would be amazing, it would also be unrealistic. Nintendo not only has no need to do so, but the DSi is not considered "the" next generation Nintendo handheld. It's just a small update to the current handheld.
<br/>
<br/>
But, I don't see why they couldn't enhance current video capabilities at least a little. They did with the audio, the wifi, and possibly even the CPU, so why not the video hardware, like increased polygon/vertex RAM and the fillrate?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think realistically, we might see improvements for the DSi that would not break backwards compatibility, like an increased poly count or fill rate. Even better, given increased RAM system wide, we might see an increase in VRAM available for textures. That said, I wouldn't expect anything major in the graphics department.
<br/>
<br/>
With the exception of the N64 (which was actually superior in the general 3D powerhouse department for its time, the PS1 had terrible 3D calculations) Nintendo seems to follow a theme of letting the code and the game designers make the graphics beautiful, rather than the hardware. Where Microsoft and Sony will both ensure that their hardware will have no trouble playing the games released and encourage their developers to take full advantage of that hardware, Nintendo seems to be content with keeping their hardware costs down, and encouraging their developers instead to make games that are *fun to play* and do *innovative things* rather than just looking pretty.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, Nintendo is happily content with providing a system with enough power for most moderate graphics tasks, in the interest of keeping their hardware low cost for the end user. They won't skimp out to the point that games just look "last gen" in comparison, but they also don't seem to be trying to win any awards in their visuals department. After all, it's the gameplay people will talk about for years and years, not the graphics.
<br/>
<br/>
When it all comes down to it, I think this makes Nintendo consoles more impressive targets for developers looking to push the hardware, both commercially and in homebrew. It's a true example of well planned and executed code when a game comes out on the Wii that looks as amazing as the games on the other two, because it shows that the graphics designer knew exactly where to cut (and not) cut the corners and still get the visuals he wanted in the scenes. It makes it a bit more of an art form.
<br/>
<br/>
[/longrant]
<br/>
<br/>
tl;dr: I don't think Nintendo focuses on graphics very much for their consoles, so I don't think they will push the video hardware nearly as hard as other companies do.<br/>_________________<br/>What if the hokey-pokey really is what it's all about?

<br/>
It comes from ARM's own marketing pages used to show off products using their chips. One would think that they would have the right info. I found out about it because it was used as the source for the Wikipedia entry on the DSi's technical specifications:

<br/>
If this article is correct, it seems Nintendo is looking to combat Sony's PSP Minis initiative by opening up DSiWare to more indie developers. Nintendo still maintains control over pricing and royalty rates for app size, but it allows for smaller titles to be published for a much smaller price. For instance a 500 point game must be less than 20MB or the royalties will be higher. Considering a good amount of homebrew is usually only a few megabytes, this shouldn't be a problem for a lot of apps.
<br/>
<br/>
This could be a big step in the direction of actually giving homebrew developers a legitimate way to develop and distribute their apps for the DS. I just wonder if they are going to relax their restrictions on becoming licensed developers or not? Well, no matter what, I see this as good news. Just how good it is will remain to be seen.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I have a feeling there would be little to no relaxation of licensing requirements. It's not like they're going to go the App Store route.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
