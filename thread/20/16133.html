    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently bought a 'EZFLASH Plus' and I'm wanting to put a movie on it. I know I already have enough space for the movie to fit, so that's not going to be a problem.
<br/>
It's just the movie was originally converted onto the computer for an iPod (MPEG-4 Movie file), and thats the only copy I have of it.
<br/>
I was wondering if I'm able to change it to a DPG file?
<br/>
<br/>
and thanks if anyone can help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
