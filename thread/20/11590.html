<br/>
Seems a bit far fetched but thought I would ask as I need to get hold of something (phone, PDA) that does. It just would have been easier with the DS as I wouldn't have to spend more money and it could be one less thing to carry around with me.

Isn't there just the one, DSOrganize?

At any rate, the author of DSOgranize has abandoned the project, so no new features are coming for that. Unless somebody takes the source code and starts a fork, but there was a debate about the ethics of such a project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sorry, I just thought people had a problem at one point with people concentrating on the same type of projects. Must have been other things. (I loose track. :) )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
