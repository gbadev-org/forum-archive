Before I continue, this idea is released under the GPL license. Anyways, here it is:
<br/>
A Limewire-ish client for the DS. Complete with MP3 streaming, and official demos, not to mention homebrew. It will have to use DLDI for saving I think. Can you save a file as a stream, piecemeal? Or would you need a memory expansion? Theoretically, on a 1mbps dedicated net connection, you could download an official download, or a song in about 32 seconds. That's a pretty fast link. I have all the libraries installed on my PC, but I don't know how to code in C.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The ds wifi would be insanely slow for transferring files over a p2p network, even pc's are slow at it, not to mention people are not going to switch on there DS just to seed files and have that being the only thing running. people have there ds's for playing games on , if you want to share files there are much faster, better, ways to do it.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

<br/>
All that it needs is basic high-speed data sharing protocol, from there we can add  organization and export a readable file. I did some research, and I found that the DS has 1 or 2 mbps wifi connection. Granted that my PC has 54mbps wifi, but if the internet itself is only 1mbps, why would it matter. Granted that the DS has limited hardware, and for some reason takes a while for web pages to load on the official browser (yes, I actually have the original browser). But it couldn't be that slow. Basically all I want to do is make a database reader for downloading. Any app that has http capability can be modified with the database front-end. Granted, that may be easier said than done. And no, I didn't know that the DSO came with a homebrew database. I'm still waiting to get my R4. I did know that DSO has mp3/ogg streaming, but the idea is to integrate everything very tightly. So let's say I modify the homebrew database to include song, demo, and miscellaneous lists as well, and then attach that to the mp3/ogg streaming engine. Is that at all practical?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well i somehow doubt. Yes surely you could GPL a document describing the idea, but that wouldn't be a licence to the idea itself?

<br/>
I'm not sure exactly why; I don't have a lot of technical know-how when it comes to internet protocols, but downloading off the internet in DSOrganize gets be 14KB/s at best, now, my internet connection at best is roughly 10mbps, whereas my wifi router is 54mbps, and the DS's wifi runs at 2mbps. Yet if I slow my router down to 2mbps and download off my PC, I can still get speeds of ~50-80KB/s. It would definitely matter.

<br/>
"For some reason" being that the average PC has upwards of 512MB of RAM, and anywhere from a 2 to 3GHz processor, where the DS has &lt;4MB of RAM, and two processors running the total of ~90MHz? Yeah, I'd say it'd be that slow.

<br/>
It's possible for anyone to run their own homebrew database with a webserver and a PHP script, (search it out at the DSO forums, follow the 'YoungMX forums' link on the DSO website.) and access it through DSO, but yeah, there can't be any uploading from the DS, but you could use a website that users could sign up for for that.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The major problem with software patents is that most software patents shares several similarities with non-patentable materials like mathematical algorithms and would fail the non-obviousness requirement if analyzed properly (aka: lock a bunch of programmers in a room, give them the problem the patent claims to solve and they'll most likely come up with a similar, if not identical, solution). 
<br/>
<br/>
The sole reason the games industry still exists today as an industry today is because most developers largely ignore the patent system. the whole thing would have imploded long ago into a bloody suit-bath if they did make use of it. A few developers from decades ago would've locked all others out and would probably ruin everything without competition.
<br/>
<br/>
Independent developers would needs lots cash to do patent research for every single paragraph in their game design and to pay to license every single one of them. Stuff like health bars, extra lives, all forms of enemy AI, camera angles, collision detection and stuff would be patented already.
<br/>
<br/>
Just look at the software industry. The software giants like Microsoft and Oracle admit they file patents in order to be able to counter-sue if they ever get sued, and they often cross-license their stuff at little to no cost. It's like the Cold War.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
