    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">So you want to turn your DS into an MP3 player...</span>
<br/>
<br/>
You can do this with any of the following programs: <ul><li><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/" target="_blank">LMP-ng</a>, the "iPod-clone" music player software that the magazine told you about </li><li><a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12626" target="_blank">MoonShell</a>, a music player also capable of playing video, showing photos, and starting other programs </li><li><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dragonminded.com/?loc=ndsdev/DSOrganize" target="_blank">DSOrganize</a>, a personal information manager that also plays music, shows photos, and starts other programs </li></ul> These are Nintendo DS homebrew software, developed by a hobbyist and available on the Internet. You will need to purchase five things to get started with homebrew:
<br/>
<ol type="1"><li>A PC. </li><li>An SD card writer, which may be built into the PC or may connect through USB. </li><li>A microSD memory card. (Most microSD cards bundle an adapter to use the microSD in an SD card writer.) </li><li>A Nintendo DS video game system. </li><li>"<a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=19" target="_blank">Flash equipment</a>", or an adapter to use microSD cards with the DS. </li></ol>
<br/>
You can buy items 1 through 4 at traditional retail stores throughout the developed world. You will need to order item 5 online, which may require a debit card (which most banks include with each checking account) or a PayPal account.
<br/>
<br/>
The microSD to DS adapter is the size of a DS Game Card and will let you run Nintendo DS homebrew. There are several brands of adapter, and it's generally best to choose a brand that a lot of other people have so that they can help you with problems. Many of us recommend the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.r4ds.com/r4ds.htm" target="_blank">R4DS</a> or the rebadged R4DS known as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.m3adapter.com/SLOT-1/main.htm" target="_blank">M3 DS Simply</a>. You can <a class="postlink" href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=r4ds&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">search Froogle for R4DS</a>, and you can check the stores listed in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewforum.php?f=13" target="_blank">Retailer Feedback</a> to make sure that you're buying from a reputable store.
<br/>
<br/>
But playing music is not the only thing you can do with DS homebrew. There are numerous freeware games and applications for the DS. See also <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_homebrew" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew</a> on Wikipedia.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For #5, you can buy the Max Media Dock in some stores. As I understand, though, it's not great when it comes to homebrew compatibility. If you choose a slot-2 device, you can pick up Action Replay DS for practically nothing at many game stores (I got one at a grocery store!) which also functions as a NoPass.

Also, Moonshell is another great media player, and DSOrganize plays various music formats as well as streaming AAC.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You don't have to comment on their shortcomings, just mention everything that is able to play mp3s.  Or not.. either way..  Are there any other mp3 players besides the following?
<br/>
<br/>
LMP-ng
<br/>
Moonshell
<br/>
DSOrganize

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're not going to get the required equipment for under $3, but I think some slot-1 cards are as low as $20. AFAIK those wouldn't have built-in memory though, you'd need a MicroSD card. I'd look those up on Froogle but the link seems to have disappeared O_o but anyway they can be fairly cheap depending how much storage you want, I'd recomment at least 512MB for music.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have firmware versions 1-3 and a compatible wireless card, all you need is a GBA Media Player ($20) and a Compact Flash card (depends on the size and brand, avoid those cheapo ones though). Any Slot-2 card can be used for this but GBAMP is the cheapest. However, chances are you have neither of these.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are planning to use a device that uses microSD cards, then yes, you should get that equipment.  If you're going for cheap stuff, a slot-1 card would probably be good, in which case your main options are the R4, M3 Simply, and Supercard DS.  Research those three devices to see if you prefer one over the others.
<br/>
<br/>
The EZ-Flash V is also another option as well.  I'd stay away from the DS-X and anything with the word "Ninja" in it, as the former is overpriced at $125 and the latter isn't very well supported by homebrew.  Granted, with DLDI, this theoretically shouldn't be an issue, but you're more likely to find people who can confirm problems ("yeah, it doesn't work on my XX device either") if you have a more common device like the ones I listed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The card can play .d3v videos and .mp3 audio without any other software, but the built-in player is terrible and not worth listening to.  With the new DLDI for the GnM, you can use MoonShell, DSOrganize (but it must be named bootme.nds to work), and LMP (the Ipod clone) without any issues whatsoever.  MoonShell also plays .dpg videos, but the GnM's hardware is a bit slow and videos may lag, but if you encode them at low bitrates it shouldn't be an issue.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
