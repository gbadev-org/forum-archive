Cannot edit programs on DS period, or cannot edit programs on DS without booting back into DSOrganize? If the programs are stored in an ISO 8859 encoding, then the user can edit code in DSOrganize and save it to the CF. But most 8-bit BASIC interpreters stored programs on tape or disk in a bytecode form, where keywords (PRINT, INPUT, LET, FOR, TO, STEP, NEXT, etc) were stored as single bytes with their high bit set.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

If DSOrganize can edit text files in DOS format (line end=CRLF) then those files will work in DS BASIC. The programs don't require line numbers, and can be uppercase or lowercase, when edited by a text editor programs. I hope to also lets editing on DS BASIC as well, like some old BASIC, by typing in line numbers and commands.
<br/>
<br/>
Some things about DS BASIC:<ul>
<br/>
<li>You can press START is short for typing "RUN".
<br/>
</li><li>If you press SELECT it will list the .BAS files on the card to load.
<br/>
</li><li>There are no string variables, only numbers.
<br/>
</li><li>You can not do complex IF statements (as in A=0 OR B=3), but you can do something like IF A*(B-3)=0.
<br/>
</li><li>Commands or editing (SAVE, NEW, LIST, etc.) don't work yet, but I hope to add them in next weekend.

I don't know how to do that, maybe I need to figure out how, or someone else that knows how, tell me how or do it yourself, but wait until I fix this software a bunch of stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
(Note: There is one command called FORGET, which is from INTERCAL and has a similar function as the INTERCAL command called FORGET)

I hope to add these new commands on the weekend:<ul>

You can already do PEEK and POKE.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is list of all command currently available: (assignment), PRINT, INPUT, IF, THEN, FOR, NEXT, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN, END, FORGET, PEEK, POKE, LOCATE, COLOR, VBLANK, GETKEY, GETCHR, MAP, LOAD, RUN
<br/>
<br/>
There are 26 variables available (A-Z), which can only store integers (no strings), but you can also store things in the maps (4 layers, 0=screen, 1=cursor layer, 2 and 3=hidden, each layer 32x32, but only 32x24 is visible). Line numbers are accepted but not required. You can use ? short for PRINT, but you cannot type LET before an assignment.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">ON GOTO command:</span>
<br/>
It works like the old ON GOTO command in some older version of <b style="color:#FFA34F">BASIC</b>.
<br/>
For example: ON A+1 GOTO 25 90 100 120
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">MENU command:</span>
<br/>
It display the cursor on the menu you can move cursor and select items
<br/>
You can do for example: ON MENU 1 2 3 GOTO 40 50 60
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">MOD command:</span>
<br/>
This is for self-modifying code. For example:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">5 mod 10 4 = 65
<br/>
10 ? "!!!"
<br/>
15 ? #(mod 10 6)+2
<br/>
20 end</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
This code will output:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">A!!
<br/>
#</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I still working on program editing/saving.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think it would be good to add a HTTP library (I found the Wifi lib but I can't figure out how to do it!), so that you can type LOAD "http://example.org/super.bas" and load file from Internet.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I know OUCH, but for some reason Integer Tiny <b style="color:#FFA34F">BASIC</b> uses % to do modulo and / to do integer division.

Typing NEW will clear the buffer so you can enter a new program. You can enter a program by typing the line numbers before the commands you want to enter. Type LIST to view the program you already typed in.
<br/>
<br/>
START button runs the program (or type RUN).
<br/>
SELECT button lists *.BAS files in the card. If you press Y it lists all the files, but they won't work if you select them from this menu because they probably aren't valid <b style="color:#FFA34F">BASIC</b> programs.

Befunge is pretty, I reckon. A handheld editor needs syntax highlighting, but it would be fun.

<a class="postlink" href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/You" target="_blank">You</a> can still write programs and enter commands in immediate mode, but you can't load or save programs using a SD card. You need a CF card to load and save programs. (It isn't my fault that you can't load and save using SD card, it just isn't supported by the gba_nds_fat library).
<br/>
<br/>
The SELECT button lists the *.BAS files on the CF card so that you can select which file to load. Move the cursor to the file you want using the d-pad and then press SELECT again to load the program. If you want to list all the files (instead of just *.BAS files), press Y button on the file listing menu (you can press Y button again to cancel this option). Press START to run the program after it is loaded.
<br/>
<br/>
You can type in a program either in immediate mode or include line numbers to write a program (you have to type NEW before writing a new program). To run the program you can type RUN or press START.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are still confuse you will probably have to look at the source code.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently stumbled across thsi app, which seems an awesome idea to me... but of course it doesn't work on my M3Simply (R4) or other slot-1 flashcarts (it seems to run ok, but won't list the .bas files, much as a previous poster encountered). :(
<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering... has this project been abandoned (I spent a few hours just finding this post about it!) or is there ANY chance that one day it might be updated to work on slot-1 carts?

I just think the possibilities of even <b style="color:#FFA34F">basic</b> <b style="color:#FFA34F">BASIC</b> on the DS are wonderful!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks HEAPS for undertaking this, Wintermute! I'm very grateful!
<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I saw this, I downloaded and gave it a whirl on my DS. Now, DSBasic seems to work as before, but the file system seems to hang on my M3 Simply (slot-1).
<br/>
<br/>
I patched the nds with DLDI (R4) first, and that seemed to work fine, and when I press select within the app, it DOES list the directories in the root of the card... but won't let me do anything else, and I have to reset my DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've tried putting the nds file in the root, and in various subdirectories (PROGRAMS, BASIC and DSBASIC) but all seem to cause the same problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Any idea if there's something I'm doing wrong? How are others going testing this so far?
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, thanks again for taking up the task of getting DSBasic to work on slot-1 cards, Wintermute! :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dood77, how did your testing go with this? Curious if I'm the only one having problems with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
