    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have found out that the Mitsumi 3205A is also discovered on the "yellowed firmware" (forgot what version its called) DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed this because I have these DS boards and on the main board it says on all of them C/NTR-CPU-01 but the one with the Mitsumi 3205A says C/NTW-CPU-20.
<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to make sure you can do the LCD trick, open your DS and check if it says C/NTR-CPU-20.
<br/>
<br/>
Ignore the firmware trick where you have to take the game out while in pictochat, all of these DS's showed it as yellow so you cannot tell.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't take pictures because I don't have a good camera...
<br/>
<br/>
I am excited that I have the chip but sadly the board is bust. I will bridge the fuses soon and see if it works. If not, then I will solder the chip into a working board.
<br/>
<br/>
[Edit] Just noticed that there is another chip on one of these boards. It's a Mitsumi 3205B this time. I wonder what this one does...<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was wondering the same thing.  It seems like the quality would be mediocre too, since the DS screens just plain aren't as good as the DS Lite screens, which can be noted by comparing the two when they're on similar backlight modes.<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
"C/NTR-CPU-01"
<br/>
&gt;.&lt;;
<br/>
so im guessing that means it doesn't have light level change support?...
<br/>
<br/>
someone should make a ds app to check which chip it is...
<br/>
<br/>
because i don't believe the 01 and 20 actually matter :-\
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:LOL,
<br/>
the "C/NTR-CPU-20" thing is on the serial number sticker lol,
<br/>
bottom right corner
<br/>
<br/>
Edit AGAIN!:
<br/>
well after being bored,
<br/>
i decided to go on FCC's website...
<br/>
and i looked at the photos of the ds before it came out...
<br/>
and guess what.
<br/>
"C/NTR-CPU-X4"
<br/>
was on the board
<br/>
interesting :P
<br/>
<br/>
and the SL1 was permently briged ;)
<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------
<br/>
the ds lite fcc photo's
<br/>
says "C/USG-CPU-X3"
<br/>
<br/>
has anyone else noticed the little text doesn't say NTR (nitro)
<br/>
so the ds lite doesn't have the name nitro?...
<br/>
<br/>
i wonder what its called ?

Maybe it is true, but not because of the V5 FW.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh guess what, im getting some more Nintendo DS's. Im going to get 6 Silver ones and 4 Blue ones. I had the CPU 20 board but I can't remember which ds it came from. I only had one pink one and I think it was from there, the other 9 are silvers. Hopefully I'll get 4 CPU 20 boards with the new chip. I'll let you guys know how it is.<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Shaz, the only old DS with Lite brightness control I've seen was a pink with recent Nintendogs bundle (well, about 3 months old) and original firmware v5. Obviously also with the NTR-CPU-20 chip as you said - easiest to check is just to flash with latest FlashMe and if it recognizes the DS as DS Lite you will have the new brightness control.
<br/>
<br/>
There was a thread about this back then... seemingly Nintendo has updated the old DS circuits alongside the DS Lite using more of the same components for the display.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
