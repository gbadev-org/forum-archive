do you know what you just said ? this comment doesnt make any sense
<br/>
<br/>
a hash is created using SHA1 for example, this hash is then encrypted using RSA/DSA or whatever you like - if the Nintendo DS uses signed code well then sure there is an underlying hash algorithm used - RSA is not an hash algorithm
<br/>
<br/>
On Topic :
<br/>
<br/>
The SHA1 is far from beeing "cracked" its just that instead of random bytes you have to put together to gather the same hash as a valid message - you are now able to put up to 25-50% text (text that makes sense and is not random) in it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you can do that <span style="font-weight: bold">in a reasonable amount of time</span>, then it really is "cracked". At least for practical purposes. Can't you use the first 25-50% part of the file to put your nds, and just leave the rest for the random stuff? Then your ds would only execute the "text that makes sense" part, and the rest would just ocupy space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
the attacks are generally for plain text messages (i.e. signed emails or something like that) - its not cracked yet since you cannot create exact 1:1 messages (i.e. you have to hide some data for the enduser)
<br/>
<br/>
moreover, the sha1 term is missleading - because the proof of concept is only provided for a lower sha1 with uses only 64 steps during hashing instead of 80

if you are interested in this subject - heise.de has created an article about it with more in depth information - it is in english too

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately, from what I read in the article, the attacker has to be generating BOTH pieces of code in order to produce matching signatures. In other words, this will only help if we know someone on the inside who is willing to attach random data (selected by an attacker) to the end of a commercial nds file before it is published. Also, currently you need to have 25% real data and 75% random attack data. So at this time, this is pretty much useless to us.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
