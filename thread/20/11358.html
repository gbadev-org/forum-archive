I'm curious about their mention of an "OS" though. Is it really an OS?

Hmmmmm, well, it would be nice if it were possible to use a DS-Xtreme on conjunction with a SuperCard...
<br/>
<br/>
How?
<br/>
<br/>
Well, DS-Xtreme for the homebrew end, SuperCard for the extra memory. Although, come to think it it, that's kinda redundant.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmm, tepples, you have a point. Did they port FreeDos? *laffs*
<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I doubt the firmware for the SuperCard that handles the basics is an OS really...
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough I browsed on over to their (DS-X's) forums. There's a lot of user chit chat but no really juicy tidbits from the devs...
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Mahe, I'm not sure I follow you wrt to the faking...
<br/>
<br/>
If I recall, the following happens in the video:
<br/>
<br/>
1: Connects DS-X to desktop running Mac OS X (Yetch)
<br/>
2: Copies base dsorganise binary (Stated to be the plain .nds one...)
<br/>
3: Disconnects DS-X
<br/>
4: Starts DS
<br/>
5: Navigates to apps menu
<br/>
6: Selects DSOrganise binary and loads it
<br/>
7: DSOrganise displays complaint screen due to it's directory structure not exisiting and then creates it
<br/>
8: Buggers about in DS-X, makes a scribble, views it in the browser
<br/>
9: Powers down
<br/>
<br/>
Potentially there's a problem at 7, if DSOrganise doesn't re-create it's directory structure. I can't remember myself, but can it do this. I'm sure I remember doing it once. Wait a second, a good way to test...
<br/>
<br/>
*grabs DS and test*
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm, okay, used DSO to frag my DSO directory and then restart and loaded DSO. It *does* create the directory and files if they are missing. However, I'm not sure whether the screen for DSO grey (The one they claim to be using) is very different from that of DSO blue (Which I'm using...), other than in terms of BG colour.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think the DSO error message in the version they demo'ed looked a little different from the one on mine...
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they grabbed the DSO source and modified it a little?<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

People tend to incorrectly call anything with a windowing system (Moonshell), built-in applications (DSOrganize), or a file browser (many apps) an OS, but this isn't usually correct.

Well, a Moonshell/DSOrganiser hybred seems pretty much a dos match to me in terms of features.

<br/>
The only main difference I guess is theres no "drivers" as such (for sound, mice) ect.

But then the DS dosnt need that as it dosnt have varying hardware.

Well...
<br/>
<br/>
Hardware &lt;-&gt; DOS &lt;-&gt; Software

<br/>
Hardware &lt;-&gt; Software
<br/>
<br/>
DSO is software, as is pretty much all the other DS homebrew...

This is probably a bit of an oversimplification really...

Basically, though, I'd say that DS software is running bare metal...

However, we do have DS Linux...
