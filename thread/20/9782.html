    <h4>#85916 - thundrestrike - Sat Jun 03, 2006 2:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I just finished installing my new NDS shell.
<br/>
But I ran into a problem...
<br/>
<br/>
Whenever you hold a normal, unmodified DS upside down, the top part (the part that holds the top screen and speaker) stays in place; still touching the bottom part (the part that holds the touch screen and buttons).
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">
<br/>
My DS, when held upside down, the top part just hangs loose instead of staying together!</span></span></span>
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j93/chad120/NDS.jpg" target="_blank">Picture of my Loose DS</a> (sorry got no camera, had to draw this in paint) ;D
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, on a normal DS, whenever you unfold your DS to play a game, the top part clicks into place, instead of going flat. Then you can - if you want - push it past the click so that it is flat. (if you dont understand, then try it on your DS, unfold it, and listen for a click)
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">My DS doesn't have that click. it just goes straight into flat mode. I dont like that at all!</span></span></span>
<br/>
<br/>
----
<br/>
<br/>
So my main question is...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What inside of the DS Shell, makes the top tight, and click?</span>
<br/>
I can open up the top part of the DS and tighten something if needed, I just don't know what it is im supposed to tighten.
<br/>
<br/>
Please help!!! :D<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Btw was it the shell that says Ninetudo DS Shell? I have plenty of them and I hope I don't have that problem..<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This annoyed me so much when i got my shell replacement!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
See that part sticking out about a millimeter (on the achsis that the DS folds)? Apply pressure to get it to hide again. This is of course speaking about the original shell, no idea if the replacement works the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i can try to do that, but i have no luck taking out the piece that is missing in that picture to expose that hinge
<br/>
<br/>
I don't wan't to damage it.
<br/>
<br/>
what is a safe way of doing it? Do I have to remove the ribbon cable?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
i got it out, and that is not the problem... it is in there nice and tight, same as the other hinge on the other side<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by thundrestrike on Sat Jun 03, 2006 4:23 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">replacement is exactly the same as the normal shell (except parts around the L+R werent cut right for me :( so i just used the original back)
<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend taking out the DS board itself while doing this as it's really hard to get in!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
