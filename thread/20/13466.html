    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a DS Lite, with R4 (kernel 1.09) and moonshell 1.71
<br/>
<br/>
Using DPGtools 1.3 I encoded a normal avi to DPG, the result video is 15 fps, but when I try to play it (pressing A key) the DSL hangs up and I have to power off and turn it on again.
<br/>
<br/>
What is wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx in advance,
<br/>
<br/>
Korre
<br/>
<br/>
PS: DPGplayer in PC shows me the movie fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could suggest retrying to encode the video with SUPER. A copy/paste of what I responded to something nearly similar on another forum:
<br/>
<br/>
[...] <a class="postlink" href="http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html" target="_blank">SUPER</a> which so far have been the best encoder I have met. I explain a bit more on my site but in simple, it offers much option and does everything good and converts not only from/to dpg but from/to a lot of formats. It may take more time than other converters to process but it's the result that count, right?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, note that the download link for super is a bit hard to find, I've been through that.

Three points:
<br/>
*No, the videos are nearly the same
<br/>
*Videos in BatchDPG get bigger than those in SUPER
<br/>
*SUPER encodes videos in much more formats than BatchDPG and that without the need for Avisynth or whatever is needed.

Why not but I've just tried it and you can't seek in DPGPlay to test different parts to see if everything is fine throughout the video.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://ndsdpg.totalh.com/" target="_blank">http://ndsdpg.totalh.com/</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">batchdpg will encode pretty much anything that you have a codec for
<br/>
<br/>
the videos are larger because they are a better quality encode, specifically a much higher framerate
<br/>
<br/>
higher frame rate is really only noticeable if you're doing stuff like TV or Movies.  if you're just doing cartoons/anime, then SUPER does a very decent job
<br/>
<br/>
encode something like stargate/lost/whatever and you'll see a huge difference between super and batchdpg</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wasn't all that specific I guess
<br/>
<br/>
If you use SUPER, and encode a file with the same settings as you would with batchdpg, you'll end up with a much bigger file
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
using the same source vid(a 700mb divx encode of Stargate Atlantis) batchdpg produces a 99mb file at 20fps
<br/>
<br/>
same source vid, to get 20fps SUPER ends up at 140mb
<br/>
<br/>
maybe I'm doing something wrong with SUPER, but for producing high quality DPG (well, as high quality as you can for a DS) I think batchdpg does a better job
<br/>
<br/>
SUPER is a great tool, and just works for a ton of stuff</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
