    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just noticed yesterday that there was some NSMB (for DS) editor around now. I couldn't help myself and collected some <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.be/2013/06/nsmb-editor.html" target="_blank">reverse-engineering thoughts </a> based on how the editor works.

(NB: I haven't investigated yet whether the developers of the editor had themselves made their reverse-engineering on the game public, so maybe it's just blatantly duplicate of information. If that's the case, sorry).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/p/sprite-editor.html" target="_blank"> SEDS: Sprite Edition on DS</a> :: <a class="postlink" href="http://sylvainhb.blogspot.com/search/label/modplayer" target="_blank">modplayer</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
