    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you just swap it over the counter at some idiot game store (where you still have a warranty) you'll probably get away with it. But I reckon if you send it to Nintendo to get it repaired, they will notice.
<br/>
If it's just a damaged one and you want a replacement (under warranty) it'll be fine as N don't refurbish DSes and resell them.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Considering that at least both screens are salvageable I think $20 is hardly a fair price, you can usually find DSes with broken top or bottom screens for a good price, a friend of mine used the bottom screen from one DS and replaced it in another DS that had a broken screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is a safety mechanism for the Nintendo DS. The leds will light up as normal and then change colour for like no more then a quarter of a second.
<br/>
<br/>
As I said this is a safety mechanism which prevents anything from over heating or something. This is usually caused by bridging on the DS Logic Board.
<br/>
<br/>
If the DS worked after the new switch was installed, then he must of messed with something on the logic board. If it didn't then he definately did a bad job putting that DS Switch in place. If I were you, you should of taken the switch back off and see if it worked again...
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the switch is bridging with something on the logic board. Now since you've sent it to Nintendo already. It's a 50/50 chance they will repair it because bridging would never happen unless it is opened. But since you replaced the power switch, it might be a different story as you could say that you pressed the power switch too hard and that caused the bridging.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and another thing, you could of checked the fuses (F1 and F2) to see if one of them are busted. If it was busted then you could of just bridged it with some wire...<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
