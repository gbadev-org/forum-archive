    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wired up a midi port to my DSerial yesterday (for MIDI out), and today downloaded DStar to give it a shot, but it is freezing up once I tap past the intro screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else had this problem / got it working?
<br/>
<br/>
I've emailed collin already about it, just keen to play with my new toy so wanted to see if anyone else had an answer!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
