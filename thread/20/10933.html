    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all,
<br/>
<br/>
DSFTP 2.0 is out! Get it <a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/downloads/dsftp/DSFTP-2.0.zip" target="_blank">here</a> or at its <a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html#donate" target="_blank">homepage</a>!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What is DSFTP?</span>
<br/>
DSFTP is a full-fledged FTP server, with the additional ability to boot .nds files directly from the FTP prompt (currently only tested on SuperCard CF, SD and Lite). It is a stand-alone program that you can use to run a FTP server on your DS. It is also a software component that makes it easy for you to add an FTP server to your own program with a couple lines of code. 
<br/>
<br/>
With this, you can speed up the build process radically, because you can upload the new version of your program to your own running program, and reboot it immediately. This can even be automated via the command line. No swapping of flash cards ever again!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Changes in V2.0</span>
<br/>
o Active mode supported! No more passive-mode only!
<br/>
o "hostname" setting now called "masquerade" for clarification
<br/>
o Log output scrollable via D-Pad
<br/>
o L+R+A creates screenshot (PPM format)
<br/>
o Reference documentation for developers
<br/>
o More bugfixes
<br/>
<br/>
I consider DSFTP feature-complete now. Further improvements will be bugfixes only. If you find any bugs, as always, please send me an email with the complete description of the error, screenshot, logfile and config file.
<br/>
<br/>
If DSFTP is useful for you, I will happily accept <a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html#donate" target="_blank">donations</a>. If you use DSFTP as a developer, I'd appreciate it if you would tell me about your project!
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: My next project is an ebook / RSS reader. Donations will help me with that, too :-)

One thing: DSOrganiser already has a great ebook reader.
<br/>
In order to beat it, you really need to provide something that is yet to be possible in DS mode:
<br/>
Reading and listening to music at the same time.
<br/>
(maybe be using moonshells libs?)
<br/>
<br/>
The GBAMP's built in gba firmware can do this, and it was a really nice feature.

<br/>
I disagree. I don't like DSOrganize's ebook reader at all, which is precisely why I'm writing my own. Reasons: Fixed, non-antialiased sans-serif font, too little text per page, unintuitive scrolling, wrong/non-switchable format... short: it's too little like a book for me to want to read ebooks on it. I think it's quite easy to beat ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
And reading and listening to music at the same time?! 
<br/>
<br/>
a) it's an ebook reader, not a music player.
<br/>
b) I don't think listening to music on the DS is such a great idea. Too little storage, sound quality too bad. What do they make iPods for?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

OK, offense reversed. :-) And "verified" means just that -- somebody tried and reported it working. For SC CF, that was me. You can contribute! Download it and try! As far as the "feature complete" is concerned, I'm writing a FTP server, not a program launcher, so I was referring to that.
<br/>

@MaHe: I'm using REIN's FAT lib, and <span style="font-style: italic">writing</span> to M3 miniSD works well, as many people have reported. <span style="font-style: italic">Booting</span>, OTOH, is unverified.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yes end user was missing - i cant test boot right now because im unable to find a working ftp client - leechftp seems to be missing the first character from each file/directory name - firefox is read only and i dont know how to execute a custom shell command...prolly have to use dos ftp

however - the ftp server often hangs on "aquiring dhcp" and i have to restart it - i even deleted the dhcp entry on my router but didnt help so far seems to be an issue with my router now cause the wifi_test_lib.nds has the very same problem</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i would but after 10 unsuccessful tries to start up dsftp again and also using wifi_test_lib im at a loss - i dont know what the problem could be that i no longer can aquire DHCP

the wifi site only says

Problem:
<br/>
Hangs at ASSOCSTATUS_ACQUIRINGDHCP

* your router is denying the lib's DHCP request; I've seen this on a few routers and am looking into it.

Yes. Make sure you've got the right port (no listen statement in the <a href="http://ftp.conf" target="_blank">ftp.conf</a>), try pinging the DS to see if the network is OK, and make sure you have no personal firewall or other things up.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://giesler.biz/~bjoern/en/sw_dsftp.html" target="_blank">DSFTP homepage</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
why don't you create a <a href="http://ftp.conf" target="_blank">ftp.conf</a> file already in the zip file with the right directory?
<br/>
<br/>
Do I need to use the M3 transfert software, or can I just copy/ paste the .nds file to the SD card ?
<br/>
<br/>
is it possible to give a static IP adress , not one taken from DHCP ?
<br/>
<br/>
wich one should I use: .gba ou .gba.nds ?
<br/>
<br/>
thanx.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
