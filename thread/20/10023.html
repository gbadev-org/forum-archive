    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From IGN.com and the Opera website-
<br/>
Opera Software, maker of the web browser of the same name, has announced the Nintendo DS version of its internet-surfing tool will be released in Japan on July 24.
<br/>
<br/>
-Old stuff already known-
<br/>
Initially to be available online only, the software will go for 3,800 yen ($38) and will come with an additional memory expansion pack. North American and European release dates have yet to be announced.
<br/>
<br/>
The Opera browser for the DS lets users log onto the internet. Using the cartridge, you can connect to a network via a HotSpot or wireless router, and begin browsing on two screens. With an on-screen keypad and stylus, users can navigate the Web from their DS with PDA-like functionality. The two screens are used for multifunction purposes -- both can show one web page together, or one can show a zoomed-in view of the page. When typing, the bottom screen shows the text being entered while the top shows the webpage you are on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm really interested in importing this thing, but its rather useless for me, to have a japanese only browser. Then I would be stubbon enough to wait for an american release</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thats hopefully what we can do I'm still wondering on how much additional ram it will add to it dont think its been posted anywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the choose your language I doubt that they will have that and only release it in Japan and not even set an American or European date, but then agian you never know it all sorta seems hush hush...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The end of an era :(

(I now refuse to use a homebrew device which does not do some kind of removable storage medium... preferably CF, but I guess MiniSD or Transflash would be acceptable if it opened up Slot-2. Of course, that's just my opinion).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Obviously it will have the ability to visit english websites, so as long as you know which button is "Go To...", "&lt; Back" etc, then you'd be able to use it fine without knowing japanese.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It might be time to actually look into Slot1 development.

At the moment, its working well as it is - but might be time to look for another option.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Dunno, personaly I prefer the pc-like nature of having flash memory over having the extra ram. (emu's, saves..and the whole idea of creating stuff on the DS itself)
<br/>
I dont fancy carrying extra ram and constantly swapping it over to run certain things.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if there was a flash memory solution for Slot-1 then it would be the best of both worlds ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True, but its not a standard as such....we have a situation where different people have different amounts of ram. 
<br/>
If this new one has, say, 10, that will likely mean some homebrew will require 10, others might need more (32), and might need just what the DS is got.
<br/>
I know we already have that situation a bit at the moment, but I wouldnt want it to expand.
<br/>
Its better for the community if the vaste majority of homebrew works on all set ups.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
