I have traced the pins from the DB25 to the passme and all wires are where they should be, also I have to NEW batteries in the holster(3.1V)
<br/>
does it need to be 3.3V??
<br/>
<br/>
Please help if possible. It will be greatly appreciated<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Using a proper male 25-pin connector salvaged from an old computer as well as 2 working AA batteries and the appropriate resistor.
<br/>
Connection to pads on the PassMe looks secure, although it's a bit more tricky than Natrium's to get working because the pads for the JTag cable are little round things.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be wonderful if that error message was a bit more specific.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was getting sooooo pissed, I went and soldered the freakin wires to the passme to make sure they were secure, and I know they are. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am just wondering if something is different with the passme that does NOT have the 45' angle chip.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there something I can do to double check the JTAG connections on the board, like when I have it all connected, is there supposed to be a certain voltage value on the board somewhere???
<br/>
<br/>
Damn things, I hate buying a new thing when I have something I can use now. I even bought a MK2, what good that does me.... it sits in a friggin box.<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway.

If you do a "get device ID" what does it come back with?  Also, are you checking the "erase" box when trying to program?  What version of the iMPACT software are you using?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got all fired up when it wasnt working.

<br/>
well I hooked up the Passme back to my old DS and I am still able to get white screens. so I assume it works fine. 
<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling the wiring is different on the Passme with a non 45" angle CDLP. or is it something else<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My PassMe now appears to be detected (what a relief! These CPLDs must be invincible!), but when I choose to do anything with it (Program, Verify, etc.) I get the following error (and I have no idea what it means since I have a Very beginner knowledge of this stuff):</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">ERROR:iMPACT:583 - '1': The idcode read from the device does not match the idcode in the bsdl File.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
This happens with both passme.jed from Natriums passme-serial and the PassMe download from Darkfader's site, so I'll assume that the problem isn't with the files I've downloaded.
<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas what is going wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xil_ans_display.jsp?iLanguageID=1&amp;getPagePath=13529&amp;BV_SessionID=@@@@1336187036.1150773636@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=cccfaddidjmiiigcefeceihdffhdfjf.0" target="_blank">Hmm... spoke too soon?</a>
<br/>
I guess I'll try those... I'll edit in the idcode in a sec.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A second later:
<br/>
There: 00001111111111111111111111111111
<br/>
Expecting: 00001001011000000100000010010011
<br/>
<br/>
IDcode loop Failed (elapsed time: 3 seconds... a good omen?)... Chain integrity test not happy and tells me to test everything I could possible test as posted above.
<br/>
<br/>
EEK!
<br/>
Oh well, It's comforting that they haven't yet told me "your device is dead, y`idiot... Go back to your cave!" ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess the problem could be the cable's connection to the contacts on the passme.
<br/>
How much do I have to worry about making contact with Lynx's passmes?
<br/>
Right now I have wires passing through the appropriate holes that look like they are touching the metal bits and have tape on them. Is there metal all the way through (ie: Operation) or should I be a bit more precise with this and solder the wires in?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

<br/>
<br/>
I had similar problems with the upgrade at first, but when I double-checked the wires, one of them had been jerked out by the weight of my battery pack. Once I soldered it back in, it worked on the first attempt.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd definitely check your wiring and try it again. Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
