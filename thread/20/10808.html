    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I figure a thread where people can post their ideas for ports of old PC software to the DS would be nice. If you can follow my format when posting, that would be nice too...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> X-Com: UFO Defence
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> Hell yes!
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> One of the best games ever made and one that provides endless hours of fun. Plus, a touchscreen interface would be a great bonus.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> UFO2000, the mutliplayer open-source UFO project would be a good place, as it has all the info for opening and editing the UFO data files.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> TIE Fighter
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> Yes
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> A good space-sim is just what we need, and TF is one of the best...
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> A lot of editing tools were released for TF. Their authors would probably be a good source of info...
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> Darklands
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> Possibly
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> A classic RPG with a very open scope.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> That is the question. Darklands is a very very old game and I've never seen much in the way of tools for it. Technically, a port would be possible, but unraveling the data files might not be so easy.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> Civilisation
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> Yes
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> A classic TBS game that most people have played at some point...
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> A number of Civ ports to Linux have been done, so they would probably be a good place to start looking...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone else got any great port ideas...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

But doing a remake of Micro would be sweet. Micro was a game on the apple II, where you were trying to cure a patient by driving around in his bloodstream in a miniaturized submarine - removing tumors with a laser, using electrical shocks to stop the heart so that you can pass through the chamber unharmed and releasing medicine if needed. Very good stuff, but I am at a loss of where to find resources for it, as google didn't yield anything.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Fresh games are nice, but they're also a huge investment if you want ton get them to the level of existing games.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when it comes to games like X-Com, and HoMM, the originals really are probably the best place to start.
<br/>
<br/>
Why re-invent the wheel, after all :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I hear what you're saying though. I too would love it if someone put together some crackingly good homebrew project, something to rival the level of the commercial greats that have been released. However, I don't think that's likely to happen any time soon...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well now that we have a port of DOOM for the DS all that is left for me to be content is a port of Duke3D. If memory serves it doesn't require all that much.

<br/>
Hmm...only thing I can think of is the 8 Megs of Ram issue there. Textures could be halved from like what 64x64 to 32x32...ugly. But probably fine for the DS purposes.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd do it myself but, 
<br/>
1. I'm working on an FPS for the PC I want to finish before I die. 
<br/>
2. I just finally got my PassKey so it'll take me some time before I get aquinted with the DS Hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
But then again I already know SDL and I believe there's an SDL Port somewhere so with the DS SDL port it's entirely possible.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll look into it and see how much time it'll take away from my FPS :P give me your thought too so I'm not going on a wild goose chase. In case somebody else is already working on it, (I don't remember hearing anything) or if it would be too annoying for it's own good.
<br/>
<br/>
[UPDATE]
<br/>
Well upon further consideration and research it appears the DS SDL Port is lacking file system and sound. This makes it less cut and dry than I originally thought. I'll keep doing some research and see what I find out.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Palm Tungsten Series can run Duke3D at a pretty nice clip just like the PC version. I believe the Palm uses an ARM Processor similar to the DS's so I don't think it would be too much of a problem. Just the ram issue would be the only thing I can think of.

I recall that Duke3D on a minimum spec machine was not a fun game. It was, in fact, an ugly and poorly performing game :-(

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A similar thread came up on gamesradar a couple of days ago. My replies went something along the lines of...
<br/>
<br/>
Scumm games (Only cause Scumm ds doesnt as yet support my card properly ;) )
<br/>
Lemmings - I feel this was wasted on the psp's inadaqute controlls. (although I havnt played it, the GBA port, although fun is irritating with a d pad imo.)
<br/>
Civ
<br/>
Elite (or something similar with wifi)
<br/>
Sierra point n clicks
<br/>
Command and Conquer
<br/>
'Theme' games maybe.
<br/>
<br/>
These are primarily games that would benifit the controlls of the DS imo.
<br/>
I'm sure there are other games that would be good without the need of the touch screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think AitD would run quite well given the difference in specs.

My own query is that purhapes..one day...we might have a x86 emulator with a dos emulation.

    <h4>#99465 - MechaBouncer - Mon Aug 21, 2006 10:59 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So this can be for any old games, even those that are still licensed? So would that be pretty much making a virtual machine that uses the original game files very much like how SCUMMVM DS works? If that's the case, then here are a few I'd recommend:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> M.U.G.E.N.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> Unknown what the requirements are
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> Fully customizable fighting game. 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> The original source code is not availalble, however <a class="postlink" href="http://openmugen.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">OpenMugen</a> is an open project in C++ and SDL is out to recreate the original engine to support all current features and Internet play. There is also a PSP port of it in the works.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> Descent 1 and 2
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> Should be technically possible (calls for 8MB RAM), but controls may take some work (it was on PlayStation, though)
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> One of the early FPS (sort of) games that allowed for 6 degrees of movement. You fly a small craft through mines filled with out-of-control mining robots that want to kill you. 
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> The source code is freely availalble.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> MechWarrior and possibly MechWarrior 2
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> MW1 should be possible with a DOS emulator as it had minimal hardware requirements (it was ported to the SNES afterall). MW2 would require source code, which I do not believe is available.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> Pilot mechs on missions across various worlds of the Inner Sphere.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> The source is not available, but a basic DOS emulator should be able to run this. It hardly even used sound, so that shouldn't be much of an issue.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> MetalTech: Earth Siege and MetalTech: Battledrome
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> Technically, the requirements for these games are pretty low, however with no source available, they seem less likely.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> More giant robots clashing, but in a different setting. Earth Siege puts humans against hostile AI robots called Cybrids in a battle for survival. Battledrome is more like arena combat with mechs.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> Don't know as Dynamix went under and Vivendi Universal does not have access to the source code archives.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> Wing Commander I, II, and (possibly) III
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> I and II shouldn't be a problem in terms of hardware (was originally ported to SNES if that gives you a clue), but III required at least 8MB of RAM.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> Space flight sim game featuring you against the cat-like Kilrathi. Great games.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> Also not sure as the source is not available. Here's a link to some modifications, though:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.wcrevival.de/hcl/exe_dll/" target="_blank">http://www.wcrevival.de/hcl/exe_dll/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Name:</span> Battlezone, Spectre, other tank games
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Viable:</span> Very
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Summary:</span> Tank in an open field shoots at other tanks while avoiding being shot. Simple fun!
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Where To Start:</span> Okay, these games are simplistic enough that people have written them in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.cyberdyne-systems.co.uk/bz/bzsplash.html" target="_blank">36 hours</a> (in the case of Battlezone). I would suspect it would just be easier to make a clone than to try to port it. There probably is one already that I missed. Online play would be a very nice addition.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm still looking at the Rancidmeat Port for Duke3D to see it's plausability.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still not convinced though of Mech2 or ES for the DS. I mean the controls alone would be a burden for the DS unless we got some Keyboard Peripheral. 
<br/>
<br/>
A VM alone for either of those two would be a pain, I may be mistaken, but I remember searching for info on the file formats used and nothing turned up. :/ for MW2 At least.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, it would be nice to sit on a bench in the park or in class busting some Glitches in an Apoc. Also taking down some Inner Sphere Freebirth Warriors in a nice cozy Timberwolf would be quite enjoyable too. NetMech on NDSWifi would be convenient.
<br/>
<br/>
Open M.U.G.E.N. on the other hand would be great, I still have some DBZ Mugen games that were quite fun.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: gray">The lone Wolf howls, driven by pride he presses on.

    <h4>#99510 - MechaBouncer - Tue Aug 22, 2006 3:12 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Spec-wise, EarthSiege would be easier to accomplish than MW2. It called for 80386/486DX 33MHz, 4MB RAM, and a 256-color VGA graphics card and runs at 320x200 resolution. The screen ratio isn't the greatest, but it's not too far off, either. Controls could also be done as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
D-pad Up: Throttle up
<br/>
D-pad Down: Throttle down
<br/>
D-pad Left: Turn left
<br/>
D-pad Right: Turn right
<br/>
X: Aim up
<br/>
B: Aim down
<br/>
Y: Turn torso left
<br/>
A: Turn torso right
<br/>
L: Fire
<br/>
R: Next target
<br/>
<br/>
This would need to make use of the touch screen to click all the buttons in the cockpit. Although I'm not sure how small all the buttons would be. The other screen can show external camera views of your Herc or your target and perhaps toggle with Select. There's also the HDD that could go up there to show your Nav points and everything. It would make more sense if the bottom screen showed the HDD, but then you lose all the touch screen functionality. I really think it could be made to work.
<br/>
<br/>
As for MW2, yeah, I think that would be pushing it. Although if it can be done on the PS1, then you know it can be done on the DS as the DS has as much or more horsepower as the PS1. MW1 on the other hand seems like it could run on a small DOS emulator, which may be the way it has to go.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In my eyes the idea is not to try and implement an x86 emulator. I don't know how many of you use Dosbox regularly, but in my opinion it's not worth the effort on a DS.

<br/>
Attempting to emulate 386/486 architecture on the DS lies in the same realm of trying to "convert N64 roms to work on the DS" (A topic that came up on the DS Linux forums a long time ago)...

Nah, what I'm talking about is doing proper ports that use the original data files. If a port isn't possible due to the original source not being available, then a clone that uses the original data files is the next option...

<br/>
XCom is fantastic, but my point was, re-writeing games gives you a better result<span style="font-style: italic"> per-game</span>. But each game has to be done on its own.
<br/>
<br/>
But emulating the chip means you get a whole bunch of games without having to specifically do each one.
<br/>
And yes, theres some nice games out there ;)
<br/>
<br/>
So if you just wanted Xcom ,sure, its silly.
<br/>
But what about Xcom and AitD ? What about Xcom, Skyroads, AitD and "Continuum"?  What about Xcom,Skyroads, AitD, Continuum, Alleycat ,Jumpman and Mule? ....
<br/>
(this are all games off the top of my head, haven't actually looked into their specs,they are all fairly low though)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Incidently,as XCom1/2 is turn based, slow emulation is <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> much of an issue ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Either way, imo, emulateing dos+x86 is much more possible then N64 "conversion".
<br/>
Of course the GP2X is much more powerfull, but then, Windows95 requires a lot more then a (low spec) dos.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I haven't used it since it's DOS incarnation, but I think the minimal resolution was 320x240. It's not too much of a drop down to 256x192 and at least it's the same ratio. As for the specs, however, I'm not sure what it requires to run. All I know is that it was ported to the PSP, so there may be some hope.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Summary: Best football manager sim ever - the DS would be ideal in terms of the dual screen setup and using the touch screen would be nice aswell.  Sadly, I'm not sure if something like this would ever be possible.  =(

Viable: Maybe?

Summary: Great little platform game series I have fond memories of playing on my Amstrad CPC 464 and PC.  This wouldn't necessarily have to be a DS port, GBA would do as the touchscreen interface wouldn't really be required.

I'd also like to second suggestions of an X-com port - it was done to a pocket PC I believe, and it really is a fantastic game that'd be ace on the DS.  It'd also be nice to see a program similar to scumm vm that'd let people play the classic Sierra point and clicks like Gabriel Knight, QfG, Space Quest and Police Quest series.  
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I just wish developers like Lucasarts and Sierra in particular would realise how perfect the DS is for their point and click back catalogues and release some compilation carts - I would buy them without a doubt.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The goal probably wouldn't be to port StepMania per se (it crawls on even a PS2, as seen in <span style="font-style: italic">In The Groove</span> which was a straight port of SM) but just to clone it, making another generic dance sim.

    <h4>#101559 - h0t1ce - Wed Sep 06, 2006 2:05 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OOPMan is right in that a port of N64 games are completely out of the question, for many reasons.
<br/>
<br/>
But the way it has been said is maybe on the rough side. I think some people dont have any background in music, graphic design, and programming. Leaving them in the dark on knowing the possibilities of the DS' hardware and the dev kits that is available to the community.
<br/>
<br/>
A reason why N64 games might often be suggested, and I think it has been said before in the thread or forum is: Mario 64 has been put on the DSas well as Mario Kart.
<br/>
<br/>
So people, so we don't go off too far in our dream game ports, you might want to considera few things.
<br/>
<br/>
- How complex is the game? Is it 2D or 3D, does it have a lot of different textures and music. Usually puzzle games are easier to port than a full 3D platformer like Mario 64. Most projects have to be within reach for 1 programmer. Usually homebrew is made by 1 person only. Groups that work well together are rare but possible. But are usually much smaller than lets say a real team working on a commercial game like Mario64. Don't forget that the homebrew creators aren't getting paid either.
<br/>
<br/>
- Licensing (although I might be wrong on OOPMan's vision for this thread licensing would probably be an issue.) Most programmers artists don't want to put effort on a project knowing there are high risks that they will recieve a Cease &amp; Desist letter from the Company owning the license on the game.
<br/>
<br/>
- Take a look at existing homebrew games and use a bit of logic to understand what is possible as games and the quality to expect. Although the latter is not always true since in homebrew we can always expect to be surprised by quality.
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I am giving a little guideline that follows what OOPMan was expecting from this thread, if not, I will simple edit my post on his request.
<br/>
<br/>
I really do hope that some of the suggestions for port get seenby interested programmers and do see the light of day!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hotice has pretty much gotten it right. Maybe I was a little rough, but that's how I tend to be :-)
<br/>
<br/>
The points hotice makes about porting are also important. Listed ports should be do-able. In other words, they should not be technologically problematic.
<br/>
<br/>
The subject of licensing is a little more problematic. In a perfect world, all abandonware would be completely open source and it wouldn't be an issue. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect. Most abandoned games have never been opened. In such cases, a port would be more of a clone that uses the original data files. However, clones of this sort are not always on good legal ground (Remember how Blizzare shut down the Freecraft project a while back?). If you're going to do a clone, then contact the developers and publishers first to find out what the legal stance is. If it's an old game, chances are things will be fine anyway :-)

However, do you really honestly think Nintendo are just going to let you wade in, rip up their N64 games and port them to the DS...

Get real...

Abandonware ports are more viable for the reason that they're abandonware.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Define "abandonware".
<br/>
As far as I know, the rights to most games which are labeled abandonware do still fall under the commercial companies. Abandonware is just a popular term used by people who <span style="font-weight: bold">think</span> games should not be sold at a price after 10 years or so.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Erm, a lot of abandonware is actually abandonware, having only been copy-righted for a period of something like 5-10 years...
<br/>
<br/>
The 50 year period you're thinking about applies to patents, if I recall. And it may only apply in the U.S., although I'm not a fundi on patent law so I'm probably wrong :-)
<br/>
<br/>
As for my personal opinion of abandonware. I think ALL games for ALL platforms should be released fully and at NO cost (Source code, game resources, etc) 5 years after the game was initially released.
<br/>
<br/>
I doubt very many games are still selling meaningful quantities after 5 years, if at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the legality is issue you're raising with respect to this thread and abandonware is a littl off-kilter anyway, seeing as how most abandonware remains closed source, hence any kind of "port" would actually be a game resouce compatible "clone". Those are usually fine, unless you're doing a "clone" of a Blizzard or Lucasarts product, in which case you'll probably be Cease-and-Desisted to an early grave...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

That would be the best way too do it.
<br/>
Have a kinda of character-file which is made from simply BMP's.

Would be fun also to have an online scoreboard showing "your" charecters rank and popularity.

Purhapes even, if you wish, you could share your charecters use out...then the score for that charecter is determained by the average. (kinda like a clan).

Yes, of course, having a website with "Homer Simpson" ranked against "Genghis Karn"

<br/>
C and C++ are programming langauges. PALib is a library written in C or C++ (Not sure which...)
<br/>
<br/>
Look, it's good to have ideas, but if you don't learn how to program first then you're just going to end up disappointing yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd recommend you take a look in the NDS Tutorials thread stickied in the DS Development sub-forum on this site. There's a bunch of links there to tutorials that will help you learn C and C++.
<br/>
<br/>
Once you've learn how to program you can start developing DS homebrew. However, trying to do so without an understanding of C and C++ is kinda like putting the cart before the horse...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

There are some <span style="font-style: italic">official</span> clones for GB and GBC, the GB one is called Tetris Attack (probably due to lack of imaginative names) and the GBC version is Pokemon Puzzle Challenge. It features all the modes of the original SNES verison, and is great to play when you have nothing better to do. I was shocked to find that there is another mode of difficulty that took me 3 months to complete.

It is one of the most addictive game I have ever played on my old Atari ST. There was a sequel/remake called Sentinel returns which is pure crap. The original is the one to look for.

SnezziDS v0.28a emulates it pretty well, although sound tends to sound horrible.  The no-sound version works better.  I think there are a couple of random crashes that happen at certain points of the game, but trying to fix them for v0.28 broke other games, so bubble2k reversed the changes and released v0.28a.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are some <span style="font-style: italic">official</span> clones for GB and GBC, the GB one is called Tetris Attack (probably due to lack of imaginative names) and the GBC version is Pokemon Puzzle Challenge. It features all the modes of the original SNES verison, and is great to play when you have nothing better to do. I was shocked to find that there is another mode of difficulty that took me 3 months to complete.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A serious suggestion: Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, a game where you explore a small randomized area of space and sometimes have encounters or battles - in some ways, very similar to board games (except for the combat) in structure, and games don't last more than 20 minutes max, making it perfect for portable gaming. I am not sure how good the DS can handle SDL (or even the fast combat), but other than that, the gameplay is perfect for the DS, since its mouse-based and uses only one mouse button.

Yes, it is, I think so.
<br/>
<br/>
The advantage for making it GBA version (as well as NDS) is 2 reasons: In case you have GBA but not NDS, or in case somebody does not want to download the DOS file and prefer to run it in the GBA emulator on the computer.
<br/>
<br/>
Is best if someone can make a nearly exact copy (but with adding more functions if you want to!) but if you can't, then don't do so. I don't have time for doing this, and also I don't have compiler for GBA (I only have DS compiler devkitPro)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That was ported to Virtual Boy.

I'm not so sure that the DS has enough buttons for this. Blockout needs 5 move buttons (N, E, S, W, drop) and 6 move buttons (N, E, S, W, left, right). Would using both the buttons and the touch screen be accurate enough for the kind of fast play that players of modern tetromino games are used to (see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-4Mv-Kgqc4" target="_blank">NOV's infamous "Death 800" video</a>)?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Blockout is available on systems with fewer buttons than the DS, like the Genesis and the Lynx, so I'm sure a DS port would work.  I've never played the DOS version, so I don't know what it is about the control scheme that you think wouldn't work on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I think it would work very well this way:
<br/>
<br/>
D-PAD for moving on the X and Y axes
<br/>
X and B for rotating around the X axis
<br/>
Y and A for rotating around the Y axis
<br/>
L and R for rotating around the Z axis
<br/>
<br/>
That only leaves a drop button, which could easily be accomplished with the touchscreen or even the mic.
<br/>
<br/>
All this talk of axes, though, makes me wonder about the possibilities for a DS Motion enabled version.  It'd take some pretty rough contortions to keep looking at the screen while rotating your DS around like that.  Heh.

I think it would work very well this way:
<br/>
<br/>
D-PAD for moving on the X and Y axes
<br/>
X and B for rotating around the X axis
<br/>
Y and A for rotating around the Y axis
<br/>
L and R for rotating around the Z axis
<br/>
<br/>
That only leaves a drop button, which could easily be accomplished with the touchscreen or even the mic.

Like I currenly am with the Doom, Wolfenstein, Decent and now RoTT ports! 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not skilled in anything related to DS programming / porting but figured I'd toss these dream games out there incase someone is looking for something new to attempt I guess. 
<br/>
<br/>
Would these even be possible on the DS hardware? Since they are all slightly similar in gameplay I can only hope.

Quake and other games using the id Tech 2 engine cannot use Lick's RAM Unlocking API due to incompatible copyright licenses.

Why would they need to take the n64 version's code? Why not use the original? Just because the DS is near in power to the N64, doesn't mean the hardware is <span style="font-style: italic">at all</span> similar.

While it couldn't be emultated, the DS could EASILY handle a 1:1 and <a class="postlink" href="http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/8358/killerinstinctdsif1.jpg" target="_blank">better</a> Port.
<br/>

It'd be somewhat ironic if the DS out64'ed the N64.

<br/>
Aviliable for your home in 2008, only on Nintendo DS !
<br/>

With assets converted and partially recreated [sprites, sounds, 3Dobjects] a talented person could get this done in a month or two, perhaps even less. Its a pretty straight forward 6Button beat'em up with image sequences for backgrounds and 'video' after all.
<br/>
<br/>
With tools like <a class="postlink" href="http://mrclick.zophar.net/TilEd/download/HiColEd.zip" target="_blank">these</a>
<br/>
and sounds like <a class="postlink" href="http://killerinstinctonline.net/sound/announcer/KIsounds.zip" target="_blank">those</a>
<br/>
it sure can be damn tempting to start porting
<br/>
<br/>
Arguably a lame game,....but it was so cool in 1993 :P
<br/>
I used to enjoy it for its presentation more than anything.
<br/>
Add Wifi multiplayer and MovieSelection and it might actually be fun.
<br/>
<br/>
However time can be spent better.
<br/>
And with Rare being part of a 'pretty big' company, even a superfine port would probably have to dissappear within days. blimey

I think 'a month or two' is HIGHLY optimistic.  The combo system in Killer Instinct is renowned for being extremely complex.  Besides, the SNES version is pretty much 1:1 (if you ignore the graphics) and that should run on one of the various emulators.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

awww so that means he wont even be releasing the dune port.

it was looking good to.

i wish i could have it lol.
<br/>
he should totally release it though, people could only play it if they had the game. (AND I DO ;]]])

so all he would have to do is make it so you would have like dune2 folder and  you would have to put the files in there.

Rumour has it he doesn't even care that one person is angryyy though, seeing as how he feels he's contributing a lot to the homebrew ds scene already without getting anything for it in return...... the bastard. xD</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Well I'm new (sorda), I haven't recognized any of his work i guess. and i think that RTS4DS is an awesome project idea but, he should release his RTS game and Dune when he's done. if he went through all that work just not to release it.

Also, I believe Mario 64 was actually a total rewrite using mostly the same resources. Case in point: I found the physics felt quite different, and many physics-related glitches exist only in the DS version, and upon doing them the results are quite different than the N64 version. For example, the DS version has a bug that will launch you way up into the air if you hit a fence at a certain angle; at that height, you can move overtop of the invisible walls surrounding the level, fall out of the level, and die. In the N64 version you couldn't pass these walls no matter how high you got, and if you did manage to escape them, the game crashed or you died instantly. Using AR/Gameshark codes you can also see the internals are very different - levels are rearranged (and the DS version has some test levels the N64 version didn't), structures are arranged very differently in memory, and so on, and of course the effects of changing certain things via codes are very different.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
