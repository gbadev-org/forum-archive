    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Firstly: Msys is not crap; it's a wonderful piece of software and we should be very thankful of its existence. (Otherwise, we would have to persuade people to use Linux which is oddly difficult to do).
<br/>
<br/>
If you guys want, you can try starting off with PALib which makes it really easy to start up and compile with a quick look at the instructions. In my opinion it's a nice and encouraging place to start with DS development, though others disagree...
<br/>
<br/>
You'll still need to have DevKitPro and "make" and all that, so I suggest you carefully read the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/setup.shtml" target="_blank">Setting Up Page at devkitpro.org</a>
<br/>
There you can find both a very easy installer/updater program, and a manual method.
<br/>
Most importantly, make sure that the environment variables are set, because they are needed for cmd to find the new commands added by msys as well as for make to know how to compile stuff!
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if any of you dislike the terminal, three tips:
<br/>
-You can drag &amp; drop files / folders to the terminal window to quickly enter their path
<br/>
-Windows's terminal does have tab complete, where you can hit tab to finish what you were typing. It's just about the worst tab completion I've used (DSLinux does better!) but it does work.
<br/>
-The Open Command Window Here powertoy for Windows can make it nice and quick to start up the command window in order to run make. I don't use it because I've had a bad experience with the Virtual Desktop Manager Powertoy (don't even look at that one!) and primarily because I like quick and concise right click menus, but it probably works well. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx" target="_blank">Powertoys are here.</a><br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
