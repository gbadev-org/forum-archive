    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to know if someone has (or can write) a software for dealing with save-file on Pokemon Pearl DS:<ul>
<br/>
<li>Backup pokemons to store more pokemons than fits in one box, and to transfer to someone else with the same software
<br/>
</li><li>Display boxes in report view rather than icon view
<br/>
</li><li>Rename yourself and your pokemons (including punctuation, international, Japanese, and even pokemons that aren't your ID number)
<br/>
</li><li>Backward compatibility with older Pokemon games, including Pokemon Red

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Isn't there a tool for Windows like this called Pokesav?
<br/>
<br/>
But how would such a tool be compatible with Pokemon Red? There aren't any mass-produced GBC copiers. Or did you mean FireRed? In that case, Pearl itself is compatible with that after you've beaten the Elite Four.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Somewhere it says Pokesav is only if running from a flash-cart. But it isn't, so I hope some software can run directly in the Nintendo DS using the original DS game card (but possibly also save-file backup, so if you mess up you can restore the original save-file as well).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded Pokesav and a save-file to test, I changed the name from "ash" to "a*~", when save is pushed the "*~" change to other thing, and used fc to compare, it doesn't use ASCII or Unicode, but it also changed C0FE,C0FF, I tried changing that address manually, and open, it appear correctly, save, fc again and almost the entire file had changed.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's what I am looking for, and I can't find out what it is, even if I search on Google.
