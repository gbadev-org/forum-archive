    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is something that's been bugging me for a while now.  The compatibility for the various homebrew NDS loaders out there all varies so greatly.  They work on some cards and not others.  Why is that?
<br/>
<br/>
Back when I just had a G6 Lite and a Supercard SD, I assumed that it was a DLDI problem since the G6 DLDI was reverse engineered not based on full source from the manufacturer.  But now that I have a CycloDS Evolution and Team Cyclops has released the DLDI driver for it, I find that it's not compatible with any of these loaders either.  Now I also find that Chishm's loader code actually does in work on the G6, too.
<br/>
<br/>
So if it's not a DLDI problem is it because of something else in libfat or is it something else altogether?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone have a database of what loaders work on which cards?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess the loaders are written for certain devices.  Chishm's loader is unique because it works on any card that has DLDI, so it works on pretty much anything.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably (I'm guessing) it's because of the state each device leaves the DS in prior to running the homebrew launcher.  Chishm's loader probably sets everything to the proper state prior to launching, where other loaders may only set a small range of registers prior to loading, and when the homebrew trys to load, and the DS isn't in a "Clean" state, it crashes.  I wounder if MightyMax's loader, if it was DLDI patchable, would work on all devices, I know he even went to the point of scrubbing the RAM on bootup.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, Chishm's loader doesn't work on the CycloDS Evolution, should it be working?  Does it work on everything else?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: this goes for the version in DSOrganize as well as Chishm's stand-alone version, I don't know if the code is different between them.
