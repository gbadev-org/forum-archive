Of course, it can do anything the Opera webbrowser can do. This means it can view:

<br/>

I hope that both Webbrowsers can atleast this if they are finished:
<br/>
<br/>
- Browsing the Web with Text and Image Support
<br/>
- Being able to downoad Datas while surfing the web (maybe even download datas from sites like Megaupload)
<br/>
- Save Cookies, so we do not have to type our passwords all the time (which *could* bother us ;)  ) 
<br/>
- Featuring Java Script, so we can fill out formulars.
<br/>
<br/>
This is all I could think of for now.
<br/>
<br/>
Flash would be cool to, but I think it won't work... BUT if it WOULD work then it would be AWESOME !

What do you think: Which Webbrowser will get finished earlier:

<br/>
Gnirfleo,
<br/>
<br/>

Java is <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> the same thing as JavaScript. In fact, they have very little in common besides the name. And as far as I know, Opera DS supports no form of Java at all.
<br/>
<br/>
And I am not 100% certain, but I don't think megaupload needs flash at all to download. Some of their ads may be in flash, but I think you can download just with javascript support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If that was true, then every bit of software would be written by one person.  
<br/>
<br/>
It isnt.
<br/>
The extra effort needed to work together is grossly comansated for by the fact you have more people working.
<br/>
<br/>
We are never going to get a webbrowser with people working on their own. They will get so far when interested, then it will fade off into development hell.
<br/>
<br/>
The best option, of course, is for an extreamly simple webbrowser to be created, that allows other people to extend it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nah, Darkfader, I think most of us agree with you...
<br/>
<br/>
They're certainly advertising the gates of heaven, that's for sure. Whether they deliver is unsure...
<br/>
<br/>
With regards to the team thing, I think it depends on the project at hand.
<br/>
<br/>
I remember a group work project that we had to do in CSC3 that was actually more of a test of group managment than of coding. The parameters in that case were:
<br/>
<br/>
2 weeks
<br/>
4 people
<br/>
Basic Java app interfacing with Moderately complex SQL stuff
<br/>
<br/>
It quickly became apparent to me that most of the work would go into organising the group and ensuring that the team worked, because the actual coding, etc required could have been done quicker by a single-person.
<br/>
<br/>
The project also illustrated what happens when one person in such a team fails to do their job...
<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, the moral of the story. Adding more people isn't always a good thing but depends a lot on the project at hand...
<br/>
<br/>
But I imagine that this is kinda what you were saying anyway...
<br/>
<br/>
Certainly for a complex web-browser, though, a team of experienced programmers with good organisation is needed. Single-man efforts are unlikely to produce much. Especially on an embedded platform like the DS that does not cushion for sloppy coding...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Its more a question that,imo, its madness to aim so high before even the lowest basics are established. 
<br/>
<br/>
Theres also the very human effect, that once someone shows something working...no mater how badly....it will inspire others to make better versions. Even if its not in the same source-code tree.  This is more psycological then technical, but it seems quite a strong effect to me.
<br/>

<br/>
Also, there was a thread, incidently, discusing the best way to make a kinda of modular browser. That is, one that deals with any "media" seperately from the main browsing.
<br/>
The idea was to give ram-adventages, but it would also be a nice way to split workload, imo.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

On the PC, libfat is already in RAM when the program starts. This has been the case since MS-DOS 1.0. You would have to build the system such that each application itself is a module, loaded after your "operating system" (formatted as a .nds) loads.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

A long time ago, I wrote a program in Basic for the Commadore Plus/4.
<br/>
I wrote a program that would load another program off the tape, but remember the current username and score from the first one.
<br/>
It was just a collection of small games...each seperate programs that just PEEKed into the ram to see that information the last game left for it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thats more or less how i imagined the DS system working, the programs are actualy running alone with full resources of the system. They merely pass controll and information between them.

This seems, imo, to be the most likely way to make a advanced browser on the DS platform.
