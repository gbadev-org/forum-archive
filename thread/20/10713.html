    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone!
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have come to conclusions.....but need answers!
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I have talked to some people who graciously have the same problem as I do. They just can't connect to IRC or AIM programs on their ds because the program freezes at launch. I have done MUCH research of this problem through many boards and aim conversations.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, here is what I use: Max Media Player + Dock
<br/>
<br/>
There is a connection with MMP, because most of the people who freeze at launch use MMP. WifiLib test for most people freeze at "Waiting for Arm7 to init..."
<br/>
<br/>
The conclusion I have come to:
<br/>
<br/>
Their ISN'T anything wrong with using your Official Nitendo USB dongle as a SoftAP (using Waffle's method) because randomly during the night I am able to get DSAIM, SylphIRC, and WifiCHat to work, but this is totally random when it rarely works, so theres nothing wrong with the internet connection. Actually, most internet connections work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The questions I have:
<br/>
<br/>
-When they mean ARM7, do they mean the processor unit in the DS? Does this mean "waiting for ARM7 to init.." means they are waiting for the processor to do something?
<br/>
<br/>
-Why would all DS Wifi homebrew freeze at launch and then work rarely and randomly throughout the day?
<br/>
<br/>
If I could get these questions answered this could fix a lot of problems with MMP users....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
It is 12:30 right now, and AIM, wifichat, wifi lib, everything works!
<br/>
<br/>
I changed my clock to 2:30 am in the DS. Start up datel, doubleclick aim. It freezes at launch.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a bug with Datel and ARM7? It seems the only time it works is between 12am and 12:59am(0:00-0:59). Does this mean Max Media Player can't register after the 60th minute of the new day?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
