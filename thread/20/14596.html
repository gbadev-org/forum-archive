How would sending <span style="font-style: italic">less</span> power to the backlight be <span style="font-style: italic">harder</span> on the battery?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">lowest setting on the DS lite is = to regular DS I believe
<br/>
<br/>
so only reason to do it would be to brighten the screens, and use more battery</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's what I've heard. It's harder because they're already at the lowest setting, so you can only go up.

<br/>
Of course, you can also flicker the backlight. Done fast enough, it just looks dim, you don't notice it actually flickering.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But done too fast, it'll turn off the DS. <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dspowermanagement" target="_blank">GBATEK</a> says that 2500 ARM7 cycles is the minimum, where 6*355 = 2130 cycles make a scanline. So for a fade effect as seen in FlashMe, you might try pulse width modulation against a 120 Hz sawtooth wave, timed from VCOUNT: on at y=0, off at y=f(t), on at y=131, off at y=131 + f(t), where f(t) ranges from 3 to 128 based on time.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
