    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem with flash is that it's designed to deliver a rich experience with less bandwidth. Flash delivers the the stage, actors, and their instructions, your computer then does the rest and puts them to work. The DS might not be powerful enough to handle all this...
<br/>
<br/>
Flash has barely gotten to version 6 on the PocketPC/Smartphone and it's still not as lavish as you might expect. These devices are also powered by procs that can go as high as 700mhz, so I'm not even sure it would be possible on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I figure if Adobe did make one, it would have to be a stand alone application, otherwise the people at Opera would have had flash enabled on the DS browser like they did with the Wii.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it's a matter of "who has the big $$$ to convince Adobe to give him the Flash Lite SDK" -- this is not open source, and Adobe makes lots of money licensing Flash Lite to device manufacturers. (in fact, this is one of their main reasons against going open source)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be extremely hobbled in it's early incarnations, I'm sure, but it's not unthinkable.

Just because you can run a Flash file doesn't mean you can decode FLV files. That requires a little more horsepower than just running a plain old flash animation.
<br/>
<br/>
I also doubt any DS browsers would get much joy out of the Flash used on the internet, as such stuff can be irritatingly laggy even on my development box at work.
<br/>
<br/>
As for games, it kind of reminds me of the whole JavaDS thing. It's cute, but I think that if you *really* want to produce a quality game for the DS you'll need fast access to the hardware, somethig Flash and/or Java would get in the way of mostly...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
