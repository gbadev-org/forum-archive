He won't share, because he is being paid by someone to make a comemrcial cheat device for NDS.
<br/>
<br/>
However, now that it is known that it can be done, I'm sure someone else will figure it out, and hopefully be more willing to share.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

uhh, did you even click the link I posted? it's from Parasyte, the page shows his name very clearly.
<br/>
<br/>
And that link you posted is full of BS...adding 200 losses? I don't think that's even possible to do remotely. Might be possible to add losses to yourself, but I would think that would be something that is checked on the server.

And here's a compiled version: <a href="http://www.natrium42.com/downloads/mktest.ds.gba" target="_blank">http://www.natrium42.com/downloads/mktest.ds.gba</a>
<br/>
<br/>
To use, load mktest.ds.gba on a flashcart, put mario kart in your DS slot along with passme. YOU MUST USE PASSME, not flashme. then turn on your DS, and it should load (maybe take a few extra seconds).
<br/>
Then play some tracks online on WFC, the first few in the list should get replaced with different tracks! (i haven't tested it myself, but others reported it works)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The way it's written now, he just waits for the arm9 mariokart binary to be loaded into RAM,  then patches a couple bytes. However, if you boot with flashme, it messes up the RAM somewhat (in a way that doesn't affect homebrew) but some things are not loaded correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you boot from wifime, obviously it's not going to be loading data from the cart at all.
<br/>
<br/>
The way to fix it, would be to manually load the data off of the cart into RAM yourself, instead of depending on the firmware to do it for you. But this is going to be much more work than simply twiddling a few bytes in RAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It won't work if your *pass* is scrambling the data, i.e. if it's not supported when you run my callfinder.ds.gba. (For example, I noticed that my SuperPass is scrambling and hence it doesn't work.) If that's the case, you could reprogramm your *pass*...

When I tried the loader on my M3-SD, my DS started alternating between blank screens and periodically showing the M3's loading screen.  Parasyte explains:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">The "M3 loading screen" is the firmware, and one of the issues I have with these "fake" flash carts. Natrium's loader must take priority over any other program stored on the flash cart, or it will not work. The loader expects PassMe to hand control over to itself directly. When firmware gets in the way, it screws up any chance of the loader ever working.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Natrium's stated on gscentral that he's not interested in making a loader for the M3 or other such methods, so dead end there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for the "steps" to modding the rom, Parasyte has told me there are no tools for decompressing and recompressing the arm9 executable.  That's something for people with extraordinarilly rocking programming knowledge to do manually, who for whatever reason are either unwilling or unable to program a loader.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">I would suggest you get yourself a decent GBA flash cart and use Natrium's loader. It will be much MUCH less hassle. Extracting the ARM9 executable is completely trivial. If you were to go through with attempting to edit the ROM, you would have to decompress the executable. And on that note, there are no known tools available [to the public] which can do that, apart from emulation. With the decompressed executable, you could apply the patch, but then you would need to recompress the executable (again, no known tools available to the public, and no emulator is able recompress anything). Finally you would have to inject the patched/recompressed executable into the ROM and load it with one of the pirate solutions. 
<br/>
I'd say that's about as step-by-step as you need, because you're currently at a dead end. ;( 
<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, use Natrium's loader.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>MKDS friend code: 459633-596796

<br/>
<br/>
I have the following:
<br/>
<br/>
- Magic Card 256M (a purple transparent GBA cartridge)
<br/>
- PassMe (It's not Natrium's passme, it is just a black device with the word "PASSME" with an oval surrounding it on the front)
<br/>
- Mario Kart DS (USA Version)
<br/>
- My DS is old firmware
<br/>
- Flashme_Stealth installed (when using passme I press select to bypass flashme)
<br/>
<br/>
I have tested the natrium's callfinder app with passme/MKDS and get some text, which I suppose it means the passme is compatible, isn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
But when I try to load the mktest app with passme/MKDS, the screens just stay blank and Mkds never loads.

Hope someone can help me

hehe, I got the tools, and you don't need to recompress it. You don't even need to decompress it. I have a patch that can run from a GBAMP, but it requires a ROM dump (and the original cartridge), so it won't be released. You know, encouraging piracy and all that.
<br/>
<br/>
But for those who want to do it themselves, here are the steps (purposely vague, so only bother if you know what you are doing):
<br/>
1) Dump yourself a copy of the game. This is legal, downloading it is not.
<br/>
2) Find a gap in the ROM, close to the start. Insert your patching code there. 
<br/>
3) Find the branch address to the main game. It will be 02003000, located at around 0x4918 in the file.
<br/>
4)Change this to point to your patch code.
<br/>
5) At the end of the patch code, bx back to 02003000 to start the game.
<br/>
6) Start the game from a flash cart or M3 or SC SD. Do not patch it any further. You will still need the original game to run it. It won't work from a GBAMP, since it won't load commercial ROMs.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

But surely if you need the original cart i can't encourage be piracy?
<br/>
The aim of piracy is that you don't need to purchase the original media to play or use a key or anything.
<br/>
If you need the original cart you can dump the rom legally using that tool that's around somewhere (dumps to GBAMP's CF i think) like that.
<br/>
Surely that wouldn't be piracy?
<br/>
Unless of course you mean that people might work you patch into something that allows the GBAMP to run commercial roms, which would be bad...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well all the methods used to dump a ROM require a GBA flash cart (not a GBAMP). So if someone can dump the ROM themself (to make it legal), then they can also play it without the original cartridge (using a patch). But I suppose people would pirate without the patch anyway, so I am being a bit too cautious.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, the online track patch can also help to at least start commercial ROMs (since it must defeat the firmware's lack of commercial ROM support). I guess this is kind of a moot point, because it is difficult to pirate using the GBAMP, unless you really know what you're doing.
<br/>
<br/>
I am working around needing the ROM dump but it is taking some time because people won't share. I guess I could post the IPS in the mean time...

    <h4>#64725 - Hypershell - Mon Dec 26, 2005 1:40 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wiping?  None.  With the exception of saved data, a DS card can only be read, and not overwritten.  And I can tell you my saved data survived nicely, even though I've been tinkering with the rom looking for a way to modify all 20 tracks (WHICH I DID!).  The worst case scenario is that your game may freeze up if the connection with your PassMe/Key gets loose; in which case, there is no harm done, all you gotta do is turn the game off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, here are the steps to customizing the course list however you want!
<br/>
<br/>
1. Follow Chishm's instructions for creating a modified rom.  You may want to test it online to make sure you got it right before going any further.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Open the modified rom in a hex editor.  Go to 0x00004C34.  The value there should be 0C (which is hex for 12).  This is the number of tracks in your customized list.  Change it to 14 (hex for 20).  This will allow you change every course in the WFC track list.
<br/>
<br/>
3. From 0x00004C64 to 0x00004C6F, you should find the string "0C0F111317181A2021232526."  This is the 12 new tracks.  Change them, and the following 8 bytes (up to 0x00004C77) to adjust your track list.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the values for all tracks in the game, along with their internal names (from Parasyte).  Grand Prix courses not normally available are marked with *'s.  Also, I added the menu name for all Grand Prix courses in brackets.  The other courses are either battle arenas or incomplete tracks, I do not recommend trying them as they may crash your game.

AFAIK, It is legal to make 1 copy of a game for backup purposes, as well as reverse engineering, etc. This is sort of a grey area. However, it is completely <span style="font-weight: bold">illegal</span> to distribute that copy, or to download another copy, <span style="font-style: italic">even if you own the game</span>.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Please read <a class="postlink" href="http://www.theesa.com/ip/anti_piracy_faq.php" target="_blank">the ESA's Anti-Piracy FAQ</a> (applies only to the USA). I direct your attention to the question "Isn?t it legal to copy video and computer games as a backup as long as you own a legitimate copy?", in particular, this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>ESA wrote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">U.S. Copyright laws permit making a "backup" copy of computer programs for archival purposes. However, the right to make backup copies of computer programs for archival purposes, as embodied in 17 U.S.C.

Basically it says you can make a backup, but you can't share this backup, nor can you download another person's backup.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

<br/>
Under most "fair" (most european countries and the US) copyright acts it is <span style="font-weight: bold">legal</span> to make a backup copy (although in truth you'd probably archive the original and use the backup because often your right to have a backup is lost if the original media is) as long as you don't break any encryption (breaking encryption is illegal) and provided you do it with <span style="font-weight: bold">your own</span> hardware, using <span style="font-weight: bold">your own</span> copy of the software's media (no borrowing a friends even though all the disks/roms are the same).
<br/>
It <span style="font-weight: bold">is illlegal</span> to transmit or recieve images of media (.iso's or Romz for example) even if you and the recipiant own the original software media.
<br/>
You also aren't allowed to copy the copy.
<br/>
If in doubt check with a lawyer or other legal advisor.

The resulting file from chishm's dumper is 4MB.

<br/>
I assumed it would be possible to trim most of the ROM, but I wasn't sure, so I left it alone because I didn't want to break anything.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've had the hardest time with this.
<br/>
<br/>
But I finally figured it out. I guess a lot of the items disappear because of memory limitations of the DS, which is why those tracks were excluded to be online, maybe?
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, here's what I did:
<br/>
<br/>
I erased any bad dumps that my improper dumping methods created.. making sure only the _BOOT_MP.NDS were on the flash card, and IPS were as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I then allowed it to do it's job. It dumped. It came to the point where it said "reinsert DS card" (chishm, you should make it say, "Please remove, then reinsert DS game card" to clear up confusion. I got majorly confused when I saw this step.. and the readme was so vague)
<br/>
<br/>
It patched, I popped moonshell/mighty max's multiboot menus back in as _BOOT_MP.NDS, then I ran it.
<br/>
<br/>
It white screened for a few seconds, then it booted Mario Kart.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of "Yahoo!" Mario says, "here we go!" (this is exactly what Mario said in the pirated rom of Mario Kart DS.. I wonder why that is? You guys didn't screw with this did you? or does patching the memory make Nintendo know who's stealing MKDS and who isn't?)
<br/>

I still have only 20, but some of the excluded tracks have replaced ones that used to be available.  Well, I can play Shroom Ridge and Bowser's Castle online, so I'm happy.

Anyway, I've noticed that, after I run Chism's dumper/patcher on my MP, the NDS file it creates is always fragmented.  I defrag my flash card and try to run it, but it's a no-go.

<br/>
Could having the dump fragmented cause the patcher to not work correctly?  It's all I can think of, so I'll try to find out on my own!

<br/>
<br/>
I'm a little bit depressed, but ah well, I expected something to go wrong eventually. after using the patch (GBAMP) for quite some time (A month or maybe a bit less?) I booted up my MKDS two days ago, with the patch, and found my game destroyed. saved info, that is. All wifi and other records, and unlocked stuff, were gone. Was back to factory brand new condition.
<br/>
<br/>
A little upsetting, as I said, but, hey. I had backed up a copy of the game about 2 weeks prior to this, however, it had since become corrupt. eek.
<br/>
<br/>
Just leavin' a bit of a feedback for ya'll. Not mad at anyone or anything, just leaving my expereince with it. It still won't stop me from using it again. Sure, I gotta redo all the grand prixs' and ghosts and such, but hey. Something to do. plus, I have a clean record now. :P
<br/>
<br/>
I was using Flashme V5, with the newest GBAMP hacked firmware that works. I jsut updated to flashme v6, today, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It should be looked into. I'll probably be obsessed with this hack once I finally get my hands on that wireless router that I'm planning to buy, so I'll try to confirm it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It would be kind of fun to see the reactions of other players when they find themselves in Tick-Tock Clock, but ah well...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
I was thinking the same thing, MaHe, but since I don't really know how it works I decided to avoid making an imbecile of myself again.
<br/>
So... where has the game card been lately? I've had data clear itself out for no reason in a few older Game Boy games, but only once or twice from games that hadn't been touched for (probably) a year.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You're right, It isn't neccesarrily the patch that messed my cart, but It was the only thing I could think of. It's almost always in my DS, or in my DS case. Nothing else in the room or anything that could damage it. Could have just been a fluke. I too have had games mysteriously delete my data in the past (SNES and GBC days), but I havent had any current generation problems till now. 
<br/>
<br/>
Mine always said "Here we go!" whenever I ran the game with the patch.  I just figured it was always gonna happen, since it was a part of the patch.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I can't think of anyhting else that could have effected the game data's loss, But since I don't know anything about how its storeed and what effects it, it might've been some weird thing I'm not thinking of, however, The game got pretty normal use aside from the patch being ran.

Just white screens. I have tried booting through Moonshell, MightyMax's loader, and as _BOOT_MP.nds

I am running Flashme v6, with hacked GBAMP 2.07. It will boot any official demos.

I tried the full 4MB NDS and the manually trimmed NDS file (consuming 1.41 MB). The actual dumper/patcher seems to work fine; it creates the file that I have to run and dumps it in the root dir of my CF card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Firstly: Oops, I meant 2.04 :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just took a look at the loader file with a hex editor, where perhaps the problem would reveal itself.
<br/>
The file appears to be almost completely empty!
<br/>
Mostly 0s, with a few occasional chunks of the exact same number repeated many times... then back to 0s. There are two exceptions near the beginning which actually have a bit of content (address 16384 to 19567, and 20480 to 24147).
<br/>
The header appears to be completely empty; all 255 up to adress 120, except for four 0s at address 80 to 84 (FAT size?). This is followed by 0s from then on.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried redoing it with a different and empty CF card, but still got the same thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Upon comparing this to a regular NDS file, I see that it is totally different. (Duh).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm not saying that I am in any way knowledgeable about the low-level stuff here, but this looks like a rather tiny amount of real code, and all those 0s tell me that perhaps something rather important is missing.
<br/>
...Especially considering that the header contains nothing... which would cause it to not work, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be willing to email their working patched file to me?'
<br/>
If you want, I can give a proof that I own the game and a promise that I won't distribute the file.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am using GBAMP, now FW 2.11 (used to be 2.04), and fwnitro 1.4A (used to be Flashme 6).
<br/>
My CF cards are both Lexar Media with a Fat32 filesystem. One is 128 MB with 4x speed, the other is 512 MB with 40x speed.
<br/>
<br/>
My attempts have never worked on any of those setups, and they have both given me the same file as described.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Here is the sparse header:

I will only believe that Nintendo is banning people for improving their game if I see some actual reliable evidence. (Perhaps photographics proof).

I get those problems all the time too. I'm assuming you own an actual copy of the game, so you could try just booting that normally. I'm pretty sure it's just because NWC isn't very robust.

<br/>
Actually, the IPS patches the secure area with code that runs and then patches other parts of the game. The reason for this is ... explained below.
<br/>

<br/>
Although caitsith2 wasn't quite right with his reasoning, you still can't do this because the ARM9 binary is compressed. Code in the secure area decompresses it at startup, then jumps to the decompressed code. The IPS track patch patches the secure area to jump to a patcher after the binary is decompressed.
<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all DS games have the same code to decompress themselves a startup, although many don't use it snce they aren't compressed. This leads me to believe it is part of the official startup file (crt0).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

As for Nintendo knowing about the course hack.  I once ran a packet tracer while playing online.

Hey, but here's a thought... if the game is downloading and running encrypted code, Nintendo could add the ability to play all the tracks! Maybe even fixing whatever it was that made them want to hide them in the first place. So who knows?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've been trying a few methods I've found online but, so far I can't get it to work. I must be doing something wrong or maybe it just can't be done with a SuperCard?

That won't work. Putting Mario Kart in the PassMe does work, though if you so much as touch a regular PassMe it can easily lose connection and freeze the game.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems like there are as many ways of doing this as there are types of ds's?
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll just keep having to play with it and keep trying until I figure out what will work for me.
<br/>
<br/>
m2pt5, you said "hacked stub". Could you point me to the one that your using? The one I'm trying is called "mktest.ds.gba" I got it via an email from someone but, it's not doing the job :(
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I'm doing:
<br/>
First, I run it via the root menu of my SuperCard, top screen turns white then black.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, I plug in my mkds&amp;passme1 and turn it off and on again quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
Third, SuperCard root menu comes back up and the ds slot is displayed in the menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, I click the ds slot from the root menu and all I get is the same white then dark screen.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I've been trying to do this as it was explained to me and some of the ways I think that others are doing this... but, I can't get it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I'm getting close, I don't want to have to fork out more cash for another flashCart... please help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have downloaded various files already: MKDS_Hack.nds, ndsmp 2.11 and 2.04, mktest.ds.gba, and MKDS.exe.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not know if these are the files to use, yet it's all I can find for now.

How do I directly launch roms without the game manager?

apparently the newer chishms firmware made this stop working i installed the older but it still isn't working for me - does the older one detect the newer one and not actually do anything or what?

I think this would definatly be useful for the mods that I have been trying to make towards the ROM itself (yes, it's dumped; No illegal action). I have been able to access, and run, BETA courses, which is fairly easy.

<br/>
But my main priority is to change the "stats" of the karts. And to do that, I use a running ROM of the game.

Use the "Unpack" feature of DSLazy on the ROM. Then, Navigate the folder created to \NDS_UNPACK\data\data\courses.
