    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">didnt want to hijack someones topic so i just created a new one...
<br/>
<br/>
i just want to get my suggestions heard and hopefully implimented into moonshell (if i am lucky enough)...these points will refer to moonshell skinning and the images and use of images that are changed in skins for moonshell (just so you know)
<br/>
<br/>
1. completely wrap the box with images.
<br/>
 - you already have an image on the left and top of the box (im refering to the window, specifically the window that is skinned with client.bmp) also the scrollbar images on the right. If you added an image on the right of the scroll bar as well as the bottom of the window then it will be completly wrapped and customizable. this will allow for better skins (not to mention rounded edges on windows)
<br/>
<br/>
maybe turn certain images on and off in skin.ini
<br/>
<br/>
2. all images for skin support transparency
<br/>
 - already transparency is supported, but only for the close button image. If you could just use this same technique in all of the images used in the skin then skins could take on new looks. (again rounded windows, it would even allow for skinners to get rid of certain images completely (say you dont want to use a titlebar -&gt; make it transparent - or just the font on top of a window for a title bar, make everything transparent except font...and lots more!)
<br/>
<br/>
you could even allow transparency to be turned off in skin.ini
<br/>
<br/>
3. all images for skin support opacity
<br/>
 - ive seen the option for certain parts to be "see through" in the skin.ini - or moonshl.ini already, just allow all images to support opacity. this will allow windows to be see through when they are clicked off or on...such as in some windows versions or linux versions...maybe even mac (not sure).
<br/>
<br/>
you could maybe set opacity in skin.ini for images to make it easier and not have to firgure out how to get the images to do them on their own.
<br/>
<br/>
4. set up a menu or button system
<br/>
 - to clarify a bit...im talking about a menu system like on the moonshell version for the supercard dsone (slot one device). This would allow users to change settings right from the gui...and also give skinners another thing to mess with (maybe make it look like an operating system)
<br/>
<br/>
you could possibly turn the menu or button thing on and off and set positition (top botton left right) in skin.ini or moonshl.ini
<br/>
<br/>
5. allow more image extensions in skin besides .bmp (mainly .gif)
<br/>
 - this would allow for animated skins (certainly something that everyone would love). i know moonshell can already view .gif's so im sure it wouldnt be hard to implement into skin. i also havent tested .gif's in skin so im not even sure if it isnt already able to do so
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
does anybody else agree with me on these points ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Go "customise".
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I cant honestly say Im bothered with interface/skin/windowing issues.
<br/>
It dosnt multitask, so Id rather have functional improvements rather then skins or transparancys.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would be cool, but I think it would be better to look to DSOrganiser for that.
<br/>
It has an open plugin system, and already has a wonderswan emulator as a plugin.
<br/>
<br/>
My point about multitasking wasnt a demand really (allthough ebooks+mp3 would be lovely).  I was just thinking its silly having such effort going into a windowing system.....when theres no reason for it anyway :p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Window borders: Yeah, that'd be cool. It seems odd to have custom images on two sides and not the other two.
<br/>
<br/>
Transparency: Could eat a lot of CPU power, depending how the windows are drawn.
<br/>
<br/>
Translucency/opacity: LAAAAAAAAG.
<br/>
<br/>
Built-in config editor: Check the latest version.
<br/>
<br/>
More image types: Don't see why not. Animated skins: LAAAAAAAG, and would probably get annoying.
<br/>
<br/>
Multitasking: Would freaking rule, but as I understand it the code would require massive hacks, if not a total rewrite, to support this. Moonlight released a program specifically to play music and view text files at the same time, though.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the transparency i cant see how it would create lagg...because the feature is already there...the close button is made transparent with full green color - i jsut wish i could do that with the other images so that they could be drawn over one another and not have ugly white or other color blocks (actual rounded edges)
<br/>
<br/>
the opacity thing is already done with thumbnails...so i dont think it would be that hard to do into the gui (again it would be smaller images being used with it)...but it isnt that important so it wouldnt matter - just be cool
<br/>
<br/>
and i know that you can already edit the settings within moonshl.ini and skin.ini...and i didnt mention any BUILT IN config editor...i was saying that you could make the changes i mentioned (translucency, transparency, and others) and allow them to be changed or modified within those .ini's
<br/>
<br/>
also same with .gifs for animated skin...i think people would mostly use small animations such as a 2 picture gif to rotate an image or something...maybe a tiny animation for a background or desktop image. that stuff shouldnt lag behind more (again its not really important, just a nice feature skinners could have)
<br/>
-you could even replace this with if you click an image it should show a different image so it appears to be animated buttons or w/e but it is just swapping pictures (catch my drift)
<br/>
<br/>
with the multitasking thing...i think that the only multitasking needed would be playing .mp3s while doing something else (besides videos), more like looking at pictures, reading text, and i dont think there is anything else you could do :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
The close button is a very small image, and the thumbnails aren't very big either. Unless the windowing system is using one layer per window plus one for the background, transparency and translucency would have to be done manually by the CPU. For transparency this means copying manually and checking for a specific colour. For translucency this means copying manually and doing a few multiplies/divides on each pixel. It'd have to do this every time the GUI is updated, for every pixel.
<br/>
<br/>
Animation means it's going to have to update at least the animated portion of the screen once per frame of the image. If you have a few animations at different frame rates this could easily work out to a few times per second. Consider that this is all potentially while playing music or movies.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The Mediplay-Extend program for the G6 is based on Moonshell 0.9, but does include multitasking--at least for listening to music while viewing pictures or text files.  You get a slight skip in the music whenever you change pages in a text, move to a new picture or even travel from one directory to another in the file browser.  Still pretty cool, though, especially since its text viewer is a lot nicer than regular Moonshell's, so it's really usable for reading long texts.
<br/>
<br/>
In a way it's a shame that DSOrganize and Moonshell have both grown in such a way that they're now competing with each other in a lot of areas.  It's also hard to say which one I'd rather see any given plugin written for since each has its own advantages over the other.  I'm sure it's too late for the code to be merged, but it's too bad that at least the plugins couldn't be made cross-compatible or something.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, they are both massive apps, but as long as one developer dosnt spend time on features the other have got it dosnt mater, imo.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell is more a mediaplayer/viewer
<br/>
(Its unique features; Video Playback, Midi support)
<br/>
<br/>
DSOrganiser is more an editor/file management.
<br/>
(Its unique features;  Ability to move/change/edit files, Download from net, IRC)
<br/>
<br/>
That said, DSOrganiser supports playlists, which Moonshell dosnt.
<br/>
And they both obviously do MP3's and Ebooks.
<br/>
DSOrganisers plugin system seems really good mind,might just be the langerage barrier, but it seems better then moonshell's.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I still use moonshell as my booter (faster GUI to open files).

or off, i dunno if its still like this0 but in moonshell if i was booting a large nds then it would take awhile and during this process the backlight would turn off and stay off even after my nds booted.

<br/>
As for multitasking, i would love to beable to pause my nes game to write something down, or check my email (i realize nesDS has saves, but they sometimes get corrupt and i still have to turn off my DS)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
