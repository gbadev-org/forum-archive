<br/>
It would be a simple webpage browser,but could read the flash format and play videos? Images or no images your choice, and try to make it not use over 4mb?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'd like to see someone knock up any kind of streaming video client for the DS.  I've got a sneaky suspicion that it's probably not going to work too well, due the fact that:
<br/>
<br/>
A. If you have a large video file, it won't need processing as much on the DS CPU, but it'll chew up the wifi bandwidth too much
<br/>
<br/>
B.  If you have a small video file, it'll transfer quick enough but the DS CPU won't have enough horses to decode.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know too many technical reasons... but I'm not sure that its impossible for an FLV player to be done, but either it would not play at full speed, or it would require a genius coder. As far as I know, DPG uses relatively simple/old technology for its compression (MPEG-2?) so it's easier for the DS to decompress. FLV is obviously newer and requires more processing power, and maybe more RAM... as I said I'm not the most enlightened person about these things.
<br/>
<br/>
There was a flash player (not FLV, SWF.) that someone threw together a long time ago, but it played nowhere near to full speed, and obviously it wouldn't have very up-to-date FAT drivers, etc.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

the reason? the always problem of codecs,

flash suxs for videos, too much power is need, i can't even play them smoothly in my old celeron 500 mhz!

<br/>
if a flash video = 5 mb
<br/>
the same video in wmv will need 2 mb and will got much more quality.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">According to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-video.com/" target="_blank">this website</a>, the DS is capable of decoding MPEG-4 video, which is what FLV usually is. I'm not sure what YouTube's video resolution is (I know it's rather poor, but it'll probably be slightly more than 256x192), but with some handwritten assembly and optimal usage of the 2D hardware (the sprite engine lends itself to primitive motion compensation), it should be possible to write an MPEG4/FLV decoder for the DS. You'd just be able to view the video though, not any of the other features the html-embedded flash player on the youtube website offers, though you could probably hard-code the comments system and such to allow basic navigation similar to the website, but without using HTML/Flash (and the system would break anytime YouTube does a backend update).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds better.  Mobile phones can do it..  But lots of mobile phones outpower the DS, sadly. :)
<br/>
Looks like YouTube is converting their library to H.264 for this, which is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, or AVC (for Advanced Video Coding). Wikipedia says the PSP can decode that.. But even a specialized decoder which only took into account the resolution and features used by YouTube to convert their media to H.264 might be much, but I'm no expert.  66MHz ARM9 just sounds like a lot less than 220MHz phones.
<br/>
<br/>
Some googling found this:

<br/>

Maybe if we wanna make a SLOT-2 hardware decoder.  I think those ICs are only like $10 ... Then we can decode it all, muahah!!!  :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

VC-1 (aka MSFT WMV9) is a mutation of MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile (for those wondering about patents, Microsoft is part of the MPE Group, so they can do anything they want with the tech), and those performance numbers listed in that quote seem to match with the fact that games utilising the ActImagine SDK (which is an implementation of the MPEG-4 ASP codec) can decode two full DS screens in real-time (15fps). I think I've already posted earlier in this thread that the DS is capable of decoding full-framerate (24fps) fullscreen MPEG4 ASP videos using Caiman's video codec.
<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, that Caiman person seems to want to sell his (closed-source) codec, but a) he uses homebrew tools, and b) he doesn't appear to be paying the MPEG-LA licencing fees for MPEG-4. Ouch :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
