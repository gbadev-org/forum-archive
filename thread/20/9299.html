    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i highly recommend you use wordpress.com, not blogspot. I've used both (I think I used blogspot to pretty much the full extent of it's ability), and Wordpress.com is much better.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, Wordpress just looks a lot cleaner and quite a few features that would have to be coded manually in blogger are already there in wordpress. Wordpress's themes aren't quite as customizable as blogger, but there really isn't a need for that in wordpress cuz its got so many features to start with.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, you may get annoyed later with blogger because spam in the form of comments gets onto your blog. Wordpress allows you to moderate comments and I believe it's capable of checking those kinds of things itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Wordpress also automatically pings pingomatic.com
<br/>
<br/>
And, don't worry if you do use blogger for a while and decide to move from blogger to wordpress. You can import everything from blogger to wordpress automatically. I haven't tested how well that works though, but it should be fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
