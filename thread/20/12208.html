    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello everybody,
<br/>
<br/>
I just opened a GTA DS Petition Page you can get to if you click on one of the following links:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.grandtheftautodspetition.tk" target="_blank">www.grandtheftautodspetition.tk</a> oder alternativ <a href="http://www.meineseite.zoomshare.com/files/Chose_your_Language.htm" target="_blank">www.meineseite.zoomshare.com/files/Chose_your_Language.htm</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I just made this Topic here to ask for your help (yeah, I know this is a dev Board, but it is the misc section), if you like to help to get progress to this "Project" (Project = Persuade Rockstargames of making a GTA for the DS)
<br/>
you could do one of the following things:
<br/>
<br/>
a) Just give a Sining to the Page (How to is all on the Page) 
<br/>
b) Spread this Site on the Internet as good as possible so all DS Gamer's of the world have a chance to help out too.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this Idea isn't too crazy:
<br/>

The 3D GTA engines have been some of the most inefficient pieces of programing ever conceived. Even the PSP chugs trying to play LCS. You would need a completely different (AKA, skilled) developer to do a whole new engine optimized for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if you could get a decent 3D GTA engine running on the DS, you aren't going to have enough storage to do the game justice in terms of assets.

Is Payback out in the US?
<br/>
<br/>
The team that made payback would be an excelent choice for DS development, imo.
<br/>
Payback had some framerate problems but was amazing on the GBA for the specs. With the DS Im sure they could make a 3D GTA-ish game perfectly.

That's seriously impressive for a gba game however has anyone played Payback on the gp2x? I'm not sure if it's the same team but that version has some very serious framerate issues, even when you overclock up to around 275mhz.

It is the same team, an update was released today for it, oddly enough :)
<br/>
<br/>
The GP2X version is doing some seriously impressive stuff, however.
<br/>
eg.
<br/>
Its doing HDR lighting!
<br/>
<br/>
As long as you dont expect so advanced features, and you base it off the clearly quite amazing gba engine, Im sure a DS version could run nice and smooth.
<br/>
Basicaly, just take the GBA engine, and as you got more clockcycles, ram and cpu, Im sure you could make the textures smoother AND have a higher framerate :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Nintendo dosnt actualy vet stuff that way, its a common myth.
<br/>
Nintendos quality check thingy is purely about bugs. 
<br/>
The fact that so few games with a higher certificate come out on portables is just 
<br/>
a) Publisher bias
<br/>
b) Unless you got a big brand name, higher rated games sale shit.
<br/>
<br/>
It dosnt make sense for a publisher to limit their market to the over 18 crowd, so they dont like developers doing it.

Can't say I agree with that.  I bought GTA so I could do all the stuff in the game that I would never do in real life..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You could also say that about the green blood in some versions of camagedon, or any number of a dozen different things. Green blood censorship is extremely common.
<br/>
Its not a "nintendo" thing, was my point.
<br/>
<br/>
A more recent example:
<br/>
<br/>
The gamecube version of the (terrible) BMX XXX game featured topless girls.
<br/>
The PS2 version had them censored.
<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean Sony has some horrible censorship scheme?
<br/>
Does this mean Nintendo dosnt care?
<br/>
Not really, its all down to publisher.
<br/>
Sure, Nintendo and Sony can vetto stuff, but these days, as in, the last decade, thats unlikely to happen. I dont think theres any recent example of Nintendo censoring anything at all, actualy.
<br/>
Publishers caving into to weird cultural demands is more likely.
<br/>
Also, it comes down the the rateings body for each region.
<br/>
America, for instance, is more sensative to nudity then violence compared to other regions.

Can't say I agree with that. I bought GTA so I could do all the stuff in the game that I would never do in real life.. Ya'know, steal a car, drive over people, do a hooker, shoot heavy weapons, see how many cops I can get after me, etc.. :)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
