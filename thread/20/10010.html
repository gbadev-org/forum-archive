<br/>
<br/>
as for the logo on the top, you'd really only get maybe one or two lines of text by sacrificing it. instead, you might just add some more useful things to the empty space next to the logo, like a signal strength indicator. most wifi homebrew programs don't have one, but if i'm in the middle of a conversation with someone i wanna know if i'm about to loose my signal. you could also add a clock, for instance, or maybe a text alert box that will notify you when someone logs on or off.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the I.T. boxs in pubs (that you can play ds games online for free on) let you use aim on them too if you use the port yahoo messenger uses. so it'd be cool if you could change the port or have the default set to 5050 (i think)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pinesal:  Everything seems to be coming along well.  I'm not making any promises, but I'm hoping to have a version ready by mid July.  I haven't messed around with the latest version of the wifi lib, so I'll prob be adding that in.  Some features still won't be implemented such as blocking a user and maybe getting profiles.  But, I'll add the get profile feature in as soon as I can.
<br/>
<br/>
daninski:  I'm using the TOC protocol for this version.  It's the same protcol used for AIM Express.  I don't know if you are able to use that in the pubs, but if that works, this 'should' work too.  I don't know if you can surf the web there, but if so, this may work too.

For the most part I'm finished with my GUI, its taken me awhile to get it all together so I figure I'd make at least one release with this interface.  Do you have any other screen shots of your GUI?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
It's coming along pretty well.  I'm integrating the AIM code into the GUI now.  I should have a partially working copy released soon.  
<br/>
<br/>
ssj4: The conversations are seperated.  Everytime an IM comes in from a user, the user is placed into a listbox and when selected.  That user's IM is displayed.  Usernames in the listbox colored red when an incoming IM has been received.  Kind of like gaim.  
<br/>
<br/>
Some features that need to still be implemented:
<br/>
<br/>
- Adding buddies to the buddy list
<br/>
- Deleting buddies from the buddy list
<br/>
- Blocking buddies
<br/>
- Getting profiles (the code is in there, just need to see if it works better with the new wifi lib)
<br/>
- AIM Chat
<br/>
<br/>
Pretty basic so far.  You can really only initiate IM conversations with people in your buddy list.  I will add a screen so that the user can specify an SN to send an IM to either before this release or the next release.  I want to get a version out as soon as I can, so I can get some feedback.
<br/>
<br/>
MrD:  I haven't looked at any of the source for Beup or IRCDS yet, I've been basing a lot of the GUI from Bafio's wifi chat.  I'll prob as features from these other programs in the next release.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thats the status so far, and I'll rush to get a version out as fast as I can.

I didn't have time to put in the DHCP yet, so you will need to depend on your firmware settings for connection.

<br/>
sorry for the lack of update.
<br/>
I'm ready for the release, the only problem, is that for some reason I'm not able to get the sign on to work anymore.  And thats pretty critical.  It was working just a week ago, so I'm looking into why it isn't signing on anymore.  I'm away from my dev machine this weekend, but as soon as I get this problem fixed, I'll release a version.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry again,

I don't know just how true this is since my Trillian client works just fine. However, I do remember the earlier days of Trillian, when AIM connectivity required a new patch every week or so.
<br/>

Hopefully you can get this all worked out, I'm sure there are other developers who are having or have had the same problems who may be able to help you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#94640 - Primetime00 - Tue Jul 25, 2006 4:58 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, it seems like everything is back to running normally again!
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to release the first version in a day or two.  For anyone who will test this, here is a set of instruction and features that are not implemented yet.  There is still quite a bit of work left to do, but the user should be able to do the basics.
<br/>
I will revise these instructions every now and then.
<br/>
<br/>
A. Instructions
<br/>
<br/>
1. Login
<br/>
When the program is started, the log in screen *should* appear.  Just type in your username and password.  Just hit the up and down arrows to change from one input field to the other.  Once your info is in, hit the SEND button to log on.
<br/>
The log on status will be displayed as you log on.  First it will connect to your router, then to AIM.  If it cannot connect to your router, the program will freeze (I will fix later.)  If it cannot connect to AIM, it will let you know why and allow you to reinput your sn and password.
<br/>
This version only works with networks that are setup in firmware.  If you have a program to set up network settings (Any commercial wifi game) you should be OK.
<br/>
If login is successful, the log in screen will close.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Buddy List
<br/>
This is pretty simple.  You have a keyboard and a conversation screen.  Nothing can be typed until a buddy is selected from the buddy list or someone else has IMed you.  This brings me to a very important point: YOU MUST HAVE A BUDDY LIST IN AIM TO TALK TO PEOPLE.  This will be fixed later on.  If you log in without a buddy list.  Oh God, I don't know what will happen.
<br/>
To talk to someone you need to select them from your buddy list.
<br/>
-HIT the R trigger to display your buddy list.  The list only displays users that are online.  From there you can select a name using the stylus, and then select the IM button.  The buddylist will close and you buddy's name will be added to the IM list.
<br/>
The buddy list can also be closed by hitting the R trigger a second time.
<br/>
The buddy list can scroll using the scroll bars.  Only the up and down arrows work, there is no slider feature yet.
<br/>
Get Info and Add Buddy are not currently implemented yet.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Current IMs
<br/>
The window on the top left of the bottom screen contains the list of current users you are talking to.  Selecting the user with the stylus will open that person's current conversation.  If an IM is received from a user that is not currently talking to you, the name is added to this list.  A name on the list is printed in red if there are incoming IMs from that user (kinda like gaim.)
<br/>
To delete a conversation from the list, just highlight the user's name and hit the START button.  I might change this to an on screen button, but people may hit the button on accident.
<br/>
The scroll bars here work the same as the buddy list.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Sending IMs
<br/>
Once a user is selected from the conversation list, just type in your IM.
<br/>
The enter button on the keyboard currently drops to the next line.  It does not send the IM.
<br/>
To send an IM, hit the SEND button.
<br/>
You can navigate your current input by using the up, down, left, and right arrows.
<br/>
Currently, the warn and block buttons do NOTHING.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Receiving IMs
<br/>
If a user sends you and IM, he/she will be added to the conversation list.  The IM window will automatically scroll down to the bottom on the conversation unless you have scrolled up through the conversation using the scroll bars on the top right of the bottom screen.
<br/>
These scroll bars work a bit differently.  The up and down arrows do not have to be tapped continuously, just hold the stylus down and the conversation scrolls smoothly.  I'll probably change all the scroll bars to work like this later.
<br/>
<br/>
6. Logging Out
<br/>
Hit the power button (not very graceful, but it will be fixed later)
<br/>
<br/>
B. Gotchas
<br/>
<br/>
1. DSAIM should detect when a user on your buddy list has an alias.  If this alias is pretty long, the IM text could run off the screen a bit.
<br/>
2. If an error occurs, (IM too long, sending messages too fast, etc...) a dialog should pop up informing the user.  Sometimes... this causes the program to freeze.
<br/>
3. Logging in just doesn't work sometimes, power down and try again.
<br/>
4. Make sure you already have a buddy list!
<br/>
5. I think there is currently a limit of 20 conversations at one time.  If you have more than that then you are too popular to use DSAIM.
<br/>
6. If AIM disconnects, I've put in code to let the user know, but that code doesn't work.  So you may not know if you are disconnected *yet*
<br/>
7. The keyboard is fairly accurate, but sometimes it makes mistakes.
<br/>
8. One of my AIM names doesn't log on for some reason.  This might happen to you.
<br/>
<br/>
C. To Do
<br/>
<br/>
1. I'd like to put in emoticons, if someone would like to draw up or send me some emoticons to put in just let me know, that'd be great.
<br/>
2. The program rips the HTML out of all IMs right now.  I'd like to parse at least the font color, so that the text can have different colors.
<br/>
3. Sound would be nice.  But this is very low priority right now.
<br/>
4. DCHP and manual IP settings.
<br/>
5. AP selection.
<br/>
6. Fix current bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
D. Test Setup
<br/>
<br/>
This is what I used to test DSAIM.  I do not know what other equipment will do.  I have no idea at all
<br/>
<br/>
1. Nintendo DS Phat mode
<br/>
2. M3 Adapter (CF version)
<br/>
3. SanDisk Ultra II 1GB
<br/>
<br/>
If you test it and it works, let me know what equipment you use.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, thats about all I can think of for now.  I'll but this stuff in with the release also.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll have the release up in a day or two.  Or tonight if my buddy doesn't play Brain Age all night.
<br/>
Sorry again for the delay.
