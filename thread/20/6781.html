    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The topic pretty much said it all..actually, my main question REALLY is if it's possible to get a Sega CD emulator working for the Nintendo DS.. Especially with the GBAMP.. maybe the music files could be streamed via mp3, the rest of the game can be loaded through an ISO on the compact flash or something..? I dunno, just wondering if it's possible. I think it'd be cool to play Lunar: Eternal Blue on the go..

Thanks for your time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SegaCD may be a little harder, but still possible. The SNES emulator I played for the DS was running at totally full speed and that was more advanced then Genesis. The resolution is going to be an issue, but in a lot of games it wont make a big difference if you lose a few pixels on the side.  Hopefully a good genesis emulator will come out soon so I can play all the sonics and shadowrun (my favorite game) on the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
OT: That new Sonic game for DS with the dual-screen action looks awesome. I will buy it the first day it comes out in japan. ;)

SegaCD would be quite a beast to emulate and I'm pretty darn sure that it isn't possible at full speed.
<br/>
Sega CD's CPU is 12.5Mhz "fast" and has 768kb RAM.
<br/>
SNES for example is 3.58Mhz and 128kb/64kb video RAM.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not even sure if LiraLuna's Genesis emu runs at fullspeed some day.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I could be possible but zubiac, dont compare mhz its only one factor of measuring speed.  The snes emu runs so fast mainly due to it being based on snes advance and so i would imagine loopy is already very familiar with snes emus and arm architecture.  Snes wasnt practical on gba but that didnt stop them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The snes emulator runs so quickly because the cpu cores are hand coded assembly that are optimized about as far as they can be.  The second major bottleneck - graphics, is done at a high level by reinterpreting the snes graphic modes as ds modes, so the hardware does most of the work.  The other big bottleneck, sound, is done on the arm7 so snesds makes pretty full use of the ds hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
To get equivalent speed from a genesis emulator the same type of tricks will need to be used.  In the case of the genesis harware-&gt;ds mapping, the genesis is actually easier to emulate than the snes, so that should be quite possible.  The tough part will be the cpu core.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe LiraNuna's current project, which is a great start, is currently in the port/debug stage.  That's fine, but don't expect blazing speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it is any comparison, I remeber playing Genecyst  (one of the first working genesis emulators) on my way-old Pentium 133Mhz and it ran at almost full speed with sound. In relation, the SNES emulators at the time (ZSNES, I believe) could barely even run at like 3 frames per second. Even though the Genesis was slightly faster than the SNES, it was limited in other ways such as sprite size, pallete, etc. Surely if the DS can run SNES at full speed and produce games like Mario64 (a port of an N64 game). I think it can handle Genesis fine.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As much as MarioDS is the same as the N64 version, it has been completely recoded with new textures and models used, it's not your average port</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only issue regarding resolution would be the 32 horizontal pixels lost at both left and right sides. The vertical resolution could be scaled down in the same fashion PocketNES and other emus on GBA do, by abusing the LCD ghost effect.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
