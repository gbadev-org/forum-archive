    <h4>#80497 - dedtech - Sat Apr 22, 2006 10:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay I have found alot of the information I need to know about he headset port. However, there is just one thing and, I feela bit foolish to have to ask it. what kind of male jack fits into to the port? Im not talking about just the minijack but the microphone/mini jack combo. I see that Datel is making a communicator headset. Interesting as it is I dont want thiers. I want a custom built one, made by me. (I wont bore you with all the details because it is still a work in progress.) However, when I sat down to work out the project I soon found that I couldnt find this style of male adapter on any of the sites like digikey. Then again, I am not really sure what this style of jack is called so Im not really sure what I am looking for. Does anyone know what this adapter is called and where to buy them at??
<br/>
<br/>
Any help appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was afraid of that. Although its more than I wanted to spend, I think I will just buy that datel communicator for $15 and, strip it for its plug. Cheaper than trying to special order them.

Thanks for the info.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious about jamming a nice microphone into that port, but need to figure out if it would actually work before I go around attacking wires.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay I will post how it works out. However, I can tell you this, its finals coming up so its going to be a bit before I can do anything more than draw my schematics. Plus what I am thinking of is kinda involved but it will end up online. Maybe Make or i-hacked website. just depends. I can give you some info I have found so far though. 
<br/>
<br/>
Dang the link wont post for some reason. Seach this site for "headset port" there is a msg posted by Ghettron where Sebbo posts some detailed info about he headset port. If there was a cheap way to get these male headset adapters then the hack would be easy and everyone could have a custom headset. However...... as it stands your best bet is to get the Datel communicator and modify it to your personal tastes. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The person who posted this info said that he was able to get a microphone to work when it was hooked in but it was an ugly hack just to test the theory. Also, when the external microphone is used the internal microphone becomes disabled.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would be interesting to find the specs for the mic port (lol I should just get out a volt meter).
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the frequency range available for input through the mic port?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just wondering about DS IR input/output through the audio ports
<br/>
<br/>
(http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9127&amp;highlight=audio)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pritty sure it would need a frequency doubler on the audio out though.
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not sure on what would need to be done on the input.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wondering thanks :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
