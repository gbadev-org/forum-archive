No .gba, half .nds files don't work

I was really hoping to try out heretic hexen wolf3d, but it seems they won't work on it?

<br/>
Any comments on whats the best overall for homebrew?  If MMP did everything Datel boasted I think it would be, but it falls way short.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is there any way to fix this or load another shell like max overdrive that can run these files?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well since i have the launcher already and I've seen references to using it with GBAMP or something like that, is it possible to just grab one of those and use it for homebrew games and keep the datel drive to do music/movies?  I guess this is what was suggested by dualscreenman, but I don't want to make another purchase and have it not be able to do everything else I want to do with DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Bascailly, I have the max launcher and drive.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to be able to run stuff like DSAIM, DSOrganize, the heretic port and homebrew games.
<br/>
<br/>
Where should I go from here?  I been reading up all afternoon as well and it looks like I'll be spending more money.  I really don't mind as long as it is worthwhile.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sith on Tue Aug 01, 2006 8:54 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

You could just wait until someone makes a loader. It's only a matter of time, since the MMD came out and thats not a bad price at all ($40 for a storage medium and nopass)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But since MMP/MMD are just ripoff's of GBAmp, if we had the proper registers, I think modifying chishm's GBAmp firmware wouldn't be so hard ... would it?<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No it isn't. It's an ATA adapter, and it just looks similar to the GBAMP v2 CF at some level because all ATA adapters would look that same at that level. The GBAMP v2 CF has a 512 KiB firmware chip; MMP/MMD doesn't.

Yes it would. The MMP/MMD <span style="font-weight: bold">doesn't have built-in firmware.</span> It boots from the included MAX Media Launcher. Of course, you could boot custom firmware from a traditional GBA flash cart and then pak-swap to the MMP, but that defeats the purpose, right?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Wouldn't it be possible to auto-run an updated firmware using the MMP DS cart? If you name a file "BOOTME.nds", then the MMP DS cart will boot that file instead of the Max Media Player software. That is how Datel does its updates, so wouldn't something like that be possible?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Changing bootme.nds would be no different from changing _boot_mp.nds on the GBA Movie Player. It would <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> allow you to boot in GBA mode, and it would not allow you to boot from FlashMe unless FlashMe gets updated to treat the MMD like it treats MK2 and MK3.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
