    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm sorry if this is a dupe of previous questions, but I have searched and read a bit, and I want to know if I've understood this correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
I have lost my GBA + flash-cart (yeah I know, I'm clumsy), and I figured it was time to buy a DS Lite instead of a new GBA. My biggest concern is developing GBA stuff (and therefore I want "maximum" GBA compatibility), but I also want to experiment some with the stylus and wifi.
<br/>
<br/>
So here's what I've understood. Please correct anything wrong here :)
<br/>
<br/>
1: To run in GBA mode, a plain flash-cart is the "best" option since SD/CF solutions requires an application to run in multiboot-mode.
<br/>
<br/>
2: To run in DS-mode with interaction to a PC, a SD or CF solution might be preferable since there exists FAT-solutions, featuring a full file system that can be read directly later on on a PC.
<br/>
<br/>
3: The difference between SD and CF solutions are slim and next to none. I assume I would choose the one my laptop has native support for.
<br/>
<br/>
4: On a DS Lite, FlashMe is the neatest solution for running native (non-GBA) applications as it does not add any hardware to your DS Lite. I wouldn't want my DS Lite to become bigger or heavier.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that running original games are a secondary priority. I never played much games, but of course... I wouldn't want to install something that prevented commercial games from working. I am not interested in anything that aids piracy though.
<br/>
<br/>
Another note is that money is "no object", I have a good paying job and this is not something that would rumble my economy anyway. I can pay up for something good, as long as it's actually good ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Some advice would be greatly appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

SuperCard and M3 have 32 MB of RAM to store the running GBA ROM. But one Canadian site (see Retailer Feedback) is selling EFA-Linker 256, a 32 megabyte "plain flash-cart", real cheap.

For GBA homebrew designed to run from ROM and not save to the card, this is true. But any homebrew that needs to write to the card will currently work better on CF than on SD.

Your laptop has "native" support for USB. Everything else is an adapter.

Yes, it will become bigger and heavier. GBA Game Paks and GBA sized flash cards stick out from the Lite. Right now, the only card that doesn't stick out from the Lite is the EZ-Flash IV Lite, which is <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> for DS Lite.

FlashMe does not affect GBA Game Paks, nor does it affect any known DS Game Cards.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Okay, thanks. I guess in case some future roms break with it, I could always take a backup of the original firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Writing to all CF cards works in GBA mode. This is how PocketNES for GBAMP saves the NES SRAM to CF.

This is a library issue, as the SD sector write code in Chishm's FAT driver isn't stable yet.
