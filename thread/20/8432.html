<br/>
setting item added [MikModPlugin]:MaxVoiceCount(The maximum pronunciation number setting)
<br/>
The DMA transfer method was used by mistake. The text plug-in etc. recover.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It works!
<br/>
Thanks a lot :) You're doing a great job!
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone give me directions on how to change things in Moonshell?
<br/>
Right now, I alter global.ini and then run WriteFiles_IMFS.bat... Then I transfer _BOOT_MP.nds over to the CF card. Nothing changes.
<br/>
<br/>
So, obviously, I am doing something wrong :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I still can't get Moonshell working as _BOOT_MP.nds.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
I observed the Implant File System folder via Moonshell. It appears that my changes have been added to the file, but are not being carried out by Moonshell. What I did was change the background colour in the text viewer to ffffff and the text colour in the text viewer to 000000.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I think he replaced GBFS support with support for his enhanced version of Impact Filesystem Called EXFS.  It supports long filenames, which I don't think GBFS did.

I was hoping it would work to allow for themes, I was hoping to create a windows based theme editor for the Global.ini file.

Now, I was changing the colors in Global.ini,  ran WriteFiles_IMFS, loaded the ds.gba to flash and still get old colors???? is that something that cant be changed. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping it would work to allow for themes, I was hoping to create a windows based theme editor for the Global.ini file.
<br/>
<br/>
Then again, would I be breaking some rule????? do I need permission???
<br/>
<br/>
maybe adding that feature to moonshell to allow on the fly changes. Im just not a pink and purple kind of guy ;)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The method of changing me is enumerated.
<br/>
<br/>
Change in background image.
<br/>
<br/>
The BMP file of 256x192x8bpp format is made. (RLE is improper)
<br/>
It is named desktop.bmp and preserves it.
<br/>
It copies it onto files/.shell/desktop.bmp.
<br/>
WriteFiles_IMFS.bat is executed.
<br/>
<br/>
Method of changing color.
<br/>
<br/>
Files/.shell/global.ini is edited with the note pad.
<br/>
The item in the ColorCoordination section is changed.
<br/>
The comment instruction is deleted.
<br/>
WriteFiles_IMFS.bat is executed.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if you change the character color of the text into pink.
<br/>
&gt;;TextViewText=ffffff
<br/>
to.
<br/>
&gt;TextViewText=dcadc2
<br/>
<br/>
The start sound is changed. 
<br/>
<br/>
The mp3 file is prepared, it is named startup.mp3, and preserves it.
<br/>
It copies it onto files/.shell/startup.mp3.
<br/>
WriteFiles_IMFS.bat is executed.
<br/>
<br/>
When WriteFiles_IMFS.bat was executed, the (Japanese?) message dialog was displayed.
<br/>
The situation is an error.
<br/>
Perhaps, capacity is overflow.
<br/>
<br/>
The work log remains in wintools/IMFS_WriteNDS.log.
<br/>
if (ReservedArea&lt;UsedArea) then overflow!
<br/>
<br/>
The error still occurs. 
<br/>
Please send me '_BOOT_MP.nds' that all and you of the 'files/' folder made.

The one it seems I can most reliably get to crash or mess up is Opus.xm.  It seems to happen sometimes when switching between these songs, I got a bit of graphical courruption at the bottom of the file window on the top screen when I got it to crash a few minutes ago, don't know if that helps or not.  Oh, and I'm using MoonShell v06p1 and  using it with the GBAMP, just to be specific.

No. The memory leak is not corrected.

I'm sure it would support the colors (it can display 24-bit color PNGs for example), but you can't go over a certain size with the wallpaper, and one great way to reduce the size is to reduce the amount of color in it...it's not that noticable on the DS's screen anyhow.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good job with all you have done.

Why is it that moonshell ( the app) cant support modified colors and a 16m color wallpaper, but can can have a 16m color wallpaper with original colors. do the colors change the size????</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

ImplantFileSystem detail.
<br/>
<br/>
IMFS reserves only the area of 64kb by the standard. EXFS is variable.
<br/>
FileSystem provides the automatic compression function.
<br/>
BMP doesn't finish usually entering 64kb.
<br/>
However, it enters in many cases when compressing it.
<br/>
<br/>
wintools/IMFS_WriteNDS.log default Background BMP used.
<br/>
&gt;load ZLIB files\.shell\desktop.bmp 50132-&gt;27592byte
<br/>
<br/>
Please adjust it referring to the log.
<br/>
It is capacity that UsedArea actually uses. If this doesn't exceed 64kb, it is safe.
<br/>
<br/>
To build it into NDSROM generally, it becomes complex. sorry.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The method of color coordination is a little complex.

It is necessary to convert the color into 24bitHexValue of Windows.

For example, The title text color of the active window is changed.

Sorry, I should have quoted one of your posts in my reply.
<br/>
<br/>
The crashing must have been caused by me putting MaxVoiceCount into MoonShell's INI file.  I should have checked this sooner...once I took that line out of the INI it stopped crashing.  
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to make you worry...I thought you could put MaxVoiceCount in the INI to limit the amount of voices (I thought it would help more intense MODs to run somewhat better if I limited it, but I must say that this newer version seems to be faster with mods anyway).  
<br/>
<br/>
This is just me screwing up. lol  I guess I misunderstood the MaxVoiceCount thing and thought that it was an option you could change.  So no worries.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Mighty Max recently released the source code for his MPEG player here: <a href="http://mightymax.org/dsmpeg.html" target="_blank">http://mightymax.org/dsmpeg.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It works great, except there's no sound. Perhaps you could try to add sound support to it and integrate it into MoonShell? I am not a programmer, so I don't know how difficult it would be.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry if someone has already asked you this. 
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I think MoonShell is amazing! It's the reason I bought a PassMe. Thank you for your great program!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However, the bug is beside the question.
<br/>
Please report when you find some bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
I am not good at English. When a pertinent file is appended in the report, it is very welcome.
<br/>
(Global.ini is demanded when there is a problem in an environmental setting. The jpeg file is demanded when there is a problem in jpeg. )
<br/>
<br/>
Please always test the bug report with MoonShell(Ver0.6 or Ver0.6+1) of the latest version.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.
<br/>
<br/>
The DMV format of non-lossless is not scheduled to be made.
<br/>
The reason is that it decreases the frame rate.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It depends on the size and structure of the video file. If you use TMPGEnc to encode the video file at 256x192, 24 fps with something like half of the frames B frames, it plays perfectly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Why isnt it possible :?

If the GBAMP can do it, I dont see why Moonshell+GBAMP cant. Just because you access the DS features dosnt mean you lose the ability to use the old chip does it :?

Does it :?

    <h4>#60156 - Joat - Mon Nov 07, 2005 7:48 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It is impossible because of the way the context switch to GBA mode works.  Once you call the ARM7 bios function (which sets the GBA mode bit in HALT_CR), you lose all control of execution, which then proceeds to run the GBA bios, which later boots the game at 0x08000000.
<br/>
<br/>
The way starting a gba file from rom works is that *prior* to the context switch, you bankswitch the flash cart until it has the correct game at 0x08000000 (or in the case of an original game and moonshell loaded over wifi or cart swapped (dunno if this is possible, I've never used moonshell), nothing needs to be done).
<br/>
<br/>
You can't make the DS run GBA code directly from RAM, although you could have a GBA mode program on the flash cart that copies it into RAM.  Thus, you can use the GBA MP to run multiboot bins from RAM just as you normally do (through their menu), but you can't have moonshell (or any other DS program) run the code directly.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

I just ignorantly thought that in DS mode you had access to both chips, and all features, therefor you could do anything the GBA could do.
<br/>
<br/>
~sigh~
<br/>
So simple a feature that rebooted to GBA mode would be do-able from Moonshell?

Just not too any specific game (ie, just to the GBAMP, or whatever is in the slot).

    <h4>#60974 - tssf - Wed Nov 16, 2005 11:28 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hm, I got a couple suggestions for MoonShell again :D
<br/>
<br/>
First thing is, Maybe instead of simply shutting off the backlights to the screens when the lid is closed, the screens AND the lights can be shut off to conserve more power while it pumps out music :)
<br/>
<br/>
Second suggestion is, well..this is an old suggestion. Over-amiplification. I like that idea mostly because of the noise from the outside..or perhaps a waveform normalizer, unfortunately that would cause everything to sound weird, it's just the sound is so inconsistent between some formats and some libraries. MP3 is moderate volume, OGG is low volume, SPC is moderate and loud depending on the game (Lufia 2 is REALLY loud), MODs/ITs/etc are loud.
<br/>
<br/>
Third suggestion: Perhaps have a global output quality setting so everything can be pre-set to a certain quality when you specify 44,100, or 32,000, etc. If the OGG library output at 32,000 rather than 44,100, it would probably have a lot less breakups.
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth: Do away with the ugly PlayControl window, or at least add some real play control buttons.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
[|&lt;&lt; | || | &gt; | [] | &gt;&gt;| | &gt;&gt;]
<br/>
.......||...  [ 123]  [.:.:..:]
<br/>
======||................................
<br/>
<br/>
That's somewhat of an example. My text art sucks but here's the idea of it all:
<br/>
<br/>
First Line: Song Name
<br/>
Second Line: Play last song | Pause | Play | Stop | Play Next Song | Fast Forward
<br/>
Third Line: Volume Control. Would start out at "100%" (about 3/4ths the bar).. the bar higher than 3/4ths would be "over amplification". ... | the "Shuffle"/Randomize/Next/Stop/Repeat button | Graphical "visualization" of the waveform :)
<br/>
Fourth: The typical song progress scrolling, only make the end of the bar have some kind of notch on it so it's easier to drag it along.
<br/>
<br/>
This last suggestion would probably take a lot more work to do. It's probably not feasable, but it'd certainly be a cool addition to a MoonShell v.7 :D
<br/>
<br/>
Fifth Suggestion: Make music keep playing while viewing TXT or JPG/BMP/GIF/PNG files. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Sixth Suggestion: Perhaps better touch screen algorithim would be a neat idea, I don't know if anyone's noticed but draggin things in moonshell is "jerky". It's jittery, it bounces around a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
Seventh Suggestion: Do something cool with that Nintendo DS light! :) Have an analyzer have the light "blink" to the bass of a waveform. :) now THAT would be cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Eighth and final suggestion: PLAYLIST support, this would enable the playing of music in different folders, without having to manually switch to that folder.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway these are just some suggestions to help you out MoonShine, if you want to make MoonShell better. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Why would you want to open War of the Worlds? There's no bookmarking, so if you're on page 1038, you'll have to scroll 1038 pages to get to where you left off. You're better off all-round breaking it up into smaller chunks for the time being.

I do use GBAMP's ebook reader, its pretty nice.

Id just like a nice text-reading app for the DS, so I dont have to switch. (plus, you want all the pixals you can when reading text).

<br/>
Seeing as moonshell was pretty much all the way there with text anyway, I thought it wouldnt be too much to add slightly more ebook-friendly stuff.

It's very fast to navigate the Moonshell's text reader. You can even use the bar on the right with your pen.
<br/>
<br/>
I save the line where I was in a book on my cell phone, and go to that line in a jiffy.

I dont know if this works with the normal version, because I use the modded one, but try this:
<br/>
<br/>
Search for the codec "Microsoft Video 1" this should produce MPEG1 (but i am not 100% sure about this :-/ )
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this really does not produce mpeg try this: <a href="http://www.tmpgenc.net" target="_blank">http://www.tmpgenc.net</a>

This definitely produces mpeg1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you got the codec, GraphEdit should let you convert anything to anything.

I encoded an episode of Enterprise using those settings, it was wide screen, and looked amazing with no frame drops. You start to get frame drops when you use full screen sized video as this makes the DS work harder to decode each frame.
<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering however why he has decided to make the decoder use some sort of strange dithering between frame, makes it look a bit crap.
<br/>
<br/>
As for file size... at this res and bitrate your files should be pretty small. I had two minutes of video in 2.5mb</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I checked the sample files versus one output by the converter with a hex editor, and came to the same conclusion. The sample files have the video data somewhere in the middle of the file, and the ones output by the converter seem to just have it appended on the end. Sticking the video data from another file into the sample didn't work, but I'm no expert at this, so I probably did something wrong.

What version firmware does everyone's have?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm on Chism's latest firmware hack (2.4?), and it is going fine.
<br/>
There's a bug which I assume happens to everyone, with the debug text staying there even after ending the video, but it's all good aside from that. A bit of odd checkers-board-shaped distortion, but it's completely watchable and great quality!

    <h4>#64739 - Plat Sajack - Mon Dec 26, 2005 5:50 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm in shock. I have a full Samurai Champloo episode running very, very smooth. The file it self was 29.9 mb's after the entire conversion process.
<br/>
Before I ran the episode through TMPGenc the episode was roughly 170MB at 640x352 with a data rate of 124kbps XVID @ 23fps. Audio was 127kbps. The running length of the video was 23:19.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the settings I choose while in TMPGEnc were
<br/>
System: Audio+Video
<br/>
Stream Type: MPEG-1 Video
<br/>
Size: 256x144
<br/>
Ratio 1:1
<br/>
Frame Rate 15fps
<br/>
RCM: CBR
<br/>
Bitrate: 160
<br/>
<br/>
This resulted in a 60MB mpeg.Then, after running the encoder by moonlight, 
<br/>
I was rewared with a whopping 29.9 file! Amazing! I was expecting dmv file sizes *shivers at the thought*
<br/>
<br/>
I've read above that people are having trouble using the moonshelltest+dpg release and so was I, all I get are destorted checkers and such so I used the GBAMP dgpTest version released in the other thread in conjunction with GBAMBv2 and it works flawlessly! My intentions are not to spam, but only to pass on some usefull info!

<br/>
Good luck!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I don't think that would be possible, as most mpegs use MP3 compression for the audio stream. Decoding both mpeg video and MP3 audio at the same time would be difficult. That's why the convertor program converts the audio stream to a, I suppose, less heavy-to-decode codec. It leaves the video stream untouched.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Falcon : this new version has a UI and and controls. Thats a big change.
<br/>
<br/>
MPEG files contain mpeg1 video and mp2 or mp1 audio - I've not seen ones with mp3 my self - I *think* its outside of the spec. Thats one reason for the file being DPG format, as the audio is encoded to a very very easy to decode format - as well as small (means less data to handle). Also a standard MPG file would need demuxing in realtime, which can me quite complex and eat valuable proc. time.
<br/>
<br/>
Seeing as you need to re-encode your video anyway for it to work on the player then I don't really see any problem in going the extra step and making a dpg file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hehe ah people always want everything at once. You can have it read mpg files, but you'll lose performance and complain about low frame rates then.
<br/>
<br/>
The *TEST* version is not a full version of moonshell. Its only to test movie playback (although it does read text still).
<br/>
<br/>
The DPGs are as far as I know the RAW mpeg1 video stream and the converted audio stream - not muxed so it save CPU time. I really don't see a problem. Once you've encoded a video at DS size and bit-rate, you wont want to play it on anything else apart from the DS - so what does it matter if its DPG?!
<br/>
<br/>
I would expect soon the movie-player will be part of the full version of moonshell and he'll start doing updates to the whole thing again. This really is a breakthrough for the DS - it means its better than the PSP almost when it comes to homebrew media playback.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It takes like 20min to convert a 30min video on my (aging) eMac 700Mhz G4.
<br/>
<br/>
How long would it take to convert on the DS?

A long time.

heh, I timed a convert last night on my 3800+ x2.
<br/>
<br/>
Converting a 35min video to 22050/15fps/full res timed out to 1:17 (min:sec) system time.  Considering the DS can even barely play this file without skipping...that means my desktop transcode ~30x faster than the DS can decode the end result</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's working perfectly now also with my GBA MP (using a Kingston 512mb CF card --orange one).  All the samples work great.  In the first version my DS just crashed when i ran anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Tried out a litttle sample I made too..but...i messed up on it and it diden't have sound.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
6% faster playing files
<br/>
<br/>
Puts widescreen video in the middle of the screen with black borders

<br/>
one tap/select moves the screen between top and bottom
<br/>
<br/>
the new release is the full version of moonshell now, with support for everything else it always had before
<br/>
<br/>
better GBAMP support (it seems)
<br/>
<br/>
faster skipping (I think, I could be wrong)

I know some one who as a project decided to make an ARM9 optimised version of an MPEG decoder, maybe if I can convince him to release the code it could speed things up more - the current decoder I'm pretty sure is not well optimised for the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#65008 - Durandle - Thu Dec 29, 2005 1:30 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Some one PM'd me about the settings I used for those example videos I posted, and I'm posting what I told them here...  
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------
<br/>
<br/>
Its kinda hit and miss... but the best settings I have used so far are :
<br/>
<br/>
256*168  at  1x1 VGA. I don't use the full DS screen (which is 256*192) as that makes it very hard to produce smooth video. Also not I don't squash the video into that space as that would distort the image, I crop 16pix off the top and 8pix from the bottom. You could use 12pix from top and bottom, but if there are subtitles that may cut into them. Also, my source video is already 256*192 - if yours is not, you may have to play with the settings.
<br/>
<br/>
2 Pass VBR , 130min, 150avg, 160max
<br/>
<br/>
24fps max (choose what ya want, I tend to use the same as the source video if its 24 or less)
<br/>
<br/>
MPEG2 Audio - 32,000hz, 128kb - this gets converted to GSM anyway later so it doesn't really matter too much.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using TMPGEnc 3.0 XPress, which has some filter options. 
<br/>
<br/>
Noise Reduction - helps make flat areas of clolour look smooth - best used for animation.
<br/>
<br/>
Sharpness - if the video has inbuilt subtitles, this helps them stand out a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
Colour Correction - turn up the brightness a bit, the DS screen makes it look quite dark otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
Audio Correction - amp up the volume a bit otherwise its often very quiet.
<br/>
<br/>
--------
<br/>
<br/>
As for the options to use within the filters, your gonna have to work that out for your self, it depends a lot on the source video. For example, noise reduction is a bad idea on normal video (non-animated) as it makes it have a blotchy look. The filter can however aolso reduce file size and increase decoding speed... a tiny bit.
<br/>
<br/>
I have had trouble with TMPGEnc not picking up MP3 audio from AVI files - so I have used virtualdub to re-encode them to 256*192 DivX with PCM audio.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I got it to work by opening the video files in VirtualDub and choosing "Save WAV." Then I chose that file as the source audio in TMPGEnc. Worked like a charm on everything I tried.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I managed to get the entire "Star Wreck - In the Pirkinning" into my CF card for Moonshell, and it's running perfectly!
<br/>
I shrunk the screen down to 256x160 or something like that -- more to fix the stretched image than to make it run better.
<br/>
<br/>
It's actually 160 MB in total, so I had to cut it in half... not bad, though! (And since I almost have a 256 MB card... I'll soon be able to shove a feature film on here if I plan it 3 hours in advance).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
