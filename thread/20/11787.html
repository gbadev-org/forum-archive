    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have so many problems regarding DSOrganize 2.3 and SuperCard 1.70 firmware. SC's upgrade seems to have broke FAT routines or something has changed in the I/O.
<br/>
I can't save anything DSO does or saves, like vcards or scribbles. When i edit any text file, it gets corrupted. I can delete or copy + paste files fine though.
<br/>
I can't bookmark a txt section also.
<br/>
<br/>
I use the blue version. CF SuperCard here.
<br/>
<br/>
And as i am not into coding, i would like kindly to ask if anybody can recompile the source for the last DSOrganize with up to date FATlib and whatnot.
<br/>
<br/>
Other applications work fine, only DSOrganize acts this weird.

I personally think it's extremely stupid to release your source if you don't want people to recompile it, but that's just me...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think we could do with a new PIM-style app now that DSO is dead...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone want to brainstorm on the subject?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I personally am not at all impressed with the QuickWriting implementation in DSO. It's inaccurate and doesn't work well at all.<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

In my opinion recompiling a source code is not "updating the source code" as it doesn't change the source code itself.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I agree too, but its a lot of work, even if DSOrganiser is used as a guide.
<br/>
<br/>
(of course, Id want a modular boot-loader that triggers different apps to open files based on the files extension...personaly, I think this is a better approach then one "do everything" program).<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Something that could load "plugins" and access them would be nice...

That way people could contribute modules as required...

Basically a light-weight framework for loading code modules and running them. Combo it with a threading library and you could even have multiple modules running at once, although that would probably require some work...

If *someone* wasn't jack***, you'd get it. I have a beta of DSOrganize (created by DM himself) that has a plugin interface. DM also 'ported' dualSwan to work as a plugin (which is very cool).
