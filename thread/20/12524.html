Once again, you have shocked and amazed me :D<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thiis is hella awesome, very faithful to the original even if the graphics and sounds are completely different (though still very good). VS Self is very neat, kinda punishing you for making combos while at the same time rewarding you with higher scores. Though it's clearly not Tetris Attack it feels almost exactly the same and retains the same level of addictiveness and fun. A very polished game that comes quite close to professional quality.
<br/>
<br/>
A few cosmetic things are bugging me though:
<br/>
-No sound when you swap blocks.
<br/>
-Nothing unusual occurrs when you clear 3 of the "space invader" blocks (no sound or graphic); a black block just falls and you later wonder where that came from. Those who aren't familliar with Tetris Attack may be quite confused.
<br/>
-No visible indication that the game is paused, and the only way to return to the menu is to finish the game.
<br/>
-Screens, sound, backlights etc are still on when lid is closed.
<br/>
-Top screen is kinda wasted in 1-player mode and should maybe be turned off. Or, make a special mode where you play two boxes at once or one very tall box. :-p Remember this is a handheld, so battery conservation is important.
<br/>
-My Japanese username is garbage in the high score list (not surprisingly).
<br/>
<br/>
Will we be seeing any sort of AI soon? Maybe support for your own graphic/sound files so one could make it look and sound more like the original? A menu option to exit to the card menu?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe it's a feature? :-) Anyway, I'll ask Thomas look at it.

Actually, Thomas tried to implement this, but he ran into some problems with FAT. Unfortunately that code was most likely lost in his hard disk crash, so I think it's unlikely that we will implement this.

We need to make another sound effect for this.

Ah yes, the combo sound effect should be playing or something.

Yeah I know but you only need to raise the stack to end the game, so...

Does anyone have some sample code which covers everything you need to do to enter sleep mode?

You could make some monster chains with a stack like that :-). Unfortunately the upper screen is no touch screen.

<br/>
I should add an option to change the name I guess. Either that or improve my font rendering code. The former seems easier :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh, I didn't even realize this game used the touch screen. I think I'd rather use the buttons though.
<br/>
<br/>
Also how about a sound when garbage blocks fall?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you want to be exactly true to the Tetris Attack game, you need to have a slight delay when blocks are cleared such that blocks directly on top of them do not fall, but any block that is currently falling will drop into place.  right now no matter what my timing is the blocks that are currently falling always stop before they hit the empty space.
<br/>
<br/>
Ex:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
|* &lt; falling
<br/>
|             **
<br/>
|XXX &lt; clearing
<br/>
<br/>
What should happen
<br/>
<br/>
|                  **
<br/>
|* &lt; block fell past stationary blocks
<br/>
<br/>
What happens instead
<br/>
<br/>
***
<br/>
___ &lt; blocks matched up on invisible (cleared) blocks
<br/>
<br/>
There are some examples in the tetris attack puzzles that you can observe if my example doesn't make sense.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
