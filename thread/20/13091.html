<br/>
Not that I don't think this is a bad idea, but isn't your market for this almost too small to exist? To run it on their DS they would need to also purchase the required hardware. I don't know how open the iPhone is but I could see something like this on the PalmOS or Windows Mobile platform...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, but interactive cd are not so fun !
<br/>
For the fact that my market will need the required hardware, it's true but i already found the solution, the NDS emulator, i'll give a link on the website and myspace for people who doesn't own a NDS. The graphist of my label is famous in europe, he works for a lot of companies and diferent clients al over the world. you can see his work in paris subway ads and on the wall of the city. anyway, it would be more than interactive it would be art ! but more than that too ! let me give you all an exemple ok ? and this is why i was talking about Iphone but Dood77 is right, windows mobile and palm os are good platforms too.
<br/>
We can take the exemple of a rock band, marylin manson maybe, imagine you're in the subway or in a bus, you just bought the extension on the web or in a Music shop, you downloaded it to your nds/iphone/palm/mobile with touchscreen, and you discover the album but at the same time, you discover the artwork on the screen, you can use your stylet or finger to browse into the graphic menu and also play mini games for some songs ! and you have an integrated player of course. For marylin manson we can imagine mini games like : you can change is eyes ball, try diferent colors, change the clothes or make up, and in another song you can play to a Nintendogs-like and take care of his snake, give him food, learn some tricks like eating a friend hahaha anyway... its an alternative to the system of collecting 10 000 tracks in a mobile device and you ll never have the visuals, and this is the most important thing, because a records is also a graphic universe, think about famous covers or artwork for Cds or vinyls (Bjork, the residents, iron maiden, funkstorung, aphex twin, unkle, many others and of course my label's record &gt; Tuning (its a 50 page book with a cd and a 7" ) or my last e.p (komori - convul c k)
<br/>
I mean i don't have an Ipod , and on my computer my mp3 seems more and more sad to me. ;) nobody's interested ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem is that there's no lib available for playing MP3s while at the same doing other stuff like minigames.  Static artwork or even simple animation like the old CD+G format should be possible, but I don't know about mini-games, especially if you want the MP3 files to be of a good quality.  Of course, uncompressed audio would work, but then the file(s) would absolutely huge.  Maybe you oculd convince these musicians you're working with to switch to making MOD and XM tracks instead of regular composed music.
<br/>
<br/>
I like your idea, though.  I'm just afraid the DS is not the right platform for it at least not currently.  Palms, mobiles and (hacked) iPods are probably better.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">you mean that you cannot include a mp3 in a mini game ? 
<br/>
XM could be possible but its not the thing i had in mind
<br/>
it has to work with mp3, or ogg or whatever...I m ok that the Ds is maybe not the best platform but i know it could be a simple add on, like one track for beginning (not necesseraly with a player) 
<br/>
I mean for me programming is an art as much as music so if it's a game including an original track from the record + original graphic artwork of the records it would be a nice piece of undeground electro art no ? :) :) :)
<br/>
what are the other handheld gear with touchscreen on the market ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It depends on the quality level you want, for both the music and the game. I was able to put <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/lu/" target="_blank">compressed music in a GBA game</a>, where decoding takes a bit over 50% of the CPU time.
