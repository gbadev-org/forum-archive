Two minutes? Well..  Two minutes?! Well.. TWO MINUTES?!! 
<br/>
<br/>
No comment.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">edit</span> Now to make this topic a bit more interesting: the DS only supports WEP and not the safer WPA. This means, in order to go online with the DS, you have to put your networks security at risk. (Or you can change your WEP key every 2 minutes..)
<br/>
<br/>
How silly is that?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In principle I would agree, however, I'd argue that someone who is interested to compromise YOUR specific network is going to find a way anyway. So for all normal means and purposes, meaning neighbours wanting to use your wireless without your permission, WEP and a list of allowed MAC addresses would still be good enough (for me). For those who think that it's not good enough - yeah, it bites that you can't use the DS online then.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If people are worried about security then buy a dedicated wireless router for the  DS and then block all access from the this router to your secure network.
<br/>
<br/>
People will still be any to borrow your Internet connection but they will not be able to browser your network shares and similar. And when you are not using your DS you can even turn the router off. If the connection appears unreliable then anyone borrowing it will move on.
<br/>
<br/>
You can do the above configuration using the Nintendo USB Wifi stick or similar and Windows.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Quickly cracking WEP is not new..  There is a flaw in the design that allows it.
<br/>
<br/>
WEP is like a lock on a locker.. It keeps the honest people honest.  Someone driving along won't just 'hop' onto your network or peak into your locker.  But, if someone comes along with the intentions of cracking your WiFi, WEP isn't going to stop them.. and if they have bolt cutters with them, a lock isn't either.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if someone could enlighten me. I have a wireless network at home and the only two things I have done (security wise) were to filter mac adresses and not broadcasting the SSID. Is this insecure in anyway?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you
<br/>
<br/>
PS: Most homebrew aplications don't work unless I make the router broadcast the SSID but Nintendo games work anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anything short of WPA or EAP security is unsecure.  I believe using MAC and not broadcasing your SSID is basically the same as using WEP, as neither are secure.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone is going to go through the work of capturing your packets, changing their MAC and getting into your network that way, they will have the WEP cracker as well.
<br/>
<br/>
So, do you need to add WEP?  Not really.  What you are doing has the same effect as WEP.. it's keeps the honest people honest.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a mod (Im not sure if it was firmware or otherwise) that allows you to use WPA, but makes your DS incompatible with WEP. (It's for the EZ4, IIRC)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Having cracked WEP Protected networks and focusing in on this for about 3 days i can say it all depends on what your password is and how complex it is(does it use all letters or does it use symbols too?). also it depends highly on how much traffic is being generated (are you using it a lot?) in any case wifi is never going to be completly secure so don't be stupid and share important files over your network when wifi is enabled.
