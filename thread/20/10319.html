    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">could any of you hardy develpers make a homebrew dictonary for the ds? 
<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know how to develop anything, but I believe it could be relatively simple.  Couldn't you just copy the entire Merriam Websters Dictionary in some text file, and then include some type of search function ?  
<br/>
<br/>
The top screen could be used to view the definition of a word.  The bottom screen could show a search box where you could use the stylus to write in the word.  
<br/>
<br/>
This would be handy for all you office people.  I bet this would be a great app for DS Organize !

    <h4>#92028 - HyperHacker - Tue Jul 11, 2006 5:07 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking about this the other day. I figure the longest word you'd need is maybe 21 characters (you could probably get away with base words; no need to have "buzzing" when you already have "buzz"). If you store an index of words as 21 characters plus a 4-byte file address at which that word's definition resides, you'd be able to do lookups much faster, but the index alone could be a few megabytes. You might get even more speed by having a second index for each letter, telling where in the file the index for words starting with each letter is located. Since the two indexes aren't likely to be more than 16MB, the letter index could be one byte for character and 3 for address. Then compress the entire thing, and you might just fit it onto a memory card. The double-indexing would help fit it all into memory:
<br/>
1) Take the first letter of the word.
<br/>
2) Decompress the index for words starting with that letter into memory.
<br/>
3) Scan the index for the word.
<br/>
4) Decompress its definition and display it.
<br/>
Since the index of words alone could be &gt;4MB, splitting it up into 26 separate indexes might be the only way to fit it into memory.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the source of the definitions... make a bot to download them from dictionary.com?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For searching, the definitions could be assumed to be in alphabetical order... so it could scan with a collection of loops like this pseudo-code:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>

<br/>
Local SearchBoundMin:Int=0
<br/>
Local SearchBoundMax:Int=NumberOfLinesInDictionary
<br/>
Local StepCount:Int=50
<br/>
<br/>
For SearchLength:Int=1 To Len(SearchString)
<br/>
{
<br/>
     ScanString:String=Left(SearchString, SearchLength) //ScanString is SearchLength # of characters from the left of SearchString
<br/>
<br/>
     For ReadLineNumber:Int=SearchBoundMin To SearchBoundMax Step=StepCount //Step is just BASIC-ish code for the amount that ReadLineNumber is incremented each loop
<br/>
     {
<br/>
          CheckWord:String=ReadWordOnLine(ReadLineNumber)
<br/>
          //Some stuff, much like this, which checks the word against the last searched word to see if the other word lies between them. If it does, SearchBoundMax=ReadLineNumber and SearchBoundMin=LastReadLineNumber. StepCount is decreased, by some fancy calculated value based on by how many letters the other words came to equaling the search query... or something like that. Eventually, we wittle our way down to the final answer.
<br/>
     }
<br/>
}
<br/>
Next</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
That pitiful excuse for an example assumes that each line in the dictionary is a new word (which assumes no line breaks in definitions, which would be absurd).
<br/>
Using an Index as per HyperHacker's suggestion could cause such crazy assumptions to be very possible :)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think my example is actually done properly... I just couldn't think of a word for what such an algorithm would be referred to as, so I wrote it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some dictionaries, btw:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dictionary&amp;domains=gutenberg.org&amp;sitesearch=gutenberg.org&amp;btnG=Google+Search" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/search?q=dictionary&amp;domains=gutenberg.org&amp;sitesearch=gutenberg.org&amp;btnG=Google+Search</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking this would best be combined with a fancy plain text reading program, which I may or may not be doing and finishing at an unknown time assuming it even exists, which may or may not be true in the same way that it may or may not be true whether it may or may not include fancy Search functions.
<br/>
(I wonder if that even makes sense...)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

You have the right idea, but scanning for line breaks means reading every byte, which would be slow. The reason I suggested an index and padding words to 21 words is that you can compress the entire thing, then just decompress the index into memory and jump ahead 25 bytes at a time (21 chars + 4-byte address) until you find the word you're looking for.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW I imagine a dictionary would function as a simple spell checker. Even if it doesn't look for variations of the word, at least if you get a definition, you know you spelled it right. :-p<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's actually already a spellchecker out there for the GBA called Scrabble Dictionary, available at <a href="http://pdroms.de/file_details.php?fn=1554" target="_blank">http://pdroms.de/file_details.php?fn=1554</a>

Granted, it's not a full dictionary, just a spellchecker, but it works nonetheless.  On real hardware however, it does tend to recognize a keystroke both when pressing and releasing a button, so you often end up moving two spaces in one direction instead of one or typing double letters where you meant to only type one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
