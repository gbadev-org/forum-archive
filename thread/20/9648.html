    <h4>#84270 - ficedula - Sun May 21, 2006 7:04 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, my new project, SylphAmp - project page is here - <a href="http://www.sylphds.net/ev2/contentview.php?id=462" target="_blank">http://www.sylphds.net/ev2/contentview.php?id=462</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a Winamp plugin that outputs to the DS rather than to the sound card ;)
<br/>
<br/>
To quote from the readme,
<br/>
<br/>
To use:
<br/>
<br/>
-Put the plugin (OUT_SylphAmp.dll) into your WinAmp plugins folder.
<br/>
-Start WinAmp and choose SylphAMP as the output plugin. YOU SHOULD DO THIS BEFORE
<br/>
BOOTING THE DS. 
<br/>
-Boot the NDS in any way you like.
<br/>
-Wait for it to autoconnect to your AP. Hopefully.
<br/>
-The program will prompt you for the IP of your PC. It had better be on the same
<br/>
subnet as the DS or you're stuffed. Change the last IP component by holding down 
<br/>
Up/Down, or holding A/B to change quickly. Press START when you're done.
<br/>
-The DS will now attempt to contact the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
If WinAmp is playing something, hopefully it's now streaming to the DS. Things you can do:
<br/>
<br/>
A = Play
<br/>
B = Pause
<br/>
Left/Right = Change track.
<br/>
X = Stop.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things That Don't Work:
<br/>
Nearly everything. The following things definitely do not work and will cause things to go
<br/>
horribly wrong:
<br/>
<br/>
-Any source audio on the PC that's *not* in 44KHz/16bit/stereo. Most MP3s are going to be OK...
<br/>
-Two DSs trying to connect to the PC at once.
<br/>
-Starting the DS *before* WinAmp is loaded with SylphAMP selected.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The buffering is also horribly hacked up at the moment so stopping the stream doesn't always clear the buffer, and the time display in WinAmp is wrong too. You may miss a few seconds at the end of each song. Before anybody reports it, <span style="font-weight: bold">yes</span> I'm aware of that ;)  It's on the to-look-at list...
<br/>
<br/>
In theory you could stream internet radio but I suspect Dissonance is better for that, since you'd need a PC as a gateway to use SylphAmp. SylphAmp is intended more as a sort of Apple Airport replacement device, you can put the DS audio out to speakers if you want, after all...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The app seems to hang at "Connecting via WFC data." I ran it up once and it got stuck at "Hello World!"

<br/>
All other homebrew apps which don't require SC/SD have been okay for me so far. At the very least, this is the first time I've had trouble finding an access point. My IP is manually configured.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really excited to see this working on my DS! Does anyone have any ideas what the problem could be?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I just tried it another couple of times and it found the AP! This is great stuff...
<br/>
<br/>
About that Left/Right delay thing - it doesn't seem to happen all the time, or even consistantly on the same songs. I wonder what would cause that?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Liquidnumb on Sun May 21, 2006 8:19 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Works pretty good. If I change/pause tracks too quickly, I get the echo problem as well. also, the pause sometimes skips tracks for me. o_O

I can't see that it should give higher volume; two channels at hard-left and hard-right should give the same volume as one centred channel? Besides, it's pretty loud as it is, much louder and I'd be worried about damaging something... ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm, the plugin could use work. The Configure button does nothing and the About dialog explains very little.

<br/>
It works, yay! Desync is BAD though. It desyncs almost immediately and I have a damn fast connection and the DS is about one foot from the router. Volume's perfect though. Using the Stop hotkey on your keyboard instead of pressing X is a bad idea (DS crashes, sorta).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, that's what I mean; it's desynced after about 2 seconds for me. It also tends to skip and repeat a lot, probably when a packet drops. (This happens in my living room, signal strength is about 50% according to other apps.) The echo actually sounds kinda cool though. :-p I do notice that when I have it sitting here next to my computer, it desyncs a bit, but then stays how it is, so even after 4 minutes one channel isn't lagged way behind the other; it sounds the same as it does at the beginning. (I ran it with WMB, BTW. I have both a wireless router and a card used exclusively for WMB. There's a GBAMP plugged in though.)
<br/>
<br/>
IMO what would make this perfect (besides the obvious fixes, and connections from any AP) is not making it an output plugin. As it is now I have to select the plugin in Winamp before I can use it. It'd be nice if it could just always be running when Winamp is, so I can just pull out my DS and connect to it from wherever. If it has to be an output plugin to capture sound output, then there's two methods I can think of to use:
<br/>
1) Make a second general plugin or something that's always loaded, that when it gets a connection request, switches output plugins.
<br/>
2) Make it a 'proxy' plugin; you select it, and within its configuration you select a second output plugin; when it's not streaming to the DS, it passes everything to this second plugin.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW I imagine the ARM7 is doing most of the work. If the ARM9 isn't too busy, it could show some trippy visualizations to go with the music. Maybe the plugin could even send the data needed to generate them, to save the DS some work. (At least there needs to be something on the top screen, or it needs to be turned off.)
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and is the IP supposed to change by 16 when you press A/B? Seems rather arbitrary, like you might have used 0x10 instead of 10.
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing, I highly disagree with saying that stereo isn't necessary. It may not sound great through the speakers, but DS has a headphone jack for a reason. ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be really nice to have some different output options in Winamp. Stereo/Mono 16-bit/8-bit, etc. Lower settings would require less bandwidth (and would be able to buffer more, I assume), which would be nice for when you have low signal strength.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Should have the next version out later this week, maybe tomorrow or Thursday. Things that should be sorted:
<br/>
<br/>
-Reduced delay between PC -&gt; DS
<br/>
-Less screwing up when songs stopped/paused
<br/>
-Basic GUI for current track, etc.
<br/>
-Hopefully less left/right channel desync issues
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for connecting to remote IPs ... like I said on my site, the issue is really that most consumer broadband connections don't have a great upstream; often 256Kbit which really means 240Kbit if you're lucky ... but in theory, there's no reason you couldn't point SylphAmp at a public IP that had the right port forwarded to your PC; for it to be usable, though, first I'd have to make it easier to select the IP/host to connect to, then add some options on the PC side to downsample a bit first.
<br/>
<br/>
Output on the PC - I'm favouring implementing a plugin 'proxy' so you could choose a second output plugin for SylphAmp to forward the audio data to. The alternative would be to output directly to DirectSound or similar myself, but I'd rather avoid that if possible.
<br/>
<br/>
General audio capture on the PC - technically it's obviously possible, but I'm not considering it at this point ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Other Winamp commands - easy to implement, will get done as and when I get around to them.
<br/>
<br/>
Output to two DSs at once - very possible, but not a high priority (I don't, after all, have two DSs myself). Same goes for multicast (don't even know if the wifilib supports that).  (At the moment, incidentally, if you turn off the DS, the PC sits there still trying to transmit to it, but if you start SylphAmp again on the DS and reconnect, it will switch over to your DS's new IP if it changed and start working again).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

-Less garbage playing when pausing/stopping song
<br/>
-Display playlist on DS

-Very basic UI

-Support entering any IP as server to connect to

<br/>
In theory you could connect to your home PC via the internet. In practice I haven't tried this (and until NTL upgrade my broadband next month, I won't have enough upload). You'd need to forward port 9883 from the router to the PC running Winamp; it also needs an absolute minimum of 350Kbit upstream from the PC to the DS to work, preferably a bit more.
<br/>
<br/>
Once I implement options on the PC side to downsample the audio either to 22KHz and/or mono, it'll be more usable on lower speed connections.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This version works way better. No desync at all, sounds just like I were playing the MP3s in Moonshell. It actually stops making noise when I stop the song too. ;-) There's 2 rather nasty UI bugs though:
<br/>
<br/>
1) It doesn't appear to connect. It stays at "SylphAmp Connecting..." until you actually press A, then it downloads the playlist and starts whatever song was selected in Winamp at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
2) It stops playing if you scroll through the list.
<br/>
<br/>
Either way the important thing is it sounds good. Finally I can listen to more than 10 songs outside of my room without headphones. (Good for times when that's not possible, like when I solder things; I'd just end up melting the cord. &gt;_&gt;)
<br/>
<br/>
Why is the executable so big though? Also you forgot to update the readme.

Some things I thought I'd report/mention:
<br/>
- Sometimes it hangs for me at 'Connecting via WFC data' during start-up. This seems to be quite random.
<br/>
- When deleting everything in the Winamp playlist while connected, SylphAMP falls back to the log screen playing the last few seconds over and over.
<br/>
- While testing downstairs, I got occasional audio glitches. I guess this is due to the connection speed, as it doesn't happen when I'm close to the Wi-Fi adapter.
<br/>
- When the Shuffle option is selected in Winamp, the up and down keys aren't really of any use since they just select a random song.
<br/>
- When the IP is already entered, would it be possible for the Left/Right keys to function as a fast way to cycle through the playlist?
<br/>
- What exactly does B do during playback? Whatever it does, it seems quite buggy.
<br/>

It's supposed to pause, but it causes some glitches. If I pause for 10 seconds, it skips about 10 seconds when I resume, and then about a minute later the two sides quickly get about 10 seconds out of sync, which just sounds horrible. It seems to be keeping in perfect sync otherwise though. (Of course right now it's sitting about one foot from the antenna. :-p)
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I found another bug. If you try to scroll through the playlist while the music is stopped, it does go through the list (you can see it on the PC) but the screen doesn't update. Press down a few times and the same song is still selected, but then press A and it jumps to the one that's actually selected.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] Also, I turned off my monitor using <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nirsoft.net" target="_blank">NirCmd</a> and the connection broke. By the looks of it the plugin stopped transmitting. Winamp was still playing, but the DS just kept repeating the last few seconds. It'd be nice if it just stopped when disconnected, and maybe when it connects again it could seek back to around where it was before so you don't miss a bunch of the music.
<br/>
<br/>
Another bug: Sometimes when it connects it shows a blank playlist until you scroll up to the first song.
<br/>
<br/>
[edit again] Actually this seems to happen if the selected song is off the first page. As you scroll up parts of the list will be displayed until eventually the entire list appears. Also, I noticed it's a bit slow to update the list; when you play a song Winamp often changes the title from what's stored in the playlist to whatever format you've specified. The DS client sometimes doesn't update until you've scrolled through a few songs, making it look like the entire list just changed when really it just reformatted the names.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A data rate of 150 kilobytes per second is about right for VCD-quality MPEG-1 video, and given that the DS's screen (256x192) is smaller than a VCD screen (352x240), that makes it even easier.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
A data rate of 150 kilobytes per second is about right for VCD-quality MPEG-1 video, and given that the DS's screen (256x192) is smaller than a VCD screen (352x240), that makes it even easier.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Using MoonShell's DPG format as an example, the highest bitrate its encoder will even allow is around 50 KB/s, including audio. The DS's connection speed definitely wouldn't be a problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The latest moonshell supposedly uses the 32Mbyte of RAM on M3 and Supercard for cache.
<br/>
Could this be a solution?
<br/>
We don't want to use an on CF/SD buffer as that would kill your card very quickly.
<br/>
We might not have enough RAM for a buffer.
<br/>
How about the extra RAM on the Supercard and M3?<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

The point of turning off only the light (much like Moonshell) is so you can use headphones with it and save some battery life, as the lights are one of the biggest draws on the battery.

It does include one or two minor bugfixes, but not many, so if it's not working for you already this probably won't help a lot. Wifi issues, I probably can't do an awful lot about - although if other wifi homebrew works in theory it's probably my fault...

Well, I fixed my problem...god I hate windows sometimes. :D  All I did was change the name of the plug-in's DLL to out_sylph.dll instead of out_sylphamp.dll...why this fixed it, I am not certain, but it's working for me now.  Does this help anyone else?

<br/>
*edit2*
<br/>
Nevermind, screwing up when it tried to load a new playlist must have been a fluke, it worked the second time I tried it.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is the quality the best its going to get?

Secondary: do you plan on creating a standalone server... Id love it to be able to listen to two different songs 1 on DS 1 on workstation
<br/>
without loading two copies of winamp
<br/>
and screwing around with output everytime.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Audio quality is unlikely to change soon - well, except that I'll probably add the option to downsample to 22KHz - I'll mostly be playing about with adding more options in.
<br/>
<br/>
A standalone server would be possible but wasn't on my list of things to do; the plugin is, after all, tied in pretty closely to the way Winamp works. Although anybody else who wanted to could write a 'server' app, since the Winamp input/output plugin APIs are public...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
im getting the error "Winamp has caused an error in OUT_SYLPHAMP&gt;DLL. Winamp will now close." once i open my winamp when the "Out_SylphAmp.dll" file is in my winamp plugins folder. when i take out the "Out_SylphAmp.dll" file, then i can open winamp without any problems. Any idea what could be the matter?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What flashcart are you using?

<br/>
Im using the CF M3 with the newest (v26) firmware.

<br/>
Maybe that has something to do with it...?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">When i add a new playlist in DS side, i can only PLAY it by winamp ittself. START only plays when winamp is already playing.
<br/>
When i use SylphAmp in DS and turn if off, i can't connect again if winamp is still runing. I must turn winamp off and on again, and SylphAmd again after it.
<br/>
Luckly i don't have any plugin or winamp issue.
<br/>
Just adressing the "start playing" part and the no connection bug and it should be my prefered homebrew ever.

<br/>
Great job so far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Naturally if i move too far out  of reception the playback gets messed up but thats no fault of yours (i need better wireless range -_-)

I hope you continue to work on it by improving the streaming or wherever has room for improvement.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Again, it's just a few specific files that are causing problems, which I can just remove from the playlist.  Winamp doesn't freeze when the songs are merely present; only when I try to play the songs does it stop responding.
<br/>
<br/>
Really, the only issue I have is that I've never been able to get the latest release to work correctly, so I've been using v0.03</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
