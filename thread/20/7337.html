It saves the maps in .aws format. I got an idea: is it possible to enter a "Trade Maps" mode with DS (via 2500 Ralink chipset) and send those maps from the computer to DS?

Thanks for answers!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can someone capture the packets? I can send an app to do it (for rt2500)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is not useless; people can download images of the map and then write it to their game (and it might be compatable wtih AW2 (and rarely AW1)).
<br/>
<br/>
If somebody could find the areas of the save that store the map data, and how the map is stored and such; then an application to modify this data could be sent with the map created by the editor.

<br/>
Or were you thinking something different, like the "trade maps" part of AW:DS?  (My brother has the game, but I haven't played it, so I don't know.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Still be cool if you could directly upload to AW:DS, without having to sit and create the map.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is the EXACT purpose.  There is one for AW and AW2, also...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
