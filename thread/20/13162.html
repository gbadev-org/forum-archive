    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, I hope it is OK to post this announcement here as its seems the most appropriate forum on the boards to do so. Feel free to move this post to another forum if necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
This is our 5th year of the GBAX coding competitions and we hope it will be the biggest ever. During the last 5 years we have given away thousands of dollars in prizes, have had over 200 entries submitted, some of which went on to become commercial games, others to be developed into excellent free software.
<br/>
<br/>
Whether you are planning to enter or are just browsing we are sure you will enjoy the competition and testing out the entries in July.
<br/>
<br/>
Expect the weird, the original and the best. GBAX2007: May 7th - July 7th.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: 
<br/>
"- Any software which is fully working on the GP2X, GP32, PSP and DS hardware can be entered; a game, port, demo, emulator or application." -- I guess that means that GBA-entries are allowed after all. My bad, but I still think the rules could mention GBA explicitly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The way I read it, if GBA counts then any platform that has an emulator available would count as well.  Being that you could write an Atari 2600 game and wrap an emulator around it and it would be allowed because it runs on one of the platforms listed?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I guess in theory you could write a Atari 2600 emulator for the DS and then write a game for it. Emulators and games are both allowed so can kill two birds with one stone :) We like stuff that's different from the norm so are looking forward to your emulator and game ;)

Edit - Oh GBA entries are fine, just spoke to Craig and he agrees.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.emuholic.com/" target="_blank">http://www.emuholic.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believe you are thinking of Beup Live and the neoflash competition... but I could be wrong.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah it is probably the neoflash competition, I was a judge in it but the way it  is run was not down to me. I just received the entries and judged them. I have made it clear in the GBAX 2007 rules about this as I was very annoyed that people could do this:
<br/>
<br/>
- Using Open Source and Ports of existing software is allowed but you may want to get permission from the original author to make sure potentially winning a prize is OK.
<br/>
<br/>
I will be checking up on all winning entries to ensure all rules are followed.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.emuholic.com/" target="_blank">http://www.emuholic.com/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

One additional and [b]important note[/b] is that if your entry is over 20MB in file size please get in contact with us beforehand to arrange an upload to our FTP as our email only allows up to 20MB attachments. Alternatively if you have your own web space simply upload it there and let us know the URL.

I havent had a chance to fully check but it looks like we have around 60 entries to the competition which makes this our biggest in our five year history. I would like to say a big thanks to everyone that entered and good luck in the competition.

I really like the look of DSreader however i'm having serious problems with loading bookmarks. unfortunately i can't report it to the dev since he doesn't seem to have a blog or anything.
<br/>
I found someone else who had the same problem.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: found someone else who said filenames shouldn't have any spaces in them otherwise there can be problems. hopefully that solves the problem. gonna test now.
<br/>
<br/>
edit2: removed spaces. still problems.
<br/>
<br/>
put files in root of card, finally worked.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by OSW on Sun Jul 29, 2007 10:48 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are only 3 prizes, so every entry has to compete against entries from all systems.  At least I think that's how it's supposed to go.  It's completely up to the judges though, so they may feel like giving 1st prize to a GP2X entry, 2nd to a DS/GBA entry and 3rd to a PSP entry.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Mon Jul 30, 2007 10:38 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
