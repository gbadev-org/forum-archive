I just loaded it onto the flashcart...are you sure you have the most current version?  That sounds like the bug Super Metroid had a few revisions ago.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does the builder find any special options for super metroid other than sram? is there an asterisk before it in the rom list?
<br/>
<br/>
90% of the time people have this problem, it's because their rom has a bad header, and the builder doesn't automatically find the special options in the superdat that it's meant to. try getting a new rom, preferably one that comes with a bunch of junk at the end like (UE) (!).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
