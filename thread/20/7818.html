    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Has anyone considered porting/remaking <a class="postlink" href="http://www.bripro.com/gbagi/index.php" target="_blank">GBAGI</a>, or something like it, for the NDS?
<br/>
<br/>
The DS is a great system for playing old DOS games, because they actually suit the hardware you're playing them on. (I find that playing old adventure games on a PC isn't absorbing and doesn't feel right... whereas on a DS I can do it start to finish as though it were made yesterday!)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, just a thought for anyone who wants something to do :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I just love those old games. I've got space quest 1-6, police quest 1 &amp; 2, Leisure suit larry 1 and probably some more which I've forgotten.<br/>_________________<br/>Packin':

If that was ported as well then youd be able to play, like every adventure game ever on the ds :D
