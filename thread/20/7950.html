<br/>
Was curious, has anyone worked this backwards and gotten the ninty wifi stick working using different softap drivers/client?
<br/>
<br/>
If so what softap drivers/client?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have Wireless USB adapter (such as the official Nintendo one, Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-AI - which is exactly the same as the Nintendo one, or any other USB adapter that uses the RT2500 chipset) then you can get it to function as a SoftAP.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the official Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector, with the ASUS WL-167g software (which I modified with a HEX editor to recognise my Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter).
<br/>
<br/>
ASUS software from here:
<br/>
<a href="http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip" target="_blank">http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a complex process because I did many steps to get it setup correctly, but the main things I did are as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Uninstalled the official Nintendo WFC software and drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Installed the Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-AI drivers (modified INF file). I think you should be able to use the drivers of any USB adapter that has the RT2500 chipset.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Installed the ASUS software (not drivers, but the Wireless Control Center thing). I had to use a HEX editor to modify the device IDs in some of the exe files to get it to recognise my USB connector.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Setup ASUS software to become a SoftAP. Received error message saying driver file could not be copied, so I copied it manually. Set it to SoftAP again, then it worked correctly. Secured the access point by hiding SSID, setting up WEP, etc. Put access point to 802.11b mode only.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Bridged the wireless network with my internet. This caused problems (many drop-outs in Mario Kart), so I switched to Internet Connection Sharing. And since, it has been working flawlessly. DHCP doesn't work for me so I just assign IP addresses manually.
<br/>
<br/>
So now my Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector now functions as a SoftAP. I've tested it with having two DSs and two PSPs connected to it simultaneously - worked beautifully, no problems.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
When I follow the instructions of Waffle and turn my Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector into a SoftAP,  I can use my Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector for dowloading the E3 demo's (WiFiMe style)?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok, but why does it work on Linux and not on Windows? Because Linux doesn't have some kind of security that Windows have, or just because the program is made for Linux?
<br/>
<br/>
I tought, it's kinda strange, because the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector only works under Windows with the original drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
And how is the development process going, to get the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector working with WiFiMe(on windows ;)), are you guys almost finished?, you guys are doing a great job for the DS gamers community :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The latter.
<br/>
<br/>
So a lot of us would have to choose between using wireless and using one's paid-for flatbed scanner at boot time because both of them don't have drivers on the same operating system.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
but are you guys (still) working to get WiFiMe working with the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector under Windows? If yes, when is it expected to be released?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
