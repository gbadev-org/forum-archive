The description states that it also works in the GBA and fits into the GBA slot. So it's probably some variant of the Play-Yan.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'd settle with Video support, as it was removed from play-yan into MP3 Player. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this thing, I doubt, will boot under NDS Mode. On DSi, it will most probably boot under 1 screen, like normal GBA games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I must spit this out: Why should I buy it as I have a small minisd adapter with MoonShell?

Theres still people with GBASP's out there.

Its actualy quite a good thing they put one on.

Not that Id ever by it, Moonshell gives me what I need, and if it didnt, then a stand alone mp3 player would probably still be cheaper.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Play-yan micro's output is way better than the gba micro one. It's like comparing AM and FM. Don't make me tell that the play-yan sound is the same quality of FM, it's as good as a standard mp3 player. I don't know about the DS output, I will try tonight.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know anything about that new mp3 player (just like anyone) apart from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dstouch.com/images/M0000004392.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a>. We don't have a name, the simple guess we can make is that the logo is <a class="postlink" href="http://www.h7.dion.ne.jp/~fmtk/LOVELOG_IMG/M20050915d6a55922.jpg" target="_blank">really similar</a> to the play-yan micro.
<br/>
<br/>
The german text don't say anything about a GBA cartridge, I'm sure if this was the case it would be mentionned. And on the left sheet we can see half of a drawing of a DS cart. We can seriously guess that the mp3 player will be a DS cart with a SD slot. Hence the lack of support for video, if the related chip does not fit in it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still, I'm ready to make a donation to the guy who will make the gba homebrew on Play-yan micro possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's because the GBA audio hardware isn't very powerful, just an 8- or 9-bit PWM DAC clocked at 65.5 or 32.8 kHz.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
