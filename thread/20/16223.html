Let's say I have a company that meets Nintendo's criteria (market experience, financial stability and properly registered business address), and we use LibNds and DevkitPro to build a proof of concept prototype and get a taste of DS development before applying for a license.
<br/>
<br/>
What happens if Nintendo finds out about that? Do they consider the homebrew tools "pirate devkits"? Do they view it as being as bad as downloading leaked NitroSDKs? Can the company get "burned" or "blacklisted" if they find out they used homebrew tools?

For what it is worth... evidently, if you know where to look, you can find development hardware in Akihabara.  I honestly have no clue how they would feel about you using it, but I suspect Nintendo would be friendlier than Sony about something like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wouldn't be so certain of that. On the Wii, Nintendo is doing exactly the same sort of cat-and-mouse against homebrewers that Sony did on the PSP. Some people in EFnet #wiihelp have suggested that it has something to do with blocking FCE Ultra and Snes9x, which compete with Virtual Console. Sony, on the other hand, has learned from the mistake and made an "Other OS Installer" sandbox for the PS3. So has Microsoft, with the (subscription) XNA Creators Club environment.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The homebrew tools are a perfectly acceptable means of producing prototypes - you would be more likely to be blacklisted for using pirated official tools.
<br/>
<br/>
There are actually a *lot* of authorised developers around who started out with devkitARM &amp; libnds. There are even some commercial GBA products around which were produced using devkitARM/libgba although obviously this won't apply to the DS due to the arm7 restriction.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

So should the front page of, say, wiibrew.org be changed to read "<span style="font-weight: bold">devkitPPC</span> which is distributed <span style="font-weight: bold">by</span> devkitPro"?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
