<br/>
<br/>
My DS has developed a dead pixel in the touchscreen and I called the company that handles repairing here, I'm thinking of going there tomorrow. Hope they don't take too long.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, I had flashed the DS, I'll have to unflash it, but at the site it says that it is risky. What are these risks? Can it fry my DS? ;(
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks
<br/>
<br/>
Oh don't know if it is important. I'm from Portugal, so my DS is european.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The original firmware don't writes that recovery code so you have to complete the flash process or otherwise your DS is unusable. 
<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn't say it's risky. There really is not much that can happen.

Done:)
<br/>
<br/>
It stoped at 74% and so I had to short the SL1 again. What a workout:D had to open the battery door with the DS connected do the wall plug and not dropping the battery.
<br/>
<br/>
Fiddled around a bit with a screwdriver, softly to leave no marks and then, thought it might take a while to restart unflashing. So put the screwdriver and waited a few seconds, changed its position and waited again, until it started the % again.
<br/>
<br/>
Its done. Thanks guys, you rock:)

Hopefully my dead pixel will disappear.

Yes, I tried them all.

Hi JaJa
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I didn't mention that but I removed it gently and smoothly and then placed it back untoched. Its as if it was never removed. The glue is like a gel, it doesn't glue strongly and doesn't fade quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
Use a sharp and pointy knife (don't get cut!) to remove it by peeling, with the help of your wonder-of-nature thumb, and it will be ok.

I had my xbox chipped and I painted it, but had the bad thompson drive so it never played any of the games I had, like I'm talking I take the game out of the wrapping and put it in and it doesn't work so I used a blow dryer to take apart the new xbox, switched the drives and returned it.  I know it's kind of wrong but hell, they shouldn't have stuck in lousy disc drives.

Doesn't Wal-Mart scan the DS's serial number at point-of-sale and print the serial number on the receipt?

I think you should report EB to Nintendo. They are probably going against Nintendo policy.

I too got some nose twitching from FNAC, where I bought my DS and decided to go to Nintendo personally. What a trip! But there I spoke with the person who was actually going to fix it:)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just got my first DS. I'm not sure, but looks like there are 2 or more sleeping pixels (grey all the time) in the upper screen. They do make my gaming as hell because I look at those pixels all the time. 
<br/>
*Mario Kart is great.*
<br/>
<br/>
I have runned the GBA tool: "Stuck Pixel Fixer" for some hours with no luck. I will try to replace this babe soon (hope they are not idiots in the local super-market). 
<br/>
EDIT: That didn't help because they are dead pixels, not stuck. :(

Btw:
<br/>
- the lower screen is very bright
<br/>
- I also noticed that the lower screen is not aligned in the center... weird

Ok, I just replaced that unit to another one. They at the local store were not familiar with pixels.. :D They didn't know what means "pixel". So I needed to write that on the paper for them.
<br/>
<br/>
The new one that I got don't seem to have faulty pixels (didn't found any yet). 
<br/>
<br/>
But there is a clear difference between it and the first one. 
<br/>
This one does have a brighter screen at below (not the upper one as with the first one I got). So I assume BigN do replace faulty screens and pack/sell them again as they were new ones. The one I got did look like used one.
<br/>
<br/>
I will do more tests later today after the battery is fully charged (takes ~3h).<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

My mom has 17" LG Professional series monitor with one stuck pixel in it (blue or red.. I can't remember). That does not bother much. It's position is about 3cm from the edge. 
<br/>
It has been there since she bought it about 9 months ago. LG do not take back monitors with only one stuck or dead pixel.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ok, here are my findings:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">- Tested more and can't find any faulty pixels.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">- Most DS games uses the upper screen. My upper screen is like yellow, not white bright. That is not a problem since it saves my eyes more than looking on bright light white screen. Look at this picture: <a href="http://www.w2k.co.uk/junk/UPLOAD/STUFF/ds_yellow_vs_white.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.w2k.co.uk/junk/UPLOAD/STUFF/ds_yellow_vs_white.jpg</a>
<br/>
*I assume the lower screen is a second producion line product (very bright one) and the upper one is from the first producion line (yellow brighness)*
<br/>
<br/>
- This DS has straight aligned lower screen, cool (not left aligned as the first one did)
<br/>
<br/>
- I just noticed that DS will show that health screen when starting.. if you wait 60 seconds it will automatically pass it.</span><br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Mr. Sir. :P

Yes and no.
<br/>
<br/>
The first time it was fixed it was the same DS I sent.
<br/>
<br/>
But it came with even more dead pixels, so I went there again, and after waiting for a week or so I got a call and went there to receive a completly new one. Now, the new firmware DSs were already out, but I got an old one, which means they have some old in stock, principaly on the places where they fix them. I suppose.
<br/>
<br/>
But I warn you, the first was didn't only had even more dead pixels but added to that the lower (fixed) screen was not very well centered. I talked to the guy who fixed it about it and he told me it was quite difficult to but it right.

Ok, that was the case with my earlier DS. It had lower screen mis aligned (left aligned), like yours.
