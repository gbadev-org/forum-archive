    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
I'm looking into a project.
<br/>
Turning the DS into an infrared remote
<br/>
for the TV/VCR/DVD/Robosapian ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Project : IRDA
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously the DS doesn't have a IR port.. Some of the older gameboys did but Im sure we can work around it
<br/>
<br/>
Possible ways to deal.
<br/>
1. The famous IPOD IR
<br/>
<a href="http://features.engadget.com/2004/07/27/how-to-turn-your-ipod-in-to-a-universal-infrared-remote-control/" target="_blank">http://features.engadget.com/2004/07/27/how-to-turn-your-ipod-in-to-a-universal-infrared-remote-control/</a>
<br/>
<a href="http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2004/10/28/graphics/ipth_0115.gif">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Serial to IR 
<br/>
Avaliable from any good electronics store are generally standard 4port computer IR adapters *look on old motherboards for the 4port IR*
<br/>
<br/>
but HOW do you connect serial to the DS - The PassME has a serial port *possible but hard* need to write software for the PassME/drivers to manage the i/o - a pain
<br/>
<br/>
OR
<br/>
<br/>
Using something like this <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/tech/mp3/ircontroller/" target="_blank">http://www.pjrc.com/tech/mp3/ircontroller/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Using the DSerial i/o - If the unit is ever released, you might be able to connect the IR to it. - If natrium42 codes the software support for i/o - All you need to do write the drivers for the i/o *easier*
<br/>
<br/>
OR
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">DSMem by amadeus</span>
<br/>
<br/>
DSMem is an awesome little unit with DSLinux booting and serial i/o.. now this is the best option so far
<br/>
DSLinux SHOULD have full support for all the DSMEM hardware
<br/>
so the serial should be mounted at /dev/serial
<br/>
using LIRC - Linux Infrared Remote Control
<br/>
We could simple hook ANY old IRDA, Lirc should work for us with less effort/cheaper then the other options
<br/>
<br/>
Its obviously not as easy as that
<br/>
<br/>
Ofcourse the power drain would need to be looked at but I doubt the LEDS would take much more then.. 1.5volts when IN use
<br/>
<br/>
Any other options or opinions?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been looking for small low power 4 pin IRDA/IR serial with both RX/TX.. but that seems to be hard to find without a microcontroller *more power*
<br/>
<br/>
The easier option is having a reciever setup for devs - So you can record the signal
<br/>
and the "general" ir sender.. so people can hook it up and simply use it :D
<br/>
<br/>
I have a decent electronics background but If anyone in the know could give there opinion on this..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As a developer, you wouldn't have to record, as the IR signals for remotes got a standard they follow. But if you got something that doesn't care about this standard, connect a IR Sensor to the mic-in and capture it.
<br/>
<br/>
Btw. how did you measure power consumption. Your initial post is a bit wrong about what the consumption is:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">would take much more then.. 1.5volts when IN use</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
The pure volts don't say anything on the power consumption. the Volt*Ampere (=Watts) is what you should care about. Easiest case btw, would be components which operates at 5.2V<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
that'd be great for transferring files from mobile phones :)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried doing this yesterday.
<br/>
I found an old remote, hacked out the IR emitter, soldered it to a headphone jack, plugged it into the DS, checked it was working with a digital camera, desoldered it (i had soldered it backwards), resoldered it the right way around and then realised it was broken.
<br/>
This is most likely because I fail at soldering and probably overheated the IR and cooked it.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I'm going to get some board, some IR emitters and try again.
<br/>
Shouldn't be too hard....
<br/>
<br/>
(IR is kinda similar to audio. This is where i got the idea. I wanted to use a remote for a moonshell remote using the mic port and a moonshell plugin that compared what it receives through the mic port with the signals it had stored (for my remote)).<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was the first person to have this idea, and I think you need to connect a modulator to the audio out to make the IR signal to be modulated
<br/>
<br/>
Did I read somewhere that there is a register to disable the volume slider? If there is, you could use that, I don't think there is any other use for that.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, because it's tried and tested (with the iPod and laptops and stuff).
<br/>
Anyway, I should get some more IR emitters and a reciever in a few days and some stripboard.
<br/>
I shall then try again.
<br/>
That DS mic socket is gonna be a PITA.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE
