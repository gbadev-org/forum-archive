<br/>
<br/>
What is the best WiFi dongle
<br/>
for homebrew?(This includes dongles that
<br/>
need hacked drivers.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know about Datel's WiFi Max,
<br/>
and Nintendo's USB WiFi Connector.
<br/>
<br/>
Which is better:
<br/>
Datel's dongle, or Nintendo's dongle?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want to get a dongle because,
<br/>
were I live I am stuck with slow Dial-Up. )=
<br/>
So I can't use a router because of that.
<br/>
<br/>
I have searched the Internet,
<br/>
and dongles work with Dial-Up.(at least WiFi Max.)
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm no expert in network dealings usually, and I've never even so much as looked at network code for a game, but to my experience it doesn't matter how much data needs to be sent, because if the game was programmed professionally with modern anti-lag techniques, it's not going to like a 400+ms ping. Neither are Nintendo's servers, I'm guessing.
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, even in the most casual of matches, TetrisDS does send data more often than every half second. Look at a 4 player match, and remember that the top screen shows your opponents screens, where they have their current tetrimino, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Granted, a game like quake was programmed with the knowledge that people will be using it on dial-up, so people can play it over dial up, just having to wait almost a half second after they click before their rocket fires. (hence LPBs and HPBs)
<br/>
<br/>
I guess why I have so little faith in dail-up with DS online games is because they weren't programmed to run over dial-up.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

I have slight problem with this thing anyway. When i turn it on i can connect no problem - original games and homebrew works ok, but when i disconnect i need to reset the dongle to be able to connect again. I didnt noticed it first time i tried as i was experimenting a lot.

The DS's wifi can do a maximum of 2Mbps (thats megabits, not megabytes, one byte is eight bits, so 2 megabits is 2048 kilobits (the kilo prefix in computers means 1024, not just 1000) divided by eight is 256 kilobytes. So thats your maximum speed, but it also depends on the program that uses it, as an example I've heard of people's maximum speed using DSFTP is around ~120Kbytes/sec.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Why not try linking to the shop's retailer feedback thread. People can then browse that and make up their own mind.

If 100 people each hit 40 listed stores manually, that's a horrible duplication of effort. Besides, some reputable stores that sell some of these products are still not listed.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Neither are Nintendo's servers, I'm guessing. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
Latency and bandwidth are completely unrelated concepts. You can have a high bandwidth connection with 400 ms ping, and a dialup connection with 5 ms. Assuming that you will have high latency just because you are on a limited bandwidth link just doesn't work in the real world.
<br/>
<br/>
As for bandwidth, many DS games are low enough that they won't even saturate a dialup connection. Using Tetris DS as an example, you will generate 873 Bps on the upload (download is roughly the same, due to the P2P network of WFC games). Assuming the maximum upload of the V.90 spec (33 kbps), you would theoretically have enough upload to support 4 simultaneous games of Tetris DS over one dialup link. Naturally you will never actually hit the maximum upload in the real wold, but a buffer zone of 4x is more than enough.
<br/>
<br/>
All technical data aside, many people have played on WFC with dialup using the Wi-Fi Connector and have had no problems. The servers won't kick you, and all functions of the game work as normal. You just need to stick to games that use less bandwidth, like Animal Crossing, Tetris, Clubhouse Games, etc, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
to good with Dial-Up,

Would Sonic Rush Adventure,

<br/>
Since that game only

downloads/uploads missions,
<br/>
it would work with Dial-Up,

correct?
<br/>
Would it work when he would
<br/>
play with others over WiFi,
<br/>

with computers?

<br/>
I did some math,
<br/>
and I have found that all 6 WiFi devices(with 1.5 mbps DSL)
<br/>
would work if all of the devices sent no more
<br/>
than 100 kbps.

<br/>
How long would a Wii firmware download

take over Dial-Up take?(Hopefully
<br/>
my aunt will get DSL, so we won't have to do it overnight)

You probably won't be able to have all 6 DSes running from the router at once, unless they all have separate external IP addresses. NAT seems to cause a bit of trouble with the DS-to-DS connections over the internet during a WFC game.

I assume you meant over the same AP, correct? If so, none of the systems would be playing the same game. But, it would be cool to play Animal Crossing Wii, with 2 other DS systems in the same home. (If they can get WiFi to work with that. Maybe NiFi for local sessions in the same home?)

<br/>
But, I'm having problems. The official drivers won't work. The hacked drivers works better.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm followed the below instructions.(Downloaded files previously before now)(See bottom of post)
<br/>

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">
<br/>
way back in 2006 i got a nintendo wifi connector for christmas but it kept on not working...okay long story short: If your nintendo wifi connector isn't working or it doesn't work everytime to take it out of the USB follow this guide:
<br/>
Code:
<br/>
<br/>
To do this you need to have this rar file:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=S4VLBP9A" target="_blank">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=S4VLBP9A</a>
<br/>
or you can get it from here:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.linfoxdomain.com/nintendo/ds/nin_wifi_Fullpack.rar" target="_blank">http://www.linfoxdomain.com/nintendo/ds/nin_wifi_Fullpack.rar</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Then follow these steps:
<br/>
<br/>
1.
<br/>
If you want to use the official Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector as a standard SoftAP make sure you have removed the Nintendo software and drivers as they will no longer be needed.
<br/>
<br/>
2.
<br/>
Inside the Drivers folder of the RAR file, you will find modified Buffalo drivers. Install these drivers for the USB Connector. Then install the ASUS software (also in RAR file(eng_2371.zip)). When it prompts you to restart, select No. I have found that there is no need to.
<br/>
<br/>
3.
<br/>
Now in the ASUS EXEs folder of the RAR file, extract the six EXE files in the into the ASUS folder (C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities). Make sure you overwrite the existing files.
<br/>
<br/>
4.
<br/>
Then click Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; ASUS Utility -&gt; WLAN Card -&gt; ASUS WLAN Control Center. You will get a dialog asking if you want to use the Windows configuration utility or the ASUS one, select the option that uses ASUS one and disables the Windows one. Then there will be a wizard. Click Cancel to close the wizard.
<br/>
<br/>
5.
<br/>
Now copy the file (C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities\Driver\WinXP\AP\rt2500usb.sys) to (C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers). Make sure you overwrite the existing file.
<br/>
<br/>
6.
<br/>
Right-click on the ASUS software icon in the System Tray (bottom-right corner of screen) and select Wireless Settings. When the settings dialog opens, on the left select Config, then go to the SoftAP tab, and select Soft AP Mode. Then un-tick the Enable ICS checkbox. Then on the left click Apply. You will get a message box asking if you really want to change to SoftAP mode, click Yes. A message will come up saying something like "add the adapter to the network bridge", just ignore it and click OK. If all has gone well, there will be no error messages. Now close the ASUS Wireless Config utility or it will start conflicting when we manually set ICS.
<br/>
<br/>
7.
<br/>
Now go to Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections (this may have opened automatically opened up when you Applied the SoftAP settings). Right-click on the Network Adapter you are currently accessing your Internet through (or your internet connection icon) and open the properties for that connection. Go to the Advanced tab, and click "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". Then click OK. If you get an error message saying the IP address is already in use, disable the Network adapter you are trying to share then try again - be sure to enable it again afterwards. It can take a long time for ICS to be enabled so wait patiently.
<br/>
<br/>
8.
<br/>
Now right-click on the Wireless Network Connection and click Properties. In the middle of the dialog there will be some protocols, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and then open the properties for that. Windows would have assigned a static IP address if ICS was successfully enabled, check to make sure this IP address does not conflict with other IP addresses on your network. Also, it should be on a different subnet to the Local Area Connection (for example, my computer's IP address is 192.168.0.2, I assigned the wireless network connection the IP address of 192.168.1.1 - which is on a different subnet). If it is on the same subnet, ICS will not work correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
9.
<br/>
With that done, open the ASUS Wireless Config utility again. On the left select Config, in the Basic tab set a SSID. In the encryption tab, select Shared for Network Authentication and WEP for Data Encryption - I have found that this works with the DS. Now enter a WEP key. Go back to the Basic tab, and at the bottom click on Advanced, change the 54g Mode setting to 802.11b only. Click Apply on the left to save the settings.
<br/>
<br/>
10.
<br/>
Now turn on your DS, play a Wi-Fi Connection game, go to the Nintendo WFC Settings, and select Manual Setup. Enter the SSID and WEP Key (both of these are case-sensitive) you entered to the ASUS Config utility before. Select No to Auto-obtain IP Address (you must do this because the Nintendo DS doesn't seem to DHCP correctly with ICS for some reason). Now give your DS an IP Address (this must be on the same subnet as the USB connector). For subnet mask enter 255.255.255.0. For gateway and primary DNS, enter the IP address of the USB connector. Now try and test connection, and if all has gone well the connection should be successful!
<br/>
<br/>
11.
<br/>
Now with the ASUS Wireless Config utility, hide your SSID, and use MAC Address filtering to improve the security of your wireless access point.
<br/>
<br/>
Following this made my nintendo Wifi connector work perfectly.

<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the WEP key gets screwed,(deleted/cleared, on PC)
<br/>
and the DS fails to connect. How do I fix this?? Or is it not fixable?
<br/>
<br/>
This dongle has bad reception upstairs, were I'd prefer to WiFi. Is there a way to boost an N dongle WiFi range?(I'm assuming so)
<br/>
Could somebody suggest some devices to do this? It needs to boost the range enough to have perfect signal strength through the entire home.(like a router)(2-story)
<br/>
Other than these issues, the dongle works great.
<br/>
Yesterday I played Sonic Rush Adventure and only lost once.
<br/>
<br/>
I thought I fixed this, but... When I got off the Inet because of the phone,
<br/>
every couple of minutes it kept trying to get back on. So far this has only happened with the phone since I thought I fixed it.
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed ASUS can do Ad-Hoc. I guess this means like Download Play,
<br/>
or DS NiFi. How would I use it for Download Play and NiFi?
<br/>
Would Firefly's PC WMB Host work with it?(I don't have FlashMe, so hb wouldn't work for me)
<br/>
<br/>
If I were to get another N dongle, could I use it on my Win98 and use it to connect to my XP for internet? I'm assuming so. If I would setup a Ethernet network between my 98 and XP, could I bridge the wired and wireless connections, and still use ICS?(Internet Connection Sharing)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When I try to install the drivers, Windows REFUSES to install them.

It seems it not even detecting those drivers, even though I'm telling it

to search in the directory with the drivers inside it.
<br/>
Instead, it only installs the official drivers, which obviously don't work.

Nothing got killed this time, at least not yet. I set a system restore point,

so nothing is toasted if that happens again.

I have solved my problem, but now my problems are even worse.
<br/>
(My XP is near dead, it needs a redo.)
<br/>
<br/>
It was detecting the .inf files for the official drivers in the default path. That shouldn't happen if you don't install the official drivers first. But, that's what I did.
<br/>
<br/>
To fix that, delete rt25usbap.inf in C:/Windows/system32/inf, and delete all similar files. Now it should find the hacked drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
Follow the instructions. Don't install ASUS before the drivers. If you do,
<br/>
the dongle will quit and stop transmitting. Reinstall ASUS to get it to work.

I want to get this dongle working on my Win98. I have found out you can't share Internet, nor can you bridge network adapters.(Tell me if there is a built-in way to do this)
<br/>
<br/>
I would to like emulate one of the above.(ICS or network bridge)
<br/>
First, ICS. I think the program would 'catch' all packets sent and received
<br/>
on the wireless network adapter and the adapter for the modem.(that would need emulated too)
<br/>
Then it would send it to the appropriate adapter. The emulated bridge would probably work the same way.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this even possible, and on Win98? If so, how?
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I need a Win98 version of the rt2500.sys driver in ASUS.
<br/>
Anybody?

I tried installing the drivers, as in the instructions, but ASUS failed to connect

The only questionable property about it is the transfer rate. That page says it's compatible with 802.11b, at 11 mbps. Obviously that's to fast.

This router isn't for me, it's for my Aunt whom recently switched from Dial-Up to DSL. I'd have to use a dongle Wifi since I have Dial-Up. I experienced Wifi with Dial-Up. It worked great.(This only includes the actual playing, not including the other problems. Right now I can't do Wifi anymore because the N dongle homebrew drivers indirectly wrecked the computer. I'm going to hunt for a SoftAP device as soon as I get these computers back to normal. This previously-wrecked computer is going to be system restored today or tomarrow, seemingly because of that hoax Wii HB website.)
<br/>
In fact, I played Sonic Rush Adventure races and won most of them too.
<br/>
How did you use this router with Dial-Up?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That looks like that one web page that one web page I found long ago, way before the Wii was even announced.(Only Nintendo might have been aware of it's existence)
<br/>
<br/>
So, all the computers, and the DS/Wii systems go through one computer for Internet with Dial-Up?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather not get a router for Wifi. My computers don't even have a physical Ethernet on the back of their towers!(Yes, I know I can add these ports myself, but...)(What would I Google for to find these Ethernet ports?)
<br/>
I'd have to get a router, some adapters for the computers, and another Ethernet cord if I use Ethernet. To much money!
<br/>
<br/>
However:
<br/>
Is it possible for the computers to automatically switch between being the ICS host and client? Say there's the following situation:  
<br/>
<br/>
Win98 ------ Direct Ethernet/Wireless Connection  -- WinXP
<br/>
   |___________________________________________|
<br/>
   |___________________________________________|
<br/>
   |___________________________________________|
<br/>
Wifi AP_____________________________________Wifi AP
<br/>
(Note that the underscores are only so that it displays correctly. Only one system could be an AP at a time.)
<br/>
<br/>
This computers would be connected with Ethernet/Wireless.(Another Q: can another PC network with a PC acting as a SoftAP, through that AP?)
<br/>
In this example, at first both PCs are offline. But, say the WinXP would connect to Inet first. Would it be possible for it to automatically become a Wifi AP, while being a ICS host, with networking with the other machine? And, could the 98 automatically detect that the other machine is online, and automatically switch to ICS client mode, and still network with the other? Now say both are offline again. Say the 98 would connect. Could it automaticly become a Wifi AP, while being a ICS host, and still do networking with that other machine? And could the XP detect if the other is on,automaticly switch to ICS client mode, and still do networking?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, we're still talking about Dial-Up. I was think about setting up SoftAP Wifi, with both my DSes,(including siblings)
<br/>
and maybe my old computer.(Maybe even a laptop... But there isn't any laptops in this house right now, at least not yet.)
<br/>
<br/>
Could somebody confirm that this setup wouldn't work? Would it matter if the connection was ICS or not? I did Wifi before with all of my DS systems connected at the same time, without any problems, at least as far as the connection goes.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
