<br/>
Few things I'd like to see fixed is this though:
<br/>
<br/>
- <a href="http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/FF7Stuff/FF7DS/ff7ds_sfx_ready.it" target="_blank">http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/FF7Stuff/FF7DS/ff7ds_sfx_ready.it</a> &lt;- this file crashes moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
-over-amplifying on .DPG files.
<br/>
<br/>
otherwise I love the soundquality now. It's very professional, not "tinny" anymore. Oversampling helps.
<br/>
<br/>
On a slightly different note, this is the best quality DPG I could ever get on the DS:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://tssf.i-web.net/temp/dragonball.dpg" target="_blank">http://tssf.i-web.net/temp/dragonball.dpg</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Ball Jackie Chun/Goku fight with original music added back in)
<br/>
-160kbps, 18fps. Full Screen :) It seems to have some dithering at the beginning, but otherwise clears up. Perhaps a buffer issue? If it was slightly optimized, this video should run perfectly. :) Very good file size for the quality and size of the video :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I am wishing some improvements: </span>
<br/>
<br/>
1) When the MoonShell light goes off the green light starts to blink. That should not happen (no blinking). Only blinking when the lit is closed.
<br/>
<br/>
2) Backlight goes off too fast with the default settings. That could be something like 25 seconds instead of that default 10 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
3) Touch screen accurancy should be fixed a bit. Stylus is detected a bit out from the place I tap the screen (I have calibrated settings).
<br/>
<br/>
4) Ability to change date order like dd/mm/yyyy, yyyy/dd/mm and mm/dd/yyyy *d=day, m=month, y=year*
<br/>
<br/>
5) MoonShell says that the time is 11:03:00 while the real clock says it is 23:03:00
<br/>
<br/>
6) Files and folder are counted as "files". It could be better to count them as lines instead.
<br/>

I have been trying to edit the DPGEncoder but without much success - I'm using a newer version of Delphi than the one it was created in and it simply wont use some of the external packages needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Until I can get it working, I have a request...
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell / Moonlight (which is correct?) :-
<br/>
<br/>
Can you add a textbox to DPGEnc to allow people to add additional commands to Mencoder. So for example, we could do cropping by adding "-vf crop=720:436:0:74" to the textbox. 
<br/>
<br/>
hehe also... I really like the Metroid skin  ^_^  Good work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
"Tinny"ness is only good for hardware that would use up too much CPU time to use a high mixing rate, letalone any kind of interpolation, which I agree, is best for the GBA. However, the DS is a different story in that it supports 44100KHz. The samples are usually of higher quality, elimenating the need for uninterpolated sounds to avoid the "muddy" sound that interpolation would cause on a low quality sound. (A good example of this would be a lot of the Super Nintendo music out there with lower quality samples. The hardware interpolation certainly did not help the clarity) Though, were a low quality sound to be used in a sound system that has interpolation enabled, of course it would cause muddyness..I guess it should be configurable as well. heh.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS is capable of amazing sound, it's just there's too few people who want to actually exploit that in the homebrewn community. That's why I'm glad MoonLight added this feature to MoonShell. It's one step closer to having an MP3 player on the DS that sounds as good as any MP3 player on the PC. All that's missing is an equalizer. :P
<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, MoonLight: Add a "low frequency" (AKA: Bass Boost, XBS, etc etc) enhancer for the DS :D for some reason some music that has good bass doesn't have as much impact as it does playing back on a PC)..
<br/>
<br/>
Hehe an equalizer for MoonShell would be cool, too..but perhaps that would be better when MoonShell actually contains a configuration screen..if it ever happens.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I thought of a way to solve the potential problem when swapping in and out of full screen and regular mode.
<br/>
When I hold select for too long, the video will begin to swap screens at extremely fast speeds. This was fixed with the button repeat rate and delay settings in global.ini, but the problem still exists (because lots of people don't want to wait for a second before they can scroll down the file list at 5 lines per second).
<br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps the backlight on the bottom screen should stay on for a second of two before turning off when people switch the video player to full screen mode.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also noticed that sometimes, after running the video player, it is impossible to open any other files.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Stupidest? Hardly. There are benefits to using the PKZIP format even if you just use store mode. As with StepMania's .smzip, .cbz uses the PKZIP format as an archive wrapper so that an entire graphic novel or serial can be downloaded at once and kept together. Other non-compressed archive formats such as .gbfs, .tar, etc. do not work with software that comes installed as part of Windows.
<br/>
<br/>
.cbr, on the other hand, is stupid because of the stupid licensing around the RAR format.
<br/>
<br/>
And yes it would be nice to send some text to most of the touch screen and an illustration to the top screen. Imagine reading e-books this way.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Edit: Yes... if you have Directvobsub in your pc ( that autoload subtitle program ) Dpgenc will insert the subtitles in the Movie!!!!!!!!

    <h4>#70498 - Durandle - Mon Feb 06, 2006 10:14 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok for info - those needing to crop a video. Here is an example of how Mencoder cropping works.
<br/>
<br/>
The command you add is:
<br/>
<br/>
-vf crop=256:144:0:24
<br/>
<br/>
What the numbers mean, in order:
<br/>
<br/>
Width of crop
<br/>
Height of crop
<br/>
x position to capture frame from
<br/>
y position to capture frame from
<br/>
<br/>
in the example above, I would be converting a 4:3 video to a 16:9 widescreen video, cutting the top and bottom off. The x/y values should be half the amount you are removing from the image. So in the example, the full frame size is 256*192 ... the cropped image is 256*144 .... so we are removing 48 pixels off the height, 24 from the bottom and 24 from the top - so we want our frame to start 24 pix from the top of the source image.
<br/>
<br/>
This is usefull really when you have a video with the black borders encoded in the image.
<br/>
<br/>
When setting this up in DPGEnc, the command can go anywhere (i think) but I usually put it after the bitrate. Also, set the aspect ratio to 4:3 as this defines the frame *source* size when cropping. 
<br/>
<br/>
If when you start the encode it gets to the video part and says Exit... - that means something went wrong and its not encoding the video.
<br/>
<br/>
A *very* useful feature of cropping here is that you can improve video playback a lot. If you want a 4:3 (fullscreen) video to play better, you can crop 10 pix from the top and bottom - you get small black bars at the top and bottom, but the video will play better (less data).
<br/>
<br/>
Part 2 :
<br/>
<br/>
Making an image bigger. Lets say we have a 4:3 movie with subs. Normally it maybe very hard to read the subs as they'll be tiny. Again using cropping (different method though) we can make the image bigger when losing a little of the picture. The command is :
<br/>
<br/>
-vop scale=256:192,crop=240:176:8:8
<br/>
<br/>
This crops the image and zooms the result back up to full frame size, losing 8px from the top, bottom, letft and right. This usually makes the subs just big enough to read (for me at least, and depends on your source).</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Durandle on Mon Feb 06, 2006 11:01 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

As MoonShell can access the time you could make an alarm clock which you do not see as in the DS one. You could turn on the alarm and listen to music or watch movie and then the DS will beep or do whatever ya like.

I got the setup.exe to work. Stupid mistake, just had to move \files into \SetupData.

I'm glad to see the touch screen works again when viewing images. However, the OverrideWindowRect_DateTime setting doesn't seem to work anymore. I set it to x=0, y=0, w=-1, h=-1, but the window appears in the default position just under the middle of the screen. Also is it possible to move the image window to the top screen when pressing Select like it is with videos?

The new font is nice! :-)

Eh... would be really nice if there was a way to stop dpgenc.exe once it's started encoding, short of terminating the process. I got halfway through encoding a show, then realized my subtitle and audio track settings had somehow changed themselves and had to terminate the processes to cancel.
<br/>

Only REAL subs work. Real subtitles are the ones that comes with DVD movie. Actually they are pictures that have text in them.
<br/>
I don't think we can directly use text subs, sorry. You need to make them as sub pictures first with some freeware apps.

Since you can take the SD card out of the M3SD without removing the M3 itself, does anyone know if you can do this with Moonshell? Like putting Moonshell on one or both SD cards and then swapping them while in Moonshell? Can it survive doing this? Can the SD card even do it without corrupting?

This has to do with the shoulder(L/R) button behavior.

#1 Please make it so it does not forward/pause/play until the button is released.
<br/>

#2 Please make it so if both L and R are pressed it goes back to the previous media(#1 is needed to accomplish this.)

Back before portable media players, before MP3 CD players and iPods, I started using my laptop as a media player for mp3s. And I wrote a lil app that grabbed my mouse clicks, left button was next track.. right was pause.. and both was back a track, worked excellent.

I don't know about the M3 SD, but I've tried that with the Supercard CF, and it doesn't work. The GBAMP, however, can be removed and reinserted and MoonShell will keep working. Except NDS files won't work after this has been done. Dunno why.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This happened to me when I ran out of hard drive space during encoding. (See my post about it making huge audio files when encoding silent videos... it can eat up 1GB per minute.)
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed some cracking when navigating the file browser or moving windows while playing MP3s. No big deal, just an observation.
<br/>
<br/>
What bugs me though is you can't mix media. If I put some .spc and .mp3 files in the same folder, and play a .spc file, it won't play the .mp3 files. :-(
