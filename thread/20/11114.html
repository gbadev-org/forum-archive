<br/>
<br/>
I am posting about my first NDS project. As the subject shows, it is a Babel Fish translator for Ninteno DS ;).
<br/>
<br/>
The idea of the program is to allow you to translate text wherever you have WiFi access. I've been working on it for about 2-3 days now (at the time of posting). Today I updated the graphics, but you can see they are not all updated yet.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Notice: You cannot actually translate anything yet!</span> I am still working hard. I have a deadline for friday to have everything up and running for everyones enjoyment. I will keep everyone updated :).
<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few screenshots:

<br/>
<br/>
Incase anyone wants to try it out (no point really, there is no functionality yet), you can find a <span style="font-weight: bold">EMULATOR</span> build below. By EMULATOR build, I mean that the Wifi code has been removed so that it will not crash emulators, but it will still run on hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
I have only tested it with a DS Phat (firmware v2.0), using GBAMPv2 and a Datel Max Media Launcher (NoPass) through MoonShell. If you want to, try to run it on your hardware and tell me how it works :-).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Known Bugs</span>:
<br/>
- When switching menu's, the screen "flickers" : This is not really a bug as it is my own stupidity. I know what causes it, and how to fix it, but it will be too much trouble to fix it as of now.
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THERE IS NEARLY NO FUNCTIONALITY AT ALL. IT DOES NOT YET ACTUALLY TRANSLATE!</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Here you can find an EMULATOR build download:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Awesome concept.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
It requires patching to boot normally on my SuperCard CF, but does boot though MoonShell without any modifications.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
