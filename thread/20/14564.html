    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Can "grit" do the gba2gfx thing of converting multiple images and generating an optimised palette? i.e. gfx2gba file.pcx file2.pcx -&gt; file.raw, file2.raw and a common palette.pal file. grit produces file.raw, file.pal, file2.raw and file2.pal where each pal file is specific to the raw image.
<br/>
<br/>
From examining things in detail I'd say it cannot do it, but I have only skimmed the surface - seems that each image is converted individually and there is no "global" concept in there. If it functions thus, has anyone worked on adding an optimised palettes option? or am I going to have to do it myself? I really want to ditch gfx2gba, it seems to be abandonware and no longer runs on teh Linux while grit is open source and packaged with devkitarm, but this is the one killer feature that gfx2gba has (that I use) that grit doesn't have.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
