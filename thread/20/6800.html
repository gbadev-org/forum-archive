    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking of starting to work on a flight simulator the only question I have is would I be able to have 3d models in the game. the only reason's I am asking this is because I have not seen a HB yet with 3d characters and I thought I heard that you need the second processor in the DS to do 3d?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you are interested in 3D, I suggest you check the example files that come with libnds. If you dont yet have DevKitPro and libnds setup, you should do that first. You may want to experiement with some 2D before you jump into coding 3D.  In terms of actually coding a game (once you can load up your models and everything), a flight simulator is actually pretty easy. Since you dont have to deal with constant collision detection, AI, character animation, or any of the complex 3D stuff, it shouldn't be that bad.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
