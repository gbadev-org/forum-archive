<br/>
<br/>
I have released a beta-wip-preview of my ftp client DSLiveFTP (probably will be renamed to DiiFiiTiiPii, still considering it). Currently all that the binary does is connect with WFC data, ftp with <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org," target="_blank">ftp.mozilla.org,</a> transmit commands and receive results. It does not do file transfer yet, as I haven't programmed the data-connection needed for the ftp protocol to send data through.
<br/>
I released this for the people who ran out of applications to try on their homebrew DSes and like a little graphical app, now and then.
<br/>
<br/>
Will keep you updated! Expect file transfer soon!

sounds nice. Maybe soon we'll be able to access the DS ftp server with this ;)

Hey Lick, what do you think about pooling our efforts? My next project would have been augmenting DSFTP so it's a client as well...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Integrating DSFTP is extremely simple. It's designed to be just a class you can link against your own code. That was the original plan -- to provide a tool for developers so they don't have to take out the CF/SD card anymore but can just upload and boot a new build of their app directly from the Makefile.
<br/>
<br/>
DSFTP on the ARM9 side consists of three main classes:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">
<br/>
BTCPServer
<br/>
  |
<br/>
  + BFTPServer
<br/>
  |
<br/>
  + BFTPDataConnection
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
plus a config file parser, logging engine, exception handler and an exec() implementation which will maybe be replaced by Mighty Max's. The rest is just stock wifi initialization and a main loop. This stuff will be linked into a library in the next couple days and documented, so any software can use it. All you do is link to the library, create a BFTPServer instance and call its handle() method whenever you're idle.
<br/>
<br/>
The next thing I was going to be working on is a small GUI library, with a file browser / executor as the test app. That's where I got the idea for an FTP client -- if I have a GUI able to display a file browser, and I have the FTP server code and an exec(), then implementing a graphical FTP client is trivial. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about having two file browsers on the two screens, one for the local and one for the remote file system. Also allows me to test some concepts I've been thinking about, namely using 3D animations for top/bottom screen swapping, animated resizing of widgets etc.
<br/>
<br/>
So I have a couple ideas, but it's a lot of work. That's why it would be nice to pool efforts.[/code]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

All right... although don't know wherein you see the hassle :-) Linking DSFTP to your app it ain't, I assure you. But let's talk again when my GUI lib is far enough, because I'm going to start the FTP client code then. OK?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
