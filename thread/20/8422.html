    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been working on this for a couple of weeks, and having just gotten the Continue screen image done (or at least something for it done) i thought i might share it, if only for feedback and opinions. yes, i know there's a couple of icons not done up yet, and the text colour on the bottom screen doesn't show well...thats why i want feedback ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, knock yourselves out and let me know of what i can do to fix it (as well as ideas for those missing icons)

Its good to see there's been ppl interested in this little project, but i need your help to make it better (especially with the green text, nothing seems to work real well). Opinions/Feedback/Criticism (even in their harshest form...almost) are much welcomed<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll probably use it sooner or later, since the official EZ-Flash flashcard write program does not support homebrew NDS.
<br/>
Nice to see someone making an effort to create a new look.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: Ugh. Confused Darkain's loader with the loader you used.
<br/>
From the looks of the pictures included, the skin is nice though. ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
