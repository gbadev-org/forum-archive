    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello gbadev members,
<br/>
<br/>
I have a question referring to the Nintendo Wifi Usb Connector and Homebrew.
<br/>
I installed Waffels Drivers like given in the corresponding manual. Once I even got  the Wifi USB Connector to work with official Wifigames ! Unfortunatly I can?t get it to work with Wifihomebrews like DS2Key, Pointy Remote, Beup, DSOrganize and many more. The Question(s) I have now is/are:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Has anyone here gotten the Nintendo USB Wifi Stick sucessfully working with homebrew ?
<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there a (easier) Step by Step manual (that is that easy that EVERYONE can get it done ) ?
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that someone answers:
<br/>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is an issue while reading WFC settings, i take it you are using a WEP key? IIRC one of the formats for entering the wep key is misinterprated by the autoconnect. It was either the ASCII Wep or the Hex one, try using the other one.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
