Nah, the strange thing is...all homebrew wireless apps work great and all my WFC games work great (I play mario kart online with a friend all the time). :-P  Should have mentioned the details..sorry about that.

Heh, I'm with you...WFC works fine, I've gotten all DS wireless apps to work so far, but apparently dsLinux is just not configured right for me...I must be doing something wrong.  I think it's just not getting DNS for some strange reason (it should be set to the right IP addy though), it at least seems to be sending some data to my Soft AP.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There seem to be versions for Supercard CF and M3 CF, but SD devices and flashcarts have to use the pre-assembled .ds.gba.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope SD support is added soon. There are multiple homebrews that have SD read support, and a few that have write support. This means that the code <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> out there, someone just needs to incorporate it.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll have to play with it...it's too bad I don't have a day off until Monday.  It might be something else with me, I haven't even been able to successfully ping anything even.  I'm pretty sure I'm setup right though, followed the tutorial in the wiki and inputted the right info...DNS should be configured fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, could be some strange setting I haven't found yet in my AP that's rendering it incompatible.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
