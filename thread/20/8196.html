mini-itx computer + webcam + computer motor controller + batteries + wireless card + wheel + DS

Okay so you build a small robot that has a basic steering system and drive train controlled by a small computer that is also built into the frame. Then use the DS as a remote control using DSkey. Eventually add on the ability for the robot to send on board webcam shots back to the DS. Oh yeah... spybotDS

Make sure your firewall has the port open, windows didn't ask me like it usually does.

Great app though  :D  However, there is no key-repeat? So for example you can hold D-Pad UP and have it mapped to the up-arrow. You seem to have to hammer D-Pad UP.

Make sure you enter a different IP for the DS in the config screen. Once connected make sure the DestIP is the IP of your PC. Then it should work.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here is some usefull info you might want to know:
<br/>
after 9501 (the port) the numbers are the following keys (in right order of course :P):
<br/>
A B X Y L R START SELECT UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT
<br/>
<br/>
for some more info on keycode numbers go here:

Well it's mostly in "game controller" mode.. though a key repeat option and perhaps touch-screen mouse mapping would be completely awesome. you should make these suggestions on the ds wifi forum though, since the guy is posting it there originally<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Requirements:
<br/>
<br/>
A home network. Whether you have an AP wifi card, or a simple wireless router, doesn't matter
<br/>
<br/>
Instructions:
<br/>
<br/>
Open the .bat file and edit the IP address to your computers IP address (if you don't know your IP address, open Command prompt and type 'ipconfig' that should give you a 192.168.x.x number. That's it).
<br/>
<br/>
Run the bat file, a window should stay open, you have to keep this open for as long as you want to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Run the DS2Key homebrew and choose connect to AP and choose your network.
<br/>
<br/>
Set the destination IP to your computers IP (the same in the bat file)
<br/>
<br/>
Push buttons and enjoy :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Advanced: You can add in more DS2Key.exe configs by adding REM[space] in front of the unused ones. (this comments out the line so the bat file ignores it like it's not there) I have the normal one and a Media Player one in ther batch, the MPlayer reads 
<br/>
REM DS2Key.exe xxx.xxx.x.xx 9501 69 10 11 52 57 24 50 33 201 209 203 205
<br/>
and when I want to use it I just remove the REM and place REM in front of the original so the one I'm using doesn't have REM in front of it.
<br/>
(only one should not have REM in front of it, the one you're using. If you have 5 setups, you should have 4 REM's)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<div class="post">
    <h4>#67739 - AnalogMan - Fri Jan 20, 2006 2:14 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Media Player one here didn't work for me (i use 10) so I looked up the keyboard shortcuts on microsoft.com and made a new one that works for me. here it is.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a Windows Media Player 10 setup I came up with:
<br/>
DS2Key.exe 192.168.x.xx 9501 33 48 28 66 29 42 25 56 48 33 67 68
<br/>
<br/>
Since I can't do two buttons at once (CTRL+P as one DS button) some are combos.
<br/>
<br/>
LEFT: Volume Down
<br/>
RIGHT: Volume Up
<br/>
<br/>
Y: Mute
<br/>
=========
<br/>
Now for the combos:
<br/>
<br/>
L + START: Play/Pause
<br/>
L + UP: Previous Playlist Item (Or L + cool.gif
<br/>
L + DOWN: Next Playlist Item (Or L + A)
<br/>
L + R + B: Rewind (Or L + R + UP)
<br/>
L + R + A: Fast Forward (Or L + R + DOWN)
<br/>
<br/>
SELECT + X: Fullscreen (or back out if already in it)
<br/>
<br/>
Works swell for me. If anyone knows how to combo keycodes (like CTRL + X in a single DS button) let me know.
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: I actually like the combo method, I tend to lay the DS next to me and it prevents me from hitting the next button and losing my place in the movie xP
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE2: Rewind and Fast Forward only works on files that allow it. Test it on the computer first and if it doesn't work there, the DS won't do it xP</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, with a bit of work all wifi homebrew works with the nintendo wifi adapter.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Follow the directions here: <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=64608#64608" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=64608#64608</a>
<br/>
2. Open your ASUS WLAN Card Settings
<br/>
3. Click the configuration button
<br/>
4. Go to the encryption tab
<br/>
5. Set "Network authentication" to open
<br/>
6. Set "Data encryption" to disabled
<br/>
<br/>
I only tested this with XP and you must follow the directions in the link I posted EXACTLY.
<br/>
It's also a good idea to add your DS's MAC address in the access control tab.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Make sure all your servers match though. A common mistake is to forget to change the destination IP address to your actual computer's IP address..or to set your IP address in the current program you're using in its batch file (ds key mostly)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

WEP does not work.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you open your firewall, cos windows wont ask about the port.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure there are 12 numbers after the IP in the BAT file... if there are more or less it'll open and close right away.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure the IP in the BAT file is your computers IP.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure the IP to send to in the UDP test on the DS is your PCs IP.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure the IP you set as the DS's IP is not already in use on your network.

It did that to me...what's happening is you've set the DS's IP address to be the same as whatever WiFi card you are trying to connect to.  Set it to something different.
<br/>
<br/>
When you pick Connect to AP, on the screen where it says IP Address change the last number to something just to make it different than the IP your WiFi Adapter is using.  Then pick Connect-&gt;UDP Test-&gt;Accept so you're on the UDP Experimenter screen.  Click the button that says edit next to the box that says DestIP and change it to that of your WiFi adapter.

Well, actually, first did you go to your firewall setting and add the port this uses as open (and UDP)?

<br/>
Second is not all internal networks use the same IP settings. For examle, my one is 10.1.1.155 for my computer IP. Check what your internal IP is and make the DS IP match with the last number different.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

all I'm left to setup is the DS, now what would be awesome is a Skinnable GUI for the DS, with all the DS buttons (or more) mapped on the screen.

Then be able to swap between button skins for each program.  (it isn't that hard to forget what buttons are for what)

that would turn the DS into a very inexpensive CUSTOM touchscreen LCD remote.

Nope, any bat file you make will work with the same ds2key.exe. Just copy/paste the bat file, edit the keycode values, and you're set.

I am going to post all the batch files I have created, each is set with its proper program name and key map, the good thing about this is, once you set up your IP in all the batch files, you can hot swap betwwen different apps.

Just close one and open other, no need to re-configure the DS.

Relative mouse movement (like a laptop touch pad) seems like it would be relatively easy to do. But absolute mouse movement (like a tablet, where touching a spot on the touch screen would move the mouse to the same spot on the monitor) would probably be a lot more complicated.

Well, actually, first did you go to your firewall setting and add the port this uses as open (and UDP)? 
<br/>
<br/>
Second is not all internal networks use the same IP settings. For examle, my one is 10.1.1.155 for my computer IP.

I just found the problem.  See, I know the IP for my router was correct.  What WASN'T correct was the IP that DS2Key had for my DS.

You can swap the station driver for a WMB driver and be able to switch to AP mode (with resource hack) and if you need to use it as a normal wifi card (like I do) you can use the batch scripts / switcher program to switch the driver between WMB and Station for you.

<br/>
-WMB DS2Key.nds to my DS

-Switch wifi card to AP mode

-Disable windows firewall, make sure wifi card has WEP turned off
<br/>
-Set wifi card's IP to 192.168.0.1 (it's now connected to the internet, can do WFC in mario kart, etc.)
<br/>
-Set IP in DS2Key.bat to 192.168.0.1 (same as wifi card)
<br/>
-Run DS2Key.bat, which stays open like it should
<br/>
-On the DS, hit Connect to AP-&gt;search for AP-&gt;pick my wifi card
<br/>
-On the config screen that comes up, set the IP address to 192.168.2.4 (do I just pick any IP I want for the DS here?) and leave the gateway/subnet mask/DNS things the same
<br/>
-Hit connect, it sits on ASSOCSTATUS_ASSOCIATING for a long time, then ASSOCSTATUS_CANNOTCONNECT
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty clueless about networking in general, so there could be something obvious missing. Do I need to do anything with the gateway and DNS settings, for my wifi card in windows, or on the ds?<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.

I noticed this with the beta E15 firmware with MoonShell (a similar crash)...start the program by pressing start, not A.  That should work.  I do know DS2Key should work fine, I've used it myself since installing E15 (I'm using the CF version but I doubt it'll make a difference).
<br/>
<br/>
And whatever you do, don't patch it using the Game Manager...that's not needed for homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Another dude made a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.4shared.com/dir/209955/4c2d4483/DS2Key_Simple_Server.html" target="_blank">"Simple Server"</a> starter for DS2Key to make setup on the PC side easier.  It doesn't support multiple key setups yet, but it's probably good for people who are lazy or having trouble with the ol' .bat method.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#69520 - Cleon I - Tue Jan 31, 2006 6:43 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to get this set up in my dorm room, but I can't seem to get any sort of response on my PC.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Linksys WRT54G and a BEFSR41 (older Linksys 4-port 802.11b router), plus my desktop computer (WinXP), a FlashMe's NDS, and a Flash2Advance Ultra 128.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to connect the BEFSR41 to the campus LAN via the Uplink port so it'll act as a switch, and connect my computer to that so I can keep my static IP.  Then, I want to hook up the WRT54G to a port on the BEFSR41 (with another static IP) as the access point for my NDS.  However, when I do this, the PC doesn't respond to any keypresses on the NDS.  For the destination IP address, I put the PC's static IP address, and for the source address I gave it a LAN IP assigned by the WRT54G.
<br/>
<br/>
I can run the .nds.gba just fine, and I know it's sending signals because I get a response when I send them to myself, and I can see the activity light blinking on the WRT54G whenever I press something.  However, no matter how I connect everything together, I can't get any response out of the PC.  And no, I don't have a firewall enabled.
<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the lengthy problem description, but I figure if anyone knows how to solve it, this would be the place.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Cleon, my Linksys router is ignoring IP addresses past 150 (I think I set it to do that a while ago, I don't remember)..DS wifi homebrew automatically sets itself to 189.. what if you set the DS itself to say, 192.168.1.110 or something, and see if that helps your problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Remember to change the Server IP address in the program itself to use your computer's IP address as the server ip.
<br/>
<br/>
Theoretical question to anyone who's tried: If I set up my DS to connect to a remote router, and it connects properly, and I tell the DS program that the server is my cable modem's IP address, will it allow me to use DS Wifi homebrew on a remote location? I assume I might have to make sure of a few things, for instance.. DMZ would probably have to be set to the server computer..maybe. Firewalls should be considered as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, it's just a question. I know TCP/IP is not implemented, but you'd think the local/remote routers and the server computer itself were doing all the TCP/IP work, and not the DS. But anyway, I was just wondering.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Yes, with a bit of work all wifi homebrew works with the nintendo wifi adapter.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Follow the directions here: <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=64608#64608" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=64608#64608</a>
<br/>
2. Open your ASUS WLAN Card Settings
<br/>
3. Click the configuration button
<br/>
4. Go to the encryption tab
<br/>
5. Set "Network authentication" to open
<br/>
6. Set "Data encryption" to disabled
<br/>
<br/>
I only tested this with XP and you must follow the directions in the link I posted EXACTLY.
<br/>
It's also a good idea to add your DS's MAC address in the access control tab.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

well after i clicked the first link, i downloaded the nin_wifi.rar file and i wasnt sure how to instal the drivers in the rar file... would i just extract it somewhere? im not sure about it, if someone could let me kno it would be a big help</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

the first 3 sets of digits should be the same
<br/>
ie. if your computer and router are in the 192.168.0.x group, so should your DS's IP. if you change your DS to 192.168.0.11 it should work<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
