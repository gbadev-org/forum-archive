Virtual Boy: 20 MHz obscure RISC, 384x224 on each of two overlapping screens.
<br/>
Nintendo DS: 67 MHz ARM9, 256x192 on independent screens separated by a hinge.
<br/>
Worse yet: The video models don't match up as nicely as even the Super NES to Nintendo DS, and you'll have a heck of a time scaling the screen down in <span style="font-style: italic">both</span> directions.

Or it could just be left-eye-only, which still leaves most (all?) games playable.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Or you could have one screen do one eye, the other screen do the other, and then let the people who actually know how to double their vision to look at stereo pictures play it like it's meant to be played.

<br/>
Of course, it will cause massive headaches, and i'm sure there'll be a buttom limitation of some sort. It would also look very odd since the screens wouild be vertical and not horizontal...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Virtual Boy has a D-pad, a C-pad, and A, B, L, R, Select, and Start. Nintendo DS has a D-pad, a set of four buttons that can be used as a C-pad, L, R, Select, Start, and a touch screen. I can imagine some control on the touch screen to switch between the A and B buttons and the C-pad. But even disregarding the button issue, the wider screen of the Virtual Boy vs. the DS is more than likely a blocker, as the PocketNES method of hardware scaling doesn't work for horizontal scaling.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

that doesn't bode well for a megadrive emu, does it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In that case I'm misunderstanding how PocketNes does things, as my rip-off of how I imagined PocketNes to work for ScummVM DS allows scaling horizontally to get 320 pixels onto 256.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're drawing to a bitmap or rot/scale buffer, then you can downscale horizontally using the PocketNES method, but if you're using text layers (as do PocketNES and SNES DS), you can't. It's also impractical to downscale both horizontally and vertically unless you do PocketNES flicker scaling in one direction and alpha-Lerp in the other.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
