    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering if anyone could think of a simple method to break the automatic detection and consequential patching of DLDI homebrew through slot one cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Do we know what method is commonly being used to detect DLDI compatibility?
<br/>
<br/>
Reason for interest:
<br/>
Usage of alternate DLDI files for selected files, for example you might like want access to a slot two device's memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you pre-patch your .nds the card won't try to patch it. DS-X only patches if empty DLDI interface or gba_nds_fat is used.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a magic string in an NDS files that have a DLDI section.  It consists of some hex gobbeldy-gook followed by the string "Chishm."  I just change "Chishm" to "XXXXXX" after patching the NDS with the DLDI driver I want it to use, then it won't look like it has a DLDI section for any DLDI patcher app including the autopatchers in slot-1 cards.

i suspected as much; that modifying that string would break auto-patching.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What happens if you want to find the DLDI section to test yourself if your program has been patched? If the magic number or magic string have been removed you won't be able to tell! Same if you want to find the DLDI section to see whether the driver used is a slot-1 or slot-2 flash card.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Or have an option to load without patching by using a different button.  If you load a game on the CycloDS Evolution while holding Start, it skips the DLDI patching.  So you can pre-patch the file for a slot-2 cart and either use that DLDI by holding Start or patch it witht he Evolution DLDI by loading normally.
