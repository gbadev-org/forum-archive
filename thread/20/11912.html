    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am using windows Vista and the official Nintendo driver for the buffalo wifi adapter is not compatible.
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a rt2560 wifi card which i use to send demos to my ds.
<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering is there a driver for my rt2560 pci wifi card to allow me to connect to nintendo wfc through that? as the official driver for the nintendo adapter is not compatible with vista.

But I am unsure if it will work in windows Vista too.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nintendo CLEARLY notes their wifi adapter is for XP only
<br/>
<br/>
note: if this is another wifi unit, then you also must check the maker's drivers, your best off with a seperate hardware wireless network system. Like a linksys router, they're only about 40$, come with switches, and are VERY strong in hardware defense.<br/>_________________<br/>laos,

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Nintendo connector is not OFFICIALLY supported on Vista, but the beta drivers work like a charm (believe me, I've try ALL to get it work, even the compatibility mode 'XP with SP2').
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again Sektor :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The connection is recognized as a wired network, it's kinda weird, maybe for a best security system... but at least, it works fine :)
<br/>
