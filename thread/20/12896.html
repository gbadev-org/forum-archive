Not only has it stolen legitimate attention from real browsers that actually work on the DS, such as links, retawq, and my own browser (hopefully soon Okiwi too), but it is damaging the community.  Flat out lying and linking to other files is the sleaziest way possible to gain attention for your own games.  I am looking forward to the day where another new gnirfleo rumor post doesn't pop up on three separate forums.

Do you know how annoying it is to get users telling me to stop working on my browser because gnirfleo is better?  Not only is it not out, but you don't even know if it's real or if the promises made will be realized, yet I still get people telling me I should stop wasting my time and just use gnirfleo as the browser.

<br/>
You guys need to stop acting like sheep.  Stop reposting the same crap about gnirfleo and stop giving that fake of a homebrewer attention.  As far as I'm concerned, it shouldn't even get mentioned until an actual NDS file is released that does what's promised.  I cannot believe the amount of real homebrew that is being pushed aside and ignored for another delay update that's posted on the gnirfleo blog.  For crying out loud, many people still don't know that DSOrganize Alpha has been able to browse the web for two weeks, let alone about dslinux, yet we get 1000's of posts on the gnirfleo comments stating that they love him and his work.

I should appologise to you and everyone.  First off, I was only kidding about using it as a means to get attention for my game.  Also, I did it to go off of umm...i forgot his nick, but oh well,'s joke.  Quite a few people, including myself, found it pretty funny to find a snake game instead of a internet browser and it did happen on April 1st/2nd (...along with about a million other jokes on those two days).  It wasen't meant to harm anyone, nor do I think the other guy's joke was.  Nor was it for my own personal gain. I'm sorry, but, I don't think you should be putting negative attention towards people who pulled a little joke on April Fools day.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, You are right...excluding what has happened on April 1st and 2nd, Gnirfleo has been taking away from other projects (by the way, I knew about your browser the day you released that video...if it raises your self-esteem).  This goes to show you how easily people are maninupated and or how stupid people are.  If you play your cards right to can make anything popular (Pet rock comes to mind...).
<br/>
<br/>
One last thing...it may not be a bad idea to simply delete this thread...the fact that this thread has such a large number of page views over threads of more deserving things is ...not good.  This really reminds me of what happen with the Super Smash Brothers project...in fact, this is identical in many many ways.  You work up hype then ...everything splats.
<br/>
<br/>
Once again i'm sorry if i've offended anyone or made anyone mad, and I hope that whoever feels this understands that I diden't mean to make any harm nor am I out to make people mad.  I think the same way as you guys about how Gnirfleo has been taking away from other projects.  One last thing...I don't recall seeing anything about Dragon's dsorganize alpha with the browser at drunkencoders...someone should post it there...hint.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: If anyone is too lazy to read my full response, I would like to make this clear...

In no way was that my intention and I appologise if that is what anyone thought.  It was just to be funny for April Fools.  If i really felt like increasing the popularity of the game, I could devise much more efficient and respected methods. ;-)  Though...that won't happen considering I have much more important thigns to attend to.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2:  Looks like there was a mega update at drunkencoders.  :) ...also looks like I missed the previouse dsorganize updates..i just noticed them now.  I saw about the alphas here first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyways, if people are just going to blow me off, then fine.  Though, so far, not many people have been overtly mature about this whole situation except for a few.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: I did make a small post the third in the morning when I got irritated that people skimed through and diden't read the posts saying that it was all a joke.  ;-)  That was on the gnirfleo comments and anyone who actually takes anything seriously in those comments probally needs to find something better to do anyways.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT2:  You know what...I guess it was the third 0.o....I must be going crazy or i'm seeing thigns witht he dates.  Umm...honestly, I thought it was the 2nd. :S .
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT3:  I thought something was weird with that.  You just made me question my sanity.  The gnirfleo blog doesn't say the excact dates, but it says I made the posts at 7 ....Yesterday, the third, I was working for 5 and a half hours straight on US Presedential Profiles at that time.  I thought somethign was weird :S .  So yes...it was April 2nd, not third. ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well...Look at it this way.  With someone who thinks that Windows Vista could run on the Nintendo perfectly, what would they choose?
<br/>
<br/>
A.  DSLinux with a nice text browser...they could even SSH into their own linux box and have all the RAM they can muster...Tabs, colors, everything but images.
<br/>
B.  DSOrganize with a simple text browser (Well...currently at least).
<br/>
C.  DShoboro: A browser that requires an app on their computer to be running and doesn't even work fully at the moment.
<br/>
D.  OR...A Complete Working browser for the Nintendo DS that displays pages perfectly, plays flash, and is jsut totaly awesome!!!111!!!111!!!
<br/>

The answere will be published in 24 hours so you can see if you were right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Rather, we percieve him to be some kind of n-dimensional being vested with the power to create great DS apps, deliver wise judgements and teleport at will...

Hence, if we seem to be kissing his arse, it's actually because his arse has teleported itself spontaneously to a position in front of out mouths.

It's also quite annoying when I post a simple rant about something, and people come out of the woodwork to tell everyone not to have an opinion about it.

You're right, it isn't. But the problem is, a lot of people just don't like being pranked. If someone pulls a prank on people, they should expect that even though some may find it funny, others will be (understandably) pissed - whether April Fools or not.

Personally, I tend to be in the latter category (although I never heard of Gnirf-whatever until this thread).

Heh, advice taken :)
<br/>
<br/>
To be fair though, I see it not so much as a matter of *all* April Fools hijinks being bad, just ones that cross the line into obtrusive or manipulative.  If it's something that's just goofy, obviously a joke, and doesn't inconvenience anyone, then I can appreciate that (for instance, although I didn't see this myself, I heard that Maddox changed his CSS theme last year to be bright and colorful. And GamePro will often include an additional section that's clearly labeled "LamePro") But when there's real content that's just not available (*cough* TV shows *cough*), or if it's just flat-out being mean (any of the pranks on "Punk'd"), then that's a matter of deception, inconvenience, and/or rudeness and is just generally "not cool". Some people don't mind that and still laugh, but others (*cough* die-hard anime fans *cough*) will just be offended.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.

When a moderator splits a topic, the phpBB software marks the new topic's most recent posts as unread.

I'm pretty sure he was trying to convince people that the 100mb extra space was for cache...not actual code.  But either way...it dosen't matter since the chances are that it's fake.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: though, it would be kind of stupid to have the "cache file" part of the actuall binnary...Either way, the ammount of times you can write to flash comes to mind (though, this doesn't seem to be that big of a problemw ith new flash media any more.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So far HE is the only one who has come up with any kind of usable homebrew browser. 
<br/>
<br/>
Dshobro looks promising, but right now has virtually no use. DSLinux has NEVER played nice with my router. And I'm not alone. Other people with the exact same piece of crap router have had the same issue. (Despite all other wifi homebrew working.) Okiwi has produced nothing usable. (And some folk seem to be debating if that's even legit as well.)
