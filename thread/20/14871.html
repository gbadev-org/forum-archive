    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I downloaded a regular video audio converter and it had a <span style="font-weight: bold">nintendo ds </span>encoder built in. Its called Super, rightfully so because it converts anything and its free too!
<br/>
<br/>
It creates a dpg video file that you can play with moonshell. The program is very fast unlike the stock moonshell converter.

<br/>
how slow is slow?
<br/>
<br/>
it's like any video encoding, the better the quality, the longer it's going to take
<br/>
<br/>
SUPER does 15ish fps in 1 pass encoding
<br/>
<br/>
BatchDPG does 22ish fps in 2-3 pass encoding
<br/>
<br/>
so probably twice as long as SUPER (at least)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got a 2.4ghz celeron processor so it's slow.
<br/>
I tried MediaCoder, but it was too confusing.
<br/>
I tried BatchDPG and it was fast
<br/>
<br/>
I used:
<br/>
20FPS
<br/>
Medium
<br/>
256Bitrate
<br/>
32768Sound
<br/>
I think this setup is good and it encodes quickly as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I tested medium and high with several settings and I couldn't tell the diffrence between them. I tested a family guy clip and a movie clip. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think BatchDPG is now the sick DPG conveter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Psh.  I'd be happy to own a 2.4GHz PC now.  I'm using a 700MHz PIII laptop.

I guess DPG encoding is out of the question for me then...

<br/>
I purchased my laptop 4 years ago, paying 800 dollars from dell.
<br/>
<br/>
The speed is ok, but it hangs up alot when I run intense apps, such as batchdpg or super.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you can run batchdpg with a 700mhz processor, just don't run antivirus and disconnect your internet connection. If your running win 98 or 2000 your in luck because if you had xp the speed would be horrible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you're whining for no reason
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a celeron 2.4 in my fileserver, and it's exactly what I'm using to convert movies now ;)   batchdpg, as well as autoGordianKnot
<br/>
<br/>
it's obviously not as fast as my core2duo laptop, or my dual core amd HTPC's, but it's got MORE than enough horsepower to do transcoding
<br/>
<br/>
if you're having problems, it's purely PEBKAC

fwiw

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was converting some regular videos to other formats and I ran in to several erros. 
<br/>
<br/>
I found that Super only converts to avi videos successfully for me. I use ffmpeg to encode. Mencoder always has errors for some reason.
<br/>
<br/>
you can use ogg successfully, but it takes longer to encode and you need vlc media player or media player classic to view them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
