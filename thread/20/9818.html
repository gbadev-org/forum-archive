    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Textures will be interesting.  Although the DS is capable of light maps, it murders the poly count and especially the fill rate.  VQuake (for the Rendition Verite chips) was more like the software version in that it kept a cache of combined color and light data which allowed single-pass texturing.
<br/>
<br/>
It uses a lot of VRAM (since every visible surface has a unique texture) and some frames might be dropped when going around corners (as it needs to cache some new surfaces), but you could always reduce the texture detail.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Rendering is likely to remain the bottleneck indefinitely, so optimization hours will be better spent there rather than on game logic.  Besides, a lot of the time that appears to be spent in the VM is actually spent on engine calls that are made from the VM, such as BSP traces.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ever seen the Saturn Quake port? Lobotomy converted the Quake lightmaps into vertex-lighting, so the cast shadows were still there (looked like a really low-res filtered lightmap) and also supported dynamic lighting.
<br/>
<br/>
Check this video of Powerslave/Exhumed on Saturn, which used the same engine, but had sprites instead of 3D models:

<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Saturn Quake didn't use the original art assets. The levels' structures were strikling similar, but I'm sure they ran the original levels through a converter, maybe even doing manual tweaking thereafter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that is plain wrong. it only contains about 50 lines of q2s networking code. go google a bit and you'll know it. it's based on q1. actually q2 was released during the development of hl ;) (though i'm too lazy to check the release dates). it's good that they didn't change engines like 3drealms do for dn:forever... ;p btw, this is official info from valve... don't ask for links, just google and you will find it. i'm not here to prove you're wrong :p

agreed. is there any particular reason it hasn't yet? the GP32 (which also uses an ARM processor) has <a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.gp2x.org/wiki/PrBoom" target="_blank">this</a>, a port of PrBoom. <a class="postlink" href="http://mongolito404.free.fr/gp2x/" target="_blank">i found the source.</a> if the author doesn't mind us using it, i wonder how hard it would be to get it running on the DS. processor doesnt seem to be a problem, as the latest version (v9) allows you to set the clock speed as low as 40mhz. i'd be willing to do it myself, but i've just recently got into DS programming and don't yet know enough to get it running on DS hardware.

Well I do use an appended file system, but initially one of my own. I later used GBFS in an attempt to get dualis to run Quake because it apparently supports that one somehow and not the one I made. Sure dualis now finds the files, but dualis doesn't have graphics emulated well enough to display Quake. It was a rather useless effort.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is Half-life on the DS a possibility?
<br/>
<br/>
I very seriously doubt it unless it was severely butchered.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok sure it was based off of the Quake 1 engine, but there is much more than an engine to a game. Quake 1 was released with the system requirements of 8MB of ram, Half-life if memory serves was 24 required, and 32 recommended and for that matter 16 required and 32 recommended for Quake 2. So that should be an indication of the media strain from that generation of games.
<br/>
<br/>
Even though Half-Life was made with the Quake 1 engine, it and Quake 2 are generation ahead of Quake 1. They both had higher ploy count, more complex and larger levels and many more improvements.
<br/>
<br/>
Quake 1 and 2 made their way to the Nintendo 64 Quake 1?s levels were reduced and simplified and Quake 2 had entirely a whole new map set so it could run on the N64. I think the same would have to be for Half-Life on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Half-Life on the PSP could be done, but I would image the controls would be terrible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

End users will accept butchered. Just look at the GBA ports of <span style="font-style: italic">Tony Hawk</span>.

<br/>
Three differences: <ul><li>Windows itself probably took 8 MB. The only operating system on the DS is libnds and Chishm's FAT driver (if homebrew) or libnitro (if official). </li><li>The textures are bigger on a PC. </li><li>The disk on a PC has a larger seek time than a CompactFlash card or DS Game Card, which means more stuff needs to be kept in the PC's RAM to avoid texture popup. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I looked at porting half-life to other systems, the idea was to modify the quake 1 engine and add support for their model format, textures, ect. and use the HLSDK for the game logic.
<br/>
Problem is, you cannot use any HLSDK code for anything but Half-Life.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried porting some entities to QuakeC, but for things like multi_managers and trigger_multiple it was simply too limited.
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic...
<br/>
<br/>
Will this port require a flashcart?
<br/>
Compatibility with CF/SD devices is fairly high and it's pretty similar to the standard fopen, fclose, ect...
<br/>
The only thing you need to do is call FAT_InitFiles before any I/O operations.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
