    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I recently bought a new ds-lite for the european release, and the +Control Pad was all horrible when it came to diagonal steering, pushing up and right for example required some extra pressure beyond the "clicking" point.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Returned it, got a new, This one has similar issues, but feels better..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this something anyone else has experienced?, did it go away after time?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The classic ds had a flat and clicky +Control Pad, but when it clicked you _knew_ you created some input. so it was never irritating in any way..
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the gameboy micro, which has a similar smooth clicky +Control Pad as ds-lite, has the same sort of feeling that you _know_ you'll create input when you click it..
<br/>

I guess I just have to grind it down a bit..</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's a little reassuring. Though I fail to see how Nintendo could create a console with such a crappy d-pad. It's not like they don't have any experience.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think the DS Lite buttons are based on the Wii buttons. But of course, most people use the Wiimote with their righthand and from a different angle from when they use the DS Lite. So that might be the flaw.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
