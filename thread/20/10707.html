    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are already 2 commercial games (though only released in japan) that are based on the 'do stuff in time to music' genre.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Daigasso! Band Brothers - press buttons to perform your instrument. has a neat single-cart multiplayer mode where different people play different instruments. music is synthesized, sounds like MIDI
<br/>
2. Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan (will be released in US as Elite Beat Agents) - tap and drag on targets on the touch screen in time to the music. music is sampled, with lyrics, real instruments etc
<br/>
<br/>
There are also a couple of homebrew games already written that look kinda like ddr. try searching for them</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Faster screen clearing code thanks to DragonMin, Joat, and LiraNuna. 
<br/>
memset(VRAM_A, 0, 98304) FTW! 
<br/>
Pressure Detection based on one line of Natrium?s ?UnderPressureDemo?. 
<br/>
Also removed almost ALL sparse readings due to light touches. 
<br/>
TouchDetection = if((touchXY.py&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (pressure &lt; 192)) 
<br/>
Note, stylus has a pressure of around 140, and thumb around 40. 
<br/>
Two fingers give different results. 
<br/>
Pressure Indication circle thanks to Bresenham?s Algorithm and StoneCypher?s hint of its existence. 
<br/>
Better Interface. 
<br/>
Re-Wrote code completely without any while loops. 
<br/>
In normal touchscreen detection code, my code can be dropped in for global reporting of Dual and Single touch and all 3 points. 
<br/>
Simply copy DSMultiTouch.cpp to an NDSLib template project to compile. Comment out screenshot a fat driver unless you know where to get them. (Chism and DesktopMan/LiraNuna) 
<br/>
Controls and Parameters:
<br/>
<br/>
A = Toggle Draw Connections between current and last EndPoint (second touch values); 
<br/>
B = Toggle Drawing pressure circles; 
<br/>
Select = Clear Screen once; 
<br/>
Start = Enable clear screen each frame; 
<br/>
Up/Down = Modify dual touch detection threshold. if((dx + dy) &gt; Thresh). 
<br/>
Left/Right = Modify PressureDivider. Smaller values = Larger Circle. 
<br/>
L = Take Screenshot. 
<br/>
Notes/Requests:
<br/>
<br/>
Works on M3 (may need to clear screen after boot) 
<br/>
Toggling of Start/A/B is a little quick?gotta just tap it?I could fix it? Left for excercise to reader. 
<br/>
If anyone stumbles upon values for PressDiv and Thresh that they think are really good/cool or removes quick movement glitches, post a comment. 
<br/>
Use this code to do something cool and win a cookie. I?m thinking of a way to use DualTouch and the midpoint as a pivot point for 3d rotations?it may work. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Sorry, one more update. Please compare the above and below for fastish one touch movements. Trying if((diffx &gt; thresh) || (diffy &gt; thresh)) for detection instead of their sum. Also, trimmed and commented developer source.
<br/>
<br/>
*Ok..I couldn?t help but add some eyecandy. Select = Clear, Start = EyecandyMode
