    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a GBA &lt;--&gt; PC Uart cable (MAX3232) which works fine on this multiplayer port.
<br/>
<br/>
in this hardware description for the NDS it seems, the NDS has same UART hardware like the GBA. but I recognized, the NDS doesn't have this link connector (maybe cause of wifi). so I have some question:
<br/>
<br/>
does NDS have a UART?
<br/>
is the UART only present in software cause there is no hardware connector or is there another connectore used for (maybe this usb like connector for DC)??
<br/>
is it possible to wire the UART port or is it impossible to use Uart?
<br/>
so it is impossible to play multi player games with an GBA?
<br/>
is it possible to play a GBA multiplayer game with two NDS in GBA mode?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
is it possible to wire the UART port or is it impossible to use Uart? Probably impossible.
<br/>
so it is impossible to play multi player games with an GBA? with gbas, yes
<br/>
is it possible to play a GBA multiplayer game with two NDS in GBA mode? no.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The connector is probably there somewhere, but nobody's found it. I suspect you could build a GBA link connector into a slot-1 card (or even slot-2); you wouldn't be able to use it in GBA games, but it'd allow DS homebrew to interface with GBAs (or PCs or other DSes with a wired connection), which would at least mean being able to download GBA multiboots, save them to a memory card, and run them in GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

but existing software for GBA multiboot or some UART applications for example does not run without big changes ...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems the NDS also has this Uart hardware. It's hidden but it's possible to wire it.

<br/>
The Firmware chip (FMW.Pins) hides underneath of the RFU shielding plate, so it'd be easier to connect the wires to the RFU.Pins. The easiest way for the /W-to-VCC connection is to shortcut SL1 by putting some solder onto it.
<br/>
The P00..P07 and INT signals are labeled on the switch-side of the mainboard, however, there should be more room for the cables when connecting them to via's at the bottom-side, image below may help to locate that pins,

The "DS Xboo" you pasted is a special connection, that is ONLY usable by homebrew code. It can be used for uploading .nds files and running them, but it's not worth it, since you have to solder 15 wires to the DS mainboard directly. Again, this does not work like a GBA UART port.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
