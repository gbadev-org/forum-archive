    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, here is a question from a complete n00b. I own a Nintendo DS (good start) and I want to know what I can do with it. I was turned onto modding it by a post I saw somewhere saying that Wi-Fi internet access on it is possible eventauly...but not yet. 
<br/>
<br/>
So in the meantime what should I do with my DS? What is there to do with it? What do I need? And how do I do it?
<br/>
<br/>
I've read the forums but, I'm just not sure where to begin.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">With the purchase of a PassMe or using a compatable wireless network card to upgrade your ds's firmware (or using WifiMe if you don't wanna void your warranty), you can play demos from the las t E3, or homebrew applications and games developed by people right on this board.  All of the methods involve needing a gba flash cart at some point, except for WMB (and some games/apps don't work with this method becuase they're too big or they're not signed by Nintendo).  If you have a gba flash cart, you can also <a class="postlink" href="http://boards.pocketheaven.com/" target="_blank">break the law</a> but of course, that's illegal. You can do many things with your ds.....and It's a very good time to get into the homebrew scene becuase of the whole wifi cracking stuff going on. If you don't know where to begin, search the forums for "FlashMe", or "WifiMe" to learn how to do these methods yourself.  There is also a website where you can purchase PassMes but i forgot what it was.  Just google "PassMe".
<br/>
Oh yeah, if you don't have a gba flash cart, you could purchase a GBA Movie Player for much cheaper because things are being developed for that as well.  I think you can also do the firmware upgrade from the GBAMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
