    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It can, but it can't read properly.  I had that code in there and it didn't work.  You can force ScummVM to use the SRAM save method that GBA games use.
<br/>
<br/>
In the ini file ScummVM.ini (or ScummVMB.ini for build B) under the line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">[ds]</span> add one that says <span style="font-weight: bold">forcesramsave=true</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
If the M3 software lets you write SRAM saves to flash, you can then use that to save.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can't find the .ini file.  Is it something that's supposed to be created on the flash card after the first run?  (I'm using m3 SD).  'cause it's not there for me.
<br/>
<br/>
AgentQ, if the M3 SD community pitched in and GOT you a M3SD, would that make it easier for you to support it?  I know I'd contribute.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm quite impressed by what I have, and thanks a whole bunch for lefty support.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#82529 - agentq - Sun May 07, 2006 2:11 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah yes, you won't have that if it won't write at all.
<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to run with an ini with just the single option in it though.
<br/>
<br/>
Create a text file, called scummvm.ini (for build a) or scummvmb.ini (for build b)
<br/>
<br/>
containing the following:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">[ds]

<br/>

Now you should be able to use SRAM saves.  Hopefully there's a way for the M3 to save them to it's flash somehow.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Everything seems to work fine on the GBAMP. BASS seems to start off running a little fast, but that can be changed ingame.
<br/>
Gobliiins... has a tricky control scheme. You've got to change into right click mode to switch functions, then go back to left click to use it. Is there any chance of implementing a 'Sam and Max' style control method? It'd probably be pretty much the same code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">MatLeOuf, each time I release a new version, someone says that there's code out there that solves the touchscreen issue, and each time it's actually not the case.  I think the fact is that the stuff you touch in ScummVM is just smaller than most other games. I just tried out Axe, and it doesn't look any better than ScummVM to me.
<br/>
<br/>
If the touchscreen is consistantly off in the same direction, you can adjust it.  Press select during a game and change the X and Y offsets.
<br/>
<br/>
Chetic, it should save fine on Supercard CF.  Perhaps you could try select a Save Path in the options for Simon the Sorcerer and see if that helps.
<br/>
<br/>
acky, I tried putting MP3 support in there, and it worked, but caused slowdown every time someone spoke, which was very distracting.  It also used up a fair bit of RAM.  So I got rid of it for the final release.
<br/>
<br/>
Agentflit, are you sure?  I've had two separate people confirm that it works fine with the Supercard SD.  Perhaps it's something to do with the format of your SD card.  It would be nice to see if it's affected by whether the card is FAT16 or FAT32.
<br/>
<br/>
Dwedit, Kyrandia is a possibility, but I think there would have to be a build C for that, since build B is already getting a bit large.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can only get 'ScummVM-a.ds.gba' (or the b version I imagine) to work 'ScummVM-a.nds' won't run (freezes at the 100% load mark), regardless of M3 Game Manager settings (have tried all combinations obviously not trimming...also tried just manually dragging the file onto the SD card...no go).

But the wierd thing is the GBA exe only works running as an NDS game ie. it won't work loading as a GBA game.

I just had a look at the source tarball and you don't use touchReadXY() in there. Is there something more recent than <a class="postlink" href="http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com/scummvmds0-6src.zip" target="_blank">This</a>?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi!
<br/>
i'd like to leave some feedback for the dev:
<br/>
<br/>
technical details:
<br/>
NDS + FlashMe V7 (or V6, can't remember - getting to old ;) )
<br/>
M3 Perfect SD, "Firmware" 18, Sandisk 1GB
<br/>
<br/>
Games tested :
<br/>
DOTT talkie english
<br/>
MI1 nontalkie english
<br/>
MI2 nontalkie english
<br/>
INDY4 FULL takie ( not added to scummdata.zip due to 80mb size :) )
<br/>
<br/>
i've created the "scummdata-a.zip" and merged it with the batchfile to scummvm-a-withdata.ds.gba .
<br/>
<br/>
Size: scumdata-a.zip - 28.155.551 Bytes
<br/>
Size: scummvm-a-withdata.ds.gba : 29.616.879 Bytes
<br/>
<br/>
FILE: scummvm-a-withdata.ds.gba
<br/>
i can add games ( dott,mi1,mi2 ), but scummvm crashes on select of START.
<br/>
<br/>
FILE: ScummVM-a.nds
<br/>
scummdata.zip can't neither be found in ROOT nor in the folder, where ScummVM-a.nds is located. I've even tried to rename the the archive to
<br/>
scummdata-a.zip. Still won't no luck.
<br/>
<br/>
FUNNY :
<br/>
i've copied all the mentioned games directly to the sd-card and i can add the folders to ScummVM-a.nds and the games work. INDY4 has NO talkie - probably because its 80MB :) - and ScummVM-a.nds crashes after i select QUIT. ScummVM won't save the added folders.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to reduce the size of the "scummvm-a-withdata.ds.gba" and post some new infos later today.

Saving is a bit hit and miss though.  I tested 0.6 on one of my SD cards and it ran and saved fine without me changing any options.  I  stuck it on a second SD card with the same game and suddenly, saving wasn't working.  I tried setting the save path manually to different things but it wouldn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
I deleted all the save game files and tried again and then it decided it wanted to work, could save and load fine.  Great I thought, and tried a new game (Indy and Fate of Atlantis).  Again, wouldn't save.  Said it was saving but after rebooting, no save games.  Tried saving to slot 4 instead of 1 - decided to work.  As long as it works, I don't care if I have to fanny about for a few mins getting a working save slot but it does seem a bit random.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i've put ScummVM-a.nds, added DOTT, played some DOTT, saved, Message "save ok", tried to load "corrupt savegame", rebootet and finally SDcard DEAD.

Try setting the save path on the first boot, and then see if you can reboot without it crashing.

wintermute, you're right, it doesn't use TouchReadXY().  I must have done that change to the 0.5 codebase and forgotton to move it over.

I'm hoping to fix this save path thing and the touchscreen and release a 0.61 in a few days.

As for the unreliable SD card saving, there's not a lot I can do about that.  Several other very talented people have contributed to the driver, and I'm thinking if they couldn't get it to work properly there may be little I can do to help out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Shouldn't it be saving to the cart's sram?

If i change it from the default path to anything else (ds:/ ds:/scummdata or a game folder) and don't add a game it does freeze up on boot (no doubt because the flash cart's not writable i assume)

Looks like the m3:sd isn't being detected, try this.
<br/>
<br/>
1. When you "upload" to the the SD card don't use the m3 game manager, copy it using drag &amp; drop from windows.
<br/>
<br/>
2. When starting the game from the M3 menu use the A button rather than the Start button.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>

<br/>
2. Unzip/rar it to a folder, You should have 3 files (sky.cpt, sky.dnr, sky.dsk ) in one dir.
<br/>
3. Open up the SD card removable drive. Put the BASS dir in your ScummVM dir.
<br/>
4. Copy over ScummVM-a.nds &amp; ScummVM-b.nds (or ScummVM-a.ds.gba ScummVM-b.ds.gba, RENAMED .ds.gba added prefix .NDS = ds.gba.nds or just .nds) have them in the ScummVM dir.
<br/>
5. Boot up ur M3 start the ScummVM-B (IMPORTANT THE B VERSION plays BASS) with the .NDS .. or the ds.gba.nds
<br/>
6. it boots up with reading .. "Searching for ZIP archive.... Not found!" &amp; "Found flash card reader!" and shows you the menu of ScummVM.
<br/>
7. Press "Add Game.." and find the BASS dir.. once at the dir not in the dir.. press the choose button.. 
<br/>
8. Your in the BASS game options. Just press ok.
<br/>
9. Out in the main menu go in to options, Find save tab and go to "Save Path .." Press it and choose where it will save to (i used the ScummVM dir) ok and out in the main menu.

10. Main  Menu pick the BAss game and press start. Hopefuley in seconds you should c the Virgin Logo and start hearing the story line ;D

<br/>
- click A on scummVM-a.ds, can't start, progress bar full but hangs
<br/>
- click A on scummVM-b.ds : can't start, progress bar full but hangs
<br/>
- click A on scummVM-a.ds.gba : first click, nothing

second click, the program starts, yippie, close my DS, open it back, SD dead, my SD is screwed, need to format it back
<br/>
- click A on scummVM-b.ds.gba : first click, nothing
<br/>
second click, the program starts, yippie, close my DS, open it back, SD dead, my SD is screwed, need to format it back

I'm a bit disappointed, I wanted to play dott on my ds :o(.  Even lost my GBA and NDS savegames along the way :O(

I did not create a scummvm.ini file, but damn, it corrupts badly my SD card...I'm not sure it will fix anything!! If the program starts, it corrupts my SD...

I'm using FlashMe V6, maybe you should write something like "unstable" untill problems are solved.  If you need help for beta testing on my hardware, please ask, I could help.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have an EZ flash II and III. I use my EZ Flash II to put it on, cause I can't find a work to let it work on version III
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have a problem with version 0.6, version 0.5 worked except the known bugs :)
<br/>
<br/>
But version 0.6 doesn't work at all. I created a normal store zip ( no compression ) as I did before. The games are in a dir inside the zip, and build it with the A version ( I tried monkey island 1 and 2 and loom so far ). They all have the same result, it says it can't find something, stops working and gives black screens. Things it can't find are monkey.002 ( never saw that file with that game, ' ? \ ' for monkey island 1 and for Loom well it gives no error just stops.
<br/>
<br/>
I know that flash cart types , certainly EZ flash aren't supported by any homebrew, but it worked before so maybe something got broken in this version ?
<br/>
<br/>
If I had any programming knowledge I'd look into it myself .. but I suck at it :p

I hope it will be fixed in 0.7 :) Thanks for the great port though :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah i was thinking the same thing a few days ago.. games like the dig and full throtell would so rock on the NDS .. and as we got the FAT working on SD cards we play with only 2,4Mbs uploaded to the ram of the gba flashcarts, so we got like a 30Mbs free to be uploaded now all there needs to be done is some one reverce enginere the direct writing commands of every card or maybe ask nicly from the developers of the brand and get on with having a swap ram of some sort or just using it directly.. isn't the XiP linuxds uses the thing we need to get and sort of membory expansion ? or em i just winging something that is way to much work and not really posible ?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S i know that the arm7 isn't used to much in the scummvmds as i looked in the source.. (i'm no wiz just a calculated guess) but it seems it could be put to more use as a ram swaper or something like that .. anyway just my final thoughts on the issue

----------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
anothere thing i was thinking about is the use of mp3 or ogg don't have to be super crips quality some not as cpu intense .. now i know ur a audio wiz with the audio you made for gba.. so i don't think it'd be to much of a chalange to maybe geting stereo or something going... now i don't think the NDS can pusch out the amps of the audio in the hardware but just as moonshell uses some sort of audio antializing maybe u can do the same..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I did have MP3 audio going, but it caused a fair bit of slowdown.  Many parts of the games are close to slowing down anyway, and the extra chunk of CPU made them pretty slow.  Parts that slowed down already became really really slow when running MP3 audio.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I may well have scraped enough RAM together to put it in the next release, if anyone is still interested.  No promises though.  It runs ok when there's not much animation going on while the MP3 is playing, but at other times its really bad.  Reducing the bitrate of the MP3s seems to make little difference.
<br/>
<br/>
Stereo audio is definately a possibility, although I don't know how many games actually had stereo audio.  Higher quality audio is a little tricky, as the OPL3 emulator used is incredibly slow.  Audio antialiasing is also something which might help, and could potentially be done on the ARM7.  Please, if anyone wants to have a go at that, go ahead, I'm not sure when I would have the time to work on it.
<br/>
<br/>
RAM is not the only problem with running the later SCUMM games like The Dig, but also I would imagine they would need more CPU power than we have as well.
<br/>
<br/>
As for resizing the graphics, I'm not sure there is any way of extracting the graphics and repacking them.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if this was a commercial project and I had six months full time to spend on it, I think it would all be possible, but unfotunately I have to fit it all in around my job, and after spending 8 hours programming during the day, doing another three or four hours when I get home is not the most appealing thought.

Basically, if this was a commercial project and I had six months full time to spend on it, I think it would all be possible, but unfotunately I have to fit it all in around my job, and after spending 8 hours programming during the day, doing another three or four hours when I get home is not the most appealing thought.

I heard you were in talks to get this released as an official  port on the SCUMMVM site, is this true?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, congratulations on an excellent engine, as you know, ANY releases and upgrades, no matter how small are greatly apreciated by the community.

Can anyone tell me which files in need for simon2?i've tried from two different CD versions, but neither of them work, I just get black screens with the mouse icon on the top screen, it completely freezes (or seems to).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

I <span style="font-style: italic">know</span> that they use too much RAM, and I <span style="font-style: italic">suspect</span> they may use too much CPU time as well.

Yes, the plan is that it will eventually become an official port.  This is mostly dependent on the ScummVM team adding features to replace the hacks I've made to the source, and on me fixing some of the source code mess in my port.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad this stuff is appreciated, it makes it all worthwhile!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys, sorry for bothering people if this has been mentioned before, but are there any plans for a version of scummvm that will be compatible with the max media dock?  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit worried that this new hardware to the scene may get the shaft cause its low price and mainstream availability will make it popular with people who don't really follow what's going on in the dev scene, rather than dedicated folks whove dropped a pretty penny on their import cards....  
<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to get some friends into the homebrew scene but they're scared away by the coding aspect, and this seemed like a nice relatively simple alternative, complete with real english documentation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">does anyone know what compression settings are capable of getting the MONSTER.SOU files down under 30mb so i can use them with the DS? I'm using the scummVMtoolBox1.0 and can't seem to shrink the DOTT SOU smaller than 90mb. A step by step guide on SOU compression would be nice, as most of the readmes and net info i've found has been pretty vague. Thanks for any help.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
