    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A Flash 7 player for the DS would not be technically possible. I did some research into this (I was concidering porting it) but there is just not enough power. Flash is notoriously slow (even on fast PCs) so even if someone could port it, it would run like crap. Maybe a port of the Flash Lite player (used on cell phones, PDAs) could work.
<br/>
<br/>
A more realistic solution would be to create a trimmed down flash player specifically for the DS. The SWF format is an open standard, so it would be possible to create a custom DS SWF player. Some of the flash effects would have to be cut (like alpha channels) to get a decent speed, but I imagine it would be possible.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What if this SWF player simply trimmed the unneeded things out? Like linking, some action scripts that are unneeded, etc. Also, anti-aliasing for some of the lines could be rendered in "medium" mode as opposed to "high quality".. It'd be neat to see the DS do something like the PSP menu in real-time, though I doubt it could ever happen.
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, if there were some set limitations, I'm sure some form of SWF player could be ported? Maybe it's just wishful thinking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is entirely possible to do on DS. Obviously it wont look as good as on the PSP widescreen, but I dont see any reason why there cant be an interface like that on DS. I doubt using any Flash port will get that kinda performance, but if it was a custom app it should be no prob.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A tailored player, playing tailored content, might not be so slow. But firing up a DS "browser" and navigate smoothly across newsgrounds.com, and playing that cool flash game your friends sent you is a far, far reality.
<br/>
<br/>
I think a custom-made player playing specific content would run at around 15 frames per second, depending on the graphical content and actionscript complexity. I'd love to be proved wrong, of course.
<br/>
<br/>
That is considering the DS would need render 2D vectors, with gradients and beziers, in pure software (using the hardware would impose hard limits on the complexity of the vectors on the screen), and interpret the action script. 
<br/>
<br/>
The only usage I can see for such thing, is using the Flash dev environment to create not-so-neat looking GUIs. The Flash dev app is far from being free, mind you, so this would put off some more open-source-bound developers. A custom GUI library could be put together much faster.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, a DS flash player would ONLY benefit those who don't know jack shit, but want to get the fake feeling that they got something of their own running on the console.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Making the DS accessible to the zillions of flash guys out there is a bad idea because they don't deserve it? Hmm...

  I think this is quite a bold statement. Much of the professional work I do is in flash, and it is not as simple as some believe. Sure, you can get a ball bouncing in 5 minutes, but to do the cool stuff you have to know your shit. In some ways, Flash can actually be as complex as any C++ code once you get into actionscript 2.0 and OOP using prototypes and the like. Not to mention the kinds of backend/databasing applications you can write using it. To automatically assume all actionscript programmers "dont know jack" just cause there is a lot of crap content is a huge mistake. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, not for nothing, but there are a lot more talented artists using flash than in the homebrew scene. Sure you might be the world's greatest uber-hacker, but if you cant draw for shit, how good is your game really going to be?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just took a look at the demo from the links you gave. It actually looks like it works good. The example was very basic, but still ran at full speed and looked fine. Its hard to tell how much of the flash player is actually working or whats supported, but its a great start. Maybe there could be a way to wrap the key listeners to the DS so that you could control the flash content using the DS. If the speed was good, you could even use Flash as a DS dev environment. That would be really cool.

Note: Only works in hardware
<br/>
<br/>
Note2: It only plays (for now) this SWF. The problem is that the SWF inside te ROM isint in fact an SWF...
<br/>
The SWF was designed to put more information in less bytes, and must be "uncompressed" before the NDS can playit.

True, but it's hard to construct a .nds file where the startup code doesn't overwrite the GBFS file with 0 bytes when setting up the .bss section. You have to convert the GBFS file to a .s or .o file so that it goes into the .rodata section, and you can't modify the GBFS file once it's in the .nds file unless you make a huge empty GBFS file and use someone's GBFS inserter.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

That doesn't make any sense.. gbamp can do gbfs as long as it's not making direct address calls to the GBA slot.
