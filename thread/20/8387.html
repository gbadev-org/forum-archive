    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So I just got my M3 two days ago and was anxious to get everything working. I flashed my DS with the latest FlashMe (V6) because I hated having the passkey2 dangling out the back. Everything's worked great so far except for ScummVM. When I load it from the M3's menu using FlashMe I either get two black screens, two white screens, or the initial button help shows up on the top screen and it says that it's found a CF reader and it's switching over to using the scummvm.ini file. After that, the bottom screen just stays black. Now, if I plug my passkey2 into the unit with a game in it and hold select while turning on the DS to bypass FlashMe, ScummVM works fine. Anyone have any idea what the deal is, or if this is a known issue?

Thanks in advance guys, and keep up the good work agentq.

So this is an M3 CF?  All I can say is it works fine for me.  What M3 firmware are you using?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, that's what I have.  Make sure you start the NDS with the 'Start' button instead of 'A'.  In older firmware you could use A, but now you have to boot it using 'Start'.  I have no idea why.  :P  That might be why it's in beta. lol<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I'll be damned, pressing 'Start' fixed it. What's the difference between "Start-Open Demo" and "A-Open Game" anyway? So strange... hopefully they'll get it sorted out at some point. Having the touch screen work in the M3 menu as well as icon support would be fantastic too... and not having it constantly ask me if I want to load a saved game. But beggers can't be choosers I guess.

Thanks a Bunch!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
