The Nintendo DS screen is 256x384 with a big split across the middle, whereas the Pocket PC or GP32 screen is 240x320 all as one unit. Pocket PC is clocked faster than the Nintendo DS, which may become important if SCUMM uses GPU-unfriendly graphics transformations, and possibly has more memory as well.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, an older, pruned version of SCUMMVM running mainly the older 16/256-color games might work.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also MAME, which could make special use of the DS' touch-screen and vertical screen lineup. (Remember those old space railshooters that used a horizontal screen setup?)

And, offcourse, who could forget the obvious flood of Game&amp;Watch Emulators we'll be seeing. :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is horrible, because I'd almost rather see a ScummVM port than a fully working SNES emulator. (yeah that's right, and I love SNES with all my heart!)

A lot of people don't have a GBA flash cart or a GBA Movie Player; they use WiFiMe with a modded DS (either a pre-modded one or one modded with a borrowed flash card). In order to load parts from "disk" in such a situation, the interpreter would have to have a Wi-Fi driver, a TCP/IP stack, and a CIFS or HTTP client to pull down the files. If you can get a Wi-Fi driver working, you can earn a <a class="postlink" href="http://sc.tri-bit.com/dswfb" target="_blank">bounty</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

As a long time lurker, DS owner with flashed bios and flash card, and a rabid fan of all of the homebrew development for the DS, it is this project that single-handedly excites me the most right now.
<br/>
<br/>
As someone in their (very) late 20s who played all of the scumm games when they came out (including Maniac Mansion on my good 'ol c64) I can't describe how happy I would be to play any scumm games on my little DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
As for the 'don't expect anything post Monkey Island 2', some of us still pretend that anything beyond Monkey 2 doesn't exist...

The memory problems partly come from the fact that so far the binary itself is 2Mb!  That's half the memory gone before you start.  Also, I expect that ScummVM would be less efficient than the original interpreter was, as all of the ScummVM targets have plenty of memory and therefore memory usage optimization would not have been top on their list.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've just recently started the port and although there's not much to show my progress so far has been very promising. Here's a few shots of it running in iDeaS:

So far I have most of the basic graphics backend functionality implemented as well as input through the touchscreen. Sound is yet to be implemented as well as file system support. After this there shouldn't be much left to do to get at least a scumm game up and working, although I anticipate severe performance issues since the backend stuff I did isn't really taking advantage of the DS' graphics hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
No promises how soon any of these things will be done since, like a few of you mentioned, the DS' filesystem support is very limited (although I do have a few neat idea's about how to get around this problem which are very similar to how my friend rich got NesterDS working). I'll keep everybody up to date when I have more to show though (sorry to be such a tease).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
