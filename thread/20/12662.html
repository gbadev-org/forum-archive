    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, for one, pressing the L button has stopped registering.
<br/>
Secondly, my slot 1 is messed up. If I just put in a game normally, the DS won't recognize it (although sleep still works in code loaded other ways). Usually, if I pull up on the cart a bit, I can play it again. I've tried inserting a Q-tip with rubbing alcohol, but that didn't fix it. Anyone have any ideas?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My slot-1 stoped working properly. With mine, one of the contacts has snapped. Beacuse I could not fix the origional slot, I made a new one (see image). I removed the origional connector by desoldering the 4 tabs then the connector while lifting it with a screwdriver. Then connecting the board to the connector from an old passme using an old ide cable (cut down of course).

The only problem is now the carts stick out real far and my motion sensor doesnt work with it (not sure why).<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
