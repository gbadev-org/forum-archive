    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fueled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other."

i think it would be awesome for someone to port one of the best strategy games ever made, aka Total annihilation to the nintendo DS. read about Total annihilation (TA) here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem with porting it is the fact that there is no source code to TA available. There is an open source project called TA Spring, but it is so much more advanced than TA, that a port would be very difficult if not impossible. What WOULD be nice would be a C&amp;C open source engine (like the Vegas engine is to the Wing Commander genre), and have it ported over to the DS. I believe I saw one, but it's been a while. A quick glance at sourceforge.net and I ran across numerous different projects in that type, including FreeCNC, an open source reimplementation of the original Command &amp; Conquer. I also saw several RTS game engines that looked nicely suited for the DS, but as I'm not really a programmer, I wouldn't know how well it would work.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

Would Stratagus work?

But what I want to see is an open source clone of <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack" target="_blank">the <span style="font-style: italic">other</span> TA</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">How about <a class="postlink" href="http://www.lostgarden.com/game_HardVacuum.htm" target="_blank">Hard Vacuum</a> it has some really cool sounding features. I would love to play it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is a webpage for a former developer for that game that was never released, maybe we could interest him in helping out and providing source files.
<br/>
<br/>
Its a shot in the dark, but I e-mailed him seeing if it was possiple.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
