    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had an idea once for a homebrew that would sniff packets to tell you what Wifi games were being played in a public place. A neat idea but impractical, since you have no way of knowing when you might be able to join in on the game, and no way of interrupting the game to contact the players. (Unless they were pictochatting, I guess)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

That's what the human voice is for. If you sniff an <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing: Wild World</span> session, you introduce yourself to the other players using your AC character's name. Preferably you can dress like your AC character. Or if you sniff <span style="font-style: italic">Pok?mon Diamond/Pearl</span> session, you walk up to whoever is holding a DS and ask: "So I heard you like Mudkip".<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's a cool idea. Does anyone know if there's a NiFi standard procedure of knowing the game that's sending the packets?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you catch the broadcast data being sent when the game is starting up, the messages have clear text description of what game is played. Have never really investigated how the in-game data looks like (if e.g. universal game id's are used etc.) If someone were to make something like this, it'd be probably lot easier to start sniffing the packets first with a PC with Ralink card and work from there to a portable solution.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
