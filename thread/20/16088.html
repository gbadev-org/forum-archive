Will I become irrelevant if I do not buy a doing-business-as form[1], a Mac mini, a KVM switch, an iPod Touch[2], and a developer certificate?

One reason is the lack of mature development tools and environment. I use desmume and its gdb stub for most of my development. If I want to use a DS feature not implemented or buggy in desmume it either means fixing desmume or working round or not using the feature.
<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, I have been playing around with XNA on Windows/Xbox and you get an IDE with debugger. You do have a fee (for Xbox distribution) and you have to work within the framework that Mircosoft provide but you can spend more time developing and less time playing with the development tools.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS is a really fun platform to play around on though. Maybe Nintendo will do something similar to XNA for the next DS and embrace the homebrew community.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

XNA requires managed code. I'm used to writing different front ends for different platforms (see Lockjaw build process), but that works only if all platforms can run back-end game logic written in the same language. In what language should I write my game logic if I need to publish on one platform that runs only C# (XNA), one platform that runs only Java (J2ME phones), and one platform to which no managed language has been ported (DS)? Or would I need to write my own managed language interpreter, which would run on top of another managed language interpreter?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I think at that point, most people would say that it's time to get better tools.  Unfortunately for those of us with budgets, computer-land (and thus software development) is a fast-moving treadmill of upgrades, and that's just a fact we have to live with if we want our projects to stay relevant.

And there's the rub.  Microsoft wants you to be locked into their way of doing things, unfortunately.  Unless you want to completely rewrite your game for multiple platforms, or be Microsoft only, then yeah, you are better off doing what you do now.  Back to the iPhone discussion -- that was another thing that dissuaded me from doing iPhone development....I don't WANT to use a new, different language (objective-C).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you build your own framework on top of XNA, you could maybe port your game to something like mono on non-ms platforms.  Or maybe write the bulk of your game in something like lua or squirrel.  Then you could have a C# XNA driver for ms, and a fast C++ driver for other platforms.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Are most homebrewers really concerned that their projects be "relevant"?
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I plan to continue working on DS projects well beyond the system's lifetime.  In fact, now that I've gotten a little more experience with coding thanks to the DS, I've been thinking about returning to the Dreamcast and Neo Geo Pocket and some projects I started on those systems when I was first getting into homebrew coding.
<br/>
<br/>
I've always thought of homebrew as existing in a world quite separate from the usual succession of console (or handheld) generations.  In fact, that's one of the things I like most about it.  There's at least three new commercial homebrew projects coming out on the Dreamcast this year alone (though I'll be pretty surprised if at least one of them doesn't end up getting delayed into 2009--or possibly all three).

Great question.  I understand where you are coming from, but the mass migration from GBA to DS development seems to indicate that people would rather develop for the new platform with its new users.  Whether that is because of the technical abilities of the DS, or because of the number of users, is another question.

Slightly offtopic, but are there good resources and documentation for learning Dreamcast development?  When I looked a couple years ago, it was pretty sparse.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe I'm alone on this, but I make homebrew pretty much entirely for myself.  I like the creative thinking and problem solving that it takes to do something complicated with a limited set of tools.  It's like any other kind of puzzle.  A crossword puzzle for instance.  I don't think people do crossword puzzles so that they can show off the completed puzzle when they're done, they just do it because their mind wants a workout.  For me it's the same with homebrew.  The puzzle is "can I make the game that I picture in mind's eye a reality?"
<br/>
<br/>
Having something that I can play and enjoy for the rest of my life is almost just like a nice side effect.  It's true that being able to show off the game to other people is nice as well, but I get a lot more satisfaction when showing it to friends or family in person than I do from random strangers on the Internet playing it anyway.

<br/>
I don't think anyone has sold homebrew Dreamcast games on CDR, the commercial releases have always been on pressed CDs and (because of that) as far as I know none of them has ever made a profit.  Last Hope may have since they sold it for $40.
<br/>
<br/>
With DS flash cards available for as little as $12 now, there's no reason someone couldn't do the same thing (i.e. lose a little money or break even, but have a really cool commercial quality product to put on their shelves and sell to people and feel big about) on the DS at this point and with a lot less money needed up front since you wouldn't have to have a 1000+ unit production run.

A bit OT, but you're not alone. I've written quite a bit of stuff for the DS that I haven't released (I haven't released anything.) Partly for want of polish, but mostly because I don't think anyone else would be into it (with the exception of one app that I'm still toying with.)
<br/>
<br/>
Back on topic: Would I prefer to port these to another platform if it were available to me? Most of them, yes. In fact, my best work is poorly suited for the DS's relatively low processing power (but actually does stunningly well on the DS, considering.) It turns out, however, that the ones that I think would be most appealing to others are either best suited to the DS or else no better suited to anything else.<br/>_________________<br/>- nanou</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I understand what you are saying, because I mostly write homebrew for the fun of writing it.  But an additional part of the fun for me is the hope of making something that people will play and enjoy.  Having people actually PLAYING Anguna is almost as fun as writing it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'd still enjoy writing something for a platform that wouldn't get played as much (I'd like to try writing a NES or Atari 2600 game), but I don't think I'd ever enjoy making a game that I knew would never get played at all (like for some theoretical system that only I have).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've already made a few tests for what I hope will eventually be a pretty involved game that will require both a DS Motion Card and Taito Paddle simultaneously.  That'll be about the smallest potential audience for a game that I can think of.
