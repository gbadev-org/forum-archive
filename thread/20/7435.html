Some homebrew (for example, the Hexen and Heretic ports, snesDS) *REQUIRES* the use of a GBA flash cart to store assets on (art, music, and what have you).

Sure, a version could probably be made that reads from the compact flash or something like that, I'm just saying the ds.gba versions there are currently can't be  used on a GBAMP since they aren't expecting a normal FAT file system and aren't designed to use the compact flash like that.  I think they both use GBFS (perhaps this would help with changing it to run from the compact flash?  although I can't know for sure), so they are using some kind of filesysystem, just not something that maps directly onto the compact flash card.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
