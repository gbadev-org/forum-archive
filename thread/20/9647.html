<br/>
can I send a demo of my game from my DS to someone elses the way download games work?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

No. It does not work to send official demos with the M3... Target DS freezes at Nintendo logo.

tepples just answered that. the M3 patcher messes with the RSA signature.

Try one of the other patchers that are generic and work on GBA flashcarts maybe.  Not saying what they are or where to get them.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The signature from a signed demo will only match that demo, hence its purpose. Essentially the signature is an RSA-encrypted hash of the file being sent; anyone can read it but only someone with Nintendo's key (meaning only Nintendo) can create it. If the hash doesn't match the file it won't start. Even if you just change some random unused byte in a signed file it won't match anymore.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If we could find an exploit in the wireless communication that takes place _during_ the multiplayer game of a single-game-card Download Play game. i.e. in the wireless communication between the host code and the child code of the game, not in the nintendo Download Play protocol.
<br/>
<br/>
Then we could capture that signed remote image sent as part of Download Play, the signature and all, and include that in homebrew to be sent for its exploit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Depending on the stage of the download that we attack, what you describe is called WiFiMe2 or PetMe on the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/#future" target="_blank">future passthrough page</a>. But the consensus is that we don't need it until Nintendo finds a way to block NoPass.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Erm the original was downloaded using an M3 (that's the one everyone is using right?) you don't have to patch that to run it on an M3 unless of course people have other versions than the one I'm using that may have already been prepatched by the DLing software??? :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
