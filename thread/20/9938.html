    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been building Nintendo DS's and I have badly screwed up this time.
<br/>
3 of my DS mainboards are dead!
<br/>
I put the battery the wrong way round on all 3 and now they wont even boot or even the led won't come on.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway reviving these boards?
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps you blew a fuse that you could simply bridge on the ds's board? I remeber they were labelled F1 and F2 or something. Though it could have fried the whole board and you cant do anything about it.

<br/>
You could try bridging the blown fuse with solder or something like that</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

F1 and F2 are there and look ok.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Test them with a multimeter first.
<br/>
When a fuse 'blows' it doesn't explode or anything, they can often look fine from the outside.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: They CAN explode but you have to dump so series current through them.
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't the DS have a diode on it to protect against inverse polarity from the battery?<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

When i've put the wires there, i'll insert the battery and put it on and it should work...

Yeah kinda...
<br/>
<br/>
I can get a broken DS for around $33 with only one screen broken and a hinge broken. Everything else works, just buy another one of these and you got your self a new ds with parts to spare... I would only need 1 more broken ds as I need one more screen. Kinda cleaver eh. So im getting these ds's at a steal. Oh and I buy them cases from china "Ninetedo DS" :P<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe it would help you to understand what a fuse is.
<br/>
<br/>
A fuse is just a piece of wire that breaks when too much electricity is run through it.   The idea is that the fuse should break before too much electricity gets to some other components in the DS, thus protecting it.  
<br/>
<br/>
You can bridge the fuse any way you like... all that you are actually doing is replacing the fuse with another wire.   So what you do is unsolder the fuse from the board... this will leave two contacts on the board that probably have a bit of solder on them still.  Cut a very short piece of wire just long enough to stretch from one contact to the other and solder it in place.   If there was solder left over on the contacts from when you removed the fuse, you should probably try to solder the wire on there using only the solder that's on there already... this way you don't over solder and cause a mess.   If you do need some more solder on there, use a very small amount... if you need more you can add another very small amount.  The components are close together so it's a good idea to be careful.
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.   if you're still not sure after reading this, I will be performing this operation sometime this week and I can try to snap a picture of it for you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for the reply, I know what a fuse is btw...
<br/>
<br/>
I've just started soldering things and this fuse is just F**king tiny and I wasn't sure how i was going to do it without burning my hards off!
<br/>
<br/>
BUT!!!.... I have done it and it is working!!!
<br/>
Although im such an ediot, I took the fuse off one of the boards so one is dead (unless i get a new fuse).
