<br/>
<br/>
...Maybe someone can get him to cough up a copy?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I'm an idiot, that PDF is linked at the top of the page you linked. I tried searching for DSgrok, since they seemed to be related, and they both appear to be custom apps.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Peanut is my research framework, it's not in a fit shape to release :D  All of the packet formats, etc... are up on the wiki now, the rest of peanut is just mountains of debug printfs, packet queues, parsing, fragment disassembly / reassembly, etc...  If anyone has any questions about what it does, I'll be glad to answer, but the code itself is 'research-quality'.
<br/>
<br/>
DSgrok is my NDS tool, no real point in releasing it, it does the same thing as NDStool, and doesn't even have the same features (doesn't repack filesystems).  I keep it around and updated because it pretty-prints .NDS info into a html file.
<br/>
<br/>
When I get another DS again and have some time, I'll start working on an active WMB implementation (with a superset of features from Firefly's WMB program and my peanut program).  WMB is a discontinued closed source project by Firefly, but my understanding is that the linux WMBers have gotten pretty far (haven't really been reading the thread on it, but it's long :D).  Firefly also has something unreleased akin to peanut or some set of tools that he used to reassemble WMB captures from multiple pcap logs (peanut only uses the realtime data or a single pcap log (which gets played back through the realtime code), so you need to have no packets that were totally missed by the mediocre ralink card for proper reassembly).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd love to know more about both Peanut and DSgrok, if you'd care to share more and/or send me either of the tools to play with.
