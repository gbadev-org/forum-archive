<br/>
thats one example, weird thing is that i cant see his bottom screen changing brightness, but i think its just the crappy viewing angle.
<br/>
<br/>
also notice that the brightness cannot be turned off if flashed in a normal DS, while it has levels of brightness. it is said while the one in the video have adjustable lighting, not all version of DS can realize this function. i have only seen 2 or 3 cases of success. others include no effect and/or the ability to turn off the light is comepletely disabled. but when flashed back to v6, the off/on function works again.

Sadly it didnt work.
<br/>
I could'nt even turn off the back light.
<br/>
The funny thing is, it turned the brightness button into a volume control button lol
<br/>
If I pressed it once, it would decrease the volume and save it. Pressing it would also make a click sound.
<br/>
After you did that twice or 3 times (can't remember), the sound will be muted. Pressing it again will put the volume to normal.
<br/>
<br/>
[Edit]
<br/>
<br/>
Forgot to mention that the screen was twitching slightly too. So I flashed back to FlashMe V7<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Isn't this variable "brightness" in VJ the color which is displayed on the screen (if you choose medium it is darker than in bright). At least I didn't see any difference when I switched between bright and medium and looking from the side (when you only see the white light and nothing the displays shows)<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here's one more confirmation. I just flashed a brand new pink DS (Nintendogs bundle) - FlashMe recognized the old DS model as DS Lite, telling so on the first line of: FLASHME INSTALLER (DS LITE) - the original firmware is version 5. After the firmware upgrade there's 4 different brightness levels in the main menu screen. The settings between 2-3 seem to be closest to the original DS whereas brightness at 4 is clearly better than the original DS had.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing I didn't realize to try is how the brightness controls work before flashing the thing. Out of habit I just flashed the DS first and then started testing things. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe we could just dump the original v5 version of the DS and flash it, then we flash v7 of flashme lite?:)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Uhm no.  The method used to check if the DS is a DS lite,  is through a bit that is different in PM (Power Management) register 4.   If Bit 6 of PM 4 is 1, then the DS is considered to be a DS lite, otherwise its a normal DS.   In the case of a DS lite, you can change the brightness by writing bits 0 and 1.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe the power management chips weren't working 100% properly, so they just packed them in the old DS's and installed old fw ... :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">True. Companies do that all the time (Intel, AMD, ATi, nVidia, etc.). They take the chips that can't perform properly at the top and remarket them lower where they do operate properly.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also possible that Nintendo just changed components so that they could use similar parts between the two in order to save costs. That's done a lot in business. (Although if you ask me, Nintendo should have done something like they did with the GBA Micro for the power/link connector as to use the same AC adapter for the DS Lite as the Micro and possibly function as a link port for GBA games.) It also happens when a newer, superior chip can be acquired for the same price or less and be integrated without making other changes. Look at all the revs of Sony and other gaming hardware over the years.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also possible that they might have wanted to upgrade the DS like they did the GBA SP, but decided not to because of the extra drain on the battery. Or they decided not to in order to avoid stealing thunder away from the DS Lite's launch. With them still being sold side-by-side, they may still do this later.

I agree! that would be an interesting project for the hardware mod community. I do have a question though, has anyone found a detailed breakdown of the DS with schematics thats free? I found one on portelligent thats supposed to be very detailed with a complete breakdown of all parts in a list form and a schematic of the board, voltage reading, ect. However, they want $2500 and, well, thats just a bit to much for a hobby mod/developer like me. Im not a pro or anything but, I have had a few years of electronics and digital circuits back in highschool. That was a long time ago but, I can RTFM and eventually it comes back to me. 
<br/>
I will post the portelligent link to the order link so you cn see what is offered if anyone is interested but, I didnt want it to look like I am spaming for them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Isn't this variable "brightness" in VJ the color which is displayed on the screen (if you choose medium it is darker than in bright). At least I didn't see any difference when I switched between bright and medium and looking from the side (when you only see the white light and nothing the displays shows)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the DS has a screen brightness control which affects the brightness of the colours displayed, not the backlight. I can confirm that even my V1 DS can do it. (It IS a documented feature after all.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heck, even the GBA can do the same effect with the blending mode register. (A lot of GBA games blend with 75% image and 25% white to get lighter colors on the GBA's idiosyncratically dark screen.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
