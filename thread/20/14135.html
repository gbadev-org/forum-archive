How is this impossible? MoonShell video (.dpg) uses a 256 kbps stream, which is well within the DS's 2000 kbps limit, and it runs on a DS without a Memory Expansion Pak. Or does turning on Wi-Fi slow down the CPU like it does on the PSP?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As absurd as this entire topic seems to be, I agree. DSorganize has already done a fine job of streaming audio, and although it has a few bugs, I have been able to get high-quality streams playing without any problems.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the problem I see is where this television is going to come from. Unless it is broadcast "on-the-air", televised things are usually copyrighted broadcasts, protected legally from un-authorized re-transmission. (Go watch a televised Sports Broadcast for the full message.) We would thus be un-able to legally achieve this over the internet, as we would have no permission whatsoever to re-transmit anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Physically possible, yes I can see this happening. In all actuality, I don't see it coming together.

thats bull, you need to collect TV frequencies online to get em on the DS, means you need servers to collect the TV data, which is stealing TV in other words, only certain channels have internet frequencies, and they arnt too great.

Looks like DS serial? with a tunerchip and antenna attached.

Like ATSC in the US and DVB-T in the EU, this is just a terresrial digital television standard.

"In North America a specification laid out by the ATSC has become the standard for digital terrestrial television. In the United States the FCC has set a final deadline for the switchoff of analog service for February 17, 2009. All television receivers must now include a digital tuner. In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), has set August 31, 2011 as the date that over-the-air analog transmission service will cease in most parts of the country except in Northern Canada.[1] [2]"

Back in Berlin they switched off analog broadcast years ago. You can get the digital boxes (there they use dvb-t) for like 50 bucks now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wish the government would actually ask the whole public whether they wanted to keep analog or switch completely to digital. Now there's no choice of more than 4 channels or not; it more than 4 channels and a digital box/freeview box, or no TV.

<br/>
Which also means my portable TV will become obsolete.<br/>_________________<br/>My favourite DS apps:
