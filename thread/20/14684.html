You can not play GBA games (neither commercial nor homebrew) from a slot-1 card. It is impossible to use the slot from gba hardware and nobody will ever create an emulator to do something that the hardware does already. You will have yo buy a slot-2 card for GBA stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the others, you can try nester, dsnes, snesds, nesds, retrobox, there are others that i cant remember, try the search feature of this site.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

As for the RAM, I wonder if Chishm's <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=139121#139121" target="_blank">Opera RAM program</a> could easily be expanded to work with the 3in1's RAM.  Perhaps Lick's RAM API could be added in?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I stated in the thread I linked to, I personally find it incredibly convenient not to have to pak-swap when I wish to run the web browser.  I keep the Opera DS cartridge in slot-1 and then merely use my Supercard as RAM when needed.  It's quicker and easier than swapping to the official RAM pack all the time.  Plus I can quickly reboot and open DSLinux if I find something I want to save to my card using Retawq or Links.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Because it's something else to carry. But isn't that the pirates' excuse too?

I would imagine that Nintendo was planning to introduce more Game Cards that could make use of the Expansion Pak, just as <span style="font-style: italic">Donkey Kong 64</span> was by far not the only Nintendo 64 game that used the Expansion Pak.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Unlike the N64 expansion pak, the NDS expansion pak is a lot slower than main memory, making it less useful. With the current large game card capacity, data doesn't need to be heavily compressed, so caching of decompressed data isn't an issue. The game cards also have a fairly high read rate, so resources can be streamed in as needed (made easier with the use of DMA). I'd say that the only reason the pak is used by Opera DS is to store downloaded data somewhere, just as DSOrganize caches it to disc. Storing large amounts of not-often-used, dynamically-generated data is the best way to make use of the ram pak.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I just love it when you see people on other forums who talk about similar things then they didn't realise that the Opera game card was supposed to come with something else too!
