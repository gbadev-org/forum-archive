    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone, I've written a nice (in my not-so-humble opinion) drawing app. Here are the main features:
<br/>
<br/>
* <span style="font-weight: bold">2x resolution</span> with antialiased rendering: The actual canvas is 512x384, but it is scaled down smoothly. This lets you draw nice smooth lines and other neat things.
<br/>
* <span style="font-weight: bold">"Smudge"</span> tool ? will smear the colors around, can be used to create a ?watercolor? like effect <a href="http://davr.org/ds2/smooth2.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
* <span style="font-weight: bold">Nice color picker</span> -- looks like a standard one, no need to play around with RGB sliders <a href="http://davr.org/ds2/picker.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
*<span style="font-weight: bold"> "Slow Fill" </span>-- When you use the bucket fill / flood fill tool, it doesn't fill instantly. The ink slowly pours out as long as you hold the pen on the screen. This lets you fill areas that aren't completely enclosed <a href="http://davr.org/ds2/fill.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>
<br/>
* <span style="font-weight: bold">Saving</span> (no loading yet, sorry), works on GBAMP, Supercard CF, Supercard SD, M3-CF, and M3-SD. Outputs standard .png files, which are nice and small, but no loss of quality.
<br/>

<br/>
Future TODO list, in approximate order I am planning to do them:
<br/>
* Easier way to see which tools avaiable, easier selecting tool
<br/>
* Fix eraser when drawing slowly
<br/>
* Larger brush sizes, with more of a 'brushy' style
<br/>
* Loading previously saved images
<br/>
* Do something to fix the "can?t draw to edge of screen" issue
<br/>
* Fix the ?evil gaps?
<br/>
* Finally fix the touchscreen once and for all!
<br/>
* Submit drawings to server over WiFi, browse gallery of submitted drawings over WiFi
<br/>
* Possibly Larger canvases? Zoom and/or scrolling?

That's a bit tougher to add...not sure how I can do it without keeping a copy of the entire bitmap. It takes up 400KB, but I think I still have RAM to spare, so it should work out. In fact, I may have enough ram left for 3 or 4 steps of undo.

Touching 'OK' or pressing L should get you out of the color picker. If not, something has gone horribly wrong.

<br/>
It's possible, however the image size depends on the complexity of the image. My png outputs range from 4KB to 90KB. SRAM is usually 32KB or 64KB, right? So you'd only be able to save some images. Perhaps I could add jpeg compression...you could get a smaller filesize, at a loss of some quality. 
<br/>
<br/>
Next version will have save to SRAM, but if it doesn't fit, it will fail to save...later I'll add jpeg support when saving to SRAM. As long as you don't use the smudge tool, most drawings should fit. Then you would be able to extract the sram.sav using your flashcart software, and simply rename it to .png.

His touchscreen code isn't perfect either. I still get the occasional 'jumping line' on it. He does take into account the pressure, with the downside being the user has to adjust the pressure sensitivity. I might try using some of that code to see if it helps things a bit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even Mario Paint has undo, and it implements it in just this way. If you want to store multiple undo levels, you could store them as run-length encoded differences between images and then allow for more undo levels if individual changes are simple.
<br/>
<br/>
I generally tend to use Mario Paint (apart from its tracker, animation editor, or Gnat Attack) as a standard against which to constructively criticize console based paint programs. Other things from Mario Paint that are not here yet and that I haven't already mentioned: <ul><li>copy and paste </li><li>stamps </li><li>airbrush </li><li>paint bucket tool that works on colors other than white </li><li>different size erasers </li><li>text </li><li>fill screen with color or pattern </li></ul>

That, or convert down to indexed mode with 256 colors (which will distort smudges but still leave everything else largely OK), or shrink by a factor of 2 before saving.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The biggest SRAM in commercial GBA game is 256KB (2048Mb), right?
<br/>
But as far as I can remember not many or any <span style="text-decoration: underline">OLD</span> GBA flashcarts support that size?, but all the existing ones <span style="text-decoration: underline">should</span> support at least 128KB (1024Mb) and possibly bigger size (like 2048Mb). 
<br/>
The goal is to give the saving support for as many as possible, so are there anyone with a flashcart that does not support at least 1024Mbit saves?
<br/>
<br/>
Request:
<br/>
Could you possibly add small power saving, please.

Hm, this reminds me. I had a nice idea regarding pressure a while ago. IIRC, the main problem is the 'pressure' input from the touch screen varies wildly in range between units? A simple calibration system could just add or subtract a user-specified number to this value to get a standard value (0-100%). To set it up you'd just show this number and the current pressure; you just press with varying strength, adjusting the number with the D-pad, until you find a good range.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
dude,
<br/>
thanks to your post i just got a great idea for this app :D,
<br/>
instead of making it so you have to click a button to change from smuge to paint to erase,
<br/>
why not use things that come with the ds :D
<br/>
<br/>
IE:
<br/>
styls=brush,
<br/>
thumb platic peice=erase,
<br/>
cloth from the strap=erase :D...
<br/>
<br/>
you can switch the thumb and cloth but you get the idea...
<br/>
and depending on your pressure you can increase the size,
<br/>
and even include it so you can press the triger and it will keep the size and go from two selected colors,
<br/>
and create inbetweens base on pressure :O
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
that would make this SUCH a damn good tool :D
<br/>
<br/>
ill help organize your to-do list with all the ideas were coming up with.
<br/>
so we can see the progress and your decision on our app mods that you can posible work on :D...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
btw your app is incredible :P<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Touch the starting point of the line, then, keeping the stylus there, touch (with your finger or some other object) the end point of the line. Now lift the stylus, and you should have a relatively straight line.
<br/>
<br/>
It takes a bit of practice getting it right, and it's not perfect, but it's pretty cool :)

(Also shows that the multi-touch example by Dynastab from a while back may be useful in here...)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

DragonMinded's DSOrganize actually has the feature for loading &amp; saving of BMP and PNG, and it came out just a little bit after mine. But he doesn't have fancy drawing algorithms like mine, his is more of a standard ms-paint type interface (line tool, square tool, etc).

<br/>
Hm, this reminds me. I had a nice idea regarding pressure a while ago. IIRC, the main problem is the 'pressure' input from the touch screen varies wildly in range between units? A simple calibration system could just add or subtract a user-specified number to this value to get a standard value (0-100%). To set it up you'd just show this number and the current pressure; you just press with varying strength, adjusting the number with the D-pad, until you find a good range.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
That's basically how the pressure detection in Bafio's chat app works. There's a little meter on the side that you touch to adjust the pressure sensitivity.

<br/>
This may not be feasable: I can't really know what you are touching the screen with, only the pressure. So if you press harder with the pen, it will look the same as if you are pressing with the plastic piece. I don't think you'd like it, if you were trying to draw something, and you accidently pressed a little too hard, and it erased stuff under your pen.
<br/>
<br/>
I might be able to apply it towards line thickness or color intensity though, that might be interesting.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Actually, you don't know the pressure so much as the resistance, which varies inversely with area. Pressing harder with the stylus will touch more area than pressing lightly, but pressing with the thumb piece will touch more area than pressing with the stylus.

<br/>
Audio feedback of the pressure reading (e.g. through changing the volume and playback rate of a scritch-scratch sample or the noise generators) would help the user control pressure/area, substituting for the tactile feedback of drawing on a natural medium.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

keep it a simple photoshop "LIKE" app. graphical menu for changing tools (DARKSTAR_TYPE_MENU) on top screen, touch hotspot to get it to switch from top to bottom ( LIKE DARKSTAR MENU) 
<br/>
<br/>
Tools needed to make a USEFUL Drawing Application:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>Pen (standard dot 3 sizes)
<br/>
Brush (changeable brushes/sizes)
<br/>
Line tool ( 3 thicknesses)
<br/>
Shape tool ( Circle, Oval, Triangle, Square )
<br/>
Air Brush ( different pressures and sizes)
<br/>
SMUDGE ( isn't the most useful but allows for great effects)
<br/>
Erase ( no explanation needed )
<br/>
SAVE Function 
<br/>
Load Function ( helps if you are making something worth saving but are too tired to keep drawing)
<br/>
UNDO function ( like, when you mess up, DUH........)
<br/>
Bucket tool ( allow for Fast flood or slow, based on how long pen is down)
<br/>
Magnify or Zoom Function ( allow for fine tuning image)
<br/>
Cut and Paste ( would be nice to see but not needed)</ul>

tools is pretty much all this app needs, too much thought to these apps tends to kill them off. It always causes high hopes for these apps then people are never happy with something cause they ( including me ) iare expecting more.

Ok. I have G6 Flash 4096Gbit.

SRAM file size is 256KB (so it's 2048Kbit).

I saved the SRAM and renamed it to PNG and it worked. =) Wow, this is amazing.
<br/>
<br/>
Can you make it to use the full 256KB if the picture needs?
<br/>
<br/>
Or possible to make it recognize the SRAM size (good idea)... or settings section where you could select which flash cartridge you have (not so good idea).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also have XROM and Flash Advance Xtreme cartridges, but I have no time to test them today.

EDIT: No My FAX CART does not fit, haha. I won't modify it.

<br/>
The size of the window into SRAM is only 64KBytes. In order to access more than that, I have to send special commands to the flash cart, and these commands are different for each cart. These commands are not known for all brands of carts. Also, I don't know if I can detect the cart type. So you may have to select it.
<br/>
<br/>
I think a better solution would be for me to reduce the image quality in order to fit. 
<br/>
I have three things I can do:
<br/>
1. Reduce image to 50% (output file will look the same as on the DS screen, instead of double-size)
<br/>
2. Convert to 8bit color instead of 24bit
<br/>
3. Compress with JPEG
<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably make it try different combinations until the file fits into SRAM, and as a last resort, keep lowering the JPEG quality until it fits.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A 50% size reduction plus conversion to 8-bit is guaranteed to work, as that ends up as 49152 bytes of image plus 768 bytes of palette plus PNG overhead even if the image is not compressible at all. (Smudges should compress OK even in PNG if the program makes an optimized palette and sorts it by increasing luma.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nice app but it does still need some work. Like all DS apps I tend to get random lines appearing as soon as I touch the screen, especially near the center and always going from the point I touched to the left of the screen. It also doesn't recognize fast movements, IE if I write I have to write really slowly. I guess this is an attempt to cut down on touch screen problems but it really just makes things worse. I was hoping to use it for autographs at Anim? North, but with those problems, I'll have to do it the old fashioned way.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW every program I've yet tried has that same line problem. It's not the problem most people have, though; it tends to work fine near the edges, but not in the middle. O_o<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that the line function is not nearly as needed as layer support. If not layer support, though, a mask function that lets you draw on top of every color save for a selected color, or the other way around (only within the selected color.)

I insist, though! He needs to smooth out the rough edges before he adds any more features.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just wish that the smudge tool work in the direction the stylus is moving. seems when you go to use it is smudges from top to bottom only :(
<br/>
<br/>
would be nice to gave an animate option, which takes a busch of images made with Draw3 and frames them together.

I know what onion skinning is, since I use it a lot when animating in Flash, but what is dope sheeting?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its shows the frames as a list. if you're animation with paper you plan out the key frames and timing with it, it's essential for lip-syncing in traditional animation. when you're using digital animation you use it more for spacing and timing, for holding frames and extending exposures. toonboom has perfect dope sheeting (shit line tho). basically lets you keep your frames organised and potent.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">like I said, I am not going to get all technical, If I was I would just use 3ds Max and make something worth watching ( since I do that kind of stuff ) I am just hoping to use the DS and DS ONLY. if the tool isn't on the ds then I will not be using it. 
<br/>
<br/>
anyways, what I can do in Draw3 is fine, the only problems is sot really being able to line up each frame. 
<br/>
<br/>
But I am now going to come up with a main character and two or three others, a very short story line, and an ending that will be worth watching.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
one problem I found with Draw3, after I save 20 pictures of so, the app crashes. funny huh?<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

but anyway, there is actually a homebrew animation thing for the ds called flip book, or maybe flipper book.

I mean, not just in animation, just in general.

Should be a competition or a dump-spot for that :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

What adaptor device are you using? EZ4? Supercard? M3?

I haven't heard many reports on miniSD compatibility, I would imagine it would be the same as standard SD (I've gotten reports of success on Supercard SD and M3 SD)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Oops, sorry, should have said...it's the M3 MiniSD.  I'm starting to think you're right, and it <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> actually work!  I can draw on the screen, I can bring the colour picker up with the shoulder buttons...but beyond that I'm at a loss.  I've checked your blog again and can't see any instructions, how do I use the fill modes and such?  I'm pressing all the buttons to no avil.  Perhaps I'd better track back through this thread.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure the top screen is displaying properly, it's a white screen with a small coloured box in the bottom right corner?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The top screen should be displaying the stats as you go: Tool, size, color, etc. That bottom corner is the currently selected color.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
