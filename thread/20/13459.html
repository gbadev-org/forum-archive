    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, NO$GBA supports running the DS firmware if you place it in its directory as firmware.bin, then change the entry point in the options to be "GBA BIOS" or something like that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That doesnt seem to be working. Do I need to convert the .bin to a .nds/.ds.gba? would such conversion be more than just renaming it?
<br/>
<br/>
I cant run it on my ds either (strange?) renamed to firmware.nds doesnt load from either my r4, or gbamp.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I backed up my firmware with DSLinux and followed chuckstudios's instructions and was able to access the firmware (though it didn't launch the .nds file I originally double-clicked on).  Perhaps you need the DS BIOS files as well, or maybe the GBA BIOS must also be present (I have all three BIOS files in the folder).  I don't really know why it isn't working for you.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  it appears that you must have BIOSNDS7.ROM and BIOSNDS9.ROM in the no$GBA directory for the firmware to launch correctly, based on my limited testing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Heh, now can you hack it to use Rebootlib or whatever to restart instead of powering off, and kill the health warning? :-p

I assume im correct in thinking 'technically not legal', then I assume it is illegal, but we do have flashme etc. I see no difference.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
