    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sorry if this question has been asked a lot.  i looked thru the stickies and did a few searches, but didn't really find anything (or maybe i just didn't look deep enough).  i actually dont have my DS yet (i just ordered it off ebay :D), but i assume you cant just save games to it without any modding of some sort.  so my question is, what will i need to download/buy to save games to my DS, if its even possible?  thanks in advanced for your responses. :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While I believe there's a preliminary service debuting in Japan that lets the Wii send Download Play demos to the DS (or something to that effect), no such official service exists in North America.

What types of games do you wish to download to your DS?  You can use WMB to send some homebrew games to your DS over Download Play if you have a compatible wireless card.  You can also buy a homebrew device to store these homebrew games more permanently on some form of removable storage (or internal memory).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i assume demos are games that aren't the full version?  sorry, im ignorant here. :(
<br/>
<br/>
my ds will be coming with nintendogs and frogger.  and i definitely wanna get brainage 1 and 2.  was just curious if there's a way to save them either to the ds unit itself, or maybe some other media.  i thought i read about DS's being able to read SD cards, but maybe i was mistaken.  if they can read SD cards, is it possible to save these games to SD cards so that i dont have to swap out cartridges?  i assume i would also need some sort of new OS on the ds too if saving to SD cards were possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Precedent on forum.gbadev.org, as I understand it, is as follows: <ul><li>You MAY discuss copying commercial DS games' Download Station demos (which are smaller than 4 MB) to SD cards. </li><li>You MAY discuss copying commercial games' saved data (e.g. your town in <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing: Wild World</span>) to and from SD cards. </li><li>You MUST NOT discuss copying entire commercial DS games (which are usually 8 MB or larger) to SD cards. This is called "warez talk" and is forbidden even on <a class="postlink" href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com/" target="_blank">September 19</a>. Even if such copying does not violate local law, it's off-topic on forum.gbadev.org. </li></ul>

It might be legal; I make no judgment on that. It's just not what this forum is for.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Where can you read this in your games' originally purchased booklets?

If you are referring to your local law, read tepples' 3rd point again.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
