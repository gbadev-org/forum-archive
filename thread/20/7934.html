    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I apologise if this is me talking rubbish- I can't programme (well, I know a bit of PHP) or do anything useful, I just know a few programming buzzwords and drop them into conversation to try and impress people.

I've recently got American Sk8land though, and have been playing online. In the game, you can upload and download "graffiti" and skateboard designs to the Sk8land website (it links it into your user profile).
<br/>

My avatar was created in the in-game paint-esque application:

<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, you cannot use the website to upload your own pictures from other sources, and then download to your DS... but I have a theory. Surely it is possible to simulate/spoof a DS connecting and uploading, and injectiing your own image instead?
<br/>
<br/>
I've used ethereal to capture some packets of me uploading my images (I believe there are four of them) to the Sk8land website- due to me being a horrible n00b, I havn't managed to filter out the other traffic on my network- but the stuff I'm interested in is stuff coming from 192.168.2.5, my Nintendo DS- I reckon the big bunch of "[PSH, ACK]" packets, whatever they are is the image itself being uploaded.
<br/>
<br/>
My point is, could any of you knowledgable elite hackers decode an image or number of images from what's there? This'd be a first step towards <span style="font-style: italic">uploading</span>... figuring out how the images are stored. On the website they appear as gifs, and I suppose the danger is they're some sort of encoded proprietary format on the DS itself.
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://jamesomalley.co.uk/misc/uploadingimage.dump" target="_blank">Click here to download it (you probably have to save target as)</a>. I called it ".dump" so the server or whatever doesn't think that it's a directory. It opens in whatever Ethereal's default format is.

Reckon anything can be done with this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">two bytes isn't bad, just make the file with every variation possible and try each one till you figure it out.  You should be able to do that faster than it took me to post this unhelpful comment lol.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
