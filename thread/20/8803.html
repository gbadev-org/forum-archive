    <h4>#74402 - MrAdults - Sun Mar 05, 2006 1:36 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since it's been dead for months, and the update is significant, I figured people would like to know. A what's-new list:
<br/>
<br/>
-Moved from devkitPro r14 to r17, fixing a lot of common bugs in the process (this should take care of the swapped screens problem some people have as well).
<br/>
-General speedups. Lots of them.
<br/>
-Low detail mode from Doom incorporated (made low detail versions of all of Hexen's rendering functions). ARM versions of col/span low detail rendering also included (which are around 13% faster than their GCC O3 versions).
<br/>
-On-demand texture patch resizing, in order to lessen memory use (should solve any remaining Z_Malloc errors, especially with those huge animating textures).
<br/>
-Fixed the info screen displaying unreadable junk on the main screen (but it's still info from the PC version, just think of it as authentic!).
<br/>
-Added an invert look option in the menus.
<br/>
-Tweaked touchscreen code more to make it more errorproof (it has always worked fine on my hardware, so this isn't 100%).
<br/>
-When errors occur, the game will display them instead of stopping and spinning in place, so that you can go to my forums and yell at me about them (if someone else hasn't already).
<br/>
-Fixed mana bars not rendering empty space on the bottom screen.
<br/>
-Proper loading screen for the initial load sequence.
<br/>
-Removed the need for cat from the wad-building process.

Source is still included, and might prove a useful learning tool if you are looking for a way to integrate assembly into your project for optimizations. A Doom port could be made quite easily from this base and it would run very smoothly as well. I have noticed no one has actually ported Doom (or did I miss it?), which is actually pretty weird when there's already a Heretic and a Hexen.

The wad is basically one of the original game files which contained a lot of the game data.  You need to own the original hexen to have it, and no you can't download it :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd like to, but I don't have the hardware to test it. If someone with the hardware made the changes and tested it and handed them over to me, I'd be glad to merge them into the codebase.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't plan on starting up any new projects soon (busy with work, and I'd rather spend my DS-devoted time improving my existing stuff).

No, since the resulting nds.gba with the wad tends to be around 21MB, it wouldn't fit on a 128mbit cart.

It is the wad file included with the full PC/DOS version of Hexen. :)

Hexen would certainly require other potential changes, as well as probable tweaking to the conditions in which zone allocations are flushed from memory and loaded from ROM again when needed. That is not a big deal on a flash cart, but would be more significant on other devices.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I am not going to stab blindly at an implementation when I don't have any hardware to test on. As I said, if someone wants to do a proper and tested implementation, I'll be happy to merge their code (and of course credit them for it). I also won't stop you from buying me a GBAMP!
