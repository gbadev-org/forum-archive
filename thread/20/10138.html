You may be able to change some values on the compiled nds.. maybe reverse engineer it somewhat.
<br/>
<br/>
but I don't think you'll be able to get complete (.net reversed) style source :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

my idea is to get the Flip.nds app to be able to save animations.<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The short answer is no, you can't get the source from the nds file. Although if you are talking about Flipbook.nds I might be able to help you out...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just started making an animated (short) film on DS and that is a great app for it. I have the PRODUCTIONS scene almost ready.....
<br/>
<br/>
just a quick animation showing DS Productions with a orbe thing with a moving light casting a shadow. its just a pain making it and recording it . it would be awesome to save. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am so focused on getting a 5 min short film(animated) made with the DS and only the DS
<br/>
<br/>
I will take anyhelp I can get for software.  THANKS ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well if you're looking for the source, then I guess you're in luck because here it is:

Please note that it's very old and in places very sloppy, I know that at the very least some of the touch code would have to be changed to work with the newest libds.
<br/>

Someone alerted me that there was still interested at the dslinux forum, I don't know if it's coindicence or what, but they might do something with it there as well:
