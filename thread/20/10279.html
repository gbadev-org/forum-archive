    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I want to know how can you create and sell/publish/distribute homebrew DS games, here are a few ideas, but there is also cost, availability, compatibility, I wonder if anyone has any tips on these things
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>Sell a CF card with the software on it, use SuperCard to read it
<br/>
</li><li>Rewrite a Datel MaxMediaLauncher card with the software you wrote (and cut the notch to the correct size) (is this even possible? some people think so)
<br/>
</li><li>Send it to a publisher, publish to DS card
<br/>
</li><li>Send to publisher, publish to GBA card and use Datel MaxMediaLauncher or firmware upgrade to run the software in DS mode
<br/>
</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you do send it to a publisher, you're going to have to port it from libnds to libnitro. Option 4 is what the "real pirates" have been doing, but then it takes us back to how to find one-time-program GBA carts.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
