    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, this started as apc application for some shader code i wanted to test... but now i used the same technology and ported it to the ds.
<br/>
<br/>
In the demo you have 100% 3d waves with fluid physics both on the water and on the camera( camera bounces on water using the height of the verties and their normals)
<br/>
<br/>
the waves can be of inifinte complexity
<br/>
the demo shows 25*25 grid (each square has two tris so its pushing 1250 verts leaving about 800 for the rest of the game)
<br/>
<br/>
the demo runs at 14 fps, the waves run on fixed point but some uneeded byte shifts can be taken out, the speed decrease is exponential since its a grid so smaller / less dense grids can run at 60fps
<br/>
<br/>
skybox looks pretty nice and free from wobbling and alising, seams etc... because its not 3D
<br/>
<br/>
its a 2D Exrot BG blended with the 3D layer
<br/>
<br/>
the small mesh in the demo show a early version of a blender mesh exporter which exports:
<br/>
<br/>
-vertex colours (whoohooo baked radiosity instead of memory eating lightmaps)
<br/>
-uv coords
<br/>
-vertex coords
<br/>
-normals
<br/>
<br/>
this is very early and i hope i might get some assembler experts to help :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DPAD= move
<br/>
Touch screen= look
<br/>
Tap i say tap the start button for waves , long presses make huge waves which can be disorientating

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">would using the DMA to copy vertex buffers of the waves be much faster than memcpy? if so i can get a big speed boost.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

At first I thought it was broken because I was facing away from the wave area, so i had to move over to it.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks guys
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see more critics so i can improve it.
<br/>
<br/>
any bugs or bad physics/ improvements please report it 
<br/>
<br/>
i would also be happy if soem assembler's helped out</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway,I failed trying to get ontop that cube :(<br/>_________________<br/>He who laughs last, obviously didn't get the joke.

If at first you don't succeed, redefine success.

<br/>
<br/>
hehe that cube doesnt have collision detection,and the waves are cel shaded thats why they look cool.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
