It says "DeviceWritePacket() failed" repetitively.

Can anyone with xp classic or x64 confirm? or am I the only one to get that bug?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember someone else posting about this problem, but I can't seem to find the thread.  My solution (and the one someone else posted) is to bring up the Windows Device Manager, disable the card, and then re-enable it.  That should allow it to work again.  You could also just restart, but this should be quicker.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's a problem with the special wifi-driver. They aren't made for stand-by. So you have to unload the driver and load it again. This can be made by removeing the hardware (PCMCIA). Is there any equivalent to rmmod/modprobe in win?
<br/>
<br/>
It's no bug, it's a missing feature (and I don't think it's worth the coding time...).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the same issue with my PCMIA card. There are tools like devcon (MS$) and deveject (some german tool, might only be useful for drives).
<br/>
But with PCMCIA it's easier to replug it :)
<br/>
I've mentioned this earlier and I think Firefly should be able to make a fix for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Happens to me after hibernating (XP Pro).
<br/>
<br/>
To get it going again without a reboot, just go into device manager and disable then reenable the device - that seems to work for me, anyway</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
