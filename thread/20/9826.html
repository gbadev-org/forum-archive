    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think to myself if there is a way to mount a PC-HD as a Network-Disk accessible from the DS or the other way around to mount CF/SD (inserted in the DS) as a Network-Disk accessible from PC ?
<br/>
<br/>
This would give us the possibility to access mp3s, pictures, dpgs directly from moonshell without copying it first to CF/SD.
<br/>
Or the other way to write programs, games etc. directly to CF/SD without the need to insert CF/SD in a Cardreader.
<br/>
<br/>
I think this would really be a very hard task, but who knews... maybe someone with good knewlege of such things could take this as an idea !

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If your HD is connected to a running PC, that's not a big deal. Just write an app, that downloads files from a webserver or ftpserver and run one on your PC.
<br/>
For the other way, you would need a ftp server on your DS (or samba or whatever), which can be done, but would be more to code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think what you are after is a port of Samba to the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually porting it shouldn't be too difficult, or you could even run it from DSLinux.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, I really don't think the DS is powerful enough to run any standard build of Samba, so you would either have to create your own SMB/CIFS client and server, or attempt to streamline Samba for the task as much as humanly possible.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be a lot easier to do an FTP client/server on the DS, which won't be as elegant as just doing drag and drop with Samba, but it will get the job done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While a port of Samba would be nice, I think a simpler, faster, solution would be an FTP server port to the DS. There was an app shortly after the release of the first WiFi lib called WiFi transfer that did something similar. It ran a Jaava server on the computer and ran code to connect to that server on the DS. It only worked for GBAMP CF, and hasn't even been talked about since January 29th, so we need an update to that, or something new... Also, it never worked with WEP as it came out before the WiFiLib supported it.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest issue with this, moreso than just porting some Samba or FTP server code is having it successfully write to an SD/CF card.. CF seems to have good drivers for it, but even then, people have difficulty writing apps to support that, and SD... I've yet to see any homebrew write to an SD card effectively, and flawlessly.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I'm not very familiar with using Samba, what would be required to have the DS look for Samba shares on the local network? I've been thinking about all the possibilities of transferring data from some source to the DS, and I *think* the most convenient would be to allow the DS to browse Samba shares, and drag and drop, or select to copy, etc..
<br/>
<br/>
it WOULD be interesting to supplement something like Win2DS with this functionality. Imagine setting up a VPN with your server sitting at home.. you've set up a network in some other location somewhere in the world that connects the two networks, you use Win2DS to connect to your server at home, modify some files, i.e. like adding pepsiman's loader to an .nds homebrew file for the M3, then, instead of even backing out of Win2DS (or some other alternative), select the newly modified file and copy it from the server to your DS...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking with a modified VNC client with some sort of Samba client software built in, you could do all this without having much more than just a good network setup at home and something like RealVNC setup on your server (which I always run anyway).<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

<br/>
<br/>
Managed to mount an NFS share on my PC using wifi and DSLinux, could navigate, list and cat stuff, I think write support worked as well.
<br/>
<br/>
SAMBA would almost certainly be too huge I think.
<br/>
The alternative is tftp I suppose, someone did do a server somewhere I think.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A stand alone NFS client would definitely be within the realm of possibility for the DS hardware, but I don't think that is going to help many Windows users. They have Services for Unix, but it isn't too great.

FTP is probably the only thing that will please everyone, and is probably the easiest to do as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Only in reverse?
<br/>
So you have some flexible cable to plug into your CF/SD slot, that leads to a hard drive the other side? (with a seperate power supply obviously, like those from removeable hard drives).
