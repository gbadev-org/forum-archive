    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does your file compress the same when using the DKA tool <span style="font-weight: bold">gbalzss.exe</span> as stated above?  If so, you can use the source of that tool in your application (or call/pipe it from/to your program).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
