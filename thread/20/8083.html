Well, its a really sad attempt at standardizing a "data" folder for all games.

Notice it goes:

I'll use it, I can't make everyone else. Just trying to reduce the number of folders on my CF root. I'd be perfectly fine with changing it if someone wants to suggest something else, but it'd be nice to have a sort of community wide standard :)

Is there a queue on the top screen? If its blank, you're still using 0.1A binaries. Otherwise, maybe its the card reader?

Hmm...that's a good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
However I'd almost prefer to have the directory relative to keep the windows type system destruction from happening:
<br/>
<br/>
/games/LuminDS/:
<br/>
LuminDS
<br/>
data/
<br/>
<br/>
/apps/MoonShell/:
<br/>
moonshell
<br/>
data/
<br/>
<br/>
I guess the extra work then would be the path discovery to correctly change the directory context.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd use relative paths if the directory weren't reset to / when the rom was loaded :/
<br/>
<br/>
If someone figures out a quick way to discover the correct directory, I'll implement it. But I'm not going to write code that gropes the whole CF card trying to find the folder. Just imagine how long that would take on a 1gb+ CF card with lots of small files O.O<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fireslash.net" target="_blank">FireSlash.net</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nope, didn't notice..  Maybe if we can nudge other developers into that direction it would help.. I'll keep an eye out..  games with data directories are still pretty new.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I guess here's some of your to-do list: <ul><li>add some indication that you need to press A at the menu instead of touching </li><li>make other menu options work </li><li>make both rotate buttons work </li><li>don't require two presses of the down key to move the piece from the top row to the floor </li><li>add sound and music (there seemed to be data, but it didn't work on FW2 and PassMe1 and GBAMP CF and the game as _boot_mp.nds) </li><li>add indication that the pieces on the top screen are the next pieces, with rightmost being immediately next </li><li>add "destroyer" blocks </li><li>pause when Start is pressed </li><li>add scoring </li><li>add progressive difficulty </li><li>add skin cycling </li></ul>
