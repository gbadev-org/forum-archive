    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you've ever got help from Tepples in the past and you can afford some spare cash then help out and donate some $$$.
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples is always offering help here, so I'm starting a thread to ask fellow coders to lend a hand.
<br/>
<br/>
That's right Tepples dosn't have a DS, and computer work in his area is hard to find so he can't afford to buy one himself.
<br/>
<br/>
I have started things off by donating $50 to the "Tepples DS fund". I am currently "between work" so it's the best I can do at this time.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, I can't believe Tepples doesn't even have a DS! How can he work without the real hardware? Anyway, Tepples has been a great help to me, so I donated $10 to the cause. I know its not a lot, but if everyone pitched in, its really not that bad. 
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: On the site it said donations for PSP and DS. I just want to be clear that my money was intended for a DS not PSP.

My page lists a passthrough, but how can I make sure that by the time I get my DS, Nintendo doesn't start shipping the North American gray or blue DS with the same firmware as the Japanese red DS?

<br/>
I had no idea you had to have a Premium account just to accept Credit Card funds. That is really stupid.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the point of announcing the donation in this thread is not to be trendy, but to help keep a running tally of how much money left is needed.

   Well I didn't see any responses, so what is the logical thing to conclude? Anyway, I have donated to similar causes in other forums and everyone always states that they donated so, as Headspin mentioned, there is a running tally of donations (ie DS wifi bounty). The more people that donate, the more likely it is that other people will donate. If no one posted a reply at all, this topic could've ended up on the bottom of the list and forgotten. And I dont see why you felt so insulted. If you did indeed donate, then you would have known I was not refering to you at all. I was mostly talking about the kind of trolls that surf the forums constantly requesting things and asking questions that are answered in the stickies without ever giving back to the community. Obviously if you donated, you are not with that crowd. I was not meaning to say anyone here was cheap. I was just trying to motivate some people to join the cause.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately, the psychiatric community has found a strong correlation in people between skill in the logical reasoning and dedication needed for computer programming and lack of skill in understanding unwritten rules of connotations. Often this difficulty presents so profoundly that psychiatrists consider it to be a mild form of autism and call it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.udel.edu/bkirby/asperger/aswhatisit.html" target="_blank">Asperger syndrome</a>.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I was mostly talking about the kind of trolls that surf the forums constantly requesting things and asking questions that are answered in the stickies without ever giving back to the community. Obviously if you donated, you are not with that crowd. I was not meaning to say anyone here was cheap. I was just trying to motivate some people to join the cause.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
I suppose it was logical to conclude that.  I didn't, but we are different folks.
<br/>
<br/>
also you said "no one else" donated.  Which implies that you were talking to anyone on the board who viewed the post (or at least that's the sentence implication).  And you pretty much called people cheap, just because they didn't say anything.  But it's cool, because you didn't mean it to be insulting.
<br/>
<br/>
Tepples.  I love how you post links to stuff.  It's good reading. :)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: And I understand that my nit pick on "no one else" is partially if not exactly what the article was talking about. I'm just a stickler and a bad speller sometimes :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, you can't choose to pay taxes or not, but you can choose to upgrade your PayPal account.  I still suggest that you create a cash only account for people that want to send checks or cash (like I did) so that PayPal can't suck $2.00 or whatever from our donation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I picked up the Super PassKeys because they are just a commercially packaged PassMe at a cheap price.  They actually only cost me $2 more then building PassMes.. and I don't have to build them!

w/o box is cheaper for shipping as they will fit into smaller envelopes. $1 vs $4 U.S. and $5 vs $9 for international.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I hope that your work on the ds scene can give you some contacts for getting a real work in games or embeded systems programmation.

BTW Played Lumines on the PSP for first time today, really liked it. Are you gonna implement the challenge mode to progress getting more skins/music.

    <h4>#56074 - tepples - Wed Oct 05, 2005 9:58 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">An exact homebrew clone of Lumines will never happen, as for one thing, I can't afford to license the official music or the official backgrounds, and for another, each screen on the DS is still smaller than the PSP screen. The closest I can get to directly copying Lumines is the parody aspect of the current version of the "Shinin'" skin in game left of Luminesweeper.
<br/>
<br/>
Challenge mode of Lumines is flawed, as not a lot of people have an hour straight to play a handheld game. Meteos did it better: five minute play bursts (yes, I still suck at that game), and then you buy new skins and stuff with the blocks you pushed off the top.
<br/>
<br/>
Template for GBA mode is <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/lu/template/" target="_blank">here</a> (EDIT: fixed). The DS mode template will likely be identical save for an extra 16 pixels at the top and bottom and an extra 8 pixels at the left and right.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
