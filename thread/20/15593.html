    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So, I apologize in advance, as this is a bit off topic from home-brew. my main purpose in posting this problem in this particular forum is out of sheer respect for the brainpower, and understanding of hardware that floats around in this forum. if a mod see's it fit to close this topic, by all means...
<br/>
<br/>
So, my DS lite has started turning off and on completely randomly. it turns on when it's not even being touched, and off the same way. I'll be listening to music with it on the shelf, and it will turn off on it's own with no indication of low battery. pretty much everytime I look over at it, the little green light is blinking, and when I open the screen up - sure enough - there's the familiar bing-bing and a health warning screen.
<br/>
<br/>
at times it's so bad, it'll literally turn off and on and off and on over and over at random. 
<br/>
<br/>
SO, it's well used (aprox. 3 years old), but I'm not apt to just give up on it. I want to open it up and see what I can do, see if anything obvious is wrong. with the technical know-how going on here, does anyone have any ideas of the bat as to where I can start? I haven't tested to see if it does this while charging - as that might indicate some problem with the battery.
<br/>
<br/>
one quick question, does anyone know whether the system powers on when the battery is first connected to the system? this would lead me to believe the contacts might be a little off, and every time the battery connects it might power on the system. is that likely at all?
<br/>
<br/>
any thoughts, sirs?<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
