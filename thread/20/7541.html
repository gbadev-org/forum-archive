    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In other words.. No.. The only way you would be able to use GBA MP with PassMe2 is if someone was able to hack the GBA MP (as, there are traces from the SRAM pins going to the CPLD on the GBA MP) to "pretend" to have SRAM and either provide the SRAM jumps, or pull it off the CF, etc.

<br/>
It would be nice to see happen.. but I doubt anyone is working on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There might be some game that has some instructions to jump to GBA ROM space, but that chance is very small.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Daigass≈ç Band Bros. loads expansion data from a ROM Option Pak in the GBA slot. Perhaps if we could buffer-overflow this then we could get JamMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

JamMe is a product of tepple's imagination :)
<br/>
So unless he is going to try implementing it (if it's even possible), you are out of luck.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Great list, tepples. I would add explanations to non-obvious terms like CPLD and SRAM. Additionaly, I also sell PassMe2 :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Done. I've added ppflash as well. But why am I getting an ad for a GameCube related promotion?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
