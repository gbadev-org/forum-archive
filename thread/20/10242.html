    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Homebrew on DS Lite is no harder than homebrew on a DS classic with v4 firmware. You can use a NoPass and a GBAMP v2 to install the latest version of FlashMe (see the stickies in DS Flash Equipment). Don't worry about losing light adjustment, as if FlashMe detects your power management chip as being the one used in the Lite, it will install a version of the firmware that supports light adjustment.
<br/>
<br/>
The major difference between the DS classic (with recent firmware) and the DS Lite is that the DS Lite's firmware implements DS Download Play more strictly, which interferes with using FireFly's wmb.exe with signed demos.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

DSL's LCD is sooo much brighter, it's worth it just coz of the screen alone.

Everything else about the DSL is same. (Other than size , weight , charger)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm.. When I first saw the DSL, I thought it was the stupidest thing ever.. Than, some guy released a FlashMe video that was just rediculous.. so I had to buy one to update my site(s)..  Now that I have one.. I use it the most.  Sure, the brighter screens are nice.. but not really needed..  Sure.. it's smaller and more compact.. but.. I don't know..  I just like the feel of it better..  Probably because it is incased in clear plastic?  I don't know..  I just like it better.. and the placement of the Start and Select have not been an issue at all, which again.. I thought was totally stupid when I first saw it.
<br/>
<br/>
So, basically, I went from hating it (before owning one) to loving it (after purchasing) and use it all the time now.  And really.. I don't completely know why.. :/
<br/>
<br/>
As for shorting SL1, I don't know how anyone could have a problem with it, as long as they wrap whatever they are using with tape to insulate it.. as I think it is really shorting against the case.. which doesn't make sense at all as it is plastic, which is normally an insulator.. but, after looking at it.. I doubt people were hitting the screw next to it.. it's pretty confined/seperated.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, unless their DS-Lite is totally different from mine.. there is no way.
<br/>
<br/>
I look down the hole.. and on the top and bottom side.. the plastic goes all the way to the circuit board.  On the right.. it almost goes all the way.  but the space between SL1 and that potentiometer is to far for it to be shorting with that..  I can't see how anything could be stuck at such an angle that it would be able to touch anything other than SL1..
<br/>
<br/>
If I look at the left side.. it doesn't go all the way down to the circuit board either, but I can't see anything next to it... again.. I don't know if you could put anything in at an angle enought to short against anything other than SL1.. 
<br/>
<br/>
So.. what's left?  I don't see a multimeter around me... and I'm to lazy to get up to check the conductivity of the case..  I personally have no idea what is causing it to turn off.. but I used my old ground down nail in the hole.. which, being a perfect fit for the hole.. has no way of touching anything other than SL1 and the case.. and was able to make the DS-Lite turn off.. so I'm still thinking that the case might have a conductive quality..

<br/>
IMHO, number 1 on that list is about the only legitimate reason to bother with FlashMe.  The idea that you'll wear out your NDS slot is laughable... last I checked, every time I wanted to change regular NDS games, I had to switch the cart out.
<br/>
<br/>
As for download play, I'm not aware of any NDS developers using Wifime as their primary development mechanism, though I'm very likely mistaken on that front... it's certainly convenient, but it requires you to go through the rigamarole of tracking down a wifi card with a very specific chipset.  I fail to see how it's worth the hassle, especially since you must already own a programmable cart of some description in order to install flashme in the first place.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the recovery capability, for people who are primarily doing homebrew *development*, the recovery function is only marginally useful.  Speaking for myself, I spend more time writing code for my DS than I do downloading it.  And if I were to run downloaded code on an unflashed DS, I'd either compile it myself, or I make sure someone else has run it first.  *shrug*
<br/>
<br/>
But, with all that said, I own an original DS that's been flashed, but only because I started DS dev'ing before commerial PassMe type devices were really widespread, and so wifime + flashme was the easiest way to go.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I did say "very likely". :)  Though, I maintain that it's still a pain... I had to search all over the place for a wifime-compatible card, and was fortunate to find an older Linksys card on the shelf at a local Best Buy.  Granted, it may be the case that new chipsets are becoming supported (I haven't been following that issue too closely).  And even though WMB is convenient for development,  I'm personally not convinced it's worth it given the potential risks involved in flashing a DS lite, particularly since I know there's projects out there to develop downloaders that will work with any 802.11-compatible AP.
<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I also neglected to mention the issue of your warrantee being voided if you flash your DS.  It's probably not *that* big of a deal, but it's something to keep in mind.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it really is a matter of personal choice.  Weight the risks and decide for yourself.  Regardless, the lite is a terrific device, and definitely worth the purchase if you're happy with buying new dev equipment (which is the other reason I'm personally not upgrading... I'm cheap ;).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Um...no. "It is brighter and smaller and stuff" is the biggest understatement I've ever come across. Just comparing them side-to-side allows you to see just how much smaller the DSL is. The only way you're going to turn it on in your pocket is if you intentionally stick your hand in your pocket, and slide the power switch. Unless you keep pennies and other junk in your pocket, then you're just an idiot.

FYI: The DS Lite's release price was the same price as the DS when it came out. Sure, they're different in price today, but you're basically paying the same amount of money for a drastically improved device.<br/>_________________<br/>Butt Monkeys.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
