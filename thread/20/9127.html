Well, for a start: that'll be a damn hard thing, since you'll have to convert digital data -&gt; audio -&gt; digital data -&gt; IR ...
<br/>
<br/>
You'd be better off by modifying PassME, IMHO.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
No idea if the voltages would be appropriate.
<br/>
You'd have to do a lot of testing and experimentation before you could even think of writeing the software side.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not necessarily. Most IR remotes use short pulses. Say you played a 200hz tone with an IR LED connected, then it'd be beaming 200hz IR pulses. Timing could be tricky though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Good luck, either way!  I'm not knowledgeable enough to do that kind of stuff, but I'd totally love to make use of it.  =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
