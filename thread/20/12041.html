    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi!
<br/>
so i got some problems with IRCDS.
<br/>
i turned my nintendo wifi-connector to a SoftAP, and installed the asus software and what not... everything.
<br/>
i set up my WFC-options and the test-connections works flawlessly. i can play commercial games with no problems.
<br/>
<br/>
but, when i now try to run IRCDS (version 0.3b), it still stops at "connecting via WFC data".
<br/>
the wifi-lamp blinks for some time, like its searching, but then stops after half a minute or so. when i used my wifi-connector with its original driver and the nintendo-software, it instantly froze (i guess, at least the wifi-lamp didnt blink at all)
<br/>
<br/>
second, i tried SylphDS (version 0.05). before i turned the connector to a softAP, i got
<br/>
"connecting to WFC AP...
<br/>
ASSOCSTATUS_CANNOTCONNECT
<br/>
Error..."
<br/>
<br/>
now, after making the stick a softAP, i get following:
<br/>
"connecting to WFC AP...
<br/>
ASSOCSTATUS_SEARCHING
<br/>
ASSOCSTATUS_ASSOCIATING
<br/>
ASSOCSTATUS_DISCONNECTED
<br/>
ASSOCSTATUS_AUTHENTICATING
<br/>
ASSOCSTATUS_CANNOTCONNECT
<br/>
Error..."
<br/>
<br/>
any suggestions on how to make it work!?
<br/>
i dont know what information you need to help me out, so please tell me what you need to know and i'll post it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You have to switch the WiFi mods when using homebrew. If I'm not mistaken official NDS games require shared encryption and homebrew requires open encryption. If that don't work it's visa versa. That'll only apply if using WEP protection, you can avoid all this without using encryption.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, i read that too.
<br/>
but the problem is:
<br/>
when i disable WEP in the asus-program, and delete the WEP-key in the DS-WFC-setting, it cant find a connection.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ok its working now. turned the network-authentification to "open".
<br/>
<br/>
slyphIRC now boots, but i cant connect to any servers because it crashed when i make it connect.
<br/>
on IRCDS, it does also boot now, and when i want to connect here, i get a "guru meditation error".
<br/>
