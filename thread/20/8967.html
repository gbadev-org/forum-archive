There should have been more difference<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">*</span> between them, but game sellers think that GBA is the old Game Boy and DS is the new Game Boy.
<br/>
The biggest Game shop in Finland says: <span style="font-size: 8px; line-height: normal">"Gameboyn seuraaja vie pelaajat suoraan mobiilipelaamisen tulevaisuuteen."</span> Translation: "The follower of the Gameboy tooks gamers directly in to the future of mobile gaming." 
<br/>
<br/>
-btw it sucks that so many ppl thinks it's the next GB and also that they think words "Game Boy" and the word "Gameboy" is the same. Those ppl are donkey holes. ;)

<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">* Package style looks almost the same as GBA package. It could have looked more mature than it is. No wonder why some lame ppl think it's a new Game Boy.. or maybe I'm just a kid in adult's body who loves to play with toys like DS.</span><br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
