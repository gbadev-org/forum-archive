    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, so here's the deal. I just completed the  CAD design for a DS Lite dock station and even have a complete prototype that I made on my schools 3D printer. I would like to find out what the market for this product is, and how many people will buy it. The dock can be used for charging your DS while folded and is also great for holding your DS while warching movies with moonshell. The following are specificatoins but I will not yet release a photo.
<br/>
<br/>
22 Ds cartridge slots
<br/>
3 GBA cartridge slots
<br/>
4 stylus holders
<br/>
the dock portion of the unit
<br/>
small tray for cleaning cloth, etc.
<br/>
slot for integrating the charging cord with the unit
<br/>
<br/>
please take the poll and  leave comments.
<br/>
<br/>
THANKS!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by SG1anubis007 on Sun Apr 27, 2008 6:43 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

by 22 DS card slots you mean just to hold the cards, right? why not just go buy a case? its really just an expensive and almost purposeless object, unless it came more as a homebrew tool, with a built in ram expansion pak (perhaps 32mb rab expansion pak?)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

Now that would make it more expensive but MUCH more interesting!
<br/>
<br/>
Personally I'm the kind of person who likes as little clutter/stuff in my room, so I'd prefer to just keep a charging cable and keeping my game cartridges in my portable carry case. No doubt though there will be people interested in this sort of product, but what can you offer in terms of warranty that larger companies can with their own charging docks?

Now to clarify things, this is not a super computer extension for the Ds, IT IS A SIMPLE DESKTOP ORGANIZER FOR STORING DS GAMES AND ACCESSORIES! I made it on a CAD program and thought it would be cool for me to have. Now I am trying to decide if this is a worthy product to be developed. I know it is hard to visualize without a picture so maybe I will upload one.
<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to think that maybe this product is best for younger children that make up the majority og DS owners. Not us homebrewers. I will say again this is only a simple desktop organizer that happens to look really cool and work well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
what can it do that an empty spot on a desk/shelf doesn't already do?
<br/>
<br/>
there's a pretty good chance that if you're able to be watching videos on it you have a flashcart
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's probably fair to say that if people have a flashcart, the vast majority of them won't have a bunch of commercial DS carts (so the ability of your organizer to hold 22 is kinda meaningless)
<br/>
<br/>
unless your organizer can function as a TV out dock, I have a hard time seeing anyone setting their DS up on it, and then watching a show on it from any distance, the screens are just too tiny
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have an idea of what you're thinking of, but I just can't imagine that anyone would actually pay money for it</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think it's about distance, it's about not having to hold the thing to watch it well. I'd like to see the design, but I probably wont buy it because I'm too cheap for such things. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

a big part for a decision wether or not to buy a "dock" is it's size, how much "quality" it shows, and if it looks good with a DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If this integrated an IDE hard drive slot with enough space internally for a 1.8 or 2.5" HD, then I'd certainly be ineterested.
<br/>
<br/>
I've thought about such a thing a number of times.  The internals of a Max Media Dock should be easy to turn into an IDE adapter only requiring external power (which would also be used for recharging the DS) and then you'd have...well, I don't know, but it'd be something.
<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, it's still not really useful for much of anything that couldn't be done just as well or better and probably more cheaply with other hardware, but it'd still be pretty cool, I think.

Also, you could probably improve the number of games it could hold by removing the individual slots and create a "bank" that holds 5 cards before putting a divider in it.  If you didn't put any dividers, it might allow users to flip through the games.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
