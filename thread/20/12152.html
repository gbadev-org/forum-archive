Its a compact flash card fat32 system. Do I put the beup.nds in the very root where Audio, Video, etc. Or do I put nds in the beup root folder. Oh most importantly WHICH nds do I use. By the way I have connected to the net with Mario Cart</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Max Media dock has some weird compatiblity problems.  I remember reading that some apps only worked if your DS clock was set to 12:00 or something like that.

Nintendo has given no guarantee that Nintendo DS Browser will be released in North America before January 1, 2102. (Yes, A.D. two thousand one hundred two. That's the release date plus the current US copyright term.)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
