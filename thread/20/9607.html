    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey guys,
<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if there's a way to get moonshell to work from a different directory than ROOT.....?!
<br/>
<br/>
Because on my Supercard I structured it like that:
<br/>
--&gt; NDS
<br/>
--&gt; GBA
<br/>
--&gt; Homebrew
<br/>
<br/>
And I want Moonshell to be in its own sub-folder in "Homebrew"....
<br/>
Afer installing moonshell to my memorystick I just shoved it over to the folder I want it to be in....
<br/>
<br/>
But after I did that the mp3 and image-viewer plugins aren't working anymore. It just says something like "not support ext.MP3"....and I can't even hear the startup-sound anymore...
<br/>
<br/>
What I'm asking now is, if there's a way to modify the config-file or whatever, to get it to work from a different folder than ROOT ?!
<br/>

Unless you recompile MoonShell by yourself, no, that's not possible. You can still make the Shell folder hidden and it won't appear in the menu anymore ... :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
