This is a preview of a version 0.4. 
<br/>
After it tests for myself, I will up-load it a little more. 
<br/>
I am glad when testing if the time is extra.

edit:wow this is good, really good mp3 seems much better (i didnt hear it click once) and i just encoded ati-demo-the-assasin(the latest ruby demo) from the HD version at 24fps@256x192 at it worked pretty flawlessly and the file was only 37megs at a duration of 1:46s.  Very nice!

Out of the question. Moonshell is for multimedia, requiring lots of space, thus I would need at least 512MB, preferrably 1GB (like the one I have now). Those cards are expensive over here, and more importantly they cost money. I have none.
<br/>

re-support FAT32 volume.
<br/>
However, FAT32 is a little slow because it is complex. 
<br/>
<br/>
thanks El Hobito.
<br/>
The source and execution were separated.
<br/>
<br/>
Tips.
<br/>
The full-screen mode of DMV is only a little lighter. (Because there is not the re-drawing of the seek bar. )

GBFS can be used also with Ver0.4.

The file is stored in the files_gbfs/ folder.

I have only tested it on the finalbeta version 0.4+0 but it should work on any of them. Don't forget to back up originals incase you want to go back.

Just put desktop.bmp and global.ini into your /files/.shell/ directory.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just thought I would mention the following that I noticed with the relationalpreview version.
<br/>
<br/>
When playing video, once you get torwards the middle the audio and video becomes very out of sync.  However, if you jump back to the beggining the audio is fine.  In your finallastbeta version the audio and video have no sync problems at all.  If it matters, I'm using a Kingston 512mb Compact Flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed, if you use zlib compression, you get pops in the sound with the   relationalpreview version...I diden't check this with the finallastbeta version.  Everything is fine with lzss audio wise.
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the new devenc program encodes the video almost excactly as how the original looked now in the relationalpreview version ( No more off-color tones with the picture), but the file size is also much bigger.  I can still fit one half hour episode on my 512mb card though :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think that TXT and SPC, etc. from IMFS were improved.

EXFS was newly established. Substitution of GBFS.

&gt;EXFS has enhanced IMFS to the flash cart.

I know rebooting _BOOT_MP.nds works fine...but i just wanted to know if this is possible to automatically free some memory when moonshell doesn't have enough to play some files.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks :)
<br/>
<br/>
edit :
<br/>
it seems that it actually frees some memory before playing mp3 (since i can play as much mp3 as i want)
<br/>
<br/>
after it became out of memory for playing spc , i was still playing some mp3 and had :
<br/>
freemem = 18432 byte (it won't go less apparently)
<br/>
i closed the mp3 and reloaded it and then had freemem = 59392 byte
<br/>
<br/>
so it might be a problem with the spc support :(

Also, please note that it dosent' just gradually get out of sync as i'm playing it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have a couple suggestions, perhaps ideas to throw at Moonshell. If you add it Moonshell, I shall be happy. If not, no big deal. :D
<br/>
<br/>
-Add over-amplification. X/Y can make the volume go beyond 100%, perhaps to 200%. The reason being, sometimes the music isn't as loud as, say, a bus that drives by when I'm walking along the street. ..and these are big headphones I'm using.
<br/>
<br/>
-Add XM/Mod support, fix IT support.. I shall be very happy. :D
<br/>
<br/>
-Add OGG vorbis support if possible?
<br/>
<br/>
-Add WinAmp-style "docking" support. When dragging a window, for instance, let it "catch" to the edge of the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
-Add in a "Title" line above the progress bar window.
<br/>
<br/>
-Perhaps add in-program global.ini editing? (Also known as: In-program configuration) That way I don't have to recompile moonshell every time I want a setting changed.
<br/>
<br/>
-Although PSF/USF/QSF/whatever SF support might be impossible, is GSF support possible?
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I realize most of the components within MoonShell are simply adapted programs that other people have written. Has anyone made an Ogg player for the GBA/DS? 
<br/>
<br/>
These are all simple little ideas to make moonshell that much better. I love this program. If NesDS worked, it would be my main _boot_mp.nds file.. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

GSF emulation would require emulating all but the video chip of the GBA. Perhaps a GSF player support only a few common GBA sound engines (Saptapper, AAS, Krawall, Toast, etc) through high level emulation.

The amplifier is a good idea. It makes try.
<br/>
I also wish the XM/MOD support. However, it did not move normally. IT/S3M is also imperfect. It is scheduled to cure it gradually.
<br/>
OGG is tried in the past and has failed. 
<br/>
I thinks about the window docking.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Add in a "Title" line above the progress bar window.
<br/>
Where is it on the Title line?

What information should I draw?
<br/>
<br/>
PSF/USF/QSF/GSF is a considerably difficult problem.
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. MoonShell is supported by quite a lot of libraries.
<br/>
Even if an imperfect problem is found, it is mortified not to be able to cure it in my technology. I do not understand.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you would like an archive with a lot of IT/S3M/MID files, here is my video game music archive. I remade all these myself: <a href="http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes" target="_blank">http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes</a> .. I've been told they're good testers for mod players. Perhaps why my name is in the WinAmp Credits. Of course, when the mod player in winamp got taken over by someone else, most of these mod files broke.

Instead of "PlayControl..." you could have the title be put there instead. For instance:

<br/>
|=========.......................|
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

If the too long to fit, you could perhaps make the title scroll inside the box kinda like how Mighty Max does in his loader. It's just a thought. :)

It doesn't have official Supercard support yet I don't think...maybe in the future.  and to change the codepage, go to the ChangeCodePage folder in the folder you unzipped Moonshell into, and click the appropriate batch file  (looks like the fith one down on my system).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
