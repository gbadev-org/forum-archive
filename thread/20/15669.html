    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok I'm a total noob when it comes to wireless networking and such, as I've had no experience or practice with it so I'm going to describe my situation and hopefully someone can help me.
<br/>
<br/>
I recently purchased a Belkin 54g Wireless Router (F5D7230-4 v8000) so that I could have fun with all the great wifi homebrew. Currently I have 3 computers in 1 room that are all connected to a D-Link DI-604 Wired Router that connects to a SpeedStream 4200 Wired Modem/Router Combo. I'm wondering how to go about setting up the wireless router so that I'll be able to connect to the internet via my ds. I've tried just replacing my D-Link with the Belkin and quite a few different settings (turning off firewall, turning off WEP, etc) and still no connection using any of the homebrew I have (beup, dsmaps, treasures of gaia, dshobro, dscam, and dsaim) So now I'm wondering have I set up my wireless router settings wrong, or maybe I should use it as an access point (which I don't know how to do, as when I did it I couldn't use my internet), or do I have to have a Wifi compatible official ds game to be able to setup wifi on the ds? Anyways a long post and hopefully someone here will be able to help me. Thanks for all the help you've given me in the past as well, I really enjoy browsing and reading this forum, as well as posting questions I have.

Yes, you need to setup Wifi on your DS somehow. Either an official DS Wifi game, or DS Organize.(The B Day <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dragonminded.com/ndsdev/DSOrganize_3_1129.zip" target="_blank">release</a>, for stability reasons.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
