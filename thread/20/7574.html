    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No it won't work.  Only cards that work with Firefly's driver will be compatible with the tunnel software.  Nintendo's USB adapter should be technically capable of speaking nifi but you'll have to wait until someone creates a driver.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sektor on Wed Nov 23, 2005 10:03 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

yup. the point still stands.
<br/>
<br/>
Firefly's driver is currently only a pci/minipci driver nothing in usb form yet.
<br/>
<br/>
being as it is a usb wifi device from buffalo you can turn it into a lan adapter or leave it as an access point but not both.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No.
<br/>
<br/>
Firefly wrote the custom driver used by WMB.  He has since put a closed sign on his web site, and is no longer active in the community.  He did not release his source code for his driver.
<br/>
<br/>
So it is impossible for anyone to update his driver to work with anything new.  lt doesn't look like Firefly will ever do it either.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone was good at writing windows drivers, they could write a new driver from scratch, using the information learned from the WMB for Linux project.  But I doubt this will ever happen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Damn...

i hope there is somebody(anonymously?) out there who is working on a compatible windows driver, he/she would make a lot of people happy :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
