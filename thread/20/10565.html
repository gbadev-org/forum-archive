What sort of DS homebrew would you need <a class="postlink" href="http://p2p.ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">PP2P2P2PP2P</a> for? Can't you just get it from DSOrganize's Homebrew Database?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Remember also that for a P2P app to work, you need at least 2 DSs that have to be on running that app and sharing files on the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
With computers, I can easily let my pc/laptop running day/night with several apps. With the DS though, If I want to play MKDS, I stop sharing, and thus, even if this app was made, noone would be on it unless someone requests a fileshare day/time and people actually login and share. 
<br/>
<br/>
In that case, you might as well request said files through rapidshare or other stuff.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it could be neat to see a "client" like app, for downloading from other servers ( just like the one in DsOrganize, just with user input support )</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
