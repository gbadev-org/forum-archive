Anyhow, I'm not sure what his reasoning is, but not many people have contributed to the snesadvance effort.  Releasing the source to pocketspc garnered me approximately zero benefit.  Of course it didn't cost me anything, and it might have helped people write sound mixers way back in the olden days, but nobody actually contributed anything to it.
<br/>
<br/>
I think you overestimate the number of people with the time, assembly skills and snes knowledge to work on something like this.  Flubba was the only person I know of who really did any work on snesadvance (edit: other than loopy of course).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Perhaps I am just an idealist...
<br/>
<br/>
Since when does it matter if releasing the source code of a project is going to further it's development? With open source software people have the option of helping in the development, but it certainly is not required. OSS is more about the sharing of knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
Out of the millions of people that run Linux, how many of them have ever contributed anything back, 2% maybe? I've never heard anyone complain about that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
TJ, I agree totally, I have no problem with releasing the source to my stuff, even if nobody contributes back to it.  My comment was just meant to show that releasing the source will not cause it to be worked on by 20 people all of a sudden :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So, you know someone who is willing and able to code for SnesDS? I sure don't. If you do know someone, refer him or her to gladius so he or she can work on the project.

You're acting like the universe will implode if Gladius doesn't release the source, which he has already stated isn't his place to release.  Enough with the "it's all riding on you" and "you're letting us all down" crap.  The developers aren't getting paid for writing the emulators, and they have no obligation whatsoever to make sure their "customers" are 100% satisfied with the product.

Even if the source is released one day, it doesn't mean that two days later the emulator will automatically become fully perfect in every way.  You're going to have to wait a bit in either case I think.

I can't remember much about it (I only saw the news flashing by), but maybe the source will be usefull for that project?

as for making the source of SnesDS opensource, I do believe in opensource, it can be very usefull both ways.
<br/>
But it is up to the developers, if they want to release it, hey that?s great, but if they feel it unnessesary (which kinda get's me hoping there will be some developement this summer breack or something ;) ), then that is there choice and right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would have used different words.. but.. either way.. the point is made.
<br/>
<br/>
And your methods only make developers not want to hassle with this stuff.  Do people not realize that HOMEBREW means people have real jobs, and they do this for __FUN__?  That they do it to show their skills.. or learn new ones?
<br/>
<br/>
Hell.. fartz, you could have single handedly been the one to kill SnesDS because the developers don't want to deal with people like you.  On top of that, you could have killed hundereds.. maybe thousands of future projects because developers see your responses and realize.. Man.. Do I even want to deal with people like this?  Using software that I am writing.. for FREE..  Something I do in my spare time.. and now.. I have to read stuff like this?  Respond to posts like this?
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... Thanks fartz..  Now we may never see an Athelon XP emulator for the DS..   :/<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I would have used different words.. but.. either way.. the point is made.
<br/>
<br/>
And your methods only make developers not want to hassle with this stuff.  Do people not realize that HOMEBREW means people have real jobs, and they do this for __FUN__?  That they do it to show their skills.. or learn new ones?
<br/>
<br/>
Hell.. fartz, you could have single handedly been the one to kill SnesDS because the developers don't want to deal with people like you.  On top of that, you could have killed hundereds.. maybe thousands of future projects because developers see your responses and realize.. Man.. Do I even want to deal with people like this?  Using software that I am writing.. for FREE..  Something I do in my spare time.. and now.. I have to read stuff like this?  Respond to posts like this?
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm... Thanks fartz..  Now we may never see an Athelon XP emulator for the DS..   :/</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Now you are kindof using the same words as he did.
<br/>
Either way the point is again made.
<br/>
I too would like to see the source released (but that is purely becaus I like the general idea of opensource software).
<br/>
That is the entire reason I release my work (sorry I don't code ;)) under the Creative commons license.
<br/>
People can edit use and redistibute it all as they like (as long as they don't make any money off of it).
<br/>
<br/>
I can undertand farz wanting to see the source code released but the methods are somewhat...crude?
<br/>
So next time farz I suggest using sligtly different arguments :).
<br/>
Like lynx said people do make this in their spare time, for free.
<br/>
If they want to release the source it is their choice.
<br/>
And yes you can ask people to release the source if you need it or feel it would help developement of the app.
<br/>
But don't try to talk people into feeling ashamed if they don't release it.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I want the scene to stay nice and people helping eachother.
<br/>
Thats something I like about opensource too.
<br/>
I can understand if frustration comes out though ;).
<br/>
<br/>
btw, and athlon emu (as in AMD)? lol</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even if the source is released one day, it doesn't mean that two days later the emulator will automatically become fully perfect in every way.  You're going to have to wait a bit in either case I think.  Stuff like this takes a lot of work.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Indeed it does.
<br/>
But lets assume Loopy dosnt have enough time to work on it anymore,then surely releaseing the source sooner would give more chance of someone else picking up development rather then releaseing it in 6 months or a years time?

Waiting is an absolute given, but the question is, is there anything to wait for?

I am not pressurising anyone to release the source, and I dont think fartz

was either.

Loopy is the only person that can decide if he wants the source released or not.

I'd be willing to take a stab at it.

He's gonna laugh at all the argument created over something as simple as code. Do you really think he will keep the source to himself?

Snezziboy ported to the DS.
<br/>
Snezziboy is a newly created SNES emulator for the GBA, which is still being worked on, and Gladius ported it to the DS. That port to the DS is called SnezziDS, and now features sound as well, unlike its GBA counterpart.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I get the feeling if anyone is interested in having the source he can just ask for it and get it sent.
<br/>
That way if anyone wants to work on it he/she can and the source hasn't been fully released.
<br/>
Problem kinda solved I guess.
<br/>
Only counter argument I could think of is that the advantages of opensource are not fully in place (you have to really want it and have to ask for it, instead of just plucking it of the net, but hey is that so much work?).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, snezziDS is already working quite nicely (better then SnesDS on some parts), I hope it will develope in something quite nice (should be possible, but  it is always up to the coders, it is their free time of cource).
<br/>
And as for NesDS I agree that it works really great and that nearly the only thing needed is a savestate.
<br/>
But if anyone wants to implement it I think Loopy (and maybe Gladius, I don't really know who developed it) would gladly send him/her the source.
<br/>
BTW, I asked sometime ago (I think) if developement would get going again (I don't remember who I asked, I don't have the nickname :)) and I got the answer that he had very busy and hadn't worked on nesDS and SnesDS for quite sometime.
<br/>
But that if there was time (he couldn't make any promises) he might pick it up again this summer.
<br/>
And like I said then, the fact that the emu's are there is already great!
<br/>
The reply I got back when I asked about the status was really great and I have the utmost confidence that if you were serious in your efforts to improve snesDS you would be able to get the source.

<br/>
The reason for the code isn't always used for making a new emu/updating an existing one.
<br/>
One can learn from source and etc..
<br/>
And as for asking, I do feel that a forum is not quite the best place to do so  (unless requesting a public release), but if you need/want the source, like I said above, it is only logical to ask for it.
<br/>
Of course the developer can always decide not to give the source.
<br/>
That is his/her good right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
