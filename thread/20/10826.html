    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, I registered it also. There's an automated email sent back...check your spam folder (it went to my spam folder on gmail). He also told me he has problems sending to hotmail accounts as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps you sent email to the wrong address, i don't think any of his addresses have "nocrash" in it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
