    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just out of curiosity, what are the differences between the different versions of the official DS firmware? IIRC, in my original firmware, v2, when you went to calibrate the screen, it kept on asking you to press the top left dot, the bottom right dot, and the center dot. It just looped until you exited. With my Flashme's firmware, it seems they added a message saying calibration was complete, and a way to check calibration. Also, disabling wifime/passme1 and changing the colors when you remove a card during pictochat. Besides all that, does anyone know what else they changed?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I had a v2 firmware, and it the same as the Flashme firmware. I do know the message and check was there.

I would actully be interested to find out what the difference between v1 and v2 is (apart from the pictochat thing).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If it loops top-left, bottom-right, center, then that means you're not pressing accurately enough. This is likely in retail demo units whose touch screen has been abused by single-digit-year-olds. On my v2 firmware (before I installed FlashMe), I got top-left, bottom-right, center, four corners.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
