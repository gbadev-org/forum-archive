In Electroplankton the beats for the RecRec plankton are just sitting there in plain uncompressed WAV format (16 bit mono 36000 hz).  I just inserted a custom beat in place of the metronome that I'll never use.  ^_^  It works great....I fudged it a little, I'll admit.  I used the program NDS TOP System to insert the file directly into the dump I made (I would have tried recompiling the whole NDS ROM if I felt I understood how well enough...every time I try to do this in a hacking aspect it doesn't work right...so many bits of the format I don't totally understand).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, just make a WAV in the format I stated above that lasts for 4.024 seconds, make sure the filesize is the same as listed for the RecRecXX.wav file you are replacing.  This is the part that can be a bit of a pain, even at 4.024 as the length it was a bit off...I finally just truncated it.  :P
<br/>
<br/>
A pre-made test WAV is located here:  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm2/zdd2/stuff/Devilslab.wav" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/realm2/zdd2/stuff/Devilslab.wav</a> (complements of Kefka)...you'll need to cut and paste anyway since it's a cruddy Angelfire account.

If you make an interesting beat, go ahead and post away.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think so...it looks like the good majority of the sounds are in one of these sdat files that most if not all DS games seem to have.  There are a lot of wav.dat files for the sound effects used by several of the Plankton in Performance mode...they must be compressed somehow though since they can't be played like a normal WAV.  I'll probably try to figure it out sometime (haven't really tried anything yet), out of curiosity if anything.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
