    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been scouring through all the links I can find to get moonshell 1.21 to do slightly different things than what it's currently doing. I've already tweaked global.ini as far as is viable for me, but it leaves me with quite a few things I can't seem to find (even looking through the source - of course I'm not really a programmer, sadly, just a scripter). Among other things, I'm looking to turn off the interface that is shown when you look at pictures while no input is given. It turns off after a few seconds after stopping input, but I want it to go off immediately after I stop input (in this case, dragging the picture around).  What would be nice would be to set things up so it reads more of these settingws from global.ini or perhaps another .ini or .xml file. Otherwise, I'd still just like to find out how to fix that setting, as well as numerous others that I can't seem to find in the source. Other things like changing the way moonshell displays the date (either MM/DD/YYYY like in the U.S. or DD/MM/YYYY like in Europe, instead of YYYY/MM/DD). And setting default zoom of any picture to zoom to fit, rather than 100%, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps an options page could be made to adjust all settings in global.ini, would be useful to not have to take the SD card out every time a small change is to be made. (granted, I could use a text editor - but just selecting an option and changing it via touchscreen and a slider would be even better).
<br/>
Other ideas would be to have it be able to play music while reading text, even if it has to pause the music a moment while it loads the text - this would be acceptable.
<br/>
Also have a slider so that audio volume can be changed (and directly change global.ini, or just create a save in sram, or at least just have a temporary change). I'm not talking about the volume of the DS itself, but volume amplification - the setting in global.ini that allows you to increase the volume quite substantially - 16 being 100%, 64 being 400%, etc.
<br/>
Also to figure out a way to get moonshell to play video on both screens simultaneously. I.E. instead of 256x192 resolution video, it would be 256x384 res video. I have a few ideas of how this would be very useful to me, and probably others.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

What kind of "script" have you written? If you've written "JavaScript" code that queries a server to update the page through the DOM (the so-called "AJAX" style), and you've written the server side of the app as well, then you are a programmer.

Sadly, nothing so complex... Most of my experience lies in the realm of dos .batch (pretty extensive), R:Base SQL server type script, etc. Nothing that's ever been compiled, either. I've got a few books on C and its derivatives, as well as VB, etc.. I'm slowly trudging through this stuff, but it's a LOT faster for me to look at actual code and learn how to work with it.

<br/>
Well, for me, I never use the scrollbars at all, just click and drag the image itself. Though I suppose for a really large image the scrollbars would be useful, hmm.. perhaps a toggle button for the interface? As for using the control pad or any button, I think the interface should come on, but only while the button is being pressed... or perhaps for just one second beyond that (to stop it from flashing when people repeat press the button). OR, if it'd be possible, to make it go partially transparent when no input is given (i.e.. all button presses stop and the touchpad isn't being touched).

I recognize that that's the standard, but it would be nice to rearrange it for those of us used to a different system. Even to the point of being able to have it say the name of the month as well. I suppose, though, that that's just some code that could be added to the clock plugin (which is where I see it anyway) so that it rearranges the data its given.

<br/>
DSOrganize doesn't like the M3-SD (which I have) at its present state. All file functions (beyond read) have been locked until he can figure out the problems. Beyond that, I'm trying to get all media functions that Moonshell works with to have more options for the user, like the default zoom level, etc.

<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to learn Lua, but it's bound to be easier than C at this point.. I'll look into that, thanks. Though, how exactly does DSLua handle things? does it compile scripts so you can run them as NDS files? (Moonshell doesn't support running .nds files on the M3-SD at present), or do you have to run DSLua and then launch the code?

Thanks, I was unaware of that. Does it dynamically modify global.ini, or does it just locally modify that, so that it returns to normal at every new play command (or new playlist, etc)? Now, to work that into a slider...

That's expected. With the hardware I have, though, I can get full 24fps playback, with 128kbps audio. I would hope, under ideal circumstances, that it could work at 12 frames per second at full dual screen playback. (of course, nothing is ever ideal)<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life
