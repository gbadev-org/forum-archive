Link (once again) taken from the other topic.

Yes, you'd have to short SL1 again to remove FlashMe, so i'd definitely recommend using FlashMe Stealth. 
<br/>
'cause if you mess up during flashing noflashme.nds, you're pretty much screwed, unless you switch firmware chips with another DS Lite, to recover it.<br/>_________________<br/>maggiekarp: Aghhh okay guys why would my right ide hurt in my ribs

If i remember correctly, switching between the normal FlashMe and the Stealth one doesn't require shorting SL1, as long as they're the same version.<br/>_________________<br/>maggiekarp: Aghhh okay guys why would my right ide hurt in my ribs

You should get your DS back all fixed up and still flashed ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You don't need to bridge SL1 when switching from one (recent) version of FlashMe to another. You do need to bridge SL1 when switching among FWNITRO, FlashMe, and stock firmware, or when upgrading from older versions of FlashMe.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
