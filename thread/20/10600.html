    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just purchased a Datel 4GB HDD for my NDS and I can't seem to get the "skipping" anomaly out of my .mp3 tracks when using them in Moonshell v1.1 (included with the HDD). I was directed here from ndshb.com, being told there was a thread about this issue here, and that the problem pertained to the bitrate I am using, but I ran a search and cannot find that thread. Please, help me out, the skipping is really annoying.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
If you encode to low-bitrate MP3, you're going to lose a lot of quality, so OGG is a better choice here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Using a Max Media 4GB HDD? 
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with it is that it's slow to read from the HDD, so apparently MoonShell can't read from the drive fast enough to play high bitrate stuff properly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

MPEG 1 L3 @ 160kbit and 44.1 KHz has (with padding) (144 * 160000)/44100 +1 bytes per frame, that is 524 Bytes per frame, so one secound has 38,3 frames, that means the Max Media has to read 19.6 kB per secound. I don't beleave it's that slow that it can't read 20kB/s...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
