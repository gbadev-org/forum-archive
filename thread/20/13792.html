I am new to this (Just started to think about getting a DS today, July 26, 2007.) Are there any tutorials or information that will get me started.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you have the Opera RAM pack, you could try Okiwi.  I'm not sure if it's finished yet though.  It said it will need a DS RAM pack/card with RAM to use images.  I should buy the DS opera browser just for the RAM pack (though I'd use the browser a lot too) for DS Linux and MoonShell and stuff that uses the RAM...
<br/>
<br/>
My friend (who has DS Lite) got the DS Browser but it came with one of those stupid DS Lite paks that is too small and has that stupid piece that prevents it from being inserted to a DS...can you get the Browser for a regular DS?<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no web browser specific to the R4, and it does not include one built-in.  The only way to run the official Opera browser is to buy it from a store.  And yes, you can get the Phat-sized version though I think it's only available online for US users.
<br/>
<br/>
There are a few homebrew web browsers that will work, though most are text-only.  Check out DSOrganize, Bunjalloo, and DSHobro, and also consider trying the Retawq web browser in DSLinux.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">@calcprogrammer1: Your friend could still use that expansion pack on his Phat he just needs to take an old gba card, rip off the missing header and attach it to the DS Lite Card (of course he needs to cut of that stuff that is standing over from the DSLite Cardridge.

I don't have a DS or an R4 yet. How do I backup a copy of the DS Browser. Do I need a special DS game card adapter?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
