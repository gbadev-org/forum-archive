    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Recently I re-calibrated my touch-screen, and it turns out that my screen is a little warped.  Due to this, the calibration is really messed up.  I can only calibrate it so that when I "click" off to the side of the center dot, it registers.  I was wondering if the calibration is stored in the firmware, and if somebody with CORRECT calibration could rip their firmware for me so that I could fix this problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Does this warping happen in official games or only in homebrew?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But that shouldn't matter. If you can't correctly caibrate the screen, you probably need to get it replaced.<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word. No space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can enter the calibration mode entirely with the +Control Pad and A button. Let's see: <ul><li>Select+Start+Power on </li><li>Move down to the DS/file drawer icon at the bottom and press A </li><li>Move right three times to the crosshair and press A </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

inthearmsofsleep, I'm pretty sure your DS is ... well, broken.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking about getting a ds lite anyway, but now I guess I have more of an incentive.  Can the ds lite run homebrew with the newest version of flashme?  If so, are there any problems with it (i.e. bricking.)?

I'm pretty sure my screen is just messed up in the center.  I can't calibrate it to do anything other than what it's doing right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

FlashMe v7 or later works on DS Lite.

DS Lite power-off issues are mostly caused by the screwdriver contacting the metal shielding around the GBA slot. Electrical tape around the end of your screwdriver (except for the very end which touches SL1) should solve that.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
