Everybody with Windows has this game. :) But, I was thinking of remaking it and Freecell, eventually. Unless someone else beats me to it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's a very addicting game. I've spent many afternoons playing Spider Solitare. I'd love to have it on my DS, too. 
<br/>
<br/>
Freecell is another solitare card game on Windows machines. I was addicted to that game before Spider Solitare became a part of Windows distributions. And I meant that when I'm done working on the homebrew app I am now, and get more comfortable with graphics, I'm thinking of doing those two games, since a similar engine should be able to do both of those. I probably just won't get to it soon, but I hope to eventually.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Most common solitaire games played on Windows are Klondike (sol.exe) and Freecell (freecell.exe) because sol.exe has come with Windows since the 1.0 series and freecell.exe came with Win32s (the pseudo-32-bit upgrade to Windows 3.1) and Windows 95.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From IGN:
<br/>
<br/>
"A compilation of challenging card games titles, based on the GBA line of Ultimate games from Telegames and Cosmigi. The game features vastly upgraded graphics to make use of the 3D potential of the Nintendo DS (including a 3D "Person Creator" for designing your own avatar and full 3D environments of play), and includes playable versions of the following: <span style="font-weight: bold">Solitaire (with additional Solitaire variations/rule options not seen on GBA)</span>, Video Poker (also with multiple variations), Hearts, Spades, Euchre, Cribbage, Canasta, Bridge, Go Fish!, Crazy 8's, Blackjack, 5-Card Draw Poker, 7-Card Stud Poker, Texas Hold'em Poker, Pinochle, Whist, and Gin Rummy."
<br/>
<br/>
From a review off of GameFAQs about the GBA version:
<br/>
<br/>
"I really haven't touched the Solitaire games, but there are 15 of them. Klondike, Free Cell, Canfield, Pyramid, Golf, <span style="font-weight: bold">Spiderette</span>, Baker's Dozen, Bristol, Castle, Aces Up, Baroness, Eagle Wing, Eight Off, Calculation, and Betsy Ross. Not being a Solitaire fan, I have no idea what those games are, but all are presumably done correctly."
<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what Spiderette is, but sounds plausible enough to be your beloved Spider Solitaire. Read this explanation of Spiderette and see if it fits the bill (I personally don't know, I don't play Spider Solitaire!)
