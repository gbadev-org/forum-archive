    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Okay, I know there are a number of NDS emulators out there, but are any of them any good? I mean as good as say no$gba or Visual Boy Advance. I have dualis right now, but have trouble with it sometimes.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I figured out my problem with dualis, but if there are any other really good ones let me know.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All DS emulators have flaws even this late in the game, and are usually not a good representation of how homebrew will run on the DS.  For instance, tepples's AXE demo freezes No$GBA (the latest versions have DS functionality), while the same demo runs well in Dualis.  I don't think any of them run the recent nightly builds of DSLinux, though an older build worked fairly well in some other ones.
<br/>
<br/>
Others you can try include iDeaS, DSEmu, GoodNDS, and desmume.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
