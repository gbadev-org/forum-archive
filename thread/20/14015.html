    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not bad idea, but how would you buffer the stream?
<br/>
<br/>
But: With 2 MBit/s in WiFi Mode, the DS is too slowly to buffer a video stream, sound is ok (see DragonMinded's DSOrganize), also you have to choose a video codec, which is streamable<br/>_________________<br/>Equipment:

Nintendo DS, GBAMP v2, SuperCard SD, SuperKey, Acekard 2i</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
A DPG video is typically 0.25 Mbit/s. I don't know whether there are other inefficiencies in dswifi that prevent streaming at this rate.
<br/>
<br/>
As for where the stream would be buffered, a 2 MB buffer in EWRAM could hold a minute of a 256 Kbps stream.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

A few video players have their UI in an interpreted language but all the video decoding in native code or a JIT-compiled language.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
