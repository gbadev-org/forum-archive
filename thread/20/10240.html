    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I havent tried it, but I'll go for the obvious question. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is your firmware (v22) in chinese or english?
<br/>
<br/>
It might be because its in english(if it is in english indeed)
<br/>
<br/>
Beware of changing the languaje, since ive heard you might brick your M3. 
<br/>
<br/>
I really dont know, I'd ask around but I have to assist class right now. I just wanted to drop a line or two.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interestingly enough, there's no language lock on the pdaDS application, so you can run the chinese PDA with English firmware (and I'm assuming vice versa when the English version comes out).
<br/>
<br/>
I've tested it out myself and it works fine. You'll have to download the entire 40MB package and extract it to a folder on the root of your media card called "pdaDS" and then just click on pdaDS on your M3 menu. Of course, without the folder, it will give you an error message, so I can only assume that at least some of them are on your media card.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life
