    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have completely rewritten the GBAMP loader. It is still in Beta, so only use it if you have another method of booting NDS files. It has been tested quite a lot now, and even if you can't boot NDS files you should still be able to load the original firmware to flash back to the old version.
<br/>
<br/>
What's Better:
<br/>
* No more defragging
<br/>
* No more need for _BOOT_MP.GBA
<br/>
* Better CF card compatibility
<br/>
* It can load files selected by another program
<br/>
<br/>
What's Worse:
<br/>
* No ability to use _BOOT_MP.GBA anymore
<br/>
<br/>
What's Different:
<br/>
* Written in C.
<br/>
* A large chunk of the GBAMP firmware is now gone.

Is there any chance that you have a way to revert back to the firmware, I would do it but like you say it won't run _BOOT_MP.gba now and it will not run _BOOT_MP.nds either</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Dannon on Sun Sep 04, 2005 2:46 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
Well, it should solve CF card compatibility problems. If it works with my driver it will work with the firmware. It also means I can easily edit the loader, since it is written in C. I have removed the need for _BOOT_MP.GBA to load in to the GBAMP firmware.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the biggest improvement is the ability to use the firmware to boot other NDS files. I have now included a very simple (made in less than an hour) boot menu in the zip file. Put it on the card and try it out. It uses the firmware itself to do the loading, so if the firmware can boot it, then the menu can too. Hopefully MoonShine will include such functionality in MoonShell, which is the only program I have found that is broken.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by chishm on Mon Sep 05, 2005 9:57 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

You may not have used it, but alot of people needed to use the included file from the V1 zip just to get the GBAMP firmware to boot. I have fixed that completely now.

No. It is a bootloader. A menu has to be used separately. I have included an example menu in the zip. What I was saying is that it would be good if you could click on an NDS in MoonShell and have it load. Unfortunately MoonShell seems to have trouble with my loader. I think it might be to do with the memory used without initialisation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Can you give me the usual diagnostic info:

What filesystem are you using (FAT / FAT32), MBR or not, bytes per cluster, what cluster does the file start on when it works and when it doesn't (in hex please)?

I put flashmp.nds on the CF, loaded with multiboot loader (mighty max) but it says"flash not detected/please insert a movie player!"

Any idea why SNESds won't work? Is it the same reason that demos wont work?

Its great that we can now make our own bootloader without the skills of Mighty Max, thanks Chism, for making my life worth living.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

SnesDs doesnt work due to a conflict in the arm7 code, basically as soon as it makes a call to the sound it crashes, if you add metroid for example you will see it boots but crashes before it gets to the intro (the nintendo logo appears and thats it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Reading the CF card will lock the firmware. Try it again, but pull out the GBAMP while the flasher is running, wait 10 seconds, then put it back in. Keep reinserting until it says flash detected
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, use the GBA version through the original firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It is flashed onto the GBAMP. You can use any flash card, as long as you put a _BOOT_MP.NDS file in the root directory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i tried that way too and it didnt work, ive literally tried every possible way i can think of. and i figured maybee it was that the _BOOT_MP.NDS file wasent the first file on the card so i formatted it and copied that file first, still no luck. I think im gonna wait till a non-beta version is out. however i think the idea behind the new firmware is nice, plus i would be extatic if the nds loader gets implemented into moonshell!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There is still movie player functions, just boot the GBAMP from the DS's firmware. I am not much of a GUI person, that's why I included an example of how to write your own front end.

Although your loader example is not pretty, it works great.  Hopefully mightmax can "borrow" it for his loader.
<br/>
<br/>
Some testing:
<br/>
_BOOT_MP.nds = MightMax's loader
<br/>
&gt; Runs Chishm's loader
<br/>
&gt; Runs Moonshell
<br/>
&gt; Slow up/down
<br/>
&gt; doesn't support long file names (yet)
<br/>
&gt; doesn't run XrickDS
<br/>
&gt; doesn't run Omalone
<br/>
<br/>
The ones that don't run might be because it doesn't appear to clean up after itself.  Example would be running DSgoo.  You can still see the loader text mixed in with the instructions on the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
_BOOT_MP.nds = Chishm's loader
<br/>
&gt; Doesn't run MightyMax's loader

I clear nearly all of RAM, except after 0x023FF800. Be aware that this region is often used for NDS specific data. The NDS header is located at 0x027FFE00 to 0x027FFF70, and there is other stuff written to 0x027FF808, 0x027FF80A, 0x027FFC08, 0x027FFC0A and 0x027FFFF8. Be aware that this may change in future revisions, but I will release the source code when it is no longer in beta (i.e. the code is no longer being modified) so you can see for yourself. Oh, nice loader BTW.

For instance, there is the ability to have boot menus that load any file that would normally load straight from the firmware, it has better CF compatibility. Plus if you think waiting 3 seconds is bad, imagine having to defrag your CF after every change to the single allowable boot file like many people had to do with V1. Also, I won't add a button to skip the mem clear, since I am sick of holding buttons at start up :-P . I mean there's already Start for the NDS menu, Select to skip the firmware mod and B to start a GBA game.

I suppose it is stable enough to take out of beta. I just want to make sure the code to load ARM7 binaries into shared IWRAM works properly. But since Gladius' WIP SPC emulator is the only app I've come across that does this, it is a bit hard to test.

Yeah, the time does go up if you load something in the 2MB size range, since it has to load it from the CF card. This is like clearing RAM with the added cost off waiting for the CF card (they are sloooow sometimes).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm...I had weird results with this.  The first time I tried to use it, I booted it through Mighty's Loader...it created this Memory.bin file on the card, then I tried to load PocketSPC.nds...it got a white screen, then went black and said it failed to init the card, press start to continue...nothing happens when I press start.  I think it courrupted the card slightly too, wouldn't work properly until I reformatted the card (for some reason it kept booting directly into GBA mode no matter what I did).
<br/>
<br/>
When I tried it by renaming it to _BOOT_MP.nds, it booted up, and PocketSPC didn't work but at least I didn't have the problem I had before...not sure if that was caused by loading it through Mighty's Loader or not.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Is there a possibility that the position of FAT cannot be detected though it is not certain yet?
<br/>
There is 'Number of reservation sectors (IPL sectors)' in 'Position 0x0e/0x0f' of MBR. 
<br/>
<br/>
It was '1 (IPL=512byte)' in the CF card that did not start. 
<br/>
It was '4 (IPL=2048byte)' in the working CF card. 
<br/>
<br/>
There is FAT just behind IPL. Therefore, the position of FAT changes when the size of IPL changes.

I think that behavior is different according to whether there is a volume label in the root entry.

Though it is a guess...

The formatter was made referring to the binary dump of a normal CF card.

Please try when there is a person who has 'CF card that doesn't start with GBAMP'. The report is glad.

sizeof(pointer) equal sizeof(FAT_FILE*) equal sizeof(int).

Even if 'FAT_fopen' returns any value, it must be unrelated if the file steering wheel is not subtracted mutually.

I do not think that there is a subtraction usually. However, I think note about to be necessary readme.

My attempts so far to get SnesDS going have failed... no doubt because it's a .ds.gba file. Obviously, I'm doing something wrong.

Definitely not! I purposely left out the CRC code from the public release, and I thought that would stop them from working. Unfortunately I was stupid enough not to make sure, and by the time I realised, it was too late. It would seem that the demos work without the correct CRC in memory, so they must not check it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, about nuatilus' comments:
<br/>
This is exactly why I didn't want the official demos to work. DO NOT ask about any official demos, I am not aiming to make them compatible. Any questions about ROMs will be met with hostility. You have been warned.
<br/>
<br/>
On the plus side, this should hopefully fix a few homebrew apps that used non-standard ARM7 binaries. The problem was in the GBAMP firmware bootstrapper that I used to unlock the card. It set the CPU to User mode, which I now know cannot go back to Supervisor mode. This caused problems with non-standard stack setups, etc. Loopy and Gladius spotted this one.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

but what is all the fuss about running official demos? They run already with wireless multiboot, and official roms won't ever work (as far as I understand) on GBAMP, because of the access times of the compact flash card (GBAMP not having a fast memory buffer).

People who want to run pirated games already went and bought flash cards, for the rest of us I see no reason why we should not be allowed to run demos, which are something game producer would supposedly be happy if we run.

Well, running official code, as Chishm has stated more then once, is a step toward allowing pirates to take his work and turn it into something he doesn't want it to turn into.  I know it's hard for most people these days to understand that a very few still have morals and don't want to have anything to do with warezing.

Obviuos in the end he does what he likes!! I own a copy of the games I run, the others are homebrew. And by the way the firmware is out with source code, so once more, it's a bit hard to control what other people do with it.

Of course you can have and state your own opinion. The difference between running WMB demos over Wifi and using a GBAMP is that with Wifi, there is no media to store any other files. This means only binaries can be sent, and completely excludes NDS ROMs (as many pirates are no doubt aware of). The GBAMP provides a CF card to store files on. 
<br/>
<br/>
It has already been proven that an NDS ROM can be streamed from a CF card, by both the Supercard and M3. The problem with doing this is repeated reads (such as to FAT) that need to be cached. The M3 and SC probably use their internal RAM for caching, but there may be workarounds for the GBAMP. So the best way to stop the ROMs from being patched to do this is to prevent them from being loaded in the first place. That's why I was concerned about WMB demos.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

Hi, and thank you for your answer, this really makes the point.

The one floating around is the beta version of the original E3 Zelda Trailer WMB demo (not enough of it was captured for it to be available, not going in to how the beta came into being ;).  The beta just freezes like this, I would have no idea why.  It's not supposed to though I don't think, as I have the actual NDS card of the trailer given out to the gaming press and I assure you there's more video to go along with that audio.
<br/>
<br/>
The NDS card's video and audio quality is better than the WMB demo in case anyone is wondering, although not perfect.  They probably squished it down to fit on a smaller NDS card.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
