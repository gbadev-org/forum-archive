What are your plans for it?
<br/>
<br/>
How about a touchscreen world map so you tap on a location on the lower screen and it will show the weather from the airport closest to where you are? With nice graphics on the top screen of course. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, how about making use of the free GFS (and other) weather data as used by:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.xcweather.co.uk" target="_blank">www.xcweather.co.uk</a>
<br/>
<br/>
This will then give additional info for people whose locations aren't close to airports.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, here's a world list of codes for anyone who can't find theirs:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First thing to do is display graphics according to the weather report.
<br/>
Second will be adding all the features you guys request, hehe. (Thanks for the xmweather site, will look into it asap)
<br/>
<br/>
However, first things go first, so is anyone interested in creating icons? I need big (64x64) and small icons (32x32). Images of the sun, the moon, clouds (4 images: 1-4 clouds) and rain (3 images: light, moderate, heavy) would be useful. Please support this project!

In fact, now that I think about it, it would be nice if you could have maybe two or three locations saved, and cycle between them to see the weather at those locations, as well as alerts for those individual areas.

Hey, that's pretty good! I like the layout very much. Hopefully the texts will fit better in the screen though. The forecast is a bit too big actually, I wanted 4-5 periods to forecast (like weather.com does). But thanks for your effort, do you have an idea where to put wind direction?
<br/>
<br/>
Sektor: nice! I don't know if it's smart to release a patcher thoguh, I'm working on the next version (actually a rewrite) so.. But if you could release a patcher, I'm sure it will last for a week or 2. Hehe, gives me some time.

Perhaps a compass displaying wind direction, various cloud symbols for cloud cover, sun symbols, snow, ice, etc, etc, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
The bottom screen would then be used mostly for anything that required input, such as displaying a screen where the location was entered - either via ICAO codes, some kind of list or, much much better, a map of the world where you tap on a country with the stylus then tap on the airport that's closest to your location.
<br/>
<br/>
Better still, also make use of the non-airport stations that I mentioned earlier via the free data utilised by the likes of by xcweather.co.uk - this ensures even greater coverage.

I'm not sure - I thought I read that xcweather got their weather data from GFS but now I can't find that reference. Whatever, there must be sites that provide freely available weather station data that they wouldn't mind you using for free.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I imagined the interface pretty much how Lynx laid it out.
<br/>
<br/>
With the bottom screen just being the forecasts, only having minimal information (hi/lo, and an icon for the general condition), and then when you tapped that particular day on the bottom, it would open up full screen on the top screen, with the complete data (or however much is available).
<br/>
<br/>
Or if not that, then at least the current conditions always being on the top screen in high detail, and then just the low detail representations for the rest of the week.
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, the weather display for XBMC broken into two separate screens:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://nino.dnsalias.org/xbox/xbmc/Weather.jpg" target="_blank">http://nino.dnsalias.org/xbox/xbmc/Weather.jpg</a>
<br/>
<br/>
That just makes a lot more sense to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, as for the tabs on the bottom, I think that would make a lot of sense to get into the options obviously, but also each tab could be a different location, as we mentioned earlier.
<br/>
<br/>
So hitting the location tabs on the bottom screen would pull in the current conditions and forecast for that area.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Using a proxy server to me has a few pros (like I said before):
<br/>
1) I don't have to code the XML parser. (There are millions of PHP-libs that do that for me.)
<br/>
2) I can output in a smaller format, like ini-format.
<br/>
3) Then the DS would have lesser data to process + lesser data to receive from the <a href="http://www." target="_blank">www.</a>

    <h4>#100074 - Liter - Fri Aug 25, 2006 10:45 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great stuff, BUT I think you need to give more details on how to find your location. 
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, here goes for anyone that is stuck:
<br/>
<br/>
go to:
<br/>
<br/>
weather.com
<br/>
<br/>
and click on 'World' in the top selection area
<br/>
<br/>
then enter your location (city, country or just country) in the box
<br/>
<br/>
when your city of choice is displayed, look at the web address (URL) in your browser's address field and enter the 8 digit alphanumeric code that you'll see. 
<br/>
<br/>
For example for London, United Kingdom the URL will be:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/local/UKXX0085" target="_blank">http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/local/UKXX0085</a> (then a load of other data)
<br/>
<br/>
So on your DS, in the 'Weather.com Location ID: box, enter: UKXX0085 (it can be in upper or lower case, it doesn't matter which)
<br/>
<br/>
Then tap on the 'Currently' tab and tap the green tick.
<br/>
<br/>
It's very fiddly, but I'm sure that this will be made much, much easier in future releases. :-)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Added note: various profiles are available so that other locations can be stored and skipped to directly - simply click on the left and right black arrows (as required) in the top right corner of the DS touchscreen then tap on the Settings tab and enter the weather.com ID for the new location. It is though worth remembering that when you browse to a previously configured profile you'll need to tap on the green tick again in the 'Currently' tab to update the data.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does anyone know how often the weather.com data is updated?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lick - well done on your work so far. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Liter on Sat Aug 26, 2006 1:56 pm; edited 5 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi lick,
<br/>
<br/>
i like ur program and i think its very useful. according to ur instructions, im supposed to create a folder called "DSLiveWeather!" in the root directory of my card right? i created the folder and when i turn off my ds and enter the program again i have an error saying "LibFat failed. Could not find profiles (FAT)." Could it be that im doing something wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
I also see that currently only the "Current" tab is up. hope to see the forecast tab working in one of ur next releases.
<br/>
<br/>
here are some opinons from me which i think can help improve ur lovely little program.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Enable a customizable profile name so that users can refer to the city instead of refering to codes such as "MYXX0008"
<br/>
2. Perhaps you could add a few more attributes such as humidity and visibility. The visibility could come in handy coz sometimes here in Malaysia we get haze (from indonesia) and the visibility levels are quite bad.
<br/>
3. Although already mentioned by many here, i would like to see images and more attactive and slightly larger text.
<br/>
<br/>
thats all for now. hope to contribute something in ur project...tho only opinions. cheers and keep up the great work man

Because LibFAT currently doesn't support a function like mkdir (make directory), that's why you need to create one manually. So put  "DSLiveWeather!" as a directory in your memcard.

<br/>
<br/>
You're using the sub-pixel ability LCDs have.  Nothing wrong with that, in fact, I think everyone should use it because the DS can ONLY have LCD screens :D
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the problem is your text.  It's formatted for Red-Green-Blue pixels.  On the DS, that's the TOP screen.  The bottom screen is actually in Blue-Green-Red order.
<br/>
<br/>
You can see this by saving this screenshot onto your homebrew device:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.dev-scene.com/images/d/de/DSLW%21-WIP60.png" target="_blank">http://www.dev-scene.com/images/d/de/DSLW%21-WIP60.png</a>
<br/>
<br/>
If you view it in DSOrganize, it'll look fine because it's the top screen.
<br/>
<br/>
If you view it on Moonshell, it'll have the funky text like the program because the image is viewed on the BOTTOM screen.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: oh yeah, I have a folder named "DSLiveWeather!" but my settings still aren't saved &gt;_&gt;  I'm using a Supercard CF BTW.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2: Apparently this applies to the DS phat.  I don't know about the DS Lite though, both screens may be RGB.  Maybe there's some way to detect if it's a DS Lite, kinda like how Mario says something "Here we go" instead of "Yahoo" when booting on a Lite.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Nintendo Maniac 64 on Sat Aug 26, 2006 11:55 pm; edited 6 times in total</span></div>

Thanks for telling about this bug! DSLiveWeather! just got a little bit better, again. Hehe..
<br/>
<br/>
I think it's easier to do the language setting on the server than on the DS. I'll see what I can do.
<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I'm using DSWifi and LibFAT, the normal way. Perhaps with the next version of DKP everyone will be able to connect and load/save without problems. Let's raise our heads and hope.. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Had a tough day, I'll add some more updates and go to sleep..
<br/>
You guys are awesome users! I can't believe that there have been over 100 locations requested! (And that's only the cached files! )
<br/>
I will make this application bigger, I promise.

As soon as you enter anything 8-digits long in the Weather.com code text box, FREEZAGE! (and the text box outlines go away if the text box is filled, but only on the lock-up)  These happens even if the DSLiveWeather! folder isn't present and you're just saving to the RAM!

It would sometimes lock after entering the location code, and then other times, after I put in the code, when it went back to the settings screen, there would be random characters and gibberish after the code.

Like:

<br/>
here is some feedback from me. when i was using ur DSLiveWeather--.nds release all was working fine except that i couldnt save my profiles despite creating a "DSLiveWeather!" folder in the root of my card. The error said it couldnt save to FAT.
<br/>
Now im testing out your DSLiveWeather++.nds version when i start, it says 
<br/>
<br/>
LibFat failed.
<br/>
Could not find profiles. (FAT) 
<br/>
Could not find previous reports. (FAT)
<br/>
<br/>
then after entering a profile name and the weather.com id and pressing tick it hangs there and i cant move to the other tabs or press anything else. The error comes out as Could not save profiles. (FAT)
<br/>
<br/>
Could you or anyone tell me what im doing wrong? Or could it be a compatibility issue or something? Im using SCSD now with a kingston 2 GB 50X SD Card.
<br/>
<br/>
oh and btw lick, maybe you would want to name each of your BETA releases for easier reference. Maybe something like DSLiveWeather 0.1Beta or Beta 1</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by awh85 on Sun Aug 27, 2006 11:58 am; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

I use DragonMinded's (coder of DSOrganize) font-generator tool. It generates per-pixel values of a font at a given fontsize. Not the best solution, but it works! :) 
<br/>
<br/>
The situation is very bad, as I don't know why it's working on my system and not on a lot of other systems. The only thing I know that has changed is that I now allocate memory from the RAM. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, <a class="postlink" href="http://lick.huuf.net/DSLiveWeather~~.nds" target="_blank">here is another underground release</a> that adds a AP-connect/disconnect button. Now the report-speed is really quick. I hope it works..

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lick - the latest ~~~ rlease is much better - works fine on my DSL with Supercard CF. :)
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of comments though:
<br/>
<br/>
First, the black left/right scroll arrows (in the upper right corner) for the Settings seem VERY erratic - sometimes they don't respond at all (especially left arrow) and sometimes they're very 'twitchy' and way too fast. This is ONLY when using them in the Settings menu, they're fine when in the Currently menu.
<br/>
<br/>
Settings still work even if a Profile name isn't given - should this be 'allowed'? It doesn't concern me as such but if the field is there then perhaps users should be 'forced' to enter a Profile name for each location?
<br/>
<br/>
The 'Connect to AP' icon isn't that obvious - perhaps it should be in red when disconnected and green when connected? Just trying to go for bit of consistency, therefore green tick/smiley = okay and red cross/sad smiley = not okay. Etc.

awh85: Good that it's not hanging anymore.. I can't believe that the FAT is still not worknig on some cards. I will investigate this and probably ask Chishm what to do..

Liter: probably forgot to change that.. My code is pretty messy as it's getting bigger. I think I need to refactor the large pieces of code in to smaller functions. That'll keep me from making those little bugs! =)

I'll put a default 'Untitled' value there and I'll complain if there is no LocID given. Thanks for the 'user-friendly' tip! =)

I like the icons.... It's supposed to be like faded (tired smiley!) when not connected, and strong (energetic smiley!) when connected. Can I keep this one? PleaaaasE??!!

Guys, you may not have noticed, but I added some key-input to the app, so you can use the d-pad L&amp;R XAB on some menus.
<br/>
 Forgot to mention that earlier.
<br/>
Okay and I uploaded a build with a lightblue/darkblue console to the same file-URL. People who downloaded version ~~ the very first moment (my fans!

Well, there's also beup's dstype (a TTF font renderer). You can use most font files (like Verdana in beup), and it lets you render lots of unicode charas. However, your executable will need 200Kb extra for the ttf file :(<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://akzeac.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://akzeac.blogspot.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi Lick,
<br/>
<br/>
After testing your latest release again I have found some bugs I think.
<br/>
First, I see that you are using the Directional keys to jump between profiles. The Down Key Increasing by 10 profiles while the Up Key Decreasing by 10 profiles. However, when I am at profile 37 for example, and i want to return to profile #0, i press up 3 times and end up at profile #7. I cant press it anymore to go to 0. Is there anyway to make it go all the way to 0 instead? So I guess it subtracts by 10s and if the number is less than 10, it wouldnt work.
<br/>
I also see that you are using the Right Key to increase by 1 profile 
<br/>
ie. 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 and etc
<br/>
But I assume that the Left Key sould decrease the profile count by 1 also right? Somehow its not working for me and maybe you left it out.
<br/>
<br/>
I see that you have implemented L and R to scroll between tabs. Nice feature. Also using the X Key to connect and disconnect while using the A Key to retrieve the data. As you mentioned, you have enabled the directional keys, L and R and also X A B. 
<br/>
Somehow I cant figure out where the B Key works and what it does. Thats all my feedback for now...Cant wait for your next releases. Cheers</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by awh85 on Sun Aug 27, 2006 1:12 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

@ bugreports: I will save those stuff up for the next release with forecasting. I figured I release too much versions, it's harder to track bugs that way.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Latest version works and recieves data just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Another D-pad bug is that after some ups and downs, the 4 headlines "profile name","weather.com Location ID" etc disappear,although it doesn't freeze.
<br/>
<br/>
Generally the D-pad code needs work:
<br/>
<br/>
Right works fine,as it moves to the next profile.
<br/>
Left doesn't.
<br/>
Up and Down should only move through the 4 tabs,no? I think moving through +10 or -10 profiles is nothing more than a bug,correct?<br/>_________________<br/>He who laughs last, obviously didn't get the joke.

I'm going to make this serversided. Along with the request for weather data, it will send a language and the server will respond in that language. Easier I suppose. That will probably be done later though.
<br/>
<br/>
At the key-bugs: yes, those will be removed eventually. I thought I'd put them in real quick, but seems like I wasn't paying too much attention when copying code blocks. Yikes! I'm going to fix them, they're easy bugs.
<br/>
<br/>
Once again, thanks everyone for testing DSLiveWeather. Yes DSLiveWeather. It's official, I am removing the trailing exclamation mark (!). Seems nicer to me hehe.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">here's a question, why can't we use area codes?  I think those are much more known...  Even better would be someway to just enter the name and state/country for data, though that'd probably take some time.  If you can do it on Weather.com, why not here?
<br/>
<br/>
OH, how about displaying UV index, pressure, and visibility?  Hating sunburn as much as I do, I'm VERY concerned about UV index.  And for the time being, seeing if the pressure's going down or up is kinda a poor-man's weather forcast.  It'd do until that's implamented.  Visibility would be good here cause fog is quite frequent. (I'm on the East US coast :P NE Ohio to be precise)
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Oh, what about alerts, like for pollen, flooding, of sever weather?  Could that be in the "Current" tab, or would there be an "Alerts" tab?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT 2: noticing there's omething about the PGA tour on Weather.com, I felt like mentioning I was born in Akron, OH and pretty much all of my reletives live there.  I'm just 25 miles NE of it :D In fact, I just came back from Akron!  YES it was raining the hard like you saw near the end at sparatic moments :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Traffic reports? Yeah, I originally planned that for Dii but don't think the project will ever take off now =(. Seems like there aren't any websites that provide world-wide traffic reports. Not even continental.. It's not like I can write an app for each and every country in the world y'know. Requests are good, but within reachable borders!

Anyway, if there's a worldwide traffic report XML/RSS webfeed that you know of, I'm willing to give it a second thought.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Actually, just creating the 'DSLiveWeather!' directory should be enough. You can even do this in DSOrganize, if you want to. The problem is that libFat currently doesn't ALLOW me to create directories, it just doesn't work. The next release of libFat (that comes with the next release of DevKitPro), will have directory functions so hopefully I can create the directory for you, if it didn't exist yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for trying out DSLW though! I'm working on the next version right now.. (which ironically requires you to create a 'DSLiveWeather' directory, without the exclamation icon (!). So sorry about this..)

<br/>
First build with graphics included. Using XboxMediaCenter Icons by Mathias Mahling.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Installation Notes:</span>
<br/>
- Make sure to create a directory in the root, named "DSLiveWeather". (If you're upgrading from previous installations, remove the trailing exclamation icon ("!") from the directoryname.)
<br/>
- Another important change is the access to 'fetch2.php' instead of 'fetch.php'. Only the mainserver (lick.huuf.net) has the new script, so the alternative (lick.whatalicefound.net) does NOT work with this build.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Bugs</span>
<br/>
Please report any bugs that you find so I can remove them ASAP. 
<br/>
Known bugs:
<br/>
1) Icon covers up some text. =/ 
<br/>
2) Visibility says 'kph' while that should be 'km'.
<br/>
<br/>
Gonna add a 'change F/C' button that switched from F + miles to C + kilometers.

why did you remove the left and right buttons that scrolled through profiles?

And what problems are you encountering in the forecast?Or are you still testing it?

Suggestion: Why don't you display the images on the upper screen and the info on the lower one? I know that the upper screen shows connectivity data but maybe a work around could be made.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had a problem at first with loads of extra numbers being displayed alongside the valid data and fixed it by deleting both the PROFILES and REPORTS files. Before I did this it was also hanging at "Processing data.."
<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions:
<br/>
<br/>
after the 'UV Index', put the number as it is then the letters in brackets, for example:
<br/>
<br/>
UV Index: 1 (Low)
<br/>
<br/>
Same for Pressure, so use:
<br/>
<br/>
Pressure: 29.21 in. (Steady)
<br/>
<br/>
Etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Is Visibility not implemented yet, or does a reading depend on the station?
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be possibile to put the time of the last data update on the Currently (and Forecast) screens?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, will you be adding a list of stations so people don't need to go online with another machine first to find their codes?
<br/>
<br/>
I still think that, eventually, it would be nice for you to display a map of the world where people can then zoom in and tap on their location with the stylus. :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Will test more later, but looking very good so far. :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could show a small graphical image, the date, if it is sunny etc, low/high temp in red and blue colors so you do not have to type low temp etc, humidity, and the uv index. Thats all. You should show the tommorrow,and the next 4 days to come or if you can make use of the two screens maybe you could fit a whole week if you use small images.

I liked the suggestions Liter found they are very practical.Plus I am a big fan of this app and I use it atleast 3 times a day to check the weather and now to see the graphics also.

<br/>
<br/>
If an unknown (or no) location ID is given and the tick clicked for the forecast, why is: 'There is no Location ID!' printed nine times on the top screen? Why not just print it once?
<br/>
<br/>
At one location, for the Wind it displayed:
<br/>
<br/>
From CALMX at 0mph/0kph
<br/>
<br/>
Can you get it to simply display CALM instead?
<br/>
<br/>
As reported for the last versions, left and right black arrows are still sometimes erratic and mostly insensitive when touched with the stylus. I think perhaps you need to extend the sensitive area a little to the left and right of the left and right arrows accordingly.

I don't really think it would be necessary to go through all that trouble. People only are going to want it in one of two locations; either on the root of the card, or under /data. In fact, I would go so far as to say most people would want /data/DSLiveWeather, but that is besides the point.
<br/>
<br/>
Given that there are really only two options, couldn't the program first check to see if the folder exists on the root, and if not, then attempt to load it from inside of /data? Or the other way around?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
