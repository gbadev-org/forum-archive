    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
i need son help with beup
<br/>
I've got a nintendo ds lite with g6 lite and superdard 3, and when i try to run beup, everything goes fine. I can connect and see my contact list offline. But when i change my status to "online", after maybe 2 seconds, beup freeze and a cannot do anything.
<br/>
I know somebody on a french forum that have the same pb but with a different linker ...
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
