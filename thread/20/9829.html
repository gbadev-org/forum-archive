Sounds like the DS game has to be Wii aware (so no playing homebrew on a TV).
<br/>
Maybe, just maybe, Nintendo will embrace homebrew and release some sort of development kit for the Wii/virtual console (this is the only thing that I find interesting about the PS3).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know about homebrew for Wii, but I think I read somewhere that they will allow homebrew programmers to only program games for older systems (GB, GBC, NES, etc.) and run them on the Wii. Or make homebrew programming only in Java, or something like that. I'm not sure though.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Important:</span> Please send messages about FWNITRO to the public forum, not privately to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sony said the exact same thing for the PS2.
<br/>
They will have a token linux for it, but they wont open up the platform for homebrew. 
<br/>
<br/>
A Nintendo dev kit is not comparible to merely having a PS3, its comparible to having a PS3 dev kit....which is much more expensive.
<br/>
<br/>

In Sony's defence, they did provide lots of documentation with PS2 linux (the VUs were fully documented for exmaple) so you were not just programming blind.
<br/>
It is the Cell part of the PS3 that interests me more than anything else and that does seem to be publicly documented (available from IBM's website). So as long as there is some way of run homebrew code on it people will be able to do interesting things.
<br/>
<br/>
Hats off to Nintendo if they do sell the VC dev kit for such a price as it  would make it feasible for a group of homebrewers to produce something commercial.
<br/>
But it is the initial access of writing for the wii that I would like to be free or very low cost. Nintendo would only have to provide some method of running homebrew (and some documentation). Individuals could start playing around and creating stuff then, if they believe their game could be commerical, group together and go the VC dev kit route.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually I remember you could make homebrew on the PS2. When you brought the PS2, there would be a demo disc where you input code and the game gets created. There were a few examples like snake and tetris. The PS2 keyboard was built for this...<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise.
