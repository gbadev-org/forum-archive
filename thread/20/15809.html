    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I decided to re-port SDL Sopwith a while back and just got around to working on it again.
<br/>
It's getting close to release but I need a few people who can play around with it to find as many bugs as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
New for release #4:
<br/>
- Set display back to 320x200, modifying the resolution was screwing up too many things
<br/>
- PSG Sound
<br/>
- TCP/IP Netplay
<br/>
- Added in a keyboard to reduce menu hacks as well as for IP entries
<br/>
<br/>
Todo before release #4:
<br/>
- Finish networking
<br/>
- Power saving</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Hope this release plays as good as an old 486 + keyboard!<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.
