    <h4>#102011 - spinal_cord - Sat Sep 09, 2006 8:54 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I mentioned in another tope a while ago that my DSLite has a problem, it keeps freezing at seemingly random times. it seems that something is shorting inside the maching, to get it to work, I have to half insert a ds cart into slot1 and lever it away from the unit (so that the inside is pressed towards the screen) I assume this re-connects something or disconnects something withing the unit. 
<br/>
<br/>
This problem is becoming more and more common. I have opened the unit and can't see anything obviously broken, so I must ask here, 
<br/>
Does anyone have a clue what the problem can be? Is there any way to fix it?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

Maybe try flashing again, this time with stealth flashme and then send it in :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Not especially. If you moved the polka dot sticker over one of the other two holes and then carefully moved it back after flashing, or if you have a Lite, Nintendo can't tell that you've opened the battery case. True, to distinguish FlashMe stealth from stock firmware, the repair tech could push A+B+X+Y and see that it gets stuck on a white screen, but from all I've read, that's not likely to happen. Besides, under the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson-Moss_Warranty_Act" target="_blank">Magnuson-Moss act</a> and foreign counterparts, it appears that Nintendo can void the warranty only if your modifications caused the damage.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
