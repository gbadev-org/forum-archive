    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi 
<br/>
<br/>
I have a bunch of comics in CD Display RAR Archive and I want to use PictoDS to read them with ComicBook DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
When I try to convert them with ComicBook DS it fails 
<br/>
<br/>
I have some other comics that have worked fine. The only differences that I can see is that these books are about twice as long. 
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any idea what the problem could be 
<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded another version of the same comic (this time in CD Display Zip Archive) and PictoDS worked fine 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
what the ham sandwich is going on here 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In my experience, pictoDS won't convert an archived file if it has more than one layer of directories. i.e. if the image files are in a folder in a folder in a folder of the archive, it won't work. it has to be at the root of the archive, if that makes any sense. 
<br/>
<br/>
Just extract the archive, and convert the whole folder that contains all the images.
<br/>
<br/>
I've had some .CBR archives that had one folder, and in that folder a folder for every chapter. I had to extract the archive, then put all the chapters into one folder together, then convert the whole sh'bang that way. if I tried to just do the .CBR without that process, it would just spit out a file that was like 0kb in size with nothing in it.
<br/>
<br/>
hope that was able to help your sandwich dilemma.

I can't even get comicbookDS to work on my m3real anymore. :(
<br/>
I almost regret getting rid of my r4.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

thanks for the infor but to the best of my knowledge (which is very limited), I don't think there are any layers of directories.  How would I know if there were?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">if you're using winrar, you can just double click the archive, and browse through the file. 
<br/>
<br/>
if when you do that, all the image files are just right there at the first level, it should convert fine.
<br/>
<br/>
if, however, there's a folder, look in there. I believe if it's in a structure any higher than that, it won't convert.
<br/>
<br/>
oh, and can someone post a link to v3?

Not sure why the author has erased most of the evidence that the program ever existed from their site... :/
<br/>
<br/>
...I'm guessing drama.

I also have a mirror of the cbds2 site, but I somehow forgot the password I used for the RAR &gt;:(</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
