    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking at recent facts (virus &amp; co.) seems that flashing the ds firmware it is a good choice. But I have some doubts: it is possible that Nintendo has put some unique code in every DS firmware, so they can block all flashed consoles from new wifi network? If so, it is a way to backup original firmware in order to restore it in this eventuality?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The wifi MAC address is stored in the firmware.

I believe flashme doesn't overwrite this part of the firmware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&gt; Can someone dump an unflashme-d firmware with this tool? 
<br/>
Yes, it works great [already done it - and the uninstalled version is the same].
<br/>
Strictly not necessary, but do it for yourself if you wish (also saves your personal settings as well as the MAC address). You need to run it with a PassMe or WiFiMe of course
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But someone please dump a firmware that flashme-d THEN unflashme-d. I want to compare it with my original FW.
<br/>
There are several versions of known firmware (2 or 3 IIRC) not including the new currently incompatible releases.
<br/>
The FlashMe installer will only install itself on these known versions (keyed of the checksum/CRC)
<br/>
The FlashMe uninstall program includes full copies for the different known versions [that's why it is so big compared to the installer]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's because IIRC ppflash uses (or your using) an old flashme which randomly does the mac address. Check the other thread you posted in.
<br/>
The new flashme keeps your mac address.
<br/>
Before with flashme you had to sign up and enter your mac address so you got a personalised copy.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If mac address is not ok then pictochat and wifi doesn't work.flashme.nds and noflashme.nds dont resolve the problem. only solution would be flashing entire firmware.If you flash entire firmware in 2 ds's you end up with 2 ds's with same MAC address.Probably they can not communicate with each other after that.So the solution would be program to detect after flashing if MAC address is ok and if not generate a new MAC address and flash it.

<br/>
<br/>
Could a software read the MAC from the DS or is everything in firmware?
<br/>
<br/>
Coz my firmware have been flashed with FlashME, erased totaly (bricker) and then reflashed with FlashME again (fail-safe).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow.. normally network devices have the "original" MAC address printed on the device, as a lot of devices allow you to change the MAC address these days.  I'm supprised it's not printed on the DS now that I look at it.  It would suck if you lost your MAC for good because of FlashMe..  :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so the only solution would be for a tool to read /and or write on firmware the mac address. I don't know if this is the only unique information that is written in firmware.Another thing, flashme works great with scard 1.52 I have, and an original nds game same way like passme.But when it comes to upload copies of the game to other ds's, does nt work.Possibly because must be patched to upload from scard instead of nds slot.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So the best thing to do is dump your own Firmware BEFORE flashme, just in case right?

<br/>
Isn't it better to make some sticky or something with this instruction, or add it to the flashme page?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
