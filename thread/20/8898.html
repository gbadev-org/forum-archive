    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think a killer app for the ds would just be the ability to play a gba game on the top screen  with a text file at the bottom screen such as the games faq or a translated guide. I have searched this forum and played around with moonshell but I can't seem to get this to work. 
<br/>
Is anybody working on this type of program or is it out already? or it even Possible?<br/>_________________<br/>Ds firmware 3 Passkey and X-rom 512</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NES? Can.
<br/>
Game Boy Color? Can.
<br/>
Anything else supported by one of Flubba's emus? Can.
<br/>
Super NES? Probably.
<br/>
All those need is for somebody to sit down and port the emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
GBA? Not likely. You'd have to emulate the GBA in DS mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Not with an active bottom screen, no.

We have a GBA booter that lets you pick a border, but thats about it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it possible to like assign VRAM B to the bottom screen, or something like that? You might be able to at least display a static image. Probably not, but has anyone tried?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
