    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's about it. A few examples:
<br/>
<br/>
- a game doesn't support erasing the saved data and you want to start from scratch or resell it; you can format it using REIN(Moon)
<br/>
- you want to borrow the Game Card to someone else and want to keep your game data; just transfer the save file on your flashcard
<br/>
- you are lazy and don't want to complete the game just to unlock something; download a completed save file and restore it to your DS Game Card
<br/>
<br/>
And so on and on ...
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: I prefer REIN over ReinMoon. I just like the simplistic interface.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
