Hm, does Rain work with Animal Crossing?  I don't think it copied my saves right as I tried to copy one onto my DS card and lo and behold all of my progress and my entire village is wiped out (the save is not 256k like I remember hearing someplace it should be, this is with Rain 09).

Well if it worked for him, I'm wondering what the save size is...perhaps it's an M3 issue to where it didn't save all of it or was slightly courrupted (it did seem awful slow in backing it up, even looked like it nearly froze at one point)...I tried it with two backups I made at slightly different times and neither of them worked.   I want to say the save was 128 k, but I can't remember since I deleted them on account of them apparently being courrupt in some way anyway.

As mentioned, RAIN will work for both BACKUP and RESTORE (I've used it with a SuperCard+CF)
<br/>
Some people have had problems with older versions. Get version 9.
<br/>
BTW: you must remove the PassMe before inserting the ACWW DS cartridge directly in the unit for reading/writing.
<br/>
<br/>
The save files should be exactly 256KB (262,144 bytes). They can be loaded into my Map editor (http://www.aibohack.com/nds/ac_mapedit.htm) or Thulinma's pattern editor (http://www.xs4all.nl/~aviator/acww )
<br/>
If the MapEditor fails to load the file, it may be incomplete (don't restore it to the ACWW cartridge or you may lose your town)
<br/>
Once you get a good backup, save an extra copy on your PC.
<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned other hardware devices should work with RAIN, but each one is different</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Mine wasn't 256KB, I'm pretty sure of it.  &gt;_&lt;  I wish I knew why this happened, and why it happened with TWO different backups made at different times.
<br/>
<br/>
I know Rain SHOULD work, I've used it with many games before (and the new M3 dat thing is a nice feature) but it just didn't seem to work right with AC for me for some odd reason.  I tried backing the save up to the dat many times also with no success...it was driving me nuts.  I assumed it was just a quirk in the M3's handling of the save data or something.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I have no idea what happened when I tried to save it (I'm going on a wild limb and guessing some kind of slight courruption of my CF card that is no longer present, it is true that I have done error scanning and reformatted the thing since then).
<br/>
<br/>
Your saves restored perfectly fine, and it looks as though Rain 9 and 6c backed up the save fine.  Darn it, what luck I have. lol
