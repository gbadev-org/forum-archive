    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi guys,
<br/>
my first post here.
<br/>
<br/>
I plan to get my ds this week (eur ds+ndogs bundle), maybe ordering a gbamp+passme.
<br/>
<br/>
I've done my homeworks reading posts, collecting tools/tuts/demos/devkitARMs/flashmes/wifimes/etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Questions/Requests:
<br/>
- could someone please post MD5 sums of tools or at least of flashme.nds so it could not be confused with r0mloader.zip?
<br/>
<br/>
- does the european blue ds+ndogs pack contains an upgraded firmware? how to surely check? should I just get a cheaper silver ds with no game instead? are the two versions different just because of the firmware or there's something in the hw too?
<br/>
<br/>
- in order to do/use homebrew does the superpass work with any gba cart (used ones are cheap) or are such things like M3 perfect-CF a better solution (cf cards are cheaper, I own one and you can even use linux to transfer hot baked programs on it)?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your replies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm, have you tried sending it via WiFi or anything like that?  I can't get it to send this flashme.nds, yet the old version sends fine.  It says it can't load header.bin, so perhaps there's an error there.  It does have the same icon and description (this new version), and NDStool says the CRCs of the header are fine, so I'm not sure what the problem is.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've decided to get the nds+nintendogs pack as I predict myself screaming at the doggie!!!
<br/>
<br/>
unfortunately the package sold out here in europe so I'll get it on next weekend shipments.
