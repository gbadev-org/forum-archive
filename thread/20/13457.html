Wait, you're trying to run homebrew (aka: DS binaries) from the Opera browser? That won't work, if that's what you're doing. Opera DS can't download files, let alone run other DS software from hyperlinks. You need a flash device that can run homebrew (R4, M3, Supercard, etc) for that.
<br/>
<br/>
But like mentioned, you can use Opera do access one of the many web-versions of MSN out there. Google for "web based msn" or something like that. 
<br/>

I remember seeing one that was very lightweight and used bare minimum javascript, years ago. It was aimed at cell-phone browsers, so it should work perfectly on Opera DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
