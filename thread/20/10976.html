    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd like to use one of the DS Download Station to send official demos to another DS. However, I want to choose the demos I want to send myself.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, those demos are compressed. Is there any way to compress demos and replace them with the ones that come with the DS Download Station ROM?
<br/>
<br/>
Until now I used this Tamagotchi game to distribute a certain official demo to unflashed DS units. But it kinda sucks to use it, because it can only send *one* demo. (But at least it works even to unflashed DS units, which is pretty cool.)
<br/>
<br/>
(Oh yeah, my SuperCard CF can send the Download Station Demos to unflashed DS units just fine while my M3 can't.)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The demos will need to be RSA signed, then you can download the DSDS binary (note, that this may be illegal in your country), unpack it with DSLazy, write a LZO compressor and put as many demos as you wish in there ... :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the reply. Yeah, all I probably need is the LZO compressor. I don't know anything about compression algorithmics, so I was wondering if such a compressor was already made and if the creator is willing to share it. ^^;</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

He gaved up trying to make it work, unfortunately.

I really hope someone else can help, though. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's possible (AND EASY!) to make a demo sender with only 1 demo in it... (One without multistage loader and RSA, so cannot be sent to unflashed ds :().

I've tried it and it works perfect.<br/>_________________<br/>The Dark... Is going to kill you today!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
