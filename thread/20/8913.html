    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I bought used NDS few days ago and I have a little problem. When i'm pressing down direction on dpad it creaks. It stops for a while after a puff into dpad (there is a slit around it) but then it happens again and its a little annoying. So i wonder if somebody knows what could help me with this problem? There is some kind of rubber under dpad or something?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes its more like squeak and while the down direction is making that sound its a little bit more resistant. Sometimes its coming back to normal position (after pressing it) a little bit longer than the rest of the directions :/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Isopropyl alcohol (Rubbing Alcohol) is what I use to clean plastic parts.
<br/>
You could take it apart to make it easier to clean the grim out of the d-pad.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Just be sure to let the alcohol evaporate before applying power to the device.</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The sounds comes because the D-pad is battered. So there is plastic powder in those plastic pieces. Just clean it with alcohol. 
<br/>
*Don't even think about drinking it in the same time. Too risky. :D*<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
