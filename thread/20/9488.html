    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i recently acquired a ds from a kid in school, the problem with it is that whenever you turn on the ds the bottom screen flashes the top one doesnt flash at all and then it turns off. i have tried shorting out SL1, and i have tried putting on a different battery as well as using the power cord. i got access to all the ds thanks to a tri wing screwdriver, do you guys have any ideas on how to fix this?
<br/>
<br/>
p.s i know for a fact that this kid does not do homebrew stuff, so he cant have the ds bricked or with flashme installed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
