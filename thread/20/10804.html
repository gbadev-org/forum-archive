<br/>
anything vibrant or of high contrast smears terribly during movement.. e.g. a moving stick figure on a white surface becomes a blurry mess.
<br/>
this is the screen, right? is the phat ds better?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
on my 16ms pc lcd on dualis, dsemume, and no$ it is fine, 
<br/>
on dslite hardware it has obvious smear problems.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">its as simple as it gets, i threw it together with palib, made a white static bg and one sprite with pagfx. init pa, pacreatebg painitbg, pacreatesprite, if pad.held.up y-- pasetspritexy etc.
<br/>
<br/>
but im positive its the screen.. once i noticed it i saw its happening in my bigger apps too, on both backgrounds and sprites, regardless of code, its just less noticeable when theres not so much contrast or much slower/faster movement.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by mgaijin on Mon Aug 14, 2006 11:10 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I tested it on my old DS, my sister's old pink, my Lite and an emulator.
<br/>
All the DS units indeed do blur the sprite, but in a different way. On my Lite, the darker tone 'takes the lead', on the pink DS it's the lighter tone and on my old DS it's somewhere between. Not much of a big deal, though.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">mahe thanks for the information!
<br/>
<br/>
for me its a bigger deal on the backgrounds, not so bad on most sprites because theyre constantly moving, but make a background with some black outlining and scroll it a little, its pretty noticeable.. im going to have to go over my graphics with some lighter colors it seems.
<br/>
<br/>
i wonder if there are any different screen types on the ds lites, i'd like to get my hands on some jap/euro models and see.. might even be variants in the different usa manufacturing runs already. if i could find a threshold for what is noticeable on each model i'd be able to automatically check my tile data for problematic neighboring colors..</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by mgaijin on Mon Aug 14, 2006 11:21 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">dan: the blur on my pc lcd is significantly less noticeable in all emulators, it seems the dslite screen has a slow response time in comparison to current lcds on the market, thats what im trying to confirm</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But I still wonder if you're correctly waiting for the VBlank. Are you?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I ONLY have a old LCD (Panasonic Cf-27!!) - I didn't know newer 'fixed' the blur thing</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've noticed more blur in scrolling games on my DS lite than on my DS phat, but it could also be that I can see the screen that much better!
<br/>
<br/>
Look, we're talking about $130 device with two screens.  Of course they cut corners.  I'm sure the response time is horrible compared to a few hundred dollar monitor!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
