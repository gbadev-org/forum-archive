I started off using the WMB tools for Linux (first beacontest, later masscat's wmb host) to do WiFiMe-type boots.  Using that method I've been able to boot nesDS off my flash cart but never off the GBAMP.  I've tried using nesDS as the _BOOT_MP.nds, I've tried loading from Moonshell, and I've tried using the simpler boot menu system, and I can't get nesDS to work from the GBAMP.  Now I've flashed my NDS and I still can't get it to load from the GBAMP - but it loads just fine from the flash cart.
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't tried booting nesDS via WMB yet...<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As I recall, saving to a compact flash device (such as the GBAMP) doesn't work yet.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
