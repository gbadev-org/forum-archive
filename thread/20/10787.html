    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was playing polarium, switched off, put in mariokart, and nothing happened, i switchend it on and the only think that happened was the green led came on. took mariokart out, went into the menu, set it for manual instead of auto. switched it off, put mariokart back in, switched on, menu came up, pressed on mariokart, screens went black.
<br/>
switched off, switched on, nothing, just two black screens and a gloeing green led.
<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was, return it to nintendo, get a replacement, but its flashed, so thats out of the question.
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone give me some ideas as to whats wrong and how to fix it?<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you install FlashMe using a borrowed GBA flash card, intending to use it only for homebrew WMB? If not, then put FlashMe Stealth on the card that you originally used to install FlashMe, and A+B+Select+Start+power on. You may be able to reinstall FlashMe this way, and your system may start working as usual.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It turns out I have problems with the lite. It switches on when I hold a DS game in realy hard, I cant even with from a gba game (I have to hold a NDS cart in hard to get the the menu to launch a GBA game).
<br/>
<br/>
I've heard that MML can damage the cart slot, is this true? I've been using that for a week(ish) before flashing it (because I was woried about how it didnt feel to fit properly, perhaps too big?)
<br/>
<br/>
The LED is slightly dimmer when it doesn't boot, than when it does.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a unflash lite yet? I unflashed it, but now nothing in the menu works accept launching a game.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had several 'issues' with the Max Media Launcher - not only did it feel 'too big' for the slot, it often wouldn't boot at all, and sometimes required a little pressure from the top to make it work.
<br/>
<br/>
Worse still, on a couple of occasions it crashed in some way, making my DS appear to be bricked. The ONLY way i could get it to work again was to remove the battery from the DS for a few minutes, then try again. I assume it was leaving crappy code somewhere in the DS's memory.
<br/>
<br/>
I would try the battery trick first, and if that doesn't help, attempt to flash it with Flashme7-Stealth like Tepples mentioned. If there's a hardware fault, and you're able to install the stealth version, Nintendo will probably replace it for you. They did for me.... heh</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried the battery thing, it worked once, I found I had to keep pressure on the cart slot, pressing towards the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
For some weird unknown reason, it seems to have fixed itself (I purchased a tri-wing screwdriver in case it happens again, I can look to see if anything is shorting behind the screen).
<br/>
<br/>
So for now, I'm happy.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">did he really flashed his DSlite the right way?
<br/>
<br/>
was mario kart the culprit of his firmware change?
<br/>
<br/>
or does his hands have the power of simple touch trouble shooting repair?
<br/>
<br/>
but never-theless did his dslite starting working out of the blue as a sign from above?
<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned on unsolved mysteries

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think I might be having a similar problem, it refuses to detect the M3 sometimes, and occasionally it crashes within the M3 menu and even on the NDS menu. Perhaps this is related to Moonshell crashing when opening an MP3.
<br/>
Luckily enough, my DS Lite just happens to be one of those with a cracked hinge. How lovely. :P
<br/>
Guess I should send it off to Nintendo for repair/replacement... Guess it's a good thing I'm using FlashMe v7 Stealth.
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how long it'll take to get it back from them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
