    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Isn't there already a SimCity game on the DS? Think so.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's not make it a justification so that noone ports it, but i'm pretty sure the "interest" to port it will be reduced as the game exists, and it's harder to port to a handheld than compiling/including it in a linux distro.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still pretty sure someone will start it.
<br/>
Even more if the GPL'ed version of the game is "better" than the DS version (which i never tested so i can't say ;) 
<br/>
Anyway, that's great news !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I've heard it's just the simulation code and not the DOS stuff like graphics, ect...
<br/>
<br/>
Still, it would really be suited to the DS's 2D hardware if you could re-make the graphics.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
