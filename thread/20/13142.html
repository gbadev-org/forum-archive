    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just downloaded a few homebrew apps and I tried playing a few but for some reason, the touch screen didn't work! It worked perfectly when I was playing Pokemon a few minutes ago.

This is one of the games I had problems with:

Please help!

And I don't think this game is DLDI patchable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Did you calibrate the touchscreen?
<br/>
<br/>
I've actually seen this on one of my DSs as well.  Never took the time to see what the problem was, because I just used a different one, but for some reason WordUp will stop taking touchscreen input.  It boots up fine, I can touch to start, but after that the touchscreen doesn't work.  I have tried playing the game on the GBA MP, R4, etc.. it's something with that hardware, as it works fine on my other two DSs..  I should try calibrating the touchscreen and see if that helps.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, it might be a devkitarm problem, like an old version. So adding DLDI would require a devkitarm update and therefore fix the problem? :P<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

I seriously have no idea. I think DLDI may fix it. All my homebrew programs with DLDI seem to work perfectly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
