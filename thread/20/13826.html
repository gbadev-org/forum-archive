    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My friend is thinking about getting a flashcard, but one thing he uses his old 33MHz PDA for is ebooks.  He wanted to know if PDF format documents would be possible on the DS, and if so, is there a program out there that reads them already?  If I knew more about the format, I might even try writing one (probably wouldn't support images or formatting though).<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
