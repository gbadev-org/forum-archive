    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
I swear a lot, and as a result, my DS's back sticker is gone. I didn't noticed that the serial number is only there (I can't see it on the box nor on firmware) and I couldn't write it down. Now, I'm buying Lite and I'm gonna sell the old one to a shop and they say they need the serial number.
<br/>
So, Is there any homebrew app or something I can see the serial number with?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx a lot!
<br/>
If there's no way, What should be the format (numbers? chars?), and see if I can "figure out" one myself ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Thanx again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I swear, that sticker is designed to peel off after a year.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most irritating is that the DS Lite appears to be the first handheld made by Nintendo which features a proper barcode that Doesn't wipe off when it makes contact with the outside world.
<br/>
...Come to think of it, I think it's the first time they've done proper paint period.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Thank gawd for that! That's exactly what happened to me, except I took it off after I took the plastic covers off the screens and the Nintendo badge. It's been leaking grey ever since. I thought I was the only one. (V1, btw)<br/>_________________<br/>Not active on this forum. For Lemmings DS help see its website.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

you could always look at the back of a few nintendo ds boxes in the store to get the idea of serial number format...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And why would the shop need a serial number? Perhaps it's going to run it by Nintendo? In that case, making one up probably wouldn't work.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by ssj4android on Fri Jun 23, 2006 5:11 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
