wouldn't that be just the same as that other painting program?

exactly that lol.

i just thought this could be another pointless homebrew app that has been made just for the sake of making it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Those who saw the movie <span style="font-style: italic">Elf</span> might remember that knobs of an Etch-A-Sketch product can be manipulated at the same time. A proper simulation would need two spinner inputs, and simulating two spinners on a touch screen would need multitouch. It would be possible with the iPhone, but the API for that is still vaporware. It would also be possible with an Arkanoid controller plus the DS touch screen, but does jay001 have an Arkanoid controller?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

but for the diagonal line problem maybe there could be a toggle switch; when selected turns the up/down and left/right knobs, into top left to bottom right, and top right to bottom left. The only solution i can see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think this idea really requires an especially capable programmer and certainly not one of 15+.
<br/>
<br/>
Even someone with no programming experience at all could probably produce a working Etch-A-Sketch clone in a couple days.
<br/>
<br/>
Jay001, I really encourage you to look into setting up devkitPro with PAlib and making this app yourself.  I'm positive that you can do it.

<br/>
Well, I suppose the first couple days would actually just be taken up with getting the environment set up and looking at the templates and compiling and messing with a few samples, but after that once the actual programming starts, I don't think it would take more than a couple days.  Depends on how much actual programming you do in a day, of course.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I may be drastically underestimating how difficult it would be to make an Etch-A-Sketch program.  Thinking about it, I guess it would require some sort of pseudo-bitmap mode, which is something I've never dealt with.  I think PAlib does have a bitmap graphics mode, though.

<br/>
I saw this post this morning and made this little demo.
<br/>
I tried the method of using d-pad as left nub and abxy as right nub :P.
<br/>
Almost works okay, except for a few problems. The d-pad is much easier to control than the little ABXY buttons. The method I used to test this isn't so great... (can get some weird effects by holding certain combinations).
<br/>
Anyway, Start clears the screen, d-pad moves up/down and ABXY controls left/right, so just rotate your thumb around those :P
<br/>
I included source so feel free to fix up the game if you want :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think I'm forgetting any of that because it's all stuff I still deal with myself.  I'm a beginner, too.  I have recently been playing around with writing one or two things on the DS and a couple years ago I released a couple things for the Neo Geo Pocket, but previous to that I had no programming experience at all aside from

on my Commodore 128.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I did make a pretty cool and somewhat complicated topdown racing game on the 128 once.  I wish I still had that.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the difficulty of programming is somewhat exagerated.  All it takes is the ability to think creatively and problem solve methodically.
