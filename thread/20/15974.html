This is a bit of a tricky question. In general, discussions involving piracy are frowned upon on this forum, for multiple reasons:
<br/>
- Piracy are beyond the scope of this forum. By discussing it, we give  Nintendo (and others) a reason to shut us down. We don't want that.
<br/>
- Many of us are professional developers, and/or dislike the idea of stealing from our friends and colleagues.
<br/>
- Pirates smell of grog and sweat.
<br/>
- Add your reason here.
<br/>
<br/>
As of writing, the only <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9484" target="_blank">forum-rule</a> that explicitly discuss piracy is the linking-rule, but I strongly suspect that you can get banned for other piracy-related reasons if you push it.
<br/>
<br/>
Where the "rest of the homebrew community" stands on piracy is not something I can answer, because I don't know. I only hang around here. I guess the rule of thumb pretty much anywhere would be "don't go there", though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
I must admit, that I have tried some games on friend's and family's NDS' before buying them and not all of them were legal copies. But, piracy still sucks. Especially, when it's your (<span style="font-style: italic">my</span>) job to make these games.
<br/>
Well, I haven't worked on a title that's been released already, so technically speaking, I don't need to worry... yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Regular (read: the very, <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> most of) developers don't "make money" with these games (and publishers take a high risk on their part, especially when giving small, new studios the chance of developing and releasing a <span style="font-style: italic">new</span> game - that's so serious, it's not funny; not even a little bit.) We always have to <span style="font-style: italic">work hard</span> to even get something to <span style="font-style: italic">work</span> on (develop games to make and find means for their funding - a freaking lot of money - some make that in a year or two! -, time and sweat goes into a project <span style="font-style: italic">before</span> it even gets a budget from a publisher) and secure future deals whenever possible (once you're in the business, doesn't mean you're in <span style="font-style: italic">for good</span> - you're pretty much a contract worker), but we usually don't become millionaires... Well, <span style="font-style: italic">usually</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
It's hard work and we don't want to become unemployed due to our games "not selling", although being (illegally) played by everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this perspective speaks for itself.
<br/>
Sharing homebrew is cool, piracy is not!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, gxxtxxx.net is also "against" piracy but everyone does it there, and openly just no linking. So really it depends on who you ask. I really say if you own the game, it's a gray area. If you don't then it's just beyond a red area. (You wouldn't open the case inside of a store and take the cartage home, if you knew you weren't going to get caught because it feels wrong. So it should be the same online)

This may vary from country from country, but I read it often when people ask if it's legal to download something they already own. Like movies...

some country even tolerate downloading when you do not own the original (whilest downloading from an illegal source would be illegal, we have there a case that makes precedence where the user was declared not guilty since he can not know if the source is illegal...). now that is still a grey area but the fact is that they only punish sharing in our country... that doesn't change the position of gbadev at all and all piracy discution are baned there, but all these discution about what is piracy just raise a question, is the "piracy" clearely defined there? and if yes on which base?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As another poster pointed out, it depends on the country.  FWIW, there are countries where piracy is openly tolerated, so any laws against it that may exist in those places are more or less meaningless.  All of this this really is beyond the scope of this discussion though.  What is important is that people get in trouble and places get shut down by breaking the rules where rules matter.  Since a lot of servers are located in places where rules matter, rules tend to matter in general.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, this forum is not a channel for piracy, or behavior related to piracy.  End of story.  Either give up or take the conversation somewhere else.

As for the law; fair use iirc allows backup copies (as well as disassembly for works that contain knowledge that is not publicly available) to be made, but copyright law prohibits its distribution of copyrighted material, as well as public releases of derivative works of the disassembled media.
