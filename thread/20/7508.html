    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I know this has been discused before, but I didn't find the answer why doesn't chishm make some support for official game demos. I love playing them via WiFiME, but that's not remotely portable. Since GBAmp is on my way, I'd like to take 'em with me. 
<br/>
<br/>
AFAIK, there are problem with potential grow of piracy on GBAmp, but, heck, you only need to load the code in RAM and then leave it alone (no saving is required anyhow,).
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my rusty engrish, but I simply don't understand.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That needs to run off of a Flashcart, so it wouldn't be able to run from a GBAMP.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I love my GBAMP+Passme, but cant play demos with it, and cant afford anything else.
<br/>
<br/>
I was told it was some sort of ram-loading issue meaning the *.nds files cant work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its due to a few reasons. I am not including security CRC calculations on the file (like WMB normally does) since this isn't needed for homebrew games. I am also not initialising the memory in the way the games expect, again because homebrew doesn't need this.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Surely its impossible for pirate games to work anyway though?
<br/>
<br/>
Access to the Compact Flash card would be too slow for anything unless the game was written for it anyway. (ie, Homebrew).
<br/>
So couldnt ram-only demos work, while still being secure against comercial pirate roms?
<br/>
<br/>
My knowledge is just based on the GBAMP's *.gba playing abilitys here, so I may be completely wrong. The only commerical roms that can play are NES/MasterSystem stuff emulated.
<br/>
<br/>
Im just asking, as I'm assumeing your doing this as a non-piracy messure, dont see this as a whinning "I want this!!" type thing ;)
<br/>
You certainly get my thanks many times over for what you have done already.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Darkflame on Thu Nov 17, 2005 2:27 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

If only that were true. Unfortunately, the M3 demonstrated that it is indeed possible to run pirate ROMs directly from CF card, since it has a streaming mode. 
<br/>
<br/>
The reasons I haven't looked too far into getting it to work are 1) Piracy, 2) Laziness. Seriously, I would like them to work too, but the amount of work involved is a lot. The effort is better spent improving my FAT lib for homebrew games to use.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

I don't know about 1) but releasing the source code would let someone else on this board or on That Other Board help with 2).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But, what would the GPL matter?  As long as they provide the modified source, which we all know the pirate captains don't do any of the real work anyway, they can still hack it how they want and sell the hell out of it.

<br/>
The only pisitive I can see that may come from releasing the source is additional features for homebrewing.. somehow I doubt there will be much help in that area.  :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
