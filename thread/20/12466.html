I need to create sprites of the various characters making up a font. While I could probably use GIMP and muck about, it would be nice if there was quicker way...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There used to be a program called TTF2PCX, which I used for my Allegro based games until it stopped working sometime around when I upgraded from Windows 9x to Windows 2000. You might consider making a program that does something similar using the FreeType library.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I did some more careful googling this time and found a bunch of tools that convert TTFs into various bitmap formats :-)

Bah, next time I'll be less quick to post a "Help Plz" topic :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ImageMagick ( <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php</a> ) will render TTFs into a bitmap (I think you'll have to pass in a string of all the chars you want tho).  A little tip is to render big then scale the resulting bitmap down, this way you get a better quality image than rendering the TTF directly at a small size.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
