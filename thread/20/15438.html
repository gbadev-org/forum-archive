    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi guys, I'm new here and I'm interested in graphics and games so I thought I should combine both of this and offer my graphics for some projects.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this the right place to offer this service and ask for work or do I search for developers searching gfx artists? If so... where? :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

welcome to the forum. you could post link to some of your work in the help offered forum. in any case, you should show some examples in order to get people interested. i'm sure sooner or later someone will send you a request.
<br/>
<br/>

I see you are from berlin. I'm from bayreuth in bavaria and wounder why I'm posting this in english :). 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways most of my stuff is posted on a forum that requires registration and can't be linked directly. My style is kinda abstract, I'veposted some sketches there and some other fun photoshop pictures. And no, I never did anything for games :) That's why I'm here...

#edit: oh, I found the help wanted board, I'm gonna browse around there :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
