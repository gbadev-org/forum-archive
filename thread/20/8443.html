<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about this question!
<br/>
But I want to play mario cart using wifi but I don`t know. should I put frimware V6 to my ds or not?
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to upgrade my ds but I did a huge mistake and turned off my ds so my ds is dead.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you do *not* have flashme installed, then there will be no problems at all with running mario kart.
<br/>
<br/>
If you *do* have an older version of flashme installed (installed before last November), then you should upgrade again before running mario kart.
<br/>
<br/>
If you run mario kart on a DS with an old version of flashme, it is not as bad as failing a flashme install.  The failsafe is still in place, and you re-run flashme from a GBA cartridge by holding down A+B+select+start.
<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to run flashme, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read the instructions very carefully and follow them.  If you keep your DS plugged into the wall, then you can leave it on for as long as you need to, until you are able to properly short SL1 again.  Never turn off the DS if the flash has started at all.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat
