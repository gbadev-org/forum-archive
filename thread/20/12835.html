    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just want to know if there are any English dictionary out there for the DS be it homebrew or commercial. The only three commercial ones i know out there are the Japanese DS Rakubiki Jiten and its sequel as well as the Korean Touch Dictionary. It would be very handy to have a dictionary software which does english only, or at least translates stuff into english. Please enlighten. Thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you go to the Moonbooks website, they've got a text-only version of the English dictionary.  It takes a long time to find the word you're looking for though.  Personally I open it in DSLinux with vi and use that to search through it, but since the file is so huge it only works on the RAM builds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey dan, thanks for replying. Just read few of ur stuff in scdev. Anyway,.currently using SC DS One with the SC Moonshell. What kinda kit u suggest to get? Such as DSLinux and homebrew to get a good DS experience. Used DSOrganize and Beup. Havent tried on the others tho.
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the topic. if thats the case, do u think its worth the time and effort to look up a word in the way that you've mentioned?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Wiktionary works in Opera (unless you live in the Americas). Or you can wait for DragonMinded to put basic HTML forms into DSOrganize.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks tepples, will have to get a slot 2 to run opera though, so just gotta stick to waiting for Dragonminded, unless i could find one available at a suitable price around my area. Thanks again, appreciated.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't buy a slot-2 card for the express purpose of searching through a dictionary with DSLinux.  You can use Moonshell's scrollbar to get to the general location of the word and then use the right and left directional keys to scroll somewhat quickly through the remaining text.  To demonstrate, I searched for "apple" and found it within 30 seconds.  I was merely mentioning that you could do searching like you would find in a Notepad-like app with DSLinux, though manually scrolling in Moonshell isn't that bad, especially since it's split up into 24 separate text files, one per letter (XYZ are combined into one).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Aight, got that dan. Thanks a lot for the info. I'll do that and see how it goes. Kind curious why nintendo didnt or has yet to release an english dictionary for DS, which would be a major plus on users ( or there already is which i'm not aware of).

<br/>
Appreciate ur prompt and straightforward reply Dan and tepples. Keep up the good work</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
