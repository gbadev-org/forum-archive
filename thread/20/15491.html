    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now, I use my ds for everything I do. I use DS organize as a text editor, Bunjalloo for a web browser, and DS organize for the rest of the stuff I need :)
<br/>
<br/>
Im using a 128sd card for this (a 1gb sd card is set aside for my music:)), so, as you could have guessed, I'm very tight on memory. I download alot of stuff using bungalloo, mostly for my deviant art, I get my artwork to show it off to my friends :)
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I was wondering if there was a homebrew that shows the Total amount of memory on the SD card and how much is used and how much is left over, or something of the sort? like I said, I tend to download things, so I'm always afraid of running out of memory. Just wondering :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">FAT is ancient, with no real way to do it. To find free clusters, you pretty much have to scan for them. :P
<br/>
<br/>
There's been talk of adding the info, in the form of statvfs() support (search boards on "statvfs", if you're curious)... the only other methods that come to mind are hacky at best.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">(Actually, FAT32 has a free cluster count, but it's not too reliable, being a frequent Scandisk complaint in my experience! My win98 machine would crash with a mean period of 3-4 Earth days, leaving the FAT in a state of slight but perpetual confusion. o_o *shiver* Man, I miss some things about the '90s but software was NOT one of them.)

Only because you are doing something wrong.  DSLinux (latest release) works perfectly fine on my GamesNMusic (when patched with DLDI v1 and renamed to bootme.nds)..  Only issue I would see is that it is 30MB in size.. which, if you cleaned up that much room.. you wouldn't need to use the 'df -h' command anymore.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have no clue but I cant ever find it and when I found it, it said there was missing files and asked for a password :(
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I found out it was my computer making an error, like the said sometimes happens with winrar when extracting :) when it extracted the file, it thought it was a .tar instead of a .tgz (I think thats what it said), and I got it to extract properly now :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):
