    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, the second linked worked. Dunno whats up with the first site (still not coming up for me). Anyway, I tested out the program and it is pretty decent.  The interface is simple and easy to use. I was surprised you actually included all the brushes from photoshop (nice touch). There are a few things I would add. One would be variable brush size (it jumped from pencil to a thick line, would have liked to tweak it). There were also some issues with drawing too fast on the screen. I realize why you did this (I was having similar issues with the touch screen), but it kinda cramps my style. I like to sketch quick gesture drawings. Also, it might be nice to be able to draw a larger picture and scroll across or zoom. Other than that it is a pretty solid paint program, nice work.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks nice and all but I can't doodle properly :\
<br/>
Try scratching back and forth, it doesn't draw like it should.

I've seen this before but have no clue where or when, sorry.<br/>_________________<br/>Packin':
