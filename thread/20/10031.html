    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the spirit of shared information, here's a quick synopsis of my DS Lite fuse repair.
<br/>
<br/>
I used this picture <a href="http://www.collinmeyermusic.com/DSLITEFUSE.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.collinmeyermusic.com/DSLITEFUSE.jpg</a> to locate F2 on my DS Lite.
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered a tri-wing NDS screw driver off e-bay for something like $6 with shipping.   
<br/>
<br/>
Once I got the DS Lite opened I could see that the fuse was much smaller than I had expected and the components are packed very tightly.  I couldn't get in there with tweezers AND a soldering iron at once to remove the fuse, so I put flux over the fuse and soldered a small drop of solder over the fuse to bridge it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I could tell when I was opening the DS Lite that I would have to be careful not to lose the plastic volume control attachment from the case.  Despite my best efforts it was propelled from my working desk somehow and I can't find it.  
<br/>
<br/>
The right trigger button also wanted to pop off... this happened a couple of times and the small spring inside it would fling itself..   it's not that difficult to put back together, but the possility of losing parts is there. 
<br/>
<br/>
Once the DS Lite casing was re-assembled I powered on my DS Lite and was greeted with the initial set up screens since I had removed the battery.   
<br/>
<br/>
At this point I was very saddened because I could tell there was a slight flicker in the screen that had not been there before.  I am not sure whether this is from prior electrical damage or from the presence of heat from my soldering iron...  i have not found a solution for this at this time.
<br/>
<br/>
A last notes for those who are interested:
<br/>
<br/>
The cause of this fuse break was not a Flashme update..   I was trying to build a custom adapter for the DS card slot in order to gain access to it's pins.   In the process, some combination of pins must have been bridged somehow and caused the fuse to pop.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
