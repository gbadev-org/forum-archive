    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey, two questions: Firstly, anyone here not currently busy with a ds homebrew project; also whom is good at coding Ds games want to help get a homebrew zelda well on its way? The game has been started. LinkW has a few mockup screens, and has one thing a walking demo. Due his busyness he could use help from others in the ds homebrew community. So anyone up for the challenge?  
<br/>
<br/>
Just PM me, and email LinkW at <a href="mailto:linkw@surrendergames.com">linkw@surrendergames.com</a> and he will give you what you need to do. Also, he will add you to the credit list. 
<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, can anyone here help port Ocarina Of Time 2d from the Computer to the DS and create anoth online/lan quest. I'll come up with the story behind it. All anyone would have to do is is just port it and add the other quest 
<br/>
<br/>
Just PM me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm asking people here because I din't have any coding skills.  I'm just recruiting people for TLOZ: Hero Of Time DS. Also, I'm trying to get some people to port the other one and add a multiplay (Lan)/single play quest to it. It would be amazing. If anyone want to do the ocarina of time 2d thing, I'll have the story writen out  for the single play/ multiplay (lan) quest. All anyone would have to do is code the game to the DS and code the second single play/ multiplay

This may appear a bit shocking, but that in itself is asking quite a bit. This is homebrew, if all you can contribute is a story line, you are probably out of luck in seeing your dreams to completion. Ideas are plentiful, programmers and artists are in short supply; however, almost no one will program for an artist, things usually work the other way around.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd have to agree with relpats here (nice name btw, the_stapler, XD).  I'd also like to add that if this is the same LinkW I know from another forum, then I know he's 12 and probably doesn't have a firm grasp on the way game development tends to work.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I wasn't aware there even was a completed OOT2D for the computer (and I'm a mod at Zelda Fan Game Central, so something like that would have been big news), so I would find it difficult to port a game that doesn't even really exist.  Do you have a download location for said game?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Question:  what exactly will it be a port of?  Usually the word "port" implies that the product being ported already exists.  I would be highly interested to see a completed OOT2D project, as I have seen several people attempt it and give up after a while.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would still need to exist before it could be ported.  To be honest I highly doubt Daniel Barras aka TRM is still working on OoT2D, but if he is then that's great.  Considering that he hasn't shown anything more than screenshots to "prove" its existence since 2003 though, I wouldn't get your hopes up.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But if he did, would anyone here port it? and add an additional Ds multiplay (lan) quest to it?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Or would anyone here want to edit Lupi's Homebrew Zelda ds demo source and make it into a completely different game? <a href="http://usuarios.lycos.es/lupidangame/" target="_blank">http://usuarios.lycos.es/lupidangame/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, If you look on TRM's website it says coming soon and it has the game menu of OOT2D up. The site just recently went under construction and the this screen was put up a few weeks ago</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's been "coming soon" since Christmas 2003.  Even if it does come out, what's the chance that he'll make it open-source?  Highly unlikely.
<br/>
<br/>
Looking at that page, it does not look like lupidan released the source code for his demo, meaning that a port would not be possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
