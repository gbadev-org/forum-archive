    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hate my first post having to be a help request, but I'm quickly running out of options and I'm hoping someone here with more experience might be able to save me from having to return my shiny new toy.
<br/>
<br/>
I finally got my first card today, a DSTT, and excitedly started loading up the programs I'd been collecting over the weekend in anticipation for it to get here. I got moonshell functioning, and was trying to work from there when I ran into an issue with DSOrganize that quickly became a problem with all my hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
I had DSOrganize 3.2 loaded on my card, but while browsing the homebrew download list I saw that there was another version listed to download (2.17 I think?) I selected the download, since I forgot what version I had, and it made it either halfway through downloading or installing it before the system froze and I had to shut it off. Not too big a deal, I thought to myself... until I start it back up, go past the health and safety screen, and the little microSD card on the top screen was red, and read "Error!" and nothing more. I took the card out, then loaded it back onto my computer, thinking that I would just remove the DSOrganize files and put them back in fresh, only to find that one of the folders refused to be deleted, giving me an error message that the "directory is not empty". 
<br/>
<br/>
I pared it down bit by bit until I found the offending file, a config.ini file that was corrupt and kept re-appearing in one of the language folders no matter how many times I deleted it. I did some searching, then formatted the card, and reloaded everything fresh. Same error message from my DSTT. I got another MicroSD card that was lying around the house (a SanDisk card, like the one that came with the DSTT), tried loading it up and putting it into my DS, and got the same error. I formatted that card and tried again. I've tried pushing the cards down when I boot up the DS and putting a piece of paper in to make sure the cards sat in the DSTT cartridge snugly like I'd seen suggested elsewhere. The only things I can get my DSTT to do are give me that error screen, or a no card screen if I load it with neither card inserted.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm honestly out of ideas at this point, and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on things to try, or if I accidentally killed my card with that incorrect download. I'm really hoping for the former, and thanks in advance for any replies.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have no experience with this card, but it sounds like you need to scan for bad sectors and stuff like that. Just put the card in your computer, right click on it and goto properties. Then, goto the Tools tab and click Check Now and check both boxes and start the scan. After this, you'll end up with a bunch of deleted files (in a found.000 folder) that you can probably delete. Now, after this, reformat your card, and then put stuff back on. Thats how I got my GnM card to start working after gettin No Media Device found, which is probably the same equivalent to your error on your card.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):
