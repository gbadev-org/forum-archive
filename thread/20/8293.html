    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had heard that you can run the E3 Demos(along with various wifi homebrew) by modifying the official USB connector so it uses Buffalo's drivers. I did this(thanks to Waffle's handy tutorial), but don't know what to do now. I tried to run FireFly's program, but it wouldn't work because I don't have the card.

<br/>
Is what I'm trying to do possible, or am I just barking up the wrong tree?

Sorry if this is in the wrong section.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
