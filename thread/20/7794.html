I think it could be possible, but that would just call Java anyway, the easyest thing is for you to replace java with the complete path to the java.exe file.
<br/>
This is probably something like c:/Programs/JRE (or JDK...) ... you can just do a search.
<br/>
<br/>
Updating the java installation could also be a solution.
<br/>
<br/>
Another solution again is to just doubleclick on the server.jar file, if Java is set up right on your machine.
<br/>
<br/>
PS. The source code of the java application is included in the jar file, the code for the DS application is still not released, I'll wait until the app and sgstair library becomes more stable...

Actually, even if I had no way to test it, the app should work with any router that supports Sgstair library.
<br/>
The only difference is that, once connected and selected transfer from the menu, you should edit the destination IP to be that of the machine where the server is running.

If I have time, I could try to add the other method for executing (the default libNDS one), would that work ona  flash card?
<br/>
Also, I would be interested on the possibility of executing from memory on the GBAMP, so this would probably make the CF card live a bit longer when doing continuous tests...

Yes, it is still using the old version, but Sgstair should be providing the new one pretty soon, until then this is the only one I have (as a library)...

I have very little knowledge of that, so I don't know, but I would think most probably not, since (if I understood that right) it has its own authentication methods.. but you can just try if you have one :)
<br/>
The wifi library from Sgstair is still in prerelease phase, so that may change, I know he wants to fix the wep support.

Yes, if fact I get the same situation if I don't set correctly ip addess, gateway (the router or pc if you use a wireless card).

For the moving boxes, the library, and the test application it isbased on, credit should go to Sgstair!

<br/>
By the way, Stephen, what do you think about me releasing this file transfer code when done? Could I release it with source code, or (since I'm mostly following your example) would you prefer for me to wait?
<br/>
The app will work with ds app and a server side written in java.

<br/>
bafio: <span style="font-weight: bold">I don't really mind if you release it,</span> though you may want to wait for me to finish fixing bugs in the lib... I think there is presently a problem with odd-length packets and the last byte isn't getting copied properly - I will be looking at this in the near future. (this could very easily be your problem)
<br/>
-Stephen
<br/>
<br/>
So to my understanding it is fine with him. I will ask him just to be sure, I undestood that what he meant is that the library itself is not for public release, so I am not releasing the source code or the library.
<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I made something useful (mainly for developers) and wanted to share it with the others, but if this upset you, I will not release the new version I have here (with ip configuration saving and a couple of bugfixes)

I'm discouraging it because the lib is in a state of flux and I don't want the lib itself spread too widely at the moment - however if people can make working, useful applications (like this one) I'm not going to prevent them from releasing.

(that's actually kinda the whole point of the prerelease lib - so people can get started working on useful projects, even if not all of the functionality exists yet.)

Stephen:
<br/>
Thank you for clarifying this, so I know it's fine with you (and the other know too!)
<br/>
I have uploaded a new release with config file saving, you can see here (I made a simple web page too):
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/bafiollo/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/bafiollo/</a>

changes:
<br/>
* Fixed file listing (we are getting there)
<br/>
* New run method in the NDS file (for people using
<br/>
  other than GBAMP, I have no way to test it but you
<br/>
  should notice the option, it's pressing select after
<br/>
  a file download)
<br/>
* Reads and saves the config file! no need to
<br/>
  enter all the time the settings, if you have
<br/>
  a different config. Goes to a simple text file

A) If you see (1) and no others, you've associated to the AP, but due to the AP transmitting at too high of a rate (bad AP) or WEP being enabled (no WEP support) the AP is not receiving or retransmitting your packets.
<br/>
B) If you see (1) and (2), but not (3), the IP being connected to does not exist on the network (or you have a really stupid AP that isn't sending data back to you.)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tutorial for setting up IP addresses...
<br/>
<br/>
Some of you don't quite know how to set up your static IP properly yet, this should serve as a guide to tell you how it works.
<br/>
<br/>
First, find the IP address information for your computer  - on windows systems you can use 'ipconfig', on linux/unix/osx you should be able to use 'ifconfig' and 'route'
<br/>
<br/>
Sample 'ipconfig' output:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">C:\Documents and Settings\Stephen&gt;ipconfig
<br/>
<br/>
Windows IP Configuration
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection 2:
<br/>
<br/>
        Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
<br/>
        IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.99
<br/>
        Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
<br/>
        Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
In this case, the 3 values given are the important ones (IP Address = 192.168.1.99, Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0, and default gateway = 192.168.1.1)
<br/>
<br/>
sample 'ifconfig' and 'route' output:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">[root@redhat root]# ifconfig
<br/>

<br/>
          inet addr:192.168.1.98  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
<br/>
          inet6 addr: fe80::204:5aff:fe55:5735/64 Scope:Link

<br/>
          RX bytes:616019173 (587.4 Mb)  TX bytes:1230436799 (1173.4 Mb)
<br/>
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0x5000
<br/>
(...)
<br/>
[root@redhat root]# route
<br/>
Kernel IP routing table
<br/>
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
<br/>
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
<br/>
169.254.0.0     *               255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 eth0
<br/>
default         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Again, the values you're interested in are the "inet addr" = 192.168.1.98, "Mask" = 255.255.255.0, and in 'route' use the default gateway (192.168.1.1)
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, when you configure your IP settings on the DS, your "SNMask" and "Gateway" fields should be exactly the same as the subnet mask and gateway for your local computer. The IP address should be an unused address in your local IP space (generally this means you can just change the last number to one that's not in use - like 192.168.1.184)
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the DNS values are unimportant, but using the gateway's IP address should work when they become important.

Try version 0.3, in version 0.2 I forgot to really set the output packets destination IP, so it was sending to 192.168.0.1 indipendently of the destination IP!!!!
<br/>
This could have been the case also for other people. Now the server automatic discovery should set the correct IP...

Compatibility with version 0.3
<br/>
***********************
<br/>
<br/>
On the server side, both a wireless card in AP mode and a compatible router should be ok. The server program itself needs Java version &gt;1.4.
<br/>
<br/>
On the NDS, it's been tested by me on the GBAMP, works with full features.
<br/>
It has been reported to work with flash cards, M3 (using .nds version), Supercard CF (probably), F2a Pro.
<br/>
Executing the NDS file probably works only on the GBAMP.
<br/>
Writing and readingto the CF is based on Chrism's driver ( <a href="http://www.geocities.com/chishm1/gbamp/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/chishm1/gbamp/</a> ). 
<br/>
That would mean:
<br/>
GBAMP, M3, Supercard CF, standard GBA Flash Carts with SRAM.
<br/>
<br/>
This is based on docs and your replies, I just have a wireless card and a GBAMP.

<br/>
<br/>
I think there are still some issues on the conection with the wifi router, mainly WEP should be off, and there is a bug with some ARP requests that seem to hang the application, this happens also to me, but very rarely.
<br/>
<br/>
Sgstair's library is being fixed, so I think these problems should be solved with the next release of the library.
<br/>
Just to make it clear, this is till a "pre beta" quality release, if it doesn't work for you I think a new version will come up sometime soon :)
<br/>
Also, I have only this hardware for testing (wifi card and GBAMP).
<br/>
Anyway, I'm hapy to see it works at least for some people, I'll update the program as soon as a new version is available.

Nice to see it's working, I am updating to the new version of Stephen's library and that should solve some issues. To start (play) the program, you need to exit the application (can try pressing select or rebooting) and start it from the multiboot menu you are using. Directly starting from the app works only on GBAMP. If anybody has the code to start an NDS file from theother cards, you can send me and I see if I can add different execution modes.

<br/>
New release, 0.4 . Second release today!
<br/>
<br/>
You can get it from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/bafiollo/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/bafiollo/</a> as usual
<br/>
There are some known issues still, not all of them are solved at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, Bafio
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From the changelog:
<br/>
<br/>
Version 0.4a
<br/>
<br/>
This update is using the new 0.2a version of Sgstair library, so
<br/>
it should be more compatible with different AP.
<br/>
Citing the release notes of the lib:
<br/>
<br/>
" * Fixed Crash bug in ARP timeout code
<br/>
" * Changed Associacion code to associate faster and more reliably, and codebase
<br/>
   now includes rate spoofing to connect to a wider range of APs "
<br/>
<br/>
* On the server, I fixed a stupid bug that would show only 1/2 of the files.
<br/>
* Again on the server, uses system look and feel.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I cite from the library notes:
<br/>
<br/>
" ** It is important to note that this lib version is a PRERELEASE version. **
<br/>
" ** Not all features exist or work correctly necessarily. **
<br/>
" ** I will not be providing much in the way of support for this release. **
<br/>
And please remember the "use it at your own risk"...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
- Put the wifc.nds into my M3 CF card
<br/>
- Created a folder called Wifi Transfer
<br/>
- Copy a NDS file into the folder and renamed it as test.nds 
<br/>
- Run server.jar
<br/>
- Choose Wifi Transfer as a directory
<br/>
- Run wifc.nds on my M3

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Updated, and it no longer crashs! :)
<br/>
<br/>
But I still get the same errors :(
<br/>
<br/>
That is, the <span style="font-weight: bold">T: T: R:</span>   error.
<br/>
<br/>
My firewall is off, and I told the router to send everything on 8888 to my IP anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Is their anything else it could be on the sever side?
<br/>
Is 8888 the only port it uses?  Could trillian and emule be interfering?
<br/>
Is there a method I could do to test if my sever is working?  (eg, goto another computer on the network and ping the port or something?)
<br/>
<br/>
Pretty sure my DS has what it needs.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.

Er, just looking at that second block of data (the T: T: R: block)
<br/>
it appears that you've set the "destination" IP to the same thing as your computer's IP (or set your DS's IP to the same thing as your computer's IP)
<br/>
Either way, if the DS is making an arp request it shouldn't be replying to itself (and it is) - so something is wrong in your IP settings.

Ok, I may have mistyped something a few posts ago..
<br/>
your dest IP should NOT be your DS IP,
<br/>
your PC ip, gateway IP, and ds IP should all be different
<br/>
<br/>
Er, other than that, the T: and R: lines are just debugging information... they're not errors.
<br/>
And, the information you're giving isn't entirely useful as the last field on the T  and R lines is somewhat important to knowing what the problem is.
<br/>
If you never get a T or R line with the last field being 0800, then there are problems, but it's not entirely clear what those problems are yet.

Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
It's a bit confusing, but in theory you can see:
<br/>
<br/>
1) on the server program (the java one), do you get something like this after starting the transfer
<br/>
<br/>
From:    /192.168.0.187
<br/>
Command; where
<br/>
receviced IMHERE message 192.168.0.187:8888
<br/>
From:    /192.168.0.187
<br/>
<br/>
This should be the autodiscovery of the server address. It's a broadcast to the subnetwork I use to avoid having to put the destination IP address. 
<br/>
If you don't get to this point the error is most probably before, on the network config.
<br/>
<br/>
2) NET CONFIG: (edit-check settings)
<br/>
should select static ip, 
<br/>
select a random ip (last field: 192.168.1.XXX),
<br/>
gareway,mask and dns should be set as in your computer wireless card (you can see these also doubleclicking on the network card icon in the system tray in windows and selecting support
<br/>
<br/>
Also, have you tried the original applcation, <a href="http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/wifi_lib_test.nds" target="_blank">http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/wifi_lib_test.nds</a> ?

<br/>
that makes it more clear, I am having problem sending back packets to the server, so I have to relay on all the packets to arrive , on time, in the right order. When this will be fixed, I'll be able to add flow control and error correction (and faster transfers too). For now flow control il kind of a manual setting inthe server, I will allow to chenge the delay so you can increase it a bit and see if this fixes the problem.In the meantime you could try smaller files and keeping the DS near the PC. I get sometimes myself that error.

Yes, I was thinking about adding the MAC address and the destiantion (server) ip in the config file, but I was hoping auto discovery would work.
<br/>
I will add this to the next release.

I guess something is blocking broadcast packets from the NDS in your configuration.
<br/>
Do you start the server AND chose the directory before connection?

Actually it does. You should have an option to do an UDP test, running a program on the computer, to rend and receive packets. My transfer app is based on that, so it should work in the cases when this app work.

I really think that the problem is related to the network configutation/setup you have. If you don't get Sgstair test app to run, for sure this app won't work eigher. Anyway the library is evolving all the time, so I'm quite sure the compatibility is increasing too.

Version 0.6
<br/>
<br/>
This update is using the new new 0.2a version of Sgstair library fixing
<br/>
some issues with ARP requests.
<br/>
new features:
<br/>
* modified the transmission protocol, it's a little more resitant to errors
<br/>
  (retransmissions)
<br/>
* transmissin seems to break less often
<br/>
* the destionation IP is saved in the config file, with the AP MAC address
<br/>
* You can set the transmission delay on the server. Lower mean faster transfers,more errors.
<br/>
  Use a higher delay if you get transfer errors.
<br/>
* many small changes here and there, like better moving in the list of files, ...
<br/>
* (discovered tifferent problems with atutomatic server detection, don't relay
<br/>
  on that)
<br/>

Its certainly related to the network set up and such, but I just wonder at what end.
<br/>
Our network is a confusing one, using a modem, router and hub.
<br/>
It wouldnt supprise me if theres something odd happening at some stage on its way to my pc.
<br/>
Also, my pc is currently running a firewall, emule and trillian. (which is currently on ICQ, AIM and MSN).
<br/>
<br/>
I dissable my firewall before tests, but any one of the others might be using that port. (even though emule says its using 4662)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That's probably because packets are sized 1024 bytes, so 1 MB ~ 1024 packets.1035 is then a more than normal value.
<br/>
The delay doe not have to do with the number of packets sent, but with the speed. The shorter the delay, the faster the speed, the more probable is packet loss.
<br/>
I still have to manage to get an ack reply to work, seems that when I receive a packet, the reply does not get sent for some reason. I would have all the code ready, making the transfer quite reliable, but until I can solve this... That's why I ahve to use a delay (I can send as many packets as fast as I want, but without ACK there is no flow control)

<br/>
You can try to set a longet delay, let's say 60 or 80. If packets get lost (poor connection or any other reason) I still can't get them back. See above.
<br/>
In my specific situatio, I manage to transfer 3-4 MB files without packet loss, but I guess I'm lucky :)

Hi, thing is: for accessing the memory,I use Chrism's GBAMP fat driver, I think it actually supports many devices including M3, supercard and releated. I don't think it supports SD based devices because the hardware is different and they are lacking specifications. Anyway,GBAMP si relatively cheap and good for homebrew. Other work as well.
<br/>
I could avoid using the CF routines if they are not available (I forgot for the config file) but then I would'n have a place to transfer the files to :) And I have no idea how to load an NDS directly to memory and run it, seems hard to be honest.

OK, first a disclaimer:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 7px; line-height: normal">This package contains a modified version of the wifi transfer program, that should allow to run on a supercard sd.

<br/>
**********************************************
<br/>
<br/>
This program can be truested only if you trust the sources above and that replacing the code is enough.
<br/>
So, just to make it more clear: I make no guarantees, I have not tested it, so if it breaks your ds, sd etc. don't blame me.</span>

<br/>
So I made a version replacing and recompiling, and it gave no errors.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link. USE IT ONLY FOR TESTING, and ONLY ON SUPERCARD SD, the normal version has the code directly from Chrism, so it's more updated.

It looks like you just have to replace on source file.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I would very much appreciate a supercard sd version. It would ease development a lot! (Not having to remove the ..fragile sc from the ds every time)

OK, first a disclaimer:
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-size: 7px; line-height: normal">This package contains a modified version of the wifi transfer program, that should allow to run on a supercard sd.
<br/>
the source was found here:

<a href="http://nds.cmamod.com/files/buildtest_newSD.zip" target="_blank">http://nds.cmamod.com/files/buildtest_newSD.zip</a>

I have not tested or even looked at the source code, so
<br/>
<br/>
**********************************************
<br/>
NOT TESTED!!!
<br/>
USE IT EVEN MORE AT YOU OWN RISK !
<br/>
**********************************************
<br/>
<br/>
This program can be truested only if you trust the sources above and that replacing the code is enough.
<br/>
So, just to make it more clear: I make no guarantees, I have not tested it, so if it breaks your ds, sd etc. don't blame me.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
So I made a version replacing and recompiling, and it gave no errors.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link. USE IT ONLY FOR TESTING, and ONLY ON SUPERCARD SD, the normal version has the code directly from Chrism, so it's more updated.

Bafio you rock!  Thanks for including the SC SD people.  That said, my NDS freezes once the program is loaded.  I get to the part where the bottum screen says "Config and connect to an AP" and "Play Wardriving".  I can't select anything.  It's just frozen.
<br/>
Does it have anything to do with not having a config file?  Do I need to make one or something?

<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your continuing effort on developing this :)
<br/>
<br/>
I was able to transfer smaller files (&lt; 100kb) to the ds :) The client seems to crash after this, but the file gets written - and it works. I also compared it to the original file and found they were identical :)
<br/>
For larger files, however, it seems to crash after a counter of about 120, but I will try again later. 
<br/>
Also I noticed transfer is starting fast, but getting slower and slower.

Version 0.8 is out,
<br/>
<br/>
main chenges:
<br/>
<br/>
In this version,I changed the protocol again :D and it works a bit more like the old one
<br/>
so you can slow the transfer down by using the delay bar if you run into transfer errors.
<br/>
<br/>
* FAST! File transfer is now almost as fast as it gets, 84KBs here on my machine!.
<br/>
* Direct connection,so you don't have to pass all the connection setting screens
<br/>
* Some other minor changes
<br/>
<br/>
I think this should work reliably to everybody, but I can't be sure, so I appreciate some feedback to undestand if the new protocol is really reliable.

<br/>
<br/>
I just tried out your program and I love it! There's no quicker way to transfer nds files for debugging than this. Also the CF support rocks! I guess this will become my standard way of testing my code. Here are some suggestions and feature requests:
<br/>
<br/>
I seem to get data corruption when I set the delay to 0 in the server. Perhaps you should use a higher value as the default if more people are having problems.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a good idea to have a fixed directory that the nds files are served from that is specified in the server, because otherwise anyone could spy my hard drive. But, on the other hand, navigating the PC's filesystem from the DS to download other nds files or mp3s to my CF card would be neat, This should be optional and discouraged of course, as such an option would be a security risk.
<br/>
<br/>
When coding on a DS project, I always want to download and run the same program to test it. So, for the impatient like me, there should be an ultra quick one-click download button in the first menu. When I click it, the DS should associate with the AP, connect to the server, download the last file it downloaded (the filename could be saved in the config file) and run it.
<br/>
<br/>
But these are just my 2 cents. What you have done so far is really great and makes tesing and debugging much much faster and above all, it eliminates the need to restart the DS for every test, which was the biggest annoyance for me.
<br/>
<br/>
So, keep doing such a great job!

I don't know if that's the problem, but the 1st time you connect you should wait for some seconds for the ds to register with the AP before going to the transfer. Also, have you tried the "list" button in the transfer screen? Does Sgstair's demo work for you?

Yes, I'm going to change my build scripts so that it gets compiled automatically and maybe I can include it in the main distribution.
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I have too many ideas of what to do next, I was thinking of a graphical UI for the program, some cleanup, at some point a complete rewrite...?
<br/>
Plus there are other wifi functions I would like to implement.
<br/>
Anyway, the code I wrote is now a bit messed up, probably I should reorgainze and rewrite (at least partially) both the client and server, to ease further development and make a good base for future extensions/other projects.
<br/>
Only problem is finding the time to do that :|
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the plan is to do the celanup before passing to new features, so I can get things done in a more proper way.

That is something I was looking into doing, but is a big security risk. I'll think about that, maye I could let the user chose where to bind the server in that case, so you could bind it to the local wirelwss network and at least keep it out of the internet.

I think I'l make a "no keys" release: one that connects, downloads the file "test.nds" and executes it with no user intervention.

This should be really simple to do.
<br/>
I also have been looking into powersaving features, I now manage to put the DS in standby, turn off the upper lcd, but I am not sure what happens to the wifi hardware then the DS is in standby (does it go off and back on automatically or does it continue to use energy?)

Plus bugfixes...
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://bafio.drunkencoders.com/" target="_blank">http://bafio.drunkencoders.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Version 0.9 RC
<br/>
<br/>
Big news:
<br/>
<br/>
* The *source code* is distributed
<br/>
  - The paths are all relative to the directory and Sgstair's lib
<br/>
    is included so it should be easy to compile. All you need is
<br/>
    the latest DevKitPro
<br/>
    NOTE: No spaces in the path to the source...
<br/>
* New app, wific2, (execute for GBAMP only) downloads and executes the file named test.nds
<br/>
  from the server, without all the setting screen (using the ones saved
<br/>
  from wific), for fast testing during development
<br/>
* Some important bugfixes:
<br/>
  - The discovery code was wrong, this time server discovery sould work
<br/>
    better.
<br/>
  - The settings sometimes were not put in the wifi, so you could not
<br/>
    (at times) interact with the server. So the 'I can't get the list of
<br/>
    file' bug (at least in some occasions)
<br/>
* Poversaving
<br/>
  - close the DS goes in standby
<br/>
  - you can turn off the upper screen by pressing select at the main menu
<br/>
* The java server now has commandline:
<br/>
  java -jar server.jar [directory] [-port portNumber] [-delay sendDelay]
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The feature list looks so promising that I wanted to take a look also. The problem is I'm currently developing on M3/SD card... I got the M3 only couple days ago so I don't know what is needed to get things working with it, but I'm more than happy to do some testing or help to get this thing working.
<br/>
<br/>
Wific.nds sayd plain "No GBAMP-compatible card!", but it looks like I can save the WiFi config as Wifc2.nds connects automatically to the AP I've configured before.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi!
<br/>
<br/>
Jet another new version, almost one a day :)
<br/>
This time the changes are significant, and should fix many problems. Try it out!
<br/>
I forgot about the SCSD this time, I'll add a download fot that later...
<br/>
<br/>
Version 0.95 RC
<br/>
<br/>
More big news!
<br/>
This time it should work MUCH better for real.
<br/>
<br/>
* The server has been rewritten completely, there
<br/>
  were some serious flows and a stupid bug that made
<br/>
  the recovery from errors useless.
<br/>
  Plus the server now can handle multiple clients...
<br/>
* Basic DNS. You can type a normal address as destination IP, so
<br/>
  you can (not tested) connect to a remote server.
<br/>
  Type the address and press list.
<br/>
* Many many bugfixes, and added recovery code for bad situations
<br/>
  like timeouts, to avoid that the application freeze.Still can happen at times,
<br/>
  but should be rare.
<br/>
* Some more bugfixes I can't remember...

First, follow the instructions here exactly as you see them: <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=64608#64608" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=64608#64608</a>
<br/>
Once you have verified mariokart is working you need to open your ASUS tray icon, click the config icon, go to the encryption tab, turn "Data encryption" to disabled and set "Network authentication" to open.
<br/>
<br/>
Though, now might be a good time to add your DS's MAC address in the "Access Control" tab.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I hate to be a pain but I think I could use some help. I tried to connect my DS to my PC with this handy tool. Eventualy I seemed to have caused a problem with my lan-card and thus disabling my internet... Eventualy I had reset my wifi 'card' and here I am right back at where I started some hours ago (well atleast my internet is working once again). So some help would be nice.
<br/>
First what i was trying to post earlyer but then wrecked my internetconnection (edited version though!):
<br/>
The first thing I figured was that I should set my wifi stuff manualy because the stupid 'wizard' tool is just a pain...
<br/>
So this is what I used:
<br/>
IP: 169.254.149.55
<br/>
Subnetmask: 255.255.0.0
<br/>
Gateway: 169.254.1.1
<br/>
DNS 169.254.1.1
<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if this is oke. If its not could anyone give me a link to a website that can explain everything above. (I do not mind reading :P)
<br/>
<br/>
First I start the java app. It picks the right folder and everything seems oke and with these values my DS connect to my pc. Eventualy I figured my pc was not transmitting anything back (on the other side it did get the netwerk name...).
<br/>
Now this is what  I WIFI file transfer tells me:
<br/>
- I see my netwerk called DSme
<br/>
- I select connect and enter the data above (by the way, the keyboards positioning is quite crap, try hitting the 1 :S :P)
<br/>
- It gives the nice blocks animation and displays 'Connected!'
<br/>
- I enter file transfer and see no files.
<br/>
<br/>
Now on my PC side I see the DS connecting to my pc:
<br/>
- Station 00-09-BF-75-A5-A2 is authenticated
<br/>
- Station 00-09-BF-75-A5-A2 is assosiated
<br/>
And everytime I hit the list button in the DS app a yellow warning sign pops up in my task bar. So I figured it atleast received my data! (by the way, it was just a sign. No text what so ever, not on mouse over, not on any click, just a yellow warning sign...)
<br/>
<br/>
So well, can anyone help me? Like I mentioned before I dont mind reading and I realy want this to work :). PM's are oke too, just need a gentle push in the right direction :P. I could post anymore info as well, though this might be sufficient :).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmm yeah thats what I thought, but wasnt sure... I asked for some more info at workexperience too and they pushed me in that direction as well.
<br/>
I am a programmer myself, though pretty much a n00b when it comes to Assembler, C++ etc. Just php/javascript and mysql here. But after work experience I am defenitly going to look at ASM, C++. and Java (those are on top of my list).
<br/>
Anyway, I will try again later. Thank you telling me what that yellow sign meanth (kind of stupid there is no text near the damn thing :P).
<br/>
<br/>
[EDIT]
<br/>
Yay, I got it to work. I thought you had to do the same IP on the DS as the one I gave my wifi point. But now it works like a charm! Man I love homebrew... Thanks Sektor!

Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
that's strange, are you sure about having the right server IP (destination) entered in the transfer window and then pressing list? you may have to do it a few times... I tried the porgram with different configuration (router and wireless card in AP mode ) and had no problem.
<br/>
Also, make sure (I think you probably know already) to have a full manual IP configuration, no DHCP and no WEP.
<br/>
The IMhere message would be to automatically identify the server, is a message sent to the broadcast address but that seems often not to work, depending on the network config. Is the other program (the chat one) working?

My PC doesn't have a wireless card, but I do have a wireless router (which is how DS2key works). Does this program require a wireless router *and* a wireless PC, or just one or the other?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just one or the other. This is how I get it to work with my Linksys Router:
<br/>
<br/>
On the PC side, IP 192.168.101:
<br/>
-Start the server (I start it in a cmd window, just like any other program, I just type "server.jar"..this is in Windows XP though)
<br/>
-Select my directory I want to send
<br/>
<br/>
On the DS Side, I do this:
<br/>
-Start the NDS file 
<br/>
-click "Config and connect an AP"
<br/>
-click "Search for an AP"
<br/>
-select my Router's SSID
<br/>
-IP Address: 192.168.1.110 (this is the IP address for the DS. I chose to go lower than the default 189 or something, because my router is set up to ignore anything past say, 150)
<br/>
-Gateway: 192.168.1.1
<br/>
-Subnetmask: 255.255.255.0
<br/>
DNS1: 192.168.1.1 &lt;- these aren't really needed I think
<br/>
DNS2: 192.168.1.2 &lt;- these aren't really needed I think
<br/>
-Click "Connect" It should connect.
<br/>
-Click "File Transfer"
<br/>
-Click "Edit" for Srv IP. Make sure the IP address is the same address of the computer running the server. In my case, it's 192.168.1.101.
<br/>
<br/>
The directory should update instantly. :) (give it a few seconds)
<br/>
<br/>
You should now be able to transfer files from your PC to your DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I think that means some packets got lost when the java program transfer the file list to your DS.  UDP protocol isn't very reliable.  On my set up, I can usually get it working by:
<br/>
- start runme.bat first
<br/>
- have the proper directory selected
<br/>
- set the delay to 50 ms (try to figure out the best settings for your network)
<br/>
- power up the DS and start the transfer program
<br/>
- use d-pad and A button to go through the Config menu, sometimes the Direct Connect to AP doesn't work for me
<br/>
- use the stylus to click on Get File List once (try not do multiple clicks)
<br/>
- after transfer of each program, press B button to go back to make sure the file is properly closed
<br/>

The IP conflict on your PC probably means something else on the network has same IP address as your PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
I have made some updates to the transfer programs:
<br/>
<br/>
* a new connection method, which uses both the wifi settings from the
<br/>
  firmware and from the file. This version has been fixed so also the
<br/>
  disk configuration works fine. It should solve problems on connection
<br/>
  seen in previous version.
<br/>
* the latest FAT library from Moonshell is used, this should make it
<br/>
  compatible with more hardware.
<br/>
* The updated source code of the server and of wific2 is included.
<br/>
  This includes a set of generic utilities that could be useful to
<br/>
  other projects as well.
<br/>
<br/>
as before, you can get it from:

If your foolish enough to transfere a large file, when your CF card dosnt have enough room for it, it seems to currupt the whole card ;)

One thing left, can you save the server's ip address in the settings file? it always defaults to 0.0.0.0 .

great work!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">bump..think I found another little bug.
<br/>
<br/>
I transferred a copy of DSOrganiser over recently, and now according to moon shell I have two identical files on the route of the card (same name, same extension).
<br/>
<br/>
Both seem to run Disorganiser, but when I try the file explorer in that it restarts. (I guess its looking at the route of the card where the error is).
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I lost my CF&gt;&gt;USB stick so I cant check whats happening on the pc for another few weeks.
<br/>
(I have been surviving purely of wireless downloading nd using organiser to delete! :D)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
