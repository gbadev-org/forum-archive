    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
I've been searching all over the web for this, but I cannot find it. Let me explain.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Nintendo WiFi USB adapter and had previously been using it to get my DS online (as my router wasn't supported by the DS). However, time has passed and I now have Windows XP x64 installed. The official Nintendo software doesn't work under XP x64, so I need a workaround.
<br/>
<br/>
I read on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Wi-Fi_USB_Connector" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Wi-Fi_USB_Connector</a> that you can get Ralink drivers for the chipset that the adapter uses and simply modify them. If I'm not mistaken, those Ralink drivers will also work under x64, thus solving my problem (I just want to use the adapter to connect my DS and Wii to the internet... my router, which is not the same as the old one previously mentioned, can never seem to get a good connection with my Wii).
<br/>
<br/>
So, um, in short, does anyone know what I have to modify in these drivers (I presume it's just the ones from Ralink's website ? Does someone have a pre-modified version for download?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">After searching even more through this forum, I found modified drivers for the USB connector (original Buffalo type, WLI-U2-KG54-A) that Waffle had posted, here: <a href="http://users.on.net/~kabeyas/nin_wifi.rar" target="_blank">http://users.on.net/~kabeyas/nin_wifi.rar</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It does support XP, but it doesn't look like it supports 64-bit, at least my system complains that the drivers aren't compatible. What a bummer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
