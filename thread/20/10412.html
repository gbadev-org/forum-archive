    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'll clear up a few things here:
<br/>
<br/>
You do need to obtain a valid macintosh plus rom file inorder to use this emulator, there are utilities available to use which can dump from a working mac plus.
<br/>
<br/>
[ Remove if unacceptable for this forum, I am assuming only legal use ]
<br/>
If you only own the rom chip itself or your mac plus is broken, the rom is available for download in some places.
<br/>
[/]
<br/>
<br/>
The emulated screen is just under 2x bigger than the DS's screen at 512x342. This limitation is handled by centering the background over the cursor.
<br/>
<br/>
As for speed, I have it running at between 16 and 22fps load/desktop which for some games and apps is very usable.
<br/>
Sim Ant for example, works very well and is very playable at 16-18fps.
<br/>
<br/>
There is also TONS of room for improvement in the 68k core, especially with memory operations.
<br/>
( And I cannot use cyclone due to license incompatibilities )

Somebody did a long time ago (mid 90's), coupled it with a 68k emulator/binary translator and called it "<a class="postlink" href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:wIdHjXLlIQcJ:www.ardi.com/MacHack_96.html&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3" target="_blank">Executor</a>." It used to be a commercial product, but the company that made it recently went out of business. 
<br/>
<br/>
Supposedly, there was a chance that they would release the source, but their page is down now. That would have made an interesting port.

If you're in contact with the author of Mini vMac, you could maybe see if he'd be up for allowing you to add this to the license in your distribution:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">As a special exception, &lt;name of copyright holder&gt; gives permission to link this program with the Cyclone 68k core, and distribute the resulting executable, without relicensing the source code for the Cyclone 68k core in the source distribution.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">It's similar to the FSF-approved exception for linking against the non-commercial Qt libraries. I would think this would be acceptable to him even if he wants to preserve the "Free-ness" of Mini vMac, as a completely Free version could still be built by not using the #define for Cyclone and using the original core instead.

I'm still trying to figure out why it's having problems reading from certain devices/setups - if anyone wants the source to help me out it is available on request.

<br/>
The only things I can suggest to everyone else is:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Verify that minivmac.nds, vMac.ROM and mac_hd.img are in your root directory.
<br/>
2) Make sure your disc is not corrupted
<br/>
3) Defragment your disc
<br/>
<br/>
Also make sure you have a valid Macintosh ROM, if you dumped it try dumping it again or obtain from a different source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's seems it doesn't work on the supercard sd because you are using an old version of chishm fat library.
<br/>
<br/>
In older versions of the library supercard sd access only worked reading but not writing and maybe this is fine when it reads the bios but not when it reads the system image because maybe needs to save or something else.
<br/>
<br/>
You could try to use latest version of the fat library or a different version like moonshell or SATA that work properly on supercard sd and many others cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you for your great job.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by amiga on Tue Jul 25, 2006 6:45 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Who needs a colourful OS like Windows when you can just run an ancient MacOS on a DS?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm noticing it has an interesting opinion on the time:
<br/>
Recently started, it says 11:02:56 PM. Its date is 11/4/5.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, do open windows remain open if I turn it off improperly? (Just pressing the power button instead of going to Shutdown).
<br/>
Seems to be happening, and I'm trying to decide if it's a purposeful feature :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

It's not that hard to do, there are many guides out there on how to do it and once you learn it things will be much easier from then on.

As for windows remaining open, no idea - I always shut down.

And I know the date/time is wrong, I'm still trying to work out why the emulator does not like the time given to it from the DS RTC.

A side note:

I have all the code in place for supporting read only disks in ROM and a writable disk in SRAM.

The machine only supports B&amp;W, so you would end up with a GB running on GBC look.

You can get 7.5 running in 2Mbyte of RAM, but it's not recommended.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

I did just add a feature that already exists in the other ports, from now on labeling your disk images "disk0.dsk", "disk1.dsk", ect...
<br/>
<br/>
Will cause them to be mounted in that order automatically at startup.

<br/>
Just one problem:
<br/>
Where the heck do I get Alladin Expander 5?!!!
<br/>
<br/>
I see Stuffit Expander, and Alladin Expander 2.1.
<br/>
Every downlaod link I have encountered for Alladin Expander 5 seems to be broken, and its home page seems to have changed into a horrible Stuffit-touting page with misused Flash buttons. (Has it become a new fad to do static image links with Flash instead of HTML? It seems like a ridiculous waste of time...)
<br/>
<br/>
So... Is Alladin Expander actually Stuffit?
<br/>
Is there another program available that is easier to find and does the same thing?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.download.com/3000-2250-905258.html" target="_blank">http://www.download.com/3000-2250-905258.html</a>

<br/>
<br/>
How can I?
<br/>
<br/>
Seems like Stuffit and Alladin Expander have pretty different layouts.
<br/>
<br/>
With Stuffit 9 Standard Demo, it won't open the SSW_6.0.8-1.4MB_Disk1of2.sea.bin and SSW_6.0.8-1.4MB_Disk2of2.sea.bin files. (At least, not via the Open dialogue).
<br/>
It seems to be calculating something very very quickly, but nothing is displayed.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Ninden:

Try taking the system 6.0.8 boot disk image, copying it to your CF card then try booting mini vmac.

If that doesn't work let me know, it should since I tested it on the Supercard CF.
