    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Whenever I turn on my DS (with a passme and GBAMP inserted) it's very random wether it'll work or not. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it freezes (even before the text has fully faded onto the screen). Anyone who can tell me what's causing this?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems to happen when the PassMe isn't making a good connection to the pins in the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
The best way to remedy this is to install FlashMe. It's much better than inserting the PassMe each time, and it works every time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, thought it was something like that. Also, sometimes it doesn't even read the Passme at all and boots the GBAMP. I'll flash it sometime today probably.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I opted to install FlashMe instead of either damaging my PassMe, or my DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">yeah, flashme is pretty easy &amp; a piece of cake.
<br/>
I pretty much keep my passme in storage and offer to flash anyone's DS I can.
<br/>
Homebrew is pretty appealing on the DS.  I have to get off my ass and port that emulator over to fltk so I can run it under linux and get cracking.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Has anyone checked to see if that option, when engaged using a flash cart, will make the Rumble Pak vibrate?<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word. No space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I actually had that freezing problem before I ever modified anything. It'd freeze at the Nintendo logo. The solution was always just to take the cartridges out and blow in them and the slots.
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, this hasn't happened since I installed FlashMe... maybe the original firmware was stopping because the bad connection mucked up the authentication, while FlashMe doesn't care? Or maybe it's just a coincicence. :-p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They also suggest not using unlicensed devices. ;-) Really, as long as you don't get any spit on it, it's not going to hurt. It's not always possible to go grab a cotton swab or cleaning kit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
