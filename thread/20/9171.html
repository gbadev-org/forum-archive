Looks a bit weird...
<br/>
So, is it for learning languages, or using them? (A travel dictionary type thing?)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I remember the GBA had a title for Japanese people learning to speak English... apparently worked quite well.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
...
<br/>
Nintendogs is unconventional :P
<br/>
Not the concept of virtual dogs, but all the little details. For example, the NDS is the first system where developers make constant use of the microphone as an input device. Since it is already there anyway, they can just pull off all sorts of things that normally wouldn't justify adding a mic for (such as inflating balloons and blowing bubbles).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

A really awesome experience I say *vote*<br/>_________________<br/>Marine, we need you to head to the depths of the compound to rescue a scientist that is being held hostage by Satan and his manyfold minions.
