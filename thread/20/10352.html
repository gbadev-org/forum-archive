    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, here's to hoping you release it before friday night. I leave on Saturday very early in the morning for a week-long trip. And I'd like to try this game. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is similar to the original Smash, right? Its not turn-based, like some other clone I played some time ago? Smash Bros Tactics, it was called. It was good, but it wasnt Smash :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried running  SmashGp on the PSP and the GP2X. The version 2.6 firmware PSP wasn't able to run SmashGP, and the GP2X version was the initial release. SmashGP2X had only Mario and Luigi, and it was pretty impressive, even for an initial release. I wonder what the GP32 version and the PSP version is like. But I digress.

<br/>
I'm looking forward to this. This is your own game, correct? Keep up the good work. We're cheering you on.<br/>_________________<br/>FW4 White DS with FlashMe v7
