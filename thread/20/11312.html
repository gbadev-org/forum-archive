And... while all the "zomg it works" post might be fake, i haven't seen any "zomg it bricked my DS" posts. Only assumptions that it will brick a DS.

Really don't know what to think of that one. And i'm neither courageous enough to try, nor do i have the money to afford a new DS. :P<br/>_________________<br/>maggiekarp: Aghhh okay guys why would my right ide hurt in my ribs

I'm not going to try this, but I will accept its existence if the author posts a video with sound and a demonstration of a decent frame rate.

As is... Nah.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Indeed, but it probably would have pushed the release date back.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Simply solder a wire from the antenna port to the nearby anchor solder for the DS cartidge slot.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And if turning all the grounded areas of the DS into an antenna was a "safe" option, dont you think Nintendo would have just done it?  Do you REALLY want to be directing microwave frequencies directly at the negative poll of EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF THE DS!  I think not!
<br/>
<br/>
Also as was said before, Nintendo would not have withheld a feature in the DS hardware that could be enabled with a couple of rewires.  Its in their best intrest to remain as backwards compatible as possible so had it been a plausable option, they would have done it.  I also seem to remember it being proved both those wires are soldered to the WiFi hardware, one is DEFINATELY the antenna port and the other I believe is the WiFi controller chip.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

<br/>
The hack he did was more likely case-modding a flashcart with goomba on it to use the pokemon cart's case, and slicing either the case or the slot down so it fits in the gba slot (which is keyed such that gb/gbc games don't normally fit).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
