Go down to the bottom of the page. On the horizon cometh a Trainer Toolkit for the Nintendo DS:
<br/>
<br/>
STOP PRESS
<br/>
Hot on the heels of Action Replay DS will be Trainer Toolkit for NDS, a pro-level game hacking system intended for technically minded gamers/hackers that lets you hack your own codes for use with Action Replay DS. Using the PC trainer software and dev-board hardware, dedicated individuals can now earn the respect of the underground community as creators of truly awesome codes!
<br/>
<br/>
Codes can be shared by creating links that make them directly available in Action Replay DS's Code Manager software.
<br/>
<br/>
Trainer Toolkit for NDS is coming soon - keep watching this space for
<br/>
details.
<br/>
<br/>
Arm yourselves. Protest to Nintendo to up the security of WiFi games.
<br/>
<br/>
This is what the famed hacker "Parasyte" from the GSCentral fourms says about this recent development:
<br/>
<br/>
"So long, WFC. I loveded yoooouu!
<br/>
GOODBYE MY LOOOOOOOOVV~~~~"

A mass exodus to Xbox Live might force Nintendo to do this in order to maintain demand for WFC games.

<br/>
The downside is that Nintendo might consider the presence of FlashMe firmware to constitute cheating, just as Microsoft did with Xbox Live.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

no. this more speculation but i guess the ar boots boots the card - and can patch the code in any way it wants before actually running the binarys.

Hot on the heels of Action Replay DS will be Trainer Toolkit for NDS, a n00b-level cheating system intended for people that need help. It lets you hax your own codes for use with Action Replay DS!!1!!! Using the PC trainer software and dev-board hardware, (people that own this haxing machine) can now witness the hatred of the collective gaming community as creators of completely unoriginal codes!

No. The freeze is controlled via software.

FYI, I posted the news about the DS AR and the trainer kit in the Dipstar thread several days ago. I guess nobody noticed though. :-(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
