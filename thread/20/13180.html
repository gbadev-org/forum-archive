    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">what tools are there to remove the loader in .ds.gba or .nds.gba files? 
<br/>
<br/>
I already know of pme2nds but it does not always work. Are there alternatives?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Which files are you trying to convert? If it's larger than about 3 MB, then it probably contains an appended data file that is intended to be read through GBA ROM in SLOT-2.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- You know, the human.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm just going to take a stab in the dark as I'm not 100% sure on this (never had to do it myself), but is it not just a simple matter of removing 512 bytes off the beginning of the .ds.gba file? I seem to recall reading somewhere that this wouldn't work with *every* program, but most anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Someone correct me if I'm wrong of course.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">could I do that within a hex editor?

EDIT: When every I remove the appended loader with pme2nds it doesn't work right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If pme2nds doesn't work, then it's likely that chopping off the first 512 bytes won't work either.  How old is this program?  If it's fairly old, then it might have been made when there were substantial differences between the .ds.gba and .nds builds, and therefore you can't convert it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Once renamed to end in .nds, most .ds.gba files do work on non-Rumble Supercards.  I had a few that required me to boot them with Moonshell though, as the Supercard launcher gave white screens.

If you told us what program you're trying to run, it might be easier to determine whether it's possible to convert it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
