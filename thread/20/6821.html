    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am new to getting stuff to load on the DS and I was wondering if I bought this flash cart <a href="http://www.divineo.com/cgi-bin/div-us/dd-gb-xg2" target="_blank">http://www.divineo.com/cgi-bin/div-us/dd-gb-xg2</a> if I would be able to load nds roms, gba roms and homebrew, not at the same time obviously. I was also going to send my ds to AheadGames.com to get FlashME flashed on. Is this site trustworthy. I live in Saskatchewan, in Canada and don't know anybody with flash tools, so this is my only option.
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to read. :D

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I ordered a NeoFlash 512Mb cart from Divineo and the service was great. It came literally 2 days later, from Canada to US. I was impressed. The NeoFlash does everything you need it to do. It is a little expensive, but everything comes in one nice package and it works as advertised. Don't bother sending your DS to get flash. Get a PassMe/MagicKey/SuperPass and flash it yourself. They can be bought for like $30. If you dont have one of those devices you will only be able to play homebrew roms. If you are really unsure of what to get, I recommend the NeoFlash Kit as it comes with everything you need (though it will set you back $160). The NeoFlash is really a re-branded XG2 cart, so I believe you can use that, but you'll still need to purchase a Magic Key from NeoFlash ($40).

Check out the info on this site: <span style="font-weight: bold">[Warez URL removed by MOD]</span>

They have reviews of all the major development devices so you can make an informed purchase. Also, there are new devices coming out this month (G6,M3,SuperCard) so you may want to wait for the better technology to come out. I hope that helps.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They charge $40 for a Magic Key?  What's to keep you from using a more affordable PassMe, from Lynx's site perhaps?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Magic Key 1 is apparently built more solidly than the exposed circuit board that is Lynx's PassMe. I can't say the same for the rebranded XG2 cart though.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my passme arrived in pieces so its certainly a more reliable choice to get a magic key.  I managed to fix my passme just enough to flash it so it didnt really bother me too much.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
