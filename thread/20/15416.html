    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello GBADev,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm kinda new into the homebrew 'scene' and I think it's all great.
<br/>
Alot of apps are working perfectly (beup, DSorganize etc.) on my R4, however there is one application that doesn't work, Sylphamp.
<br/>
<br/>
Off all applications I want this one to work the most, but it doesn't.
<br/>
It seems to be connecting just fine to my AP but when I enter my local IP of the pc that runs Winamp with the Sylphamp plugin selected it just hangs on 'Loading Sylphamp...'.
<br/>
<br/>
I am REALLY clueless and I couldn't find ANY help on the internet.
<br/>
Could someone give me a hand? :)
<br/>
<br/>
Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>
Mark.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are you sure that it's connecting to the AP? If you've got a new-style DS you might have problems with wifi code in certain applications.

Sylphamp sounds like some kind of STD.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold"><a class="postlink" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=simonjhall%40gmail%2ecom&amp;no_shipping=2&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=GBP&amp;lc=GB&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">Big thanks to everyone who donated for Quake2</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two major points here:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  SylphAmp is fairly old, and like simon suggested, the wifi library it uses may not support your new DS (Lite).  The fact that DSO can connect but not this makes me suspect this may be the case.  A better app to try would be DSHobro, as it too has the whole "DS binary connects to server on PC" thing going on, which could help you determine if it's possibly your firewall or router causing the issue rather than the wifi library.
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Try v0.03, not the latest v0.04.  I tried as hard as I could get get v0.04 working on my network and it kept freezing on me, so I went back to v0.03 and it worked fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for replying.
<br/>
The 'older' wifilibrary is the problem, so that's a bummer.
<br/>
Anyway DShosbro is working great and I think that's a great app.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, no Sylphamp for me. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
