What if someone made an emulator or something to play these home made games on the Nintendo DS!

That would be awesome.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could always use a similar structre as the PC ones because they are pretty easy to pick up, but as far as what should be in it....
<br/>
<br/>
Character attributes
<br/>
Sprite Sets
<br/>
Custom Sprite Creation
<br/>
Keyboard
<br/>
Side View Battle screen
<br/>
Weapon/Item Options
<br/>
Tilesets
<br/>
Custom Tile Sets
<br/>
Event Modifier/Creator

...thats about all that comes to mind at the moment thought. I'm sure someone can think of things I missed</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I remember RPGMaker 2 on the SNES had an expansion pack that included an art editor. And then there's the Shooter Construction Kit "Dezaimon", which had a built in tile editor too. Heck, it even has a music editor! Add -that- to that list and it's about right.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What you speak of was and still is possible on the Sega Dreamcast. A few years ago, while learning about the Dreamcasts emulation capabilities, I came across a document that explained clearly, the process of taking a lightweight RPG2k game and modifying it's contents so that it would work seamlessly on the dreamcast. It worked. I honestly doubt you'll be able to find this document, as this was back in 2001 and the domain that hosted this amazing document no longer exists. I believe it was tellah[dot]net or something, I really can't remember. Maybe some DC guru's[GPFError, I know you remember this document, alot of people on dcemulation's boards knew about this]could poke at my memory. On the up side, however, I printed this document out and I know I have it... I just have to find it. Is this possible on the Nintendo DS? Please, don't make me laugh - I'm drinking koolaid at the moment and I don't desire to decorate my keyboard and mice with this blubbery coloring...
<br/>
If I remember correctly, RPG Maker 2k has these things called Events: process that run concurrently alongside each other, eating up massive amounts of ram, so if some genius figured out a way to emulate the rpg2k games and their runtime requirements, that genius probably wouldn't have enough RAM to work with on DS to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, I think an RPGmaker from the ground up would be nice on the DS, of course. The DS's touch screen and microphone alone would validate any consideration that game development studios might have about such a project. Using the stylus, one would be without the need for a mouse. Using the microphone, one could record custom battle or fanfare sounds or voices and have them saved to a GBA option pack. In short, an RPGMaker would be great on the DS, IMHO.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyone know about this RPGToolKit that Dekared speaks of and whether it's requirements run paralell to the DS's?<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For reference, the guide to playing RPG Maker 2000 games on your Dreamcast can be found <a class="postlink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030809212233/http://www.webbeh.com/rm2kondc.HTM" target="_blank">here</a>.  It works because Dreamcast runs off Windows CE, and due to the DC's RAM doesn't allow more than 11 events running at a time, so imagine the DS...

You'll be able to make your own RPGs, but you won't be able to load current RPGMaker data files into it..
