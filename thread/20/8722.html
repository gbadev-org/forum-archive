If it's wired up to use proper SPI, the same way the MK2 does, then you can probably adapt the MK2 driver included in the FAT lib.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

How would you go about making something like this then?
<br/>
<br/>
Would it also be possible for a homemade version, possibly even one with saver and small flash memory that is properley addressed?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://downtou.ne1.net/" target="_blank">http://downtou.ne1.net/</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They are usally able to store files by docking the mini-sd into an SD sized adapter. They are also commonly used on motorola mobile phones.<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">While I don't have anything that uses MiniSD, I'm glad someone is working on something like this. An expandable DS flashcard that is the same size as a normal DS card. Screw MagicKey 2/3 and bulky PassMe's. This is the way to go. I just wonder what kind of issue slower MiniSD memory will have, if any. At least there are adapters for MiniSD -&gt; SD, so I could still get some use out of the card otherwise. I hope something like this shows up soon. It'd be perfect for the DS Lite.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
