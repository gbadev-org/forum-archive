You answered your own question already("quite similar").
<br/>
The chance that someone comes up with a N64 emu for DS is next to zero.
<br/>
and being the GBA and SNES quite similar....NO
<br/>
GBA has a 32bit ARM cpu which runs at 16,5Mhz.So the GBA CPU is about 5times faster than SNESes(3.5Mhz or so).
<br/>
That's why a SNES emu for GBA is possible<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Although it's said it isn't a great game (never played) I don't think a goldeneye 007 port would be better, of course the game would be, but That's old news. A new console needs new games...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mrsnowflake.be" target="_blank">http://www.mrsnowflake.be</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

that happening is quite possible...Rare still holds the license to Conker, and Rare has openly said that they are going to develop for the DS, and it would b nice to see Nintendo WiFi Connection used like Xbox Live was used in Conker: Live and Reloaded (although the game sold quite poorly apparently)<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And Sony was once a Super NES developer (see <span style="font-style: italic">Equinox</span>). I imagine that Rare's commitment to the Nintendo DS will last precisely as long as it takes to get an "Xboy" based on a cut-down version of Windows Mobile OS out the door.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Rare has been supporting the GBA since the buy from microsoft, with the games being publish by THQ IIRC...<a class="postlink" href="http://rareware.co.uk/vacancies/software/all_software.html" target="_blank">rare currently has positions for Nintendo DS programmers</a> if you have a look at their site
<br/>
microsoft has said it has no intentions of entering a handheld console into the market yet
<br/>
<br/>
can't quite see why Kameo is everyone's favourite elf tho ^o)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: according to IGN, Equinox was made by Software Creations (which was bought by Acclaim in 2002). it doesn't mention who the publisher was, so from your post tepples i assume that sony published Equinox?<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
