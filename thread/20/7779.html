Well, since the thread exists, I may as well say something. Wouldn't web browser be possible to GBAMP users with a port of something like Lynx or Links2? Of course, they're <a class="postlink" href="http://spaceship.ca/images/22.gif" target="_blank">not the most slick way to surf</a>, but they do work quite well, and naturally use little memory.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC: SdnlyDead</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

(I dont get why some people list something as impractical, just because it cant take over 4MB in Ram...browseing without pictures isnt *that* bad you know....you could also have a selective option to view one pic at a time later)

I have a Sony CMD-J5 phone which which is monocrome, text only, tiny screen, low res....and yet it still has a web browser on it! 
<br/>
I dont know how much Ram it has, but I dought its as much as the DS has.
<br/>
<br/>
I can post to forums fine from it, query google, and check my webmail.

Id personaly love a little web browseing app on my DS that could do all these things :)

It would be quite some work, but I dont see any hardware reason why not too.

You really dont need that high requirements to read basic HTML and translate it onto the screen. Unless the webpage is massively big, it should fit into ram fine.
<br/>
(and even if it dosnt, cache the page on the compact flash, and then view it a bit at a time...speed isnt that important is it? Its not like a game)

Theres a lot you can do with even basic websites.

I suspect there would have to be different versions written for different cards, then. (And I could see one for Supercard that runs the browser in the DS's active memory and uses the Supercard's RAM for caching images and such... 32MB may not be much, but it's plenty for web browsing.)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, while I doubt it'll be practical / doable, I'd suggest whoever wrote a browser for DS implement the flash player that's also being worked on, because there are many pages that use flash nowadays.

that partly what i mean by not overly practical.
<br/>
<br/>
as for using the cf card for cache is the worst idea ever since it would waste write cycles on the flash and ruin your card.  using the extra 32 megs of the m3 and supercard would make a browser far more practical but quite tough since you'd need some serious memory management.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Considering a web page won't hold more than a couple hundred kilobytes of data with images, how are you going to run out of memory. Even with a web browser taking up 2-3 MB of RAM space, that leaves plenty to display a single web page. 
<br/>
<br/>
Is the PSP caching in memory visited web pages and that's causing memory problems? If so, don't do that. People will have to deal with non-cached pages. Or cache only the previously viewed page for one quick back page. Or, have an option to "cache this page" and save that page to temp RAM space and not every single one. Or not automatically downloading images could allow several hundred web pages to be cached.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless I'm missing something. Personally, I say learn from the PSP's browser short comings ... don't use them to limit what you think can be done on the DS.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://ds.spacemonkeymafia.com" target="_blank">ds.spacemonkeymafia.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Right !
<br/>
<br/>
If the browser does not support java and other "stuff" it could be quite small i suppose. Since a lot of pages are PHP a simple html-interpreter would be enough to show them correctly.

<br/>
One problem is the resolution of the screens. 220*80 aint much.

Maybe use the directional buttons to scroll? The B button to go backwards?

Are you serious? My Nokia phone (with series 40 OS) has 128x128 screen and I have Opera browser in it. It will show all the pictures too (minimized). It does not support java. My phone does have only few MB's RAM so that 4MB in DS must be enough.

There'd be a box around the top screen view area, and instead of scrolling, you just move the box around with the stylus.

To follow links and such, just hit a button and the screens switch, bringing the zoomed in view to the lower screen allowing the clicking of links and highlighting of text, perhaps.

It would be helpful to get a localized html parser up and running before any actual web browsing software can be conceived.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I believe the screen size is 64?32 characters, I am not sure if it has SSL support yet.

A few of my friends bought me a blue V4 DS for my b-day, have yet to get any homebrew tools for it to test this.
<br/>
I plan to get a M3CF and use FlashMe.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a portal page I created awhile ago for when I get DSLinux running.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, we know about the text mode browser for awhile.
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I still dont know whats so hard about getting basic HTML working.
<br/>
I mean, just ignoreing tabs that are too hard to do, couldnt we start with the basics and work up from there?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Indeed.
<br/>
Seems to support a handfull of basic text tabs as well as specilised ones for doing the DS buttons (a rather nice feature :) )
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if it could open basic HTML files too...not for webbrowseing, but so people can write neat help files for their apps.
<br/>
<br/>
Something else Id like to see soon;
<br/>
<br/>
Simple download app.
<br/>
<br/>
Give it a exact URL and it downloads the file to the compact flash.
<br/>
<br/>
This will be extreamly usefull even after Opera comes out :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I really dont get what on earth takes up the space on even these text browsers :-/
<br/>
Surely for a text browser you just ignore most of the tags, display the text then assign buttons to flip between links on the page.
<br/>
<br/>
Then for displaying pictures, you could just have any picture tags selectable with another button, which downloads to ram and displays it using the correct lib (Jpeg, PNG, whatever).
<br/>
<br/>
As an extra feature any of these links could also be downloaded to the card. (like an MP3).
<br/>
<br/>
All of those features should fit into 4MB of ram with planty of room to spare :-/
<br/>
Heck, 2 MB ram should be possible (and thus allowing 2MB jpegs to be loaded)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, I have been considering this, but I have been snowed under with freelance work lately.
<br/>
If I did make one, I probably wouldnt call it a browser because it would never really reach that level. More of an web "thingy" :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
