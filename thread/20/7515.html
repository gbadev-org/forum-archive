If you want to play GBA games over link play, buy a GBA SP. Can the DS actually emulate GBA roms at full speed? I'm sure it wouldn't be as hard as emulating an SNES for instance, but it's very unlikely because again, the whole piracy factor.
<br/>
<br/>
Why would a person risk people playing illegal GBA roms for their Nintendo DS just so you can have your link play, when all you need to do is go out and buy yourself a GBA SP and a link cable?
<br/>
<br/>
Sure I answered my own question, but I also answered with one more sensible than "Link Play", and that's Piracy issues.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

<br/>
There are some problems with your line of reasoning.
<br/>
<br/>
a) you can already pirate GBA games on the DS without an emulator. It's called 'flash cards' and 'CF/SD adapter's, which are, notably, critical to homebrew on the DS. So a GBA emulator on the DS would not enable piracy, and would actually be more unwieldy a method, if it even worked at all.
<br/>
<br/>
b) a GBA SP for link play only works if you have physical proximity to someone else to play with. We have this really neat communications medium called the 'internet' that would be pretty fun to play games over, were it possible. Some of us have a shortage of gaming friends in person, yet many people online we'd like to play with.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you can explain how a GBA emulator would actually enable piracy in any way that isn't already available more easily, I'd like to hear it. In the meantime, there are legitimate reasons to want one, even if it isn't currently feasible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

And we don't even have any PC-based GBA emulators pulling that off just yet.

<br/>
As nice as the thought would be, I have trouble imagining the DS emulating two ARM7 cores, much less all the rest of the system. The possibility exists that some really squicky recompilation techniques could make it feasible, given the higher clock rate, but that would be highly improbable.
<br/>

<br/>
btw, you can buy a used original GBA for under $50 dollars. Hey, you want to keep it cheap right? don't get picky on your system.
<br/>
<br/>
The cheapest and easiest way to run software on the DS is with a GBAMP and a PassMe. Last I checked, people using those mediums can't play any larger than a 256k multiboot GBA ROM. Correct me if I'm wrong, but flash carts are much more expensive than what a used GBA would cost. Even the M3 is more expensive than that.
<br/>
<br/>
unrequited: "stfu"? what are you, 12? Grow up. You want to play with your sister in a GBA game so badly over the internet, get an online-enabled GBA emulator for the PC. See how well that works.
<br/>
<br/>
octopusfluff, you and tepples probably make the most intelligent, and reasonable answer.
<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, even if the DS did have the same processor as the GBA albeit faster..is there really any way to run a GBA "Rom" in DS Mode, while making the DS act like a GBA? This actually reminds me of an earlier question by someone in another thread..something about wanting to run larger sized ROMs in their GBAMP in DS mode.
<br/>
<br/>
You guys need to stop directing anger toward me, and look at it realistically. Sure having internet link play is a tempting thought, but giving people the added ability to get a cheap piracy device to play illegal games on a system that already plays the games you want to play legally, but without the ability of link play..I don't know. Perhaps it seems pointless to me because there were never really any GBA games I'd ever wanted to link up with.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

True :(
<br/>
I wish It would go upto 4MB, it would enable me to play a lot more homebrew stuff.

<br/>
As for over-the-net play:
<br/>
<br/>
Be fair, theres lots of good reasons to want it.

<br/>
Zelda Four Swords

<br/>
How often do you find 4 people with GBAs? The games excelent, but I have only played the gba version once with 4 other people, and that was at a special event.
<br/>
<br/>
Some multiplayer gba games are great, but hard to find people to play with.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not going to argue about the sanity or legality of emulating a GBA to play the games over the internet, but as far as the feasibility of it: NOT POSSIBLE.
<br/>
<br/>
Mostly emulating one GBA on the DS is doable with good code, but it'd be taxing the system.  Doing two is completly out of the question, and most GBA games are *incredibly* intolerant to latency on the link port (as in, any non-zero latency == dropped connection, not as in they'll only sort of work).
<br/>
<br/>
The only reason one is possible on a system less than 3 times as powerful as a GBA (faster cpu, still slow ram, 3 is a number I pulled out of my ass), is because it's so very much like a GBA.  You can let the game operate completly out of memory and execute most opcodes natively, you just need to trap SWIs and io register reads/writes to handle missing hardware, etc...  You can't do that with two GBAs, since there is only one set of main RAM, shared RAM (e.g. iwram on the gba), etc...  You'd have to emulate the lot, and there isn't enough power to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
The GBA link port is a full-duplex sync shift register.  It clocks data both directions at the same time, like a SPI bus, and most games rely on this in their protocol design.  You *cannot* tunnel the traffic of most GBA games, point blank, and as tepples said, the alternative is to emulate both machines on both sides, and lockstep sync whenever one does a comms transfer, this is even slower than just emulating two completly seperate GBAs (which as I said, isn't possible either).
<br/>
<br/>
Because the link port is a bitch to program for in the first place, some games are much more tolerant in their protocol design to get around problems they had with just a point to point physical link, and these sorts of games are the ones that work with the majesco RF link (which also has very low latency, compared to the internet).<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

Hmz..on simerlar lines though would you be able to (theorticaly) use the GBA multiplayer games over a local wireless connection?

(eg,just make up for Nintendos lack of a link port)

You wouldnt need dual emulation then.

Not with a DS. GBA games expect latency in the microseconds, and you can't get that out of consumer wireless packet protocols. You could try Majesco's adapter, which doesn't use a packet protocol.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

The lower screen does indeed turn off, and the DS is running in GBA mode, however, the SC doesn't turn off the backlight before it gives up control of the DS hardware.<br/>_________________<br/>It's 'CubeGuy.' One word. No space.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just curious how much of a difference we are talking about here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The latency on GB/GBA link ports is pretty freaking low, since operations complete effectively within a few clock cycles as I recall. Given the speed of the GBA, that means you're dealing with a latency measured in microseconds, or possibly even less than a microsecond. Wifi communications, on the other hand, have to be able to tolerate latency around the millisecond range.
<br/>
<br/>
It's a pretty huge gap.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

GBA runs at 115 kbps, and the physical layer works a bit at a time. You need 9 ?s latency in order to feed it bits.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Honestly you would probably have an easier time making your own game based on the one that is on the gba game for the ds.  Ya the wireless isn't out yet, but you could pretty much copy the gameplay exactly or add your own additions.  I mean, it's not like you are selling the game.  I mean, I would play a snes mario kart game with online play especially if you could edit tracks!  Mind you I don't have the technical knowhow to do it.  I could learn but I'm lazy and would prefer to take advantage of other people's hard work.
<br/>
<br/>
There should be lots of new games for the ds that have similar gameplay that will have wireless play.  I mean the games will be simple and fun and won't require you to do the near impossible just to have a laggy crappy experience!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A quick perusing through google suggests that there isn't a minimum payload size for 802.11b. The MAC overhead is 28 bytes, plus any encapsulation NiFi may be using.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the notion of sending 29 bytes (28 for MAC +1 to hold our data) + NiFi overhead  just to transmit a single bit is quite laughable.
<br/>
<br/>
For the purposes of your argument, 'minimum packet size' is quite distinct from 'minimum payload size', as packet size is usually including overhead, but your argument is counting accumulated bits in the payload before transmission.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
