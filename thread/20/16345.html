    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The DSOrganizer has a internet browser feature, and I am looking for a online chatroom that is compatible with it. I know DSOrganiser has IRC functionality, but that does not work for my situation.
<br/>
<br/>
My situation-
<br/>
<br/>
Me:
<br/>
<br/>
- I have a R4 and DSOrganizer.
<br/>
- I do not have a slot 2 device of any kind.
<br/>
<br/>
The person I wish to talk to:
<br/>
<br/>
- Has a DS Opera browser game card
<br/>
- Has the slot 2 device it comes with
<br/>
<br/>
I am requesting if anyone knows of a web site that has combatible chat for both these browsers. If you know of a chatroom site that you have only tested on one, please tell anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you if you took the time to help, and thank you even if you could not but read my plea anyways.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
