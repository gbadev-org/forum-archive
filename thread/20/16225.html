I haven't been too active compared to others in the community but have always kept up with the news. For this presentation I spent time researching and making sure I got my facts straight. I would appreciate the input and/or corrections if anyone has any.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Unfortunately no, however I do have an audio recording. I have uploaded it if you or anyone else would like to listen to it. You can find it <a class="postlink" href="http://www.sfu.ca/~gdcexec/eric-talk-1.mp3" target="_blank">here</a>. It is not as interesting as a video though. We have limited file storage for our club's website so this link might not work months or years from now. If it is not available just send me an email.
<br/>
<br/>
A few people have contacted me after the presentation expressing an interest in learning more. Hopefully they will be joining the community as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
