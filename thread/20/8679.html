    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi everyone!
<br/>
DSchat is finally out, with real functionalities this time... You can find it here:
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://bafio.drunkencoders.com/" target="_blank">http://bafio.drunkencoders.com/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Source code will be following after some cleanups.
<br/>
<br/>
Version 0.8
<br/>
<br/>
Too many changes to remember, but among the others:
<br/>
* DNS client working.
<br/>
* It's now possible to connect using both wifi settings from wifitransfer and the firmware settings
<br/>
* The server has option to upload a message log to an FTP server, locally serve them or save them to a local directory. HTML files are automatically generated (still in devel.)
<br/>
* Touch screen code takes into account the pressure of the pen
<br/>
* Keyboard (yes, I know it's not so good)
<br/>
* Status
<br/>
* User list (limited to 15 users now)
<br/>
TODO:
<br/>
* too much :)
<br/>
fix server publishing, user list improvements, receiving messages in menu, more menu, user settings, webcam (not on DS I'm afraid)...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by bafio on Wed Mar 08, 2006 4:10 pm; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

I have GBAMP :D but, did you try .nds and .nds.gba ?

I think I remember somebody successfully using it. Can anybody confirm that?

<br/>
1. Start WiFi Transfer and set your WiFi settings.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure that DNS #1 and Gateway are set to the IP of your router.
<br/>
And make sure DS' IP corresponds to the same pattern as other devices on your network (in my case 192.168.1.xxx).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So the problem lies on the DNS.  I suggest you to check the dns settings, the DNS server should be a valid one. Another possibility is a bug in the DNS client, but I would think it would have come up at some point.
<br/>
<br/>
The server seems to be down now, but anyway you shoild get the corerrct ip address when connecting...

Yes, my DNA settings are identical to my pc's on the wifi transfere, but I have a feeling the chat software might not be picking up the settings from wifi transfere.

Try to press start after the connection failed, it should give some info. Also, if you get ip 0.0.0.0 it will never work :| you can also try to give the ip address. Otherwise try to set the connection in the wifi settings from a game  ...

I know, I could find no way to avoid that, and I have been experimenting quite a lot with touch screen code! pressure is a good indicator of a bad touch but it's not always useful. also, small jumps are hard to avoid.
<br/>
If anybody knows a way to fix this, I'll be happy to investigate.

The top bar drawing should be impossible now (with the very latest version, 0.81b)...

They all should go in the root dir. just to be sure.
<br/>
I really can't understand how it can connect to an ssid that is not present in the wifi config file of firmware settings, since I explicitly check that the SSID is in one of the two.
<br/>
Also, I tested here with 2 wireless networks and it ignores networks ton in the list.
<br/>
Plus' it has beet test and run several times from people with many wireless networks available.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">not sure if this helps anyone else out.....but heres how i got it to connect (after much frustration of course!) :
<br/>
I used the wifi transfer program to set up my wifi settings but couldnt connect to any servers in the wifi chat (kept getting connect to 0.0.0.0) 
<br/>
My firmware wifi settings that i had set up in mariokart had automatically assigned ip,dns,gateway, etc. 
<br/>
After mucking around with whatever settings I could I deleted the Mariokart connection and then tried the chat program again - it said it couldn't find the AP - even though I had set it up in the wifi transfer......so I figured that it must be using values from the firmware and not my wifi transfer settings file. 
<br/>
So then I set up the firmware wifi settings in mariokart manually with the settings from the wifi transfer file.....and it works!
<br/>
<br/>
What I don't understand though is why that happened? I am using a supercard sd so could it be specifically related to this card?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hi,
<br/>
<br/>
First of all thanks for this message, it really helps identifying problems some people may have.
<br/>
<br/>
Quick version: if you have a SD device, or any device not supported by Chishm's library, please enter your settings in the Firmware (like using MarioKart) and make sude that the are ALL set manually, manual IP, gateway, DNS, etc... as you would do in wifi transfer. If you run into problems, this is the safest way to get this working.
<br/>
<br/>
Why: in the last version of wifi transfer I was using a modification of Chishm's library that was working on some more SD devices.
<br/>
Since the last update of the officila library fixed some serious bugs, I went back to the original version. This explains why with wifi transfer these devices (I guess supercard SD) are supported, so you can read and write the configuration file, but with wifi chat they are not.
<br/>
That means that wifichat actually can't read the config that wifitransfer has created. I'll se for the next release to update, maybe using the FAT library modifications from moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the safest way if using firmware settings, this makes possible to run the program from flash cards and WMB too, since it does not depend on any particular card/hardware.
<br/>
Remember: you DO NEED to set all the different information ( IP address, gateway, DNS, subnet mask) manually. Also, WEP is not supported.
<br/>
I hope this helps! 
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers

Actually, I have already a fill tool code, but it's recursive, so it seems to break when filling large areas (I guess some stack overflow?).

I guess I  should implement a different algorithm, so if anybody can point me out some place where to find possibly simple c drawing algorithms, I will try to add some of them :)

Also, I will need to make the keyboard hidable, so I get some more space where to add all these different buttons.

Actually that's a good idea, I was supposed to do that also for testing, but I got lazy so I never developed it .
<br/>
It sure would be easy do develop a pc application (at least easyer than the DS one)... I'll see if I find the time, but others are welcome too to develop it, I'll be happy to help.

Then you can give this app to a friend, then you connect to their IP to chat to them.

This will look interesting, once TCP will be out. Up to then, an user interface by itself tells me as much as that other VOIP program for the DS.... I mean, I hope this will come out with real functionality, but before the lib is out, there is not much to see.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, it would be really nice to integrate that with drawing functionality ;)
