    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Made a program to backup EEPROM to your SRAM, one is just to copy/restore it (ETool 2.1 - mainly for supercard users, although works on my XG2 turbo 2005 512...) and the other has multi slots to copy to (6x64k and 8x4k)
<br/>
<br/>
2mbit are not supported but:
<br/>
If someone can aim me at some good/simple info or libs (that will work with dkARM) on compression I will see what I can do about adding it to Etool 2.1 to allow backup and restore of 2mbit EEPROMS as well (currently only format is implemented)... (and yes, I have looked, so far as I can see libz may be my best choice?)
<br/>
<br/>
note: there is no check to see if you are using a passme/flashme cart so they can potentially overwrite standard gba game SRAM... because of this I did not include a wi-fi version (although there is source, and bins included are only appended using the dkARM loader)
<br/>
<br/>
Just want to say again and again "thanks SATA for the fixed code for the EEPROM reads and writes!"
<br/>
<br/>
any rate, find them here if you are interested, appreciate any feedback on bugs that you may well find in there.

Actually, using a hex editor I made a .sav (for supercard, but it should work with anything you can put an sram file to directly/uncompressed) from one of the Max Drive DS online saves, where all mini games are unlocked and and the first slot has 150 stars

FWIW: If you want to support Nintendogs carts, a simple run-length compression technique is sufficient. The 256KB of data can be compressed to well under 30KB (if you don't have too many dogs). If you want to be smarter, put in a special check if the first 128KB is equal to the second 128KB (true in the case of a non-corrupt Nintendogs cart)

<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing being using say, zip compression, even with the added overhead of headers and such compression goes below 50KB - so Im at a loss (heh pun as I need a lossless compression algo).

If you look on my site a link to SATA's GBAMP site can be found there, but for posterity's sake:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.pat.hi-ho.ne.jp/sata68/nds.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.pat.hi-ho.ne.jp/sata68/nds.shtml</a>
<br/>
is SATA's NDS page. The tool is called "NDS EEPROM TOOL update r7b" and does a bit more than just save copying.
<br/>
<br/>
/edit: for the EZ III carts you need to specify a save size BEFORE putting the tool onto it, so its possible that your cart has a similar setting... I didnt put much for flash cart info as there are so many different ways that they save and I dont have every brand of flashcard to try them all...
<br/>
<br/>
mithos: use ETool 2.1 (not Etool SMS) and tell it to copy the SRAM to EEPROM and that should do what you are after, at least, it worked for me on a couple 64k games.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Deflation is LZ77 intermixed with Huffman coding. Another thing to watch for: PKZIP's Deflate algorithm uses a 32 KiB window. It won't pick up the mirrors because they're 128 KiB away from each other.

Thanks very much for some direction tepples, before I look into the zlib port (and R16a DKA for that matter, just when I was getting to "know" R15 a little) I will definitely track down the LZ77 stuff done on the GBA... for whatever reason I got the idea that it was only really used in the emulators for ROM deflation wrather than in GBA app coding so I didnt look to far before.

Well, it works on an xg2turbo 2005 512 so I dont see why it wouldnt work with a NeoFlash... dont know why its not working on the G6 though, if I had one I would definitely try and find out. (perhaps a "homebrew" cart that isnt so homebrew friendly?)
<br/>
<br/>
edit:/ one last bit, I have been contacted by a couple people who are experiencing a problem with SRAM, is it a known problem for some flashcarts to "lose" or NULL the first byte of SRAM? I will be putting a workaround for this problem into EToolSMS, but if there is indeed a known problem with a full solution I would sure like to know about it...
<br/>
<br/>
edit2:/ OK, EToolSMS is now updated to 1.07 so that the first 2 bytes of data doesnt really matter any more, and if you have an old save file it will correct the APPID header to 2 bytes farther in so no one else should experience the problem of losing the first byte to the NULL void()</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by cory1492 on Fri Oct 07, 2005 5:53 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

ETool 3.11 - out now, backs up and restores current EEPROM (no compresseion) and FLASH (2mbit) saves (with compression) and has a PC side decompressor/extractor with... woohoo, the hardest thing I have figured out recently, drag and drop support... also moved everything in SRAM out of those dangerous bytes, so there should be no lost saves with it.

Thanks for all your help getting over the hump of compression, especially you DSPet, that trainer you made is A1 and seeing it released encouraged me very much.

edit:/ I can extract the save for you if you like, you can use ETool 3.11 to copy EEPROM/FLASH and the included PC side extractor to make a save that will be compatible @ 256k</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

New version of SRAM storage method, V2.0x, your old 1.0x will update automatically, retaining all data and function, but all slots will claim to be full if you decide to import your old save backups. Slots are numbered always now as well, and you can no longer change empty save names, as they are blank when empty rather than containing dummy save names like ?1 - save empty?. I spit on it, I polished it, and I almost beat my computer because of it? but here it be!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">nothing as far as I can tell except that it writes 2mbit save in larger 256 byte chunks wrather than the carme's way of using 32 byte chunks. And it does it faster. I dont have many 2mbit save carts to test with (and none that need the T3 fix) so I included both, in case someone such as yourself had problems restoreing the saves. Better also than having to re-release it with both later if there is a problem with the new way (although to my understanding 256 chunks is the way it is supposed to be done anyway).
<br/>
<br/>
BTW: the source code is included for both so you can find differences (aka diff util) if you really wanted to see whats different.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been using ETool for quite some time now with my EZF-Advance III and it's been working just fine. Today, however, ETool stopped being nice to me. Whenever I pull compressed saves off of my EZF-Advance III and try to extract them with ETxtract, the program says "inflate: incorrect data check" and then crashes. I've tried reformatting my card, wiping the SRAM, and doing all kinds of other things to it to try to get it to work again, but to no avail.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm out of ideas, so any help you guys might be able to offer is greatly appreciated.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: It seems to be working again just fine. The only possible explanation I can come up with was that I was doing a LOT of burning and erasing on the flash cart that day, so perhaps it overheated or something. *shrug*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
