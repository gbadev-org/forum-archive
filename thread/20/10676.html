<br/>
<br/>
I'm the owner of 2 DSs an original one and a Lite one, and the Lite doesn't bring the strap to put on your thumb and rock that touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Where can I find one of these?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hello, yes I suspected that was the reason they were not including it. It seems they have taken a lot of things in mind that were not working ok with the original DS, and fixed them. But still, I don't mind those little scratches, they magically disappear when the screens turn on:)
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys, I think I'll email Nintendo then.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, they're pretty good about that. They sent me a free copy of the US version of Mario Kart DS's manual when I complained about how little the Canadian version actually explains.

Then your strap had a fault.
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously...how do people play hunters without it?!?

Ontario, near Quebec. Every game I've seen that even bothered with French instructions had either both in one book or two separate books.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
