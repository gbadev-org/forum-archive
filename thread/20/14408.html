    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright-- "just daydreaming" time.  This is semi-related to Colors, but I couldn't think of a better Forum Topic to post this under...
<br/>
  As mentioned earlier in this forum, I am hardly a programmer, but I was wondering:
<br/>
  With the pressure-sensing capabilities of the DS as well as local Wifi capabilites as both brilliantly demonstrated by Jesse here on Colors... how possible would it be to use the DS as a wireless wacom tablet (and dare I say Cintiq)?  By remotely sending both mouse coordinates as well as pressure data to a PC/Mac- similar to the Adhoc Wifi feature soon-to-be-implemented into Colors?  Even if it was technically impossible to display the PC monitor screen on the DS (and say the DS screen instead simply remained black),  I would think that sort of thing would still prove priceless to some people as a sort of "poor-man's Wacom".  Am I dreaming past the machines capabilities?  Just curious (well, that and if it IS possible I just wanted to stick that bug in some brilliant hombrewers ear ;) ).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That's a pretty cool idea and it would be pretty simple to do a simple app where the touch-screen input would be sent to a small service running on a PC. The only problem as I see it is that it it could be hard to convert that data on the PC into mouse/pressure info. I guess the traditional way to do it would be to write a mouse driver, but that doesn't sound very tempting for me. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena" target="_blank">http://www.collectingsmiles.com/hyena</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes-- this is what I'm referring to, but to me the big thing would be to include the pressure sensitivty so you can use it for apps such as Photoshop, Flash, artRage, etc.

Haha, I tried it for that exact same reason too.
<br/>
<br/>
Manipulating my desktop with the DS had very little appeal, except maybe hitting pause on a DVD from further away... but... a baby-sized wireless graphic tablet/cintiq...? OH YES!
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for me, my network complications are such that A) I couldn't get Win2DS to work (c'est la vie) and B) I heard it has no pressure sense... boring!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">had this similar idea a few months back but i thought it was so obvious that sooner or later colors would support a pcdriver for that (mini cintiq).
<br/>
i see now it wasnt in the included plans, so here's one more vote in support for that idea.
<br/>
however it would prolly have to have:
<br/>
<br/>
.fast zoom resolution with up and down (fs or region of screen centered at stylus point of contact)
<br/>
.left back big button pressure for activating ink (or right for lefties). meaning that traveling the stylus on ds would only do the pc cursor move and dat for inking or clickin you would have to keep pressed the left big back exterior button of ds (dunno name sry) for activating it, rlsing it would turn to nonclick.
<br/>
.usage of this would be 100% or close to it with eyes focused on pc monitor.
<br/>
.adjustable interpolation values (lagged smooth vs warpy instant)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ya- I figured it was way over my head-- not to mention I'm mostly a Mac user- making it even harder.  Maybe this should be more of a suggested feature for Win2DS anyways.  And from what I understand- it may even have to be a patch written for Photoshop as opposed to a driver-- i dunno tho-- like I said- I no codey</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What are you writing about here is far beyond simplistic sketch application, that's a totally different project. I bet it wouldn't be too hard for Jesse to implement, but how many people would make real use of this? 10? 20? I doubt that much would. Of course even a couple hundred, maybe more would try that for 5 minutes, but it wouldn't be really useful for everyday work. I think that Jesse could make a lot better use of his programming skills.<br/>_________________<br/>Colors! gallery -&gt; <a href="http://colors.collectingsmiles.com" target="_blank">http://colors.collectingsmiles.com</a>

To make applications like photoshop aware of the pressure (on windows) you probably have to write a wintab driver which I have no idea how complex that would be (not sure if vista still uses wintab and if it might be more straightforward on OSX/Linux).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also I agree that a DS tablet and Colors! are two different projects and it'd be a bit silly to combine them.

I'm not sure anyone is suggesting that all of that doesn't happen first.
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it's more likely to be as you said, that any DS-2-Win-Tablet-Replacement app would be.. well, a completely different application to Colors!
<br/>
<br/>
People are just getting excited, and speculating :D
<br/>

Soo... Now I'm wondering how the various original features are coming along (:
<br/>
Collab for instance!

<br/>
its not built in colors, obviously and if u read what people are saying you will understand that.
<br/>
just that this side project could share a lot of similar code to the colors project so if he feels like doing it, theres people here interested, but surely even more not here, coz the pc crowd is huge and a miniwacom (not cintiq) is too exciting to pass on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The sensitivity works with the pen, because the special tip is like a little button that can be pushed harder or softer. (I haven't yet really figured out how the screen knows where the pen is; you can hover the pen over the screen to move the mouse around without clicking)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this program comes in a Windows XP Tablet PC edition suite of programs, but I've no idea whether there's any kind of API for such things...<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

You should not rely on such hacks. This approach only works on some situations, and fails for a lot other (i.e. using Direct Input)
<br/>
The Windows DDK has templates for HIDs such as mice and tablets. Start from there and you won't have to care about how the App reads out the Input.

Well in that case it is still superior to the SendMessage approach which wouldn't work at all due to the changed policity in sending message to other windows where applications on the same desktop might run with different rights (SendMessage command injection -&gt; rights elevation)
