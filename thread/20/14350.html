    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello! I would like to have an internet browser in my ds, i've tried DS Hobro but I can't connect, i have DSHobro 0.3 and i always get the messeage "Initialising Wifi..." I have tried option A and option B (with the key of the server). I have used the random port and ports that i have opened in my router, but anyway, I have the "Initialising Wifi..." message and nothing happens. I can play wifi games.

<br/>
I want the internet in my DS to see the Live Timing of F1 xD while I'm watching Tv, so i think i need a browser with java in order to be able to open the live timing window of the f1 website. Do you know what can i do with the program to make it run? Do you know another browser program that can allow me to do that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSHobro is the only one to support Java in a sense, so it would be best to get it working.  Wifi on homebrew is more picky than commercial games, so you may need to specify manual settings to get it to work.  See <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10320" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10320</a> for some help with getting Wifi to work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it a DS or a DS Lite?  Old DS'es ("DS Phat's") tend to have better WiFi compatibility than newer Lite models.  If you have a Lite, try setting your router's WiFi channel to 10, this has helped many Lite owners like my friend (I have a Phat FW1, works on all channels), and make sure you use programs with Lite-compatible WiFi.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF
