    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">it absolutely is, just don't use the most recent (supercard SD) release. that one dropped support for the superdat, anyway, and you kind of really need the superdat nine times out of ten.

compile it as you would for a flashcart, producing a .ds.gba binary, then rename (DON'T convert) it to .nds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you, that worked. Although I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to work: When I try to open SnesDS.nds, it now says "No roms found." And I have all my Snes roms made into .nds with the SnesDS program in the same folder. So for a while I thought it still didn't work, until I tried running one of the roms by itself. When I do that, it gives me a list of Snes roms it found, and can play them. No big deal though, if it works, it works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Either compile your roms into the snesds binary (which shouldn't be nessesary when you use a cf card) OR put the roms on the cf card directly. when snesds is compiled for use with cf cards, it will read the roms from the card.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
