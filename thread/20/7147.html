    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I dont' know if this is already being made or done, but here's an idea:
<br/>
create a site (maybe add it to ndshb.com) where every homebrew developer that want to post his/her demo, would send it to a known, trusted person (ideally, the binary and source), so the could sign the binary and then post it to the website. Everyone that wants to test the demo, could get the public key from the website to check the integrity of the file. Maybe we could create some kind of CA for demos :-P
<br/>
anyway... maybe we could just get along with md5 and hope that no one creates an evil binary with the same checksum :-P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think you don't understand the idea of signing a file. Here's the concept:
<br/>
<br/>
I, untrusted developer, want people to test my code without the fear that it might contain "evil" code. So I send it to a trusted person to publish it in his websitve.
<br/>
The trusted person has a key pair: the private key, which lives in his own, personal computer, and the public, which is available for download in the website. He signs each demo with his private key, and people can check that the demo has the "homebrew seal of quality" with the public key. The signature (unique for each file) can be downloaded from the same place.
<br/>
Someone else, maybe a regular guy that wants to test homebrew code, finds a place with a demo, downloads it, but to be sure it's clean, he checks the signature of the file with his copy of the public key from the trusted person.
<br/>
No one can create a valid signature that can be checked with the public key, except the one that owns the private key... You got it now?
<br/>
This will allow me (untrusted developer) to send the demo to the trusted person, let him play the role of a CA for homebrew code and then returns/publish the demo and the signature, so I can put those in my homepage and let people download and be sure that the code is good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do you have to get the key from the trusted source?
<br/>
Yes? So grab the file that is stored there too. 
<br/>
The server is slow? Need a mirror? The MD5 checksum will show if you got the right one.
<br/>
<br/>
Beside that, how can the trusted source can be sure it can trust you? There are a lot of means to hide dangerous code while testing it. To send the source can be ... impossible due to licenzes.
<br/>
<br/>
Who decides which one is the trusted source? The developers or the users as the user am i forced to trust that source? or can i decide whom to trust? 
<br/>
<br/>
How can i be sure that trusted public key is the right one and not contamined by a mitm attack?
<br/>
<br/>
How would a trusted source manage to sign the dozens of versions of homebrew every day (inclusive testing) without getting paid?

1. I still can't provide the work of others for free without their agreement. No matter what reasons they got to deny it.

The use of the term "intellectual property" itself is said to reflect a selfish attitude. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml" target="_blank">Richard Stallman has explained his criticisms of the phrase</a>, and <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property#Arguments_against_the_term" target="_blank">Wikipedia describes other critics' arguments</a>. In fact, the letter of the copyright, patent, and trademark law in the United States doesn't contain the phrase "intellectual property" except in reference to the name of WIPO.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thought we act international, i'm not bound to US laws. Yet there is a law i'm bound to in germany, that i can't distribute a work without the agreement of the creator. 
<br/>
<br/>
Even if i'd just create a news with some lines of my own views on these lines, nobody can lagally copy these words, except he would strip my creative/individual work.
<br/>
<br/>
Also a copyright can't unlike in other countries be traded over here.
<br/>
<br/>
Let me quote and translate from the german law determinating what is protected:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Werke im Sinne dieses Gesetzes sind nur pers?nliche geistige Sch?pfungen.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
"Creations in spirit of this law are only individual intelectual creations."
<br/>
<br/>
And from the part exclusive for apps:
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Computerprogramme im Sinne dieses Gesetzes sind Programme in jeder Gestalt, einschlie?lich des Entwurfsmaterials.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
"Computerprograms in the spirit of this law are programs in every shape, including draft material"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So yes, there is a "intelectual property" no matter if i like or dislike it, i have to follow the rules.

Well, some do!  And I for one will NOT discourage such!  And I'm sure signing the code would take more then 1 sec.. as each update would require TESTING proir to signing.. It's easy to say you want this, or that.. if your not the one doing it..
<br/>
<br/>
I'd shut ndshb.com down before I make it any harder to maintain.  It's hard enough to try to keep up now!  And developers don't submit anything to me (for the most part, I've had a few), I hunt it down, test it, play with it, and then add it to the site..

That's not what I said. There are copyright laws in the entire developed world, but they're not called "intellectual property" laws in the copyright statutes of the United States. The objection was to the use of the phrase "intellectual property" and the mindset that the phrase creates, not necessarily to the law.
