    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Today, I was just messing around, and everyone knows how poor the quality of the Games N' Music cart is (and if you don't, then you've probably never used any Datel product), and the casing of mine came off. So, I started looking at the chip and noticed something that seemed to be alot like one of my old MP3 players memory chip. Appearently, the Games N' Music has to have some sort of flash memory, or re-writable memory because I searched for what I thought was the serial number and got some info on it. From what I've found, it seems that the GnM must have between 512Kb to arond 8Mb (from what I found on the internet). I'm not entirely sure if this is true or not as flash or re writable memory, but if it is re writable, doesn't that mean that the GnM firmware would be possible to mod and switch out with something that allowed more than 4MB to be ran game wise?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

But those are external files, correct?  The .nds file itself must still be 4 MB or less, right?  I am not aware of any .nds files larger than 4 MB that run on any slot-1 device, and it was my impression that homebrew apps were run by first being copied to RAM entirely before execution, whether it be the DS's main RAM or slot-2 RAM.

no, the card would be dead in a month (maybe a little longer) Flash memory dies after so many writes, with normal use, an sd card will last years, however if you go using it as ram, and writing crap to it every fraction of a second, it will wear out. That's why it hasn't been done before, also it's slower.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm not a boring person, it's just that boring things keep happening to me.

Could you please provide a few examples?  I'd love to see why they don't work on the Games N Music.  There is no reason the Games N Music can't play any DLDI compatible homebrew that any other slot-1 adapter can play.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for the record, the Games N Music plays LoneWolfDS without an issue (Just ran it).  So, cut to the chase and just ask why the Games N Music won't play illegal warez romz like you are actually talking about.  Then, maybe the discussion can move on to the fact that even official commercial DS game cards only load 4MB into ram.  Then, you can ask why the Games N Music doesn't have the ability to do that.. at which time someone can post that it probably can, but nobody here is going to create an illegal warez romz loader for you, and you can move on and stop wasting everyones time.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well on mine, I did the following:
<br/>
<br/>
Patch with version 1 of the GnM DLDI file.
<br/>
Rename linux.nds to bootme.nds
<br/>
insert into GnM, and into the DS
<br/>
Turn on the ds
<br/>
<br/>
# cd /media
<br/>
# mkdir test
<br/>
# cd test
<br/>
# vi test.txt

type test and then save/quit.

# cat test.txt
<br/>
test
<br/>
# poweroff

Pulled the MicroSD card out and made sure it did, in fact, write the file to the card.  I opened the test.txt file and there it was.. even with linux cr/lf at the end.  ;)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its not that I want to run commercial games. I love buying the game and owning it. It's the fact that eventually people are going to be coming out with higher detailed HB that might be more than 4mb, and have it compiled into a single .nds file (because that seems to be what they're doing now days) and for what ever reason, my GnM doesn't really like running things that are larger than 4mb. But earlier on i saw that you need to use version 1 dldi, which is what I'vebeen using, but I haven't tried acromage as I've deleted it (got bored with it quite easily). Also, does anyone know if its legal to get the Metroid Prime Hunters Demo First Hunt and where to get it if it is? I don't like the Metroid Prime Hunters Demo thats just the battle arena thingy. :)
<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, I plan on... well eventually plan on, making a 3d HB, but I don't want it to be a scattered mess of files for things like 3d images (as thats what I want to make it) and all of that, I want it to be a nice, neat, compiled file so that people can't steal my work or anything.

Neither do slot-1 solutions aside from patching, but then we talk about homebrew, don't we?

If we are at homebrew, this system is called dldi - the system you seem to  not want to use.

There isn't much needed to access a archive appended to your nds other then finding the nds itself, there are even libs (alltho i personally don't like their approach) which do this for you. No scattered files involved.
<br/>
<br/>
And tbh. i don't think that anyone would "steal" your work. If you look around open sourced projects are rather common here and there isn't really much motivation for illegally optaining assets/code for homebrewers.
<br/>
<br/>
Creating &gt;4MiB homebrew by using a non-dldi system that depends on a specific hardware setup (i.e. GBFS or NitroFS without wrapping dldi) will render many users unable to run your project</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, I keep on rereading my posts when I'm trying to help people on the DSLinux and realising I sound like a bit of an arrogant prat.  I need to remember to take a breath and remember what it was like when I first started using Linux all those many years ago before I hit submit.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the fact that the GnM is available in stores means that it's buying audience tend to be a little younger than other devices, due to them not being able to buy online.

Yeah, it probably doesn't without a RAM expansion due to the stuff that's been added to the kernel recently.  TBH I'm not really interested in making DSLinux work without a RAM pack now, I'd rather spend the time extending it's capabilities.

Yeah, it probably doesn't without a RAM expansion due to the stuff that's been added to the kernel recently.  TBH I'm not really interested in making DSLinux work without a RAM pack now, I'd rather spend the time extending it's capabilities. </span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

;) Before we get to far back on topic.. I just downloaded the current version (Damn! 30MB) and popped it onto the 128MB card that came with the Games N Music.. (Took a while, I had to delete a lot of homebrew to make room for it)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I had no problems at all.  I copied the 'linux' folder and the dslinux.nds file (not the dslinuxm.nds, which I assume is the RAM expansion version?)  I patched it for the GnM DLDI version 1, and renamed it bootme.nds
<br/>
<br/>
Popped it all into the DS and turned it on.  Again, came right up to the # and again, I created a text file without issues.  Is there something specific people are having problems with?  Is there a GnM thread on the dslinux.org forums I should take a look at?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Has anyone popped open the card to see what sort of chip the firmware is stored on? Since I don't think it has any sort of settings, and I've never seen a firmware upgrade, I'd be doubtful there's any write code in the firmware, and if there are no plans for firmware upgrades, it may not even be a rewritable chip. So probably either opening it or trying various flash ROM ID commands are the only ways to check. (And that's if the commands can even get through to the chip; the card encryption or some "protection" they may have added could interfere.)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
But, in theory, the way to boot from the hacked firmware to directly to DS Organize without ever using the original boot system for GnM (meaning all you do is boot a file off of the card) would be something like this (obviously not real coding):
<br/>
<br/>
Check DLDI of:/bootme.nds
<br/>
If DLDI is present for gmtf.dldi=intialize: /bootme.nds
<br/>
If DLDI is not present for gmtf.dldi=error message: DLDI not supported, Auto Patch?
<br/>
Choice: Yes, No
<br/>
Yes: Patch with /gmtf.dldi
<br/>
[intialize:/bootme.nds
<br/>
No: Power off
<br/>
<br/>
Would it end up something like that (except longer and more like code?) if you inserted your own firmware, which I would say would just be a black screen with white text (for the question part if you haven't already patched it, otherwise it would just instantly goto loading DSOrganize and operate it as if it were the primary firmware)?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

That has nothing to do with size, it has to do with MicroSD card access times.  Even if it had a 2Mb flash ROM, if it has slow access times, it's going to have poor performance with video/sound that is at a higher bitrate than what the hardware can provide.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyway, the real problem with a firmware hack is the risk of "bricking" the card. It could easily be repaired by restoring the original firmware - if you figure out the correct write sequence - but you'd need an alternate way to boot homebrew. Typically that'd be another card, and then you wouldn't need GnM anymore anyway. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
As far as actual tweaking, really all I'd do is bypass the logo (and maybe whatever it's doing afterward, looks like VRAM clearing given how long it takes) so it goes directly to bootme.nds without any unnecessary delay.

<br/>
<br/>
I might be entirely wrong here, but...
<br/>
I think the GnM lacks the ability to play commercial roms for a couple reasons. For one, it takes too long to read from the microsd and may cause freezing. Also, the card wasn't programmed to be able to load commercial roms. The game would need to be redirected to load from the *.nds file on the microsd instead of just reading from slot-1, but the reason homebrew works is because the homebrew is already made to be able to read from a file and not from an actual DS game cartridge.

Well, I've found out some info on the SST chip for the GnM. I know that its a 4Mb (megabit) chip and its voltage (if this matters) is 2.7-3.6v (i got this out of a data sheet I found online), with a read access speed of 70ns, with a minimum endurence of 10,00 (i'm guessing thats total writes?), and a couple of other things (I don't know if they're needed, its what the WH is for, no clue what the e is for.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't know if any of that would mean anything, but what do you guys think about it? If I somehow, miraculously learned how to code and all that, would any of this help me find the write code? (the chip would be 512kb, right?)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It shouldn't be...I don't think.  The *.nds for download on the MMD mini-site is the same as the *.nds on the MMD cartridge.  So, if the GnM ever had an update, the *.nds for download would be the same as a dump from the (new) carts.  And I'm almost positive the "rom" is homebrew.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright now I'm thinking there was an update to the .nds file of the original as that rom was v 1.22 and my carts version is v1.30. I wonder why its no longer on their site, and you're right that it should be considered legal given the fact that, if they release the updates, it'll mean they're releasing the binary. I'm guessing if there will end up a mod, it'll be right after they release a update. But I want to attempt to learn to code with this (I'll start simple, obviously, after I find a way to figure out that write code :p)
<br/>
<br/>
To find the write code, I would need a way to disassemble the .nds file, right?<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):
