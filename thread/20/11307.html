    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi, im reasonably new to the homebrew scene, as i just purchased the MMP last weekend. I have come to understand that support for MMP/MMD is rather small from both the company and the community. So i have come here to ask for help, below on the list includes every single DS app or game that i have been having problems using on the MMP/MMD.
<br/>
<br/>
I know most Devs or the community is fond of helping with compatibilty issues, but i would hope that you guys would also understand <span style="text-decoration: underline">were people to</span> .

List/Associated Problems
<br/>
<br/>
NDSMail- When i load it onto my CF card (Sandisk 512 Ultra II), it loads fine. Then after i boot the NDSL i get this message
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Waiting for ARM7 core
<br/>
If you can read this, you are either not using the version that       is suited for your flashcard, an emulator or Bronto forgot to link the ARM7 core.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
DSLiveWeather- DSWiFi ready!
<br/>
                        LibFat failed
<br/>
Error loading profiles. (FAT)
<br/>
Error loading reports. (FAT)
<br/>
Error loading forecasts. (FAT)
<br/>
*Once that message loads i can't enter any information on the touchscreen and my DS freezes.
<br/>
<br/>
*Their are other apps such as DS2KEY and DSOrganize and DSBlue which don't load either but those two that i just metioned are enough for now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><ul><li>The GBAMP v2 CF is a NOR flash (for firmware) and an ATA interface (for CF). </li><li>The MAX Media Dock is just an ATA interface, as the firmware is stored partly on the MAX Media Launcher and partly on the CF card. </li><li>The MAX Media Player is a MMD with a CF hard drive. </li></ul>
<br/>
The GBAMP and MMD ATA interfaces are placed at different parts of the GBA ROM address space, and the block device driver used by a FAT library needs to be modified to take this into account. But this change is very easy to make, and usually all the author of a program has to do is update to a new version of the FAT library that already has this change in place.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
