if his card was full of mp3s, why would he want to compress the few mb used up by his homebrew? wouldnt it make more sense to compress the mp3s? ;)</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

That's what I was talking about. A lot of people rip MP3s for playback on PC sound cards, which have a 16-bit to 24-bit DAC. MP3s from LAME preset standard might clock in at 192 kbps. But with the DS's DAC, anything over -q 2 (about 96 kbps) won't improve the output very much in my estimation.
<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody done ABX testing through the DS's DAC?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">useful discussion to have in my opinion. 
<br/>
i would like to re-encode the music i play on DS, but if we find more accurately to what degree we can do this without losing any noticable quality would be good, considering i wouldnt like to lose any (given that the DS's best isn't that great to begin with).

wouldn't mind that batch file if it's still available :)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by OSW on Fri Feb 29, 2008 10:52 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Didn't know what <a class="postlink" href="http://www.provide.net/~djcarlst/abx_new.htm" target="_blank">ABX</a> was. I'd be willing to test-hear because I have a little bit of a music background, but it should really involve some really young people who actually have some taste  ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, shouldn't it be possible to take some accepted maximum-quality mp3 bitrate (320 AFAIR?) and work out in some theoretical way what the move from 16 bit 44 kHz to the DS DAC would entail?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
