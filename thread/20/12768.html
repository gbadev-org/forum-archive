    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was just thinking, with the announcement that the Miis were going to be on the DS, whats stopping the DS homebrew community from getting them on the DS (I'm sure you'll tell me, lol). With people now able to create Miis online or on Win apps, save them and use them on their wiis, is it not possible for their to be a Mii reader/maker on the DS? Your thoughts?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
