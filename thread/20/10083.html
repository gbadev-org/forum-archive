    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't know much about homebrew, but there's a really fun DOS game called <a class="postlink" href="http://mduel2k5.spadgos.com/mduel96/" target="_blank">Marshmallow Duel</a> that seems like it would work well on the DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Player 1 could use the D-pad to move and L to use item, and Player 2 could use the ABXY buttons and R to use item. the gameplay could all be on one screen. or, if you're more ambitious, wireless/wifi play could be added (especially single-card play! my bro doesn't have an M3, but I put flashme on his DS so download play works).
<br/>
<br/>
anyone have any interest in porting/emulating a game like this? it'd be really awesome!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A lot of effort though.

<br/>
dos(box) on ds would be ultimate though, there a lots of great simple games for it.

<span style="font-style: italic">Sands of Time</span> is one of the most fantasic games ever made, dont demise it because of the horrible "PoP: 3D".

Its probably the best platform game of this/last generation<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I would love to play something like Lode Runner: The Legend Returns or Megarace on ds, but there are a lot of limitations.  I don't know how well these games would play on a 16MHz x86 with 4MB ram, using a 256x192 screen...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A realistic goal would be a 4.77mhz 8086 with 640kb ram, especially if the CPU core is written in C.
<br/>
Problem is, you need someone who has experience with the x86 architecture and has the time to write an emulator.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, this is definately a project I'd like to see.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Anyone have know a good reference I could use? I guess I need info on 8086 asm, and a description of what the needed BIOS does.
<br/>
<br/>
perhaps I should just look into one of the already existing dos/x86 emu's and learn from that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
