    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I'll list the DS's and then what's happening, hopefully someone can help.
<br/>
<br/>
All 3 DS's flashed with flashme7, I can't remember what original firmware they had, but I used them for months and they worked fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Symptom 1: Now, they don't turn on. At all. The green light doesn't even flicker.
<br/>
<br/>
Symptom2: When plugged into the wall, the orange charge light switches on briefly, no more than 2 seconds, then switches off.
<br/>
<br/>
What I've eliminated: The batteries are all fine, when tried in a friends ds they all charged up and held their charge fine. As a side note, the charged batteries, when going back into the now dead ds's, still won't turn it on. I hope this can be fixed, and whats the chance of it happening to all 3?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are these fresh DSs, or is this after flashing all 3 at once, or what?
<br/>
<br/>
We'll probably need to know a bit more about how they came to be bricked...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, first off, as far as I can tell, they're not bricked. Just not getting power and/or charging.
<br/>
<br/>
All 3 have worked previously, I just got a little bored with them and they ended up in the cupboard collecting dust. They all went in working 100%, and all came out with the same symptoms.
<br/>
<br/>
All 3 we're flashed at different times, all with v7 flashme and I checked the md5 hash to make sure it was legit.
<br/>
<br/>
So here's how it went: Bought DS, DS worked. Flashed DS with Flashme v7, DS worked for months. Put them in the cupboard, no one touched them for about 2 months, took them out, and dead :-(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, probably batteries died. You should charge them for 24h, that helped with my mobile phone(s). :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the battery is not being detected as existing to the ds, chances are you didnt use them for quite a while (correct?)
<br/>
so the batteries have been fully drained, and the technology that the ds's batteries use die if they are not used for long periods of time, 
<br/>
<br/>
they are cheap, but chances are you beed some new ones
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: misread your post, didnt read the last line
<br/>
ok, chances are that the fuses inside the ds's have blown, send them to nintendo if you do not want to replace the motherboard/solder it yourself</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Know of any good tuts that could show me how to do that? I'm not sending anything back to nintendo :-P. If not, the general location and type of fuse would help. Cheers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If they are less than 12 months old, Nintendo would replace them for free, so that would be the best option.
<br/>
<br/>
Are you positive you installed flashme v7?  If they had v4 or lower then they would be bricked by any WFC (wi-fi game) like Mario Kart since those games overwrote a small part of the firmware that contained v4 flashme.
<br/>
<br/>
It seems unlikely that 3 DS would stop working at the same time but if there was a short in one of the carts that you plugged into all 3 of them then that could blow a fuse.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://gtamp.com/DS" target="_blank">GTAMP.com/DS</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">no these are the classic simptoms of a ds that cant detect its battery, and i dont know if anybody knows what type of fuse, you will simple have to bridge it with solder.

<br/>
<br/>
you only need to do the bottom half, and then solder over F1, its slightly above and to the left of the battery thing(on a ds phat)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
