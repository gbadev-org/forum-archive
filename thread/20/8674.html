I just found out about this, it's pretty cool.  It scans a DS game for sseq data (I'm assuming this is the sequence data to the songs that the standard sound format DS games seem to have uses) and rips them to a MIDI.  :)  Seems to work pretty well too, even if a few of the songs sound a bit odd in the transition. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by The 9th Sage on Wed Feb 22, 2006 5:20 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

First, to get your sseq files, you need to do the following

sseqrip -sseq &lt;nds files&gt;

Ah, I figured that was where it was probably getting the sseq files from.  I gathered there was some kind of a standard header from the other program included with it that gives info.  This is really interesting. :)  Every DS game I've looked at seems to have an sdat, but are all games 'locked' into using this format?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Probably so, given that Nintendo writes all the ARM7 binaries in official games. It's like asking why games for Windows have .wav files: because that's what Windows DirectSound knows how to play.

Examining some of the midi files converted from SSEQ2MID, it probably wouldn't be very easy to do..although possible. Remember that this tool was developed by someone from Japan, and to my knowledge, midi tools are much more popular that side of the world.
<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the format itself seems to be very midi-based, for the DS. It's strange how most of the drum layouts for say, Band Brothers or Lunar are perfect General MIDI matches. Whereas, Seiken Densetsu DS uses a highly customized instrumentation layout.
<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't be impossible, though. But, some channels have more than one note going on at a time in some games' music ripped..not something the IT format can handle. But if the notes were pushed to the next channel if multiple channels were detected, it could be done..
<br/>
<br/>
A little slightly off this current topic, does anyone know if the instrumentation format ripped by this tool can be converted to, say, WAV format? Or better yet: a Soundfont/Downloadable Sound format?<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

No it can't, New Note Actions are nothing more than sustain effects. It doesn't allow you to play more than one note in one channel unless you actually set up your envelopes to accomodate, and even then it won't be as versitile as MIDI. You can't start two separate notes at the same time in one channel.  You'd have to set up some form of structure in that groupings of mod channels would be dedicated to a certain set of MIDI channels.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
