    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I had boughten Super Mario Circuit Advance from Ebay for 15$, it works and all, but there are a few problems.
<br/>
Its saving doesn't work(it says it saves but it doesn't) and I'm playing an Australian game on my American DS. It even clearly states in the auction the publisher is Nintendo of America and It is NTSC(US, Canada)
<br/>
I also noticed it sticks out about 1 cm more that other GBA games....
<br/>
Well whatever, you know how there's a program called BootGBA I was wondering if you could make homebrew like that, that uses the dual screens, to also save the game of GBA.. 
<br/>
Thanks, MoD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There are a lot of Crazy Redds on eBay, selling counterfeit games. Have you opened the cartridge and looked inside? The authentic cartridge does not have a <a class="postlink" href="http://ap.nintendo.com/gba_mario_kart_sc.html" target="_blank">battery inside</a>.

Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS are not region locked. Region differences should matter only in multiplayer. For instance, multiplayer in the <span style="font-style: italic">Pokemon</span> games for GBA and <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing: Wild World</span> for DS doesn't work between Japanese versions of the game and Latin-alphabet versions.

That would require a hardware device that splits SLOT-2 into two: one for the Game Pak and one for the flash card that will receive the save.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Or you could just use pak-swapping. Alternatively, you could save to a SLOT-1 card.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

No. The commercial Game Paks expect <span style="font-style: italic">immediate</span> access to save memory.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright here goes 
<br/>
it's this one:

<br/>
well it's not right a cm but (-) like that much
<br/>
The box was also sketchy, no Rated E and no Nintendo sign under it.
<br/>
It's the same quality at the GBAMP CF and SD movie players box liek lamented or something...
<br/>
On both sides of MK there are tiny tears...
<br/>
Inside of the chip(not opened) you can see K 120(in regular one it says ?2001 Nintendo AGB-E03-10(well in my the sum of all fears game)), then looks like some s*** is glued on it to stick the cartridge.
<br/>
     Also comparing some cartridges the inside of MK is full exposed, at look on a regular GBA the front pins are covered by plastic crap, this one is is exposed like the GBAMP CF...
<br/>
The pins in a regular game are pure gold and in MK they are dull, the inside where it says ?2001 Nintendo AGB-E03-10 it is closed in, on MK there is a short rectangular hole in the center diameter. 
<br/>
LOL the sticker, at the top, has a cut on it making the sticker uneven to the rest too....
<br/>
<br/>
I'll post pictures in a few They suck though i'm using my phone...
<br/>
<br/>
The one on the right is the legit cartridge of The Sum of All Fears:

<br/>
Box that's shiny, WTH? Unlicensed products should only have those...?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oh, the aim is to save to a cart from within a game, not to extract a save from a game cart. In that case I suggest you get your money back from the seller (I know, it's a long shot) and buy a legitimate copy. This is perhaps the worst form of piracy, since the seller made a profit from someone else's work, and the buyer gets left with shody goods.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

<br/>
It's mail fraud to send counterfeit items in the mail and there are serious repercussions that could happen. We are going to try to get the cash back and that's it(yea right).My dad already sent something to ebay explaining them that he sent us counterfeit, we also e-mailed the guy before sending anything to ebay...We are just going to wait for a response...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
