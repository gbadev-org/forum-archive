Well the BIG problem isn't too bad. Just don't mention that specific issue. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to change MACs, but the MAC is stored right at the beginning of the firmware, which is also where the fail-safe code from flashme is stored. This is a very risky thing to flash. It is much safer and easier to spoof the DS's MAC on a laptop than to change the DS's MAC to match the laptop's.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As I understand it, isn't the MAC used as part of the seed to create the WFC ID?
<br/>
<br/>
If you changed the MAC, I imagine it would be then possible to "clone" WFC accounts, or just cause general havoc.

<br/>
But it seems the easiest way to get though captive portals would be to just use the DS Browser, whenever that gets out of Japan, anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
