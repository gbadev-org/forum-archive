    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
We're currently in the process of creating a Mario kart website at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ds-play.com" target="_blank">www.ds-play.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The site is currently only a week old, and thus there are a few bugs about but progress is swift. Features we have running so far are:
<br/>
<br/>
9 live chat rooms, to help organise games with friends, and banter with others after youve whipped their ass.
<br/>
Global friend search, offering option to add users to your buddy list.
<br/>
Point system, where by u can nominate a user a victory after a race (only if the user is on ur buddylist, and and u are on his).
<br/>
<br/>
upcoming features will include:
<br/>
<br/>
improved chat (less bugs!)
<br/>
a penalty system where you can report and flag users who quit races.
<br/>
<br/>
anyway please check it out and feel free to give opinions, suggestions and wotever else! :-p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
