The thing is I don't have proper(in this case, none at all) hardware to run my homebrews, and I'm making a Dance Dance Revolution clone for the DS... and so far I have the basic arrow engine, but now I'm at a stump because I need to implement sound...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, as long as you can drag between steps instead of having to release and touch again, I think you could do a pretty good DDR on the touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm somewhat of a Band Bros. fanatic though, which uses the buttons. I think it would probably be the most fun if the D-pad and A/B/X/Y do the same thing, sort of simulating having 2 feet. Then you can do combos, and use whichever hand is easiest for each note.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could add in L and R too if just 4 buttons isn't challenging enough when you're not playing with your feet :)<br/>_________________<br/>___________

The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

I haven't found one, but Ouendan is pretty easy to pick up and play without speaking japanese. Just look at the pictures and listen to the tunes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I can vouch for that. Ouendan is quite possibly the best rhythm-based game on the Nintendo DS, period. Band Brothers is pretty good as well, but the quality of the instrumentation is pretty bad. If it didn't sound like a crappy AWE64 soundbank then it'd be better.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

If you average the centre of an up and down jump, or a left and right jump, it will confuse the program, because if you noticed, the centre of BOTH those jumps are the same point.

HyperHacker's point was that if you press left+right, the game will see a press of left or right that quickly slides to the center. If two presses come in at exactly the same time, the game could give the player the benefit of the doubt: if more left/right arrows than up/down arrows are over the receptors, treat it as left+right; otherwise, treat it as up+down.

Given how Konami is suing Roxor Games for violating Konami's patents on arrow smashing games (see <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/dwi/Amended_Complaint.pdf" target="_blank">Amended Complaint</a>), is it wise to slavishly copy a Konami proprietary game play method?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
