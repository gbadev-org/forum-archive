    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've always wondered if it was, and with this little test, it prooves to be true, at least to me:
<br/>
<br/>
If you go into pictochat, and place your stylus pen on the screen to draw, and then press your finger on another point on the drawing part of the screen, depending on the pressure of your finger, you can move the line back and forth - press harder the line comes towards you, ease off and it moves toward the stylus pen.  That means the DS is pressure sensitive right? I mean, it's determining where to draw the line from the pressure of my finger, so It must be right? I never knew that, and I cant seem to find anything on it though, nor any games that use it.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm fairly sure that the DS is not pressure sensitive, if it was then the screen would get wrecked in no time.

Ah, that makes sense, so the more I press my finger....interesting - it could be used for that pupose though, it if works with a finger :P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The best thing to do is to stay away from Touch Sensitive Apps, The big N did whatever they could do to make the DS strong over the screen, the last thing you want to do is apply constant force on it... Have you seen the systems on display in stores???? they are mostly beat to shit.
<br/>
<br/>
It would also be dumb based on the average size of someones finger to Screen ratio you would be blocking alot of the screen, Stick to things with the Stylus or Nintendos Thumb Stylus.. This is all my opinion.<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I understand we still have an issue with the touch-coords jumping (someone in a post yesterday or the day before mentioned it at least),
<br/>
at least I experience that when I just barely touch the screen.
<br/>
<br/>
As far as I see when it jumps the touchZ1 and touchZ2 are 0.
<br/>
So I just check if these two are 0 when I get a KEY_TOUCH and if so, discard the read.
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this has already been mentioned other places, I'm kinda slow nowadays.
