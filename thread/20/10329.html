    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At least in the United States, the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson-Moss_Warranty_Act" target="_blank">Magnuson-Moss Warranty Improvement Act</a> prohibits Nintendo from voiding your warranty on the sole ground of using unlicensed products unless Nintendo can prove that the unlicensed product caused damage. But because you have left the Location: field in <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/profile.php?mode=editprofile" target="_blank">your profile</a> blank, I cannot guess under what jurisdiction you live.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
