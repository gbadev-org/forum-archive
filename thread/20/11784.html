Hm, I also seem to have found a bug in PHPBB. That "&amp;" in the title should be "&gt;_&gt;)".<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
This happened to me, I kept a copy of the driver on a disc, but for some reason it wasn't the correct one (It was the 64bit one)....

Is it a saved driver, or a fresh one?
<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully it is something simple like that...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by jas20 on Fri Nov 24, 2006 8:22 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
