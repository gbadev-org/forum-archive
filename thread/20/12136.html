But this project isnt overated!

Fantastic stuff and a very impressive number!

I only wish there was some easy way to download them from the DS itself.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's a way to do it, but it's not very easy.  Since DSLinux recently enabled the unzip command in the RAM builds, I thought it would be possible to download the .zip file directly from the Moonbooks website and unzip it, but it's apparently a compression type that DSLinux can't handle.  So a new plan was needed.
<br/>
<br/>
If the book you want is on a website like Project Gutenberg, then this is possible.  First download the wrapper.pl file linked to from the previous Moonbooks thread and save it to your media card somewhere.  In Retawq in DSLinux, browse to the .txt file itself.  Hit the "d" key to dump the page to your card's "/linux/home" folder with the filename you specify (in my examples it will be called romeo.txt).  Then type "perl wrapper.pl romeo.txt 40" to wrap it to 40 characters.  If you did not save wrapper.pl to your /linux/home directory, your command will need to reflect that.  For instance, if you're using a RAM build, the root directory of your card is at "/media/" so if it's on the root directory of your card, type "perl /media/wrapper.pl romeo.txt 40" etc.  Let it finish; it will take a while.  It will produce romeo.txt.wrap which Moonshell can't recognize, so rename it with the mv command:  "mv romeo.txt.wrap romeo_wrap.txt" for example.  If you want to move it to a different folder, use the mv command again (it works for both renaming and moving): "mv romeo_wrap.txt /media/books/romeo_wrap.txt" for example.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, it's difficult, but it's possible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I am in talks with a few people about ds based book reader development, it would be excellent to have a server people can connect to from within the program, and select what books they wish to download.<br/>_________________<br/>Brandon

Also, 1.6 finalfinalbeta1 supports dual screen viewing. I think it's just spanned vertically, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can understand him not wanting to change what DSOrganiser is about.
<br/>
But that Homebrew Database seems to already be 95% of the code needed for a book downloader.

Word wrap test build, pretty sure it needs finalfinalbeta1 to work.
<br/>
Also supports UTF-8, UTF-16 (little and big endian), and DOS/UNIX/MAC line endings. There's a little icon on the touch screen, press it. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
