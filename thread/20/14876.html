    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, as you may notice by my post count, I am indeed new to this forum.
<br/>
I have a Nintendo ds lite and an R4 and I've had then for a while now.
<br/>
<br/>
Lately I have been highly interested in "nds homebrews"
<br/>
<br/>
I have no coding experience - unfortunately, but I do have some ideas and can can get domains and all them sorta things.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
``
<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess you have been wondering what my ideas are?
<br/>
well basically, I've been searching everywhere to find pictochat in a rom file(cant find one) and I was going to edit it and change it with lots more features and a wifi feature. It would be called "DSupaChat" (possibly changed)
<br/>
<br/>
I know some of you have created one and possibly even thought about it.
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen a few around, maybe about 3 or 4. They all have problems.
<br/>
They all have something wrong with them. None of them seem to work perfectly.
<br/>
<br/>
````````````````````````````````
<br/>
<span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">My ideas and possible features:</span></span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Variety of text colours</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Custom chat room names</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Custom max no. of people in chat room</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Non WiFi &amp; WiFi feature</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Custom user names</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Updated keyboard</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Friend list</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Enemy list</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Block feature</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Voice chat to friends</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: blue">Download via ds download play (most likely not)</span>
<br/>
<br/>
````````````````````````````````
<br/>
The above are possible future features, the first release will be basic and them above features could be possibly coded in.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are good at coding and are interested please PM me or post back and I will reply ASAP.
<br/>
If I get some coders I will also need BETA testers, so if you want to BETA test, just PM me or post back.
<br/>
<br/>
If I get enough coders and it seems possible Ill make a blog page.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions/comments or anything at all, maybe you have a better idea? just PM me or post back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THANKS HEAPS!
