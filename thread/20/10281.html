    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd love to learn how to fix the GBASP's L+R buttons.  I've already opened it up and seen what's inside.  Nintendo's bogus suggestion of toothbrushing the buttons is worse than useless, since the problem area isn't the external buttons, but the contact switches that the buttons eventually press.  How do I fix the contact switches?  Someone told me that using Graphite from a pencil might work, but I don't know where or how I'd use that.

The problem happens for me even if the rubber is in the correct position.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have the EXACT same issue with my new DS lite.
<br/>
<br/>
My right shoulder button has to be pressed HARD for it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
But it's weird as some rare times, it works very well.
<br/>
<br/>
But 90% of the time, it has to be pressed so hard that it's useless.
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of opening it up also. Haven't had the time yet. =P</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
These problems are very easy to fix btw.<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes, there's a long thread about this issue on GBATemp.  It seems to affect the white DS Lite's...and mine has it too.  It's definitely markedly looser, I'm just trying to work up the courage to take it back to Game.
<br/>
<br/>
FWIW there were also a lot of reports of black DS Lite's being returned with dead pixels.  I can't usually afford to be an 'early adopter', and I'm starting to consider that as a blessing...
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:  To clarify, the thread I mentioned was more about how the R button is <span style="font-style: italic">looser</span>, rather than it needing to be pressed harder.  HTH.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
