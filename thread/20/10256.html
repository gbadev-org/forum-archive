Some of the builds for the devices capable of more...uh...memory efficiency actually do have a GUI.  For example, the Supercard build has this I think since they were able to load programs into the Supercard's built in memory and run them from there, freeing up main RAM for other stuff.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also, Frotz is wonderful. (I can't really play adventure games on a PC when I'm surrounded by pretty GUIs, so the DS is a good platform to do it with).

Or just update your firmware. I have a WRT54Gv5 and I have never had any problems that couldn't be solved by updating the firmware, and this includes Nintendo Wi-Fi.

<br/>
Linksys decided, in a move of shear genius, that their router version 5 was going to stop using a Linux-based firmware.
<br/>
Not only did they switch to a horrible closed firmware, but they also crippled the thing's hardware so that, even after someone hacks it, there's no room to do anything with it.
<br/>
The problem here is that the only reason their original routers became so popular as mainstream routers is because people could write new firmwares for them, effectively turning an $80 router into the equivalent of a $200 router. (Firmware makes quite a difference here).
<br/>
They did release a Linux version for about $10 more, but, since the VXWorks version is produced in greater quantity and costs $10 less, it is troublesome to find it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Kvasir!
<br/>
I'll see if there's a new firmware version out.
<br/>
May I ask what other settings you have on yours?
<br/>
<br/>
Freeman:
<br/>
I was thinking about the VXWorks Killer when it came out, but the only thing that runs on there at the moment, due to RAM and space constraints, lacks UPNP.
<br/>
I hear it's a lot more stable, though. (This VXWorks firmware is noticeably unstable; I am constantly having to restart the router!).
<br/>
Sounds like a build with uPnP is in the works, so I will check back later.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I decided to backup and restore factory defaults.

So I did that, it worked flawlessly, then I put in the old settings to work backwards... and it worked from the start.

So I guess the firmware upgrade helped, but it needed to be shaken around a little.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

APPLICATIONS AND GAMING
<br/>
(No ports are currently being forwarded to my DS nor is it DMZ enabled. I'm currently not using my DS to play Wi-Fi games but it is able to go online with retawq in DSLinux and via the Homebrew Database in DSOrganize)
<br/>
<br/>
ADMINISTRATION AND STATUS
<br/>
(Nothing DS centric here)
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
My DS has a static IP given to it of 192.168.1.109 and the DNS entries provided by the status tab, Subnet Mask, and Gateway (see Local IP Address above) are entered manually as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
With this set up I am able to get a working wi-fi connection.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I took some liberties in the security of my network, such as:
<br/>
<br/>
DHCP - Need it for other family members ("WHY CAN'T I ACCESS THE INTERNET!?", etc.)
<br/>
Wireless Network Mode - have 802.11b adapters still being used
<br/>
Wireless SSID broadcast - again, family members ("WHY CAN'T I CONNECT?!", "WHERE IS THE ROUTER ON THIS LIST?!", etc.)
<br/>
Wireless MAC Filtering - one of the 802.11b adapters doesn't play nice with it (Netgear MA101)
<br/>
<br/>
So you don't really need to emulate what I've done in regards to the above :P (And yes I have a very strong firewall set up for the whole network in regards to the Security section of the setup).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The trick (as far as I know) is to force load the page as html. Most web-board stuff is PHP, so this is essential.
<br/>
<br/>
So when you put your user/pass in and hit login, and then get sent to a page where you get the error, force it to load the page as HTML (I think the key is capital H), and then it 'r' to reload the page. That's how I did it on numerous forums.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Not getting very far due to RAM limits, but I think there is a history memory option somewhere that I could change.

It was a beautifully clean crash, though. The DSLinux developers have really improved that with the recent builds; All the out of memory crashes are cleanly killing the running process without any restart required.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wish *I* could post a message from my DS. :(
<br/>
<br/>
My DS works just fine across the 'net within games and I can play against other people (with Tetris DS for example).
<br/>
<br/>
Using DS2Key (doubles as a WiFi sniffer, etc) I can ping other Internet addresses, no problem.
<br/>
<br/>
However, using DSLinux *with the exact same settings as used by the software mentioned above* it simply won't ping anything *other than* the router (a revision 1 Linksys WAG54G).
<br/>
<br/>
This has me puzzled as the DNS is correct and it's using the stored WiFi settings (although entering the settings manually makes no difference).
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else come across this particular problem before? It's driving me nuts.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I hate to keep replying to my own messages, but what the heck ....... :)
<br/>
<br/>
Just found something interesting - from DSLinux, if I ping, say, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com</a> then I get the "no response from" error, however I've noticed that with addresses that have aliases (such as microsoft.com) the error refers to the alias, in this case lb1.www.ms.akadns.net
<br/>
<br/>
This says to me that DNS *IS* working correctly (after all, it's resolved microsoft.com to its alias, something which isn't stored on the DS - or could it be stored on the router???), but if so then something is blocking the return confirmation of the ping (or somesuch).
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone agree?
<br/>
<br/>
If so, then why does ping work fine in DS2Key and WiFi games connect okay?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sounds like your router itself has some settings that won't let your DS access the Internet, but that wouldn't make sense.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried pinging IPs, instead of domain names?
<br/>
(eg: Google is 66.102.7.99)
<br/>
<br/>
Are you using a static IP or DHCP?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Thanks for the suggestion but I've done that and no luck. :(

The fact that it's resolving any aliases from the pinged address indicates that the DNS is working, but only up to a point - for some reason something is then being 'lost'/not reaching my DS, but only when running DSLinux (I've now tried DSOrganize and that works perfectly too).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

How are you configuring your wireless in there at the moment?
<br/>
<br/>
There is a variable you can add to the rc.conf file which will get it to use your NWFC settings to connect.
<br/>
That variable is wfc_config, which you can set = to whichever slot has the configuration you wish to use.
<br/>
If that is what you are doing, try setting it manually. (I, for one, was inexplicably unable to connect with that).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!
