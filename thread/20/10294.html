    <h4>#91799 - agentq - Sun Jul 09, 2006 8:01 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ScummVM DS is now officially part of the ScummVM project, and I am the official port maintainer.  This means that the DS port is in the subversion repository along with the other ports, and everyone who checks out the source code will get my port along with it.
<br/>
<br/>
It also means that the DS version will be released alongside the other ScummVM versions, from the next version onward, and will be downloadable from the official ScummVM site, and on Sourceforge too.  Also, bugs and feature requests in the DS port can be reported on the ScummVM bug tracker, and the port will get it's own forum too, where I will be able to support users who have problems.
<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't mean that ScummVM DS will suddenly support every game, or that all the bugs will disappear.  In fact, the version in SVN has one less feature than my released 0.61 build, namely that you can't delete saves anymore.  This is going to be added in a general fashion for all games, so I will implement that when it comes along.  It's still just me working on the port, but if other people break the DS version, they will have some reason to fix it, while they didn't when it was unofficial.  So that will make it easier for me.  All in all, it's a pretty good thing.

If ever it will be supported, perhaps with SLOT-1 flashcard and the Opera memory expansion, it would hardly be playable, since you wouldn't see anything on the little screen.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.uglyhorst.de/blog/nerdpunk/" target="_blank">visit my blog. please.</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I meant was that I thought ScummVM DS was a stripped-down port removing some things that weren't applicable to the DS so that it could all fit and run on it? Is that true? And does agentq still have the option to cut things out to better optimize it for the DS? Or for that matter, can he add things so that it functions better on the DS, but maybe not on other versions?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, will new versions only be available with ScummVM releases and only from the official site? Or will ScummVM DS continue to be updated on its own and then bundled with the official version releases? Or will updates to ScummVM DS result in new official version releases? And will all discussion on new versions now be held at the official ScummVM forum instead of here (I suppose that makes sense)? I also suppose that's where all announcements of new updates will be as well?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I just want to know exactly how everything will change (hopefully for the better, it sounds like). Thanks!<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

any true scumm fan knows what MI stands for ._. (monkey island). I doubt the scummvm developers will demand things not needed to be added back in, as they have no reason. ScummVM is open source and 'free'</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
