    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got this strange problem in DS Heretic. As soon as I touch the bottom screen (stylus/hand, doesn't matter), the view on the top screen moves left to right in a random, shaky manner. It's not much, only 10-20 pixels left and right, but it does make playing the game rather tricky. Now, it's not like I haven't got a firm hand, it still does this when my hand is perfectly still on the screen.
<br/>
Rcelibrating doesn't help, and I haven't had this problem with any other game (homebrew or commercial).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hexen too? Interesting. I was having that issue at first, so I added a threshold of a few pixels that it would ignore and it felt fine. Must be another one of those per-unit-touchscreen-specific things.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nope. It did feel a bit unresponsive, but I wasn't sure if that was due to low framerates, or me having to move the stylus more than I should.

I'd hate to get another DS, as mine's quite modded, and neither my friends or neighbours (other 3 tested DSes) are not going to want to trade...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Prodigital on Tue Aug 23, 2005 7:14 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

But i only just got the chance to try out Heretic v0.2, and the problems are gone !!

Perhaps you forgot to save the control treshold settings in DSHexen, MrAdults ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's just a hardcoded tolerance, not a setting. I imagine it would feel less responsive for those that have it working fine now if the tolerance was just raised. The correct-ish solution is probably a menu slider for the option, unless someone has a surefire method to keep it from happening on all systems without sacrificing response to smaller movements.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's not unresponsive, just moves automatically (not over sensitive either, i can control it normally, but with shaking).

I fidn it really strange, happens on my DS alone, and now fixed with a new version ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
