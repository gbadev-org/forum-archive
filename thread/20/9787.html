I'm no expert, but it looks like the source was written for Windows and GBA, with the Windows version having some networking (read: internet) functionality included.  The code could probably be slimmed down a bit just by cutting out all of the Windows-related code.  This seems like it could be fun to tool around with.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The original version supports up to 8 players, computer controlled, or human.  I think any more than that and games could go on for hours, har.  Although it is one of my all time favourite games, there was one thing I didn't like about it, even though it couldn't be avoided...  When playing against friends you would have to hide which keys you were pressing when asked "Illusion y/n ?", otherwise they would easily know which of your monsters were fakes and dispell them.  The idea of playing against friends on seperate DS's, in the same room, or half way across the world is awesome.

<br/>
<br/>
OK, I downloaded Quirky's source for Chaos Advance and set about getting it to compile on the DS. I've got a version that runs on the DS in the loosest sense of the word. There's quite a bit I still need to do but it's recognisable. :)

This is my first go at writing code for the DS, so bear with me. Hopefully have something demonstrable soon.

Yes, I'd like to use the touch screen for selecting things and maybe a virtual keyboard so you can enter wizards names as well. This should be do-able. No idea about implementing wireless multiplayer - the Windows version has code to do this but I don't know if the equivalent functions exist on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking to get the ChaosAdvance code running as well on the DS as it currently does on the GBA before adding the new stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
@spacepirate
<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, I took out all the GBA specific calls and wrote replacement routines that used the DS equivalents. I had to adopt the standard libnds makefile to build the ChaosAdvance source and link in the .pcx files for the graphics. It was a bit of a nightmare but I got there in the end. PM me if you need the gory details.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, I've put together a fairly stable version of my port of Quirky's Chaos Advance. Tested with Dualis and (eventually....) on an actual DS - only tried with an M3SD. Had to use START to run it from the M3 menu.
<br/>
<br/>
You can find it at <a class="postlink" href="http://home.clara.net/adamhodson/chaosds.zip" target="_blank">http://home.clara.net/adamhodson/chaosds.zip</a> .
<br/>
<br/>
Issues:
<br/>
<br/>
There may be a couple of graphical glitches - magic fire doesn't seem to be drawn or updated in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the sounds don't seem to play either.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of text in the game is drawn with a default colour of white, rather than the real colour. Let me know if you spot any of these.
<br/>
<br/>
Options dialog hasn't been fully tested or implemented yet.
<br/>
<br/>
That said though, the bigger screen on the DS means you don't need to scroll the board around anymore. :)
<br/>
<br/>

Besides the things you pointed out I noticed that the attack/death sequences are not quite working, much like the fire.  Awesome work, keep it up !

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Updated version at <a class="postlink" href="http://home.clara.net/adamhodson/chaosds-250606.zip" target="_blank">http://home.clara.net/adamhodson/chaosds-250606.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
New:
<br/>
<ul>- Implemented spell casting/fire/weapon drawing. Colours not right yet though.
<br/>
- Use touch screen to:
<br/>
<ul>- move cursor in examine board
<br/>
- move cursor / select creatures in game
<br/>
			- highlight/select spells
<br/>
			- select options in the game menu
<br/>
			- OK messages
<br/>
			- Enter your name on player screen.</ul>
<br/>
- Fixed some more text colours.
<br/>
- Fixed Magic Knife graphic.
<br/>
- Options screen shouldn't crash DS anymore.
<br/>
- Fixed entering text for wizard's name.
<br/>
- Fixed missing sounds.
<br/>
- You can now change the wizard colour in the player screen.
<br/>
- Current wizard selection wasn't shown on player screen.
<br/>
</ul>
<br/>
Still broken:
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
- Sleep mode option doesn't work.
<br/>
- Some text still not drawn in the correct colour - text drawn in white by default.
<br/>
- Wizard death routine.
<br/>
- End game / game drawn messages.</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Touch screen is a bit flakey still - runs fine on the emulator but behaves differently on the DS. To highlight a spell / move the cursor just tap the stylus To select a spell or select the content of the cursor, hold the stylus down.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In the spell select menu there is a bug with the text on the right side.

<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a couple of spells missing, but i'm not sure if they were in the GBA version.  I've played a lot and noticed 'gooey blob' or 'magic woods'  haven't shown up in my spell list.  I don't know how the game randomizes the spell lists, maybe i just haven't come across them yet.  Do you know if they are in there ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I fixed that bug in the spell select screen. Forgot to check the d-pad controls still worked once I'd implemented spell selection via the touchscreen. As for the missing spells, well I have seen shadow wood, magic woods, magic fire and gooey blob on my travels. I'll check the random number code.

New:
<br/>
<br/>
- Up / down / right d-pad buttons now do the right thing in the spell select menu.
<br/>
- Fixed some more text colours.

		- works in player select screen</ul>

- Fixed end game colour cycling.

It implements everything from the GBA version, plus adds touch screen controls. Look out for a new version soon (or compile the svn code if you're impatient ;)) which makes use of both screens, adds a few new-old spells (new in the sense that they were not there before, old in the sense that they are the infamous unimplemented spells from Speccy Chaos) and "improves" the touch screen controls, adding another mode that requires less touches.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
