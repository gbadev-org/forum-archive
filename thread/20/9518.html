<br/>
<br/>
My friend bought his SuperPass2 recently, but he didn't receive the reprogrammer, because he didn't order it. Now, I'm collecting the money for DS Lite &amp; I'd like to use the SuperPass2, but I can't reprogramm it. Is there a way to do it with my old DS (it's possible with PassKey &amp; M3 using a DS in the NDS mode, as far as I know), 'cause I couldn't find any applications to do that. I'd even love a simple non-interactive application that could do that. Or is it harder than I though?
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for my explanations being so bad.
