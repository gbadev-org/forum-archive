    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most DS games uses the upper screen. My upper screen is like yellow, not white bright light. 
<br/>
That is not a problem since it saves my eyes more than looking on bright white light screen. 
<br/>
<br/>
Look at this picture: <a href="http://www.w2k.co.uk/junk/UPLOAD/STUFF/ds_yellow_vs_white.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.w2k.co.uk/junk/UPLOAD/STUFF/ds_yellow_vs_white.jpg</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I assume the lower screen is from a second producion line product (very bright one) and the upper one is from the first producion line (yellow brighness light).
<br/>
<br/>
Btw. This is my second DS (the first one has dead pixels) and that one had bright upper screen and yellow lighted lower screen.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

"The thing I noticed was that on the blue DS it seems like there's interlacing being done. On moving screens on the blue one there are horizontal stripes (quite annoying, once you've played on a silver DS). "
<br/>
<br/>
I can't quite see how your topic was describing the same problems. This topic is for the light of the screen being more yellow than white.
<br/>
<br/>
I can't see any horizontal stripes when moving my DS (I also tried fast movement). Also tried to see them using my digital camera and it's video recording mode, but can't see any.
<br/>
Can you give me some advice how to see if I have that interlacing kind interference? *off-topic*
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Tried again with Mario Kart -game. I can see little horizontal interference in both of the screens in Mario Kart menus when moving slowly my DS vertically. If that was the thing you meant?<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

I would agree with this to a certain extent although the lower screen appears to be brighter on mine. It's very difficult to tell how much of this is illusion due to viewing angles and perceived contrast with the surround.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">for one, you can not judge the screens from angles. as seen in the picture.
<br/>
<br/>
the bottom screen <span style="text-decoration: underline">Will</span> look different because of the touch screen layer.
<br/>
<br/>
but one thing that seems to be true is, the new blue DS is not as bright as the silver, and there is some sort of flicker on the Blue DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I own both and get kinda bugged about the blue one since it is the newer one.
<br/>
<br/>
maybe nintendo decided to go with a different LCD manufacturer.<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No quite true. My earlier DS had white bright screen on top, not the lower one. I also looked them in all different angles with no difference in the back light brightness. Maybe you missunderstood my point? *I also take many digital photos to be sure that I was not hallusinating.*

** GBA Afterburner vs. GBA SP **
<br/>
One compair. I have a GBA (Afterburner modded) and a GBA SP (frontlighted by Nintendo). What I can see, the GBA SP does have brighter ligh than my old GBA (Afterburner is set to max brightness). I believe many of you can agree.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

<br/>
I seriously believe that yellowish one is the earlier manufactured one... or it might be that they are from different manufacturer. 
<br/>
My DS is silver. I bought it as new but I think it's one of those units which have had dead pixels -&gt; replaced one faulty LCD screen -&gt; repacked -&gt; restocked.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">
