    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyways it's pretty late here and I need to sleep but I've been looking at a way to view pdf files on the ds, yes yes I know there's no pdf viewer and probably won't be. So what I've been trying to do is convert pdf to xhtml for dslibris which is my ds reader of choice. Anyways I've found this which can convert pdf to rtf <a href="http://www.hellopdf.com/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.hellopdf.com/index.php</a> and i've found several programs which can convert pdf to xhtml but none of them are free, so just wondering what you all do for viewing pdf files, besides converting to txt which just sucks (and all the txt viewers i've seen have had some sort of fairly major problems (bookmarks not saving, ?'s replacing characters, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, so if someone could help me find a free way to convert rtf to xhtml that'd be awesome. Sorry if this is the wrong place, but wasn't sure exactly where this fit anywhere.

<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the position where I have a 250 page e-book in PDF format. it has lots of illustrations and I'd like to keep the visual format of the book intact. 
<br/>
<br/>
my first thought was PDF to JPEG then CBDS, but every single freeware converter I found would leave a watermark across the page in some way along the lines of "freeware version - purchase full copy to remove watermark"
<br/>
<br/>
oi vae...
<br/>
<br/>
so here I am. I have, actually, 3 or so other books I'd love to convert as well. mostly strategy guides for games on 360 or ps2 that I'd like to be able to view on my DS as I play.

umm... look at my previous post please? free one that's supposed to be very good, but I haven't tested it.. As far as using the Comic book reader? it's EXCELLENT for what it does, but if all you want to read is the text, then yes, CBDS is a bit much (esp. the file size).

Is there any reason you're stuck to using .xhtml? Granted it's the format of <a class="postlink" href="http://rhaleblian.wordpress.com/dslibris-an-ebook-reader-for-the-nintendo-ds/" target="_blank">DSLibris</a>, but there are a few other readers available. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=68172" target="_blank">DSReader</a> is an EXCELLENT txt reader, that only lacks rotated reading support. <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=12810&amp;highlight=readmore" target="_blank">ReadMore Alpha</a> is an excellent alternative to DSLibris that just views txt files (unless you're one of the rare few that has the unfortunate topscreen off bug).
<br/>
<br/>
In the case you can use any of the many .txt viewers, there is at least one good .pdf to .txt programs out there. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.download.com/Easy-PDF-to-Text-Converter/3000-2079_4-10349873.html?tag=lst-4&amp;cdlPid=10349874" target="_blank">PDF to Text</a>. (don't go to the publisher's website, as their link is faulty and sends you the Free PDF to Word Doc converter - also a good tool, but not for this purpose).
<br/>
<br/>
Wonderfully, PDF to Text Converter converts .pdf files into .txt files very quickly and can do any number of pdf files you have in a folder. It unfortunately, however, creates a .txt document for every page. It also only loads and saves from a single folder, so it has some limitations, and the quantity of files IN that folder can become somewhat daunting. This is easily fixed, however, with a pretty basic Command Prompt .bat file.
<br/>
<br/>
Create a Combine.bat file and copy and paste this code into it and save it.
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">FOR %%1 in (NameOfFile.txtNameOfFile_PG_????.txt) do type %%1 &gt;&gt; NameOfFile.txt</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Change all instances of "NameOfFile" to the name of the ebook file you wish to combine (without the .txt extension).
<br/>
<br/>
Now, given a bit more time and impetus, I can create a few .bat files to automate this process so much more nicely. I'm already hashing out some code for the PDF to .JPG converter as I have some ebooks with a LOT of pictures in them I'd rather be able to see in their original style.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

I don't absolutely need the rotated screen orientation, I just prefer it, much more comfortable for me to hold the ds in that position for long periods of time. Yeah by bookmark I mostly just mean continuing where I left off in the text file.

That would be really great if you could make something like that, I could probably even offer a little bit of money (not much, but better than nothing :P)

I'd be willing to work on making one, as part of my "cwik" project. How strongly do you require rotated screen orientation? And by "bookmarks" do you mean one bookmark per .txt file, or something more general?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Moonshell.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally use Paperless Printer for converting PDF to JPEG.  Simply open the PDF file, do File - Print, choose Paperless Printer, and then choose JPEG from the screen that pops up.  No watermark, and it works well.  From there you can convert to ComicBookDS format.
<br/>
<br/>
I know the latest version of the PicToDS converter for ComicBookDS has a menu option to go straight from PDF to CBDS format, but I never understood exactly how to get it to work.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want just plain text, I got rid of the "?" characters in Moonshell and DSReader by opening the text file in Wordpad and saving under a different encoding.  I believe I saved it as "Text Document - MS-DOS format" after which point it worked fine.  Note that DSReader's bookmarks only work if the filename has no spaces.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
