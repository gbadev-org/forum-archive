    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember playing that as a real young kid, its graphics and engine seems something that would belong in the DS. Its very fun to  screw around with too.
<br/>
<br/>
I remember (From in the credits a creature saying it )Sierra publishes it, contact em, and see what happens
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Theres a mobile version and a Commodore 64 version, a rom could be found and played on Geos if really wanted.<br/>_________________<br/>laos,
