I used the most recent libnds, but it uses a custom ARM7 code (taken from one of Chris Double's examples) to have more control over the PSGs. Is it possible to use the newer touch code while still customizing the ARM7?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I had a touch screen problem with the old version, and I'm having the same problem with the new version. If I touch the stylus in the upper right corner of the screen it registers the touch a little lower and to the left. The same goes for the other three corners. The only place on the touch screen that provides an accurate result is the center of the screen. So if I touch the center and then move the stylus to the left, the dot on the screen will follow, but it doesn't go as fast as I'm moving the stylus, so it can't ever reach the edge...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In the examples folder that came with devkitpro (you did install the examples, didn't you?) there should be a template that allows you to customise the ARM7 side, with the newest ARM7 touch code. But then again, I still haven't upgraded to r18 yet, so it may still be the old template.

This seems to be true of all cases.  Anything using the old touch screen code will not properly use the calibration values, and as a result, if the DS screen responds wierdly before calibration, it will still respond wierdly after that calibration.   THe new touch screen code is not affected by this issue, and will work correctly after calibration.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But what I found out: it may help us to locate the touch issues that are still persisting. I don't know really if the random presses that sometimes occur while lifting the stylus are software or hardware issues, but they seem to occur while you only press the screen lightly, so not only after removing, but also if moving with light pressure. I tried to move the stylus over the screen with only a very light pressure and moving speed, and there where all random presses, but these presses followed some kind of rule, they were all aligned as a line (with a random difference from the line) that went from the real touch point 1.5 inches or so left-down. I don't know if someone had already found out this while trying with the touch thing (actually i cannot imagine no one has), but I just said it now.

That's because it was made on an ancient version of libnds. The layout of the ARM7/ARM9 shared memory changes from version to version. In fact, wintermute has hinted that the shared memory might even disappear entirely in a future version in favor of a completely FIFO-based solution.
<br/>
<br/>
What you could do is try taking RAC or memtestARM and turning it back into AXE.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

It would take exactly one line of code change to do this (comment out the call to runSound()), but the problem is that AXE is coded against a years-old version of libnds from back when it was still using IPC transfers, and when I try to compile it against the version of libnds on devkitPro Updater, I get a bunch of errors related to TransferRegion. I know exactly what is happening, but I've been out of the DS scene for years, so I don't know the official new way to play sounds.

<br/>
whether by T, you, me or others. but this program is to good to not develop further.
<br/>
 at the minimum we need a new version with the ability to turn on and off the backing track.
<br/>
<br/>
here is the link to the last version, plus source.
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/AXE_0.03.zip" target="_blank">http://www.pineight.com/ds/AXE_0.03.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Update axe to allow for easy coding updates and ability to still work on DS along with other newer mediums, create a new logo/splash screen for top screen, create/edit logo so it doesn't show homebrew logo. Add a player/save/song load ability, add ability to not play background loop, ability too change background loop, and samples to draw with, change scales, tempo, add a record ability of what you are writing, Add microphone record option so you can record your voice, and then instantly draw with it. If these things can be done it will be the sickest program ever. I am in the process of learning what I can to make this happen, but will need help along the way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
these homebrews have a lot of the code we will need.
