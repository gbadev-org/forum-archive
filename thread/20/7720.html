<br/>
<br/>
</li><li> Write articles about tricky technical details, for example the WMB protocol!
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</li><li> Extend pages, fix errors, correct spelling mistakes, ...
<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Anyone is welcome to get an account on the NDSTech wiki as well (everyone who has ever asked has one).  I set up the password protection to prevent poker / viakra / etc... blog spam, not to limit who can contribute (although the qualification stands that the information can't come from any illegal sources).
<br/>

Since I didn't have mysql hosting at the time, I was limited in my choices of wiki packages, and the one I've chosen doesn't have a registration system, or I would have provided a link to create an account.
<br/>
<br/>
You're wecome to have your own wiki, sounds great.  I'm just letting you know that the NDSTech wiki isn't a closed resource.<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

Then it might be a good idea to set up a simple account application form that e-mails you the contents. Then you can check your e-mail, review the applications, and set up accounts for the ones that look legitimate.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

But it's only dedicated to technical infos. The DSWiki has general stuff, tutorials etc. It isn't a secound NDSTech wiki, it tries to provide, whats not on your wiki. So far we have no problem with the possibility for everyone to edit the content.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
