<br/>
<br/>
Say I find a typo in nds-lib. I haven't tested whether it still works as I haven't started devving for the NDS yet but I'm assuming it's just a typo. 
<br/>
<br/>
Probably it's already known, and there is a general place where such things are gathered awaiting to be fixed. Where can I find whether or not it is already in the fix-list?

ps. It's about the PaletteYype in pcx.h</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
