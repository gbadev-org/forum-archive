But for a pdf reader, it's very difficult, because the ds has only 4 mo of ram !<br/>_________________<br/>Soon Blubb in 3D !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

doesnt moonshell support animated gifs too?
<br/>
<br/>
also, pdf is too complex and too large for the 4mb ram and slow cpu.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

In dsorganize, it's sometime slow, but all the frames are there !<br/>_________________<br/>Soon Blubb in 3D !</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmmmm, the memory barrier can be gotten around. The CPU issue would be more of a problem...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure some work could be done though. I mean, it's not as though a DS PDF reader needs all the whistles-and-bells of Acrobat Pro or anything...
<br/>
<br/>
For example, a PDF reader w/o image support and with a fixed resolution might work. (By fixed resolution I mean that one would use a DS Opera style of document navigation)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Txt is good enough for a book. (and much smaller)
<br/>
<br/>
Game manuals, I guess...I never use manuals much though.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What exactly would be the problem with the CPU?
<br/>
Is it too slow to decode/format a PDF file for proper screenreading?
<br/>
<br/>
Foxit Reader is a small freeware viewer and it's even smaller for mobile devices. But I don't think it's open source, but a nice example of a smaller pdf viewer.
<br/>
<br/>
Another one is Xpdf and the source can be downloaded.
<br/>
<br/>
But I've no experience in DS coding nor in coding pdf applications, so I wouldn't know what problems could arise.
<br/>
<br/>
But displaying one page at the time should be possible, I think.<br/>_________________<br/>It seems this wasn't lost after all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
