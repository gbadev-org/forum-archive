In Nintendo Power (my brother has a subscription) they showed DSes hooked up to some sort of blue box, with the image being displayed on big TVs. It looked like there was just a camera pointed at them though. Dunno what the box was for.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They probably just connect converters to the LCD connectors inside the DS. That's how I would do it, at least, if a commercial VGA mod was to be developed...<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.natrium42.com" target="_blank">www.natrium42.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure about those DS units in the Nintendo Store, but the only DS I have ever seen hooked up to a TV didn't even have a cartridge in it.  There was just a bundle of wires going from the IS-NITRO-CAPTURE unit into the DS (through a hole cut in the back).  I saw that the cartridge itself was in the IS-NITRO-CAPTURE unit.  I wanted to get some photos of the back of the DS, but the Nintendo rep wouldn't let me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At Festival Arcadia, there were a few DS units connected to monitors. I don't know what nits they are but they were definately DS's..probably souped upped ones with some kind of video relay coming out of the system through a port on the top.
<br/>
<br/>
Would be nice to get my hands on one of those. Not gonna happen, though.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Or is there not enough bandwidth on the DS Game Card port for this?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
