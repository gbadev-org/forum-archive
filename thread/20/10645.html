    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to say that I will no longer post on this forum as my company recently got approved to develop on the Nintendo DS platform and Nintendo's NDA doesn't allow any publication of confidential information.
<br/>
<br/>
I am writing this post mainly to keep a written proof that everythnig I've discussed on this board was done prior to receive any materials form Nintendo.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to say thank you to everyone who answered my questions in the last few months!
<br/>
<br/>
Farewell,
<br/>
Ben.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Then don't discuss anything confidential.
<br/>
As crossraleigh said, several forum members are Nintnedo Devs, but they don't disclose anything, and can still help with homwbrew or just enjoy the chat on the board.
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the development work anyway, whether you stay around or not.<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i agree you can still enjoy and dont need to post confidential information and heck if you did  want to break a nda signup for a new account and dont use real name or anything
<br/>
but that should not be an issue if you dont plan on leaking information</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can understand why he is worried about NDAs and all. Better safe than sorry. If he posts something that can be interpreted by a LAWYER as a breach of the NDA, he would have to hire a LAWYER to fight.
<br/>
 However you could post some definitely not NDA violating things like say the wifi lib and PAlib. Maybe you cannot discuss anything related to the hardware other than what has already been posted on the internet (ARM7, ARM9 processors, TI supplying the input modules etc;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Homebrew != official (game) development. NDA's can't restrict freetime activities using software not falling under NDA, like devkitPro. I know lot of game dev's around here who are hacking their portables all the time. In fact I hope to see some neat portable stuff released this weekend at <a class="postlink" href="http://www.assembly.org/" target="_blank">Assembly</a>...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

They can if they're <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iunctim" target="_blank">part of the same contract</a> as a <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause" target="_blank">non-compete agreement</a>.
