<br/>
The M3 has two loading methods. The A button, which loads as a "game", and the "start" button which loads as a "demo".
<br/>
<br/>
Now..
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone explain what's the difference between the two? Why say, a homebrewn demo will not work if loaded as a game, and why a game will not work if loaded like a demo?<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">demo is always smaller than 4mb. so it can be loaded in the DS ram(max 4mb). you also dont have to convert roms with the gm, because it has a special bootformat allready. if you use the gamemanager, the demo wont work. real games have to be converted with the gm and start with A, because
<br/>
1. they (nearly) always bigger than 4mb
<br/>
2. you can choose between normal(load in m3 ram before boot) and fastboot(dma 1x/4x)
<br/>
3. special boot code is added with the gm to let it boot on m3 with A(uses other read "code")

[START] fixes a lot of homebrew too.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Pressing Start prepends an NDS loader (turns a *.nds into a *.nds.gba).
<br/>
Pressing A doesn't.
<br/>
<br/>
Recent *.nds homebrew has a built in loader, so it doesn't matter which you press.
<br/>
With *.nds.gba homebrew you need to press A.
<br/>
With old *.nds homebrew and captured Wifi demos, you need to press Start.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

So why didn't they just key it off the file name suffix?

Maybe you didn't notice, but my post deliberately only mentioned homebrew.
<br/>
M3 patched ROMS have a .nds extension, but won't work if you add a loader.
<br/>
They should have used the file name suffix, but they put the wrong suffix on their warez.
<br/>
<br/>
The M3 situation is slightly saner than supercard where only files with a loader will work, but all nds homebrew has to be named *.nds</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
