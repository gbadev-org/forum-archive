    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It can be due to the firmware. I recommend you another firmware, TripleBOOT Sakura-Real-iTouch. It's compilation of three firmwares from other G6lite based cards (M3Real, M3Sakura and iTouch, they are completely same, except for the firmware, of course :)). Instructions and download here:

I am maximaly satisfied with this system, Sakura has finnaly completely funcionable and bug-free  .DPG movie player, it has integrated music/text/picture wiever (if you want towiev .jpg, then the picture must be non-progressive, like is  it in moonshell and other similiar apps). Sakura can also launch official GBA and NDS games, and homebrew works fine too, but there are few bugs. But....what you won't launch with Sakura, you'll launch with M3 Real....what you won't launch with M3Real, you will launch it with DSOrganize :) (There is a launch bug in sakura, you must run DSO throught M3real). Skinning is also great, no folders or something like that. All skins are in the .skn format, so you can have how many skins you want :) As I said, I recommend, no, I order to everybody who has M3Real/iTouch/Sakura card to download this firmware :)
<br/>
<br/>
(+)
<br/>
-Great, almost perfect, integrated media player
<br/>
-A lot better homebrew launching kernel
<br/>
-Fully automatic AutoDLDI patching
<br/>
-skinning
<br/>
-Very user friendly
<br/>
-Great stability (I use Sakura about 1 month and i didn't have any freeze!)
<br/>
<br/>
(-)
<br/>
-Some homebrew can't be launched (DSOrganize,etc...launch these things with M3Real or iTouch or DSO ^^)
<br/>
-Missing/not working soft reset (Why? It's cool and not-very-hard-to-make feature :))
<br/>
-Size of firmware (Packed about 20 MB, Unpacked about 90MB =O  )
<br/>
<br/>
Try the firmware, read the manual/FAQ and i think you'll likesakura/m3real a lot :)<br/>_________________<br/>Red dwarf and Futurama Fan!!!!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">sakura's firmware isn't 90 MB, that's the trippleboot firmware. each of the 3 firmwares is ~30MB each, thus equating to around 90..
<br/>
<br/>
the trippleboot is a fatty firmware, though, altogether. it still takes up almost no room on an 8 gig card, leaving a plethora of space for movies and comics and all your other larger files. (those two file types seem to be the bulk of my consumed space)
<br/>
<br/>
once sakura is a little better off with it's homebrew compatibility, using the trippleboot won't be necessary, whereupon it'll all be slimmed down.
<br/>
<br/>
itouch firmware is boring and unintuitive. it's like a regurgitated version of m3 real.
<br/>
<br/>
m3 real firmware can suck it. bleh..<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
