    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Today, 3/5/06, My DS's volume is <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">NO</span></span> longer working.
<br/>
<br/>
I am so scared and I dunno what to do. What happened was quite stupid and regretful.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I made this xbox gba charger, and I tried to put the wires into the DS's charger port (No, it was plain wires, and not the GBA charger connector)
<br/>
<br/>
And I started hearing popping noises and no orange light came on.
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, the DS works great, boots up and everything. And the volume works under one condition -- Headphones.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally it sucks, but then again it's my fault for being far too stupid.
<br/>
<br/>
Can someone please tell me if there is a fuse I can repair or something, because I am soooo scared without my DS having volume.
<br/>
<br/>
I have everything needed to open it etc.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and I am using Flashme v6.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
*I hope this is in the right forum* ::)

Oh, that's why the DS charger port was four connectors, unlike the charger which has two.

<br/>
You gave us all a very big clue into what/how to make your own sp earphones by cutting up some old ones... man, thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">my guess is that its not the speakers thats the problem, but the charger/sp headphone plug. i'd say that you shorted some of the pins used for the sp headphones so now it thinks there are headphones attached, hence why you don't get sound from the DS except through headphones (that is what you mean by no volume right?)<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
