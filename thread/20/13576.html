<br/>
<br/>
I got from iIntendo a new DS lite in replacement of my broken one.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that Wifi doesn't seem to work properly on homebrews with that hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way to work around it ?
<br/>
<br/>
Please help me, else it will be complicated for me to continue developping PuzzleManiak...
<br/>
<br/>
I already tried to recompile with lib wifi 3.1, unsuccessfully.

some people made patchers based on his findings, posted in blog comments.

This patcher is made by nin187 (direct link) <a class="postlink" href="http://ftp7.ohpy.com/opftp/index.php?control=Download&amp;nOption=1&amp;file=vrdx0DSozg7PPIrhh-OSyzldm1LvvQnxRl3H51Ny7vPQB6dBqDQBeqIc_MGTNManI8D5MQHdpNEM2AZ0Frh-tVbDVM_yTRmIxN54hfEFd0HDbTgkp65PpA==" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">[extra WIIIIIDE link -- MOD]</span></a>

It's probably worth doing a translation of nin187's comments, i did a google one and it was not quite interpretable, but i think he says this isn't a final patcher?

First, thanks for your answer.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm really surprised by your result on PuzzleManiak, as I tried to compile the dswifi lib with the changes done by Rudolph in the code, and that didn't work for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Can I send to you this version so you can test it ?

in regard to testing the patcher yourself, i can verify that it has so far caused me no problems on my 6 and a 1/2 month old DS. I'm fairly confident on it's safety.

If you choose to do so, it might help you isolate whether this is your problem with wifi homebrew.

<br/>
<br/>
I'd kind of expect that to break in interesting ways if it found whatever signature it was looking for. The fact that the patcher said "0 bytes patched" means that it didn't find the signature, not that I inserted "the right changes"
<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth the changes I made are functionally equivalent to the changes that Rudolph made but done in a slightly different way. I also retained the swiDelay changes rather than reverting to the for loop approach as Rudolph did - I'm really not sure why he did that.

Run the nds file (assuming your cart runs homebrew in .nds format)

select "connect via wifi connection settings"

or try "search for an AP"
<br/>
(not sure on the exact wording, but it's similar)

On the top screen it will show confirmation of any connection made.

the connection should be fairly quick. ie within a couple of seconds. otherwise it won't work and will hang.

Both versions 1.6 and 1.8 work on my DS Lite, so I guess this was a false assumption on my side and rather a bug in the game code than in the wifi library.

I had a chance to take it to work this morning and try the wifi_lib-0.3.2_test out.  I was able to see 6 APs (which was better than the 0 APs I saw at home).  
<br/>
<br/>
So this points to my AP being the issue in this case.  Why would I be able to connect with Mario Kart DS and not homebrew?

This is really puzzling (eh), your new beta doesn't work either on my DS Lite or DS Phat - whereas the v1.6 and v1.8 builds work on both perfectly. For example going to online hi-scores the game stalls keeping the led on. Lower screen shows just blank / black. I'd advice to to make a separate debug build to see where exactly the stalling happens. Making timeouts for Wifi_CheckInit() / Wifi_AutoConnect() and returning proper error messages to the user at least. I'll PM you with more details...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

First I swapped out my Microsoft MN-700 router for a Linksys (although I don't think I needed to do that). However, swapped routers at least enabled me to see my AP using wifi_lib_test.nds.

At this point I was using channel 1 and my signal strength showed 0% for some reason.  I read the previous post and changed to channel 10.  All of a sudden and I got full strength signal and was able to connect.

Here are my clues leading to me thinking there is a bug with dswifi code:
<br/>
- I can connect using Channel 1 with Mario Kart DS just fine with any router.
<br/>
- I can't connect on Channel 1 with homebrew code to any router.
<br/>
- I can connect on Channel 10 to my linksys router with any software(haven't tried my Microsoft router).
<br/>
<br/>
So the fact that Mario Kart DS can connect no problem, but homebrew code can't points to the homebrew libraries having a bug.
<br/>
<br/>
But this might only be for DS Lites, and perhaps even only the newer ones.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My friend has a new DS Lite, he got it like 4 months ago.  It connects using MKDS (and other WiFi games) on any channel...BUT only connects homebrew with dswifi .3d or greater and only on channel 10.

<br/>
<br/>
However, on DS Wifi Voice Chat, I asked "DS or DS Lite", and many people circled "Lite".  This app uses dswifi .3b, so new DS Lites can't use it, but older DS Lites must be able to use WiFi correctly.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

The wireless hardware is configured using settings found in the firmware so that official games happily work even when the hardware changes. The dswifi library also does this but since the wifi hardware is not fully understood yet some of the hardware configuration may be missed or incorrectly performed hence homebrew not working as well (or at all).
