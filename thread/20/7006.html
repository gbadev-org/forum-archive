    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was at Nintendo World event last weekend for the Miyamoto signing. There were at least 2 thousand people out there on line to meet Miyamoto. Pretty much everyone there had DS's so there was a lot of multiplayer action going on. This was the first time I actually got to use Picochat or a multiplayer game, so it was a good time. The thing was, the DS had a real hard time picking up signals. Repeatedly in PicoChat we would get randomly disconnected and the status bars were at either 0 or 1 bar (out of 4). Also, trying to play mario64 multiplayer took about 3 tries (turning the system of and on) even though the 4 of us were standing right next to each other in a circle! Later in the day the Nintendogs competition with Miyamoto got cancelled (and held up the line) because they couldn't get the wifi signal working. Apparently all the DS's in the area clogged the signal so that it couldn't get a clean connection. Joystiq.com had the following to report:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Eventually, though, they had to give up on the idea of transferring one of these puppies to everyone who got a signature. Attempts to transfer the puppy with the Mario hat were foiled, perhaps by the noise of several dozen DSs all in the same vicinity. For a moment, Nintendo staff toyed with the idea of asking everyone in the vicinity to turn off their DSs, but this idea went nowhere. How silly would it be if they had to shut off every DS in the Nintendo store in order to get the transfer function working? This will probably be addressed in a future patch to the operating system for the device.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Even though it is just conjecture, I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo released an update to fix this. It seemed like it was quite an embarrasment for them and I am surprised they didn't ever run any tests like this previous to this event.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But, to hear that to many DSs in a single location causes them not to be able to connect.. in short.. is pretty crappy.  I guess.. NiFi should maybe go back to the drawing board.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Keep in mind what market the iQue DS and Red DS are made for.  Japan and China.. so for them to put out stricker firmware for just that market actually makes sense to me.  I don't have any problem with it.  If you have a known piracy market, why not "fight" that market a little harder.  But, if they were on the anti-homebrew warpath, EVERY DS being manufactured right now would have that firmware.  From what I see/hear, that isn't happening.  If they already have it, why not use it on ALL DSs?  Nintendo IS the one making this hardware.  They aren't poor.  If they wanted to, I'm sure they could have made it a LOT harder for us to be where we are right now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Perhaps all newly manufactured units <span style="font-style: italic">do</span> come with the red DS firmware, but Nintendo and retailers have so many units with the old firmware in stock that it might take a few months before newly manufactured units end up in end users' hands. Likewise on the other side: for several months after the release of 1.51, you could still find the occasional PSP with 1.50.

In addition to limiting wireless interference, Nintendo has added a bit to their ROM header that toggles the RSA encryption. This will prove to be very beneficial to homebrewers who now no longer need clever devices such as PassMe to execute their code on the DS. With this new firmware, NDS flash cartridges are quite possible.

I guess I can't say for sure, but being that I do work in a manufacturing environment, I doubt that is the case.  When you manufacture a product, you don't want to store a few million dollars worth of it in warehouses.  You manufacture to demand (or forcasting, which is almost always wrong).  When demand overcomes your production rate, you end up with a shortage (just like they had for the last 2 months of last year).  But, you still follow numbers.  Each month is forcasted, and product is manufactured to follow that forcast.  If you have a design in place (aka, iQue and Red) you know about it far enough in advance to not end up with 5,000,000 units waiting to be sold before your new version becomes available.  That is why people have to search for an old model of something.  I'm not saying the mom and pop shop down the bock won't have a DS with the original firmware 5 years from now, because they don't have the sales to require another order (which would come with new firmware) but I'd be willing to bet that if there is new firmwared DSs released in the U.S., you'd hear about it in less then a month.  And then, there would be a rush to get the old firmwared version (even for people that don't do homebrew, because people just follow what they read, not understanding it won't really effect them) and that would cause most stores to have the new version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At E3 it was near impossible to download the DS demos from Nintendo's kiosk.  Even when there were available 'spots' (transfers were limited to about 6 at a time per demo), the connection would almost always die before the transfer could initiate, or often, it would drop midway through a transfer.  There probably weren't any more than 20 people surrounding the kiosk at a time, but there were tons of people in the 2-3 hour Zelda line with their DSs out.  I hope this doesn't end up being a problem at DS 'hot spots' if they're as successful as Nintendo hopes they will be.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
