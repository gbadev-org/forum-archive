    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So there are a ton of threads that mention the pros and cons of all the flash cards out there.  Personally, I've only ever owned an R4 and never had any real issues with it.  Nothing that would make me care to switch brands or anything.
<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, often wonder what the UIs look like for the other cards.  The R4 UI is okay, nothing great.  I like the customizability of the images.  I wish you could customize the width/height/location of the selection boxes...but whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
How does the AK or M3 UI look?  I'm talking about the one that the company provides with the shell/kernel/software/firmware/whatever you wanna call it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also I suppose since I see so much about this Sakura firmware, it could be included.
<br/>
<br/>
What makes them good or bad? How customizable are they all?
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said for the R4.  You can customize the images which is cool.  You get 12 themes you can flip between.  The only downside is, you can't choose the actual location of the selection boxes when you're picking games, media, or slot2.  it's always a perfect square vertically centered. :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
