    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looking at the DS there is one thing it keeps reminding me off a lot!! That are the double screen game and watch games from my youth...Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong 2 etc...what I would love to play these games on the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been playing with the idea of making such a game myself, but haven't found the time yet to start. Perhaps other people have the same idea and have even started working on it, let me know.
<br/>

If one game works (e.g. Donkey Kong), then others can't be that hard to make.....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
