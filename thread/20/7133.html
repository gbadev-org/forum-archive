    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I figured you guys would have some technical knowledge of the system so could help me...
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I'm playing games I get some lines across the screen.
<br/>
The look sorta like interlace artifact lines. 
<br/>
For example, an easy way to check is by doing a back as Luigi in the aquarium in SM64DS. I get greyish lines across the white tiles. I also get these lines all over the game in other places.
<br/>
I also get it in in Metroid prime demo, yoshi, and warioware.
<br/>
<br/>
Is this normal? I've asked in other forums. One guy said he saw them but he had tried 10 other DS without them. Most other people said no lines, one other guy said he saw them but they didn't bother them and someone else said they were normal.
<br/>
I tried contacting my distributor several times but all they say is I should bring it in so they can have a look...
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks alot to anyone who helps me out.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Interlace artifact lines are normal on Nintendo systems with color LCD panels, whether GBC, GBA, or Nintendo DS. The system draws every other scanline darker in alternate frames in order to make pixel response time appear faster. If you can run GBA programs, go get the "static" demo from <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/" target="_blank">here</a> and run it on each screen.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lighting conditions have a huge effect on the visibility of interlace lines, especially on the old GBA.

Different systems have screens from different suppliers.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So more light = lines less noticeable or the other way round?
<br/>
Anyway, I guess I'll just have to get used to this screen. 
<br/>
Because I just got the previous one with a stuck pixel replaced with this which seems to have much more noticeable interlace lines.
<br/>
The difference is annoying...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Also, the description of that gba app.  (I can't run it unfortunately, waiting for M3 SD ;))
<br/>
The last line of the description rompts me to ask, would the programming of the game affect how bad the lines are? 
<br/>
Because in the Metroid Prime demo and Yoshi touch and go they are wayy less noticeable than in SM64DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
