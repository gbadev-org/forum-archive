    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: normal">I have noticed that some hombrew apps and games are not working on my DS. Maybe this is because I have a supercard which most homebrew things are not built to be used with. I have also noticed this problem with the M3.
<br/>
Is there any skilled programmer out there who can possibly create an application to make homebrews work on other formats.</span><br/>_________________<br/>White DS --- Supercard SD --- Passcard ---

note: some programs dont support scsd yet, but theres usually a modded version of them lying around and more support will come soon if/ when the chishms fat driver has the sd code.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Only programs that tend not to work are just missing the PowerOn(All) line at the start of the program (or whatever the line is).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
