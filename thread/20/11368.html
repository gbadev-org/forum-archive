Suppose someone were to dump their SNES TA/PDP cart and rip the graphics and sounds; would it be difficult for them to put these into your game to get the full experience on the DS? I'd use an emulator but they all either don't work well enough or don't work on GBAMP, and they certainly don't give you 4-player wireless play.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, for three reasons: <ul><li>The Super NES runs in 256x224 with a roughly 8:7 pixel aspect ratio, while the DS runs in 256x192 per screen with square pixels. However, players are likely to accept unscaled mode with several scanlines (none of which include any playfield) cut off. </li><li>The darkening of the background behind the playfield uses color subtraction, which is conspicuously absent from the DS 2D hardware. However, this can be approximated by using color multiplication instead, which the GBA and DS hardware do support. </li><li>Most importantly, the Super NES assets are all rights reserved and cannot be distributed with what amounts to a high-level emulator any more than Lucasarts games can be distributed alongside ScummVM. </li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Yes we have not specified any licence for the source of tetattds, but you can think of them as having a GPL licence. This is what we will release the next version as (if there will ever be one).

I've been thinking about releasing the mikmod part separately for some time, and thanks to you I finally got around to do it. I've started another thread for this:

I think it would be very difficult. The graphics was extracted mostly from screenshots and then brushed up (it's not exactly the same graphics). I copied the music from the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.verge-rpg.com/files/detail.php?id=672" target="_blank">V3PdP Bronze demo</a>, but I believe it was created from an spc file, logged to an Impulse Tracker module with OpenSPC, then manually fixed. The sound effects are also from this demo. I realize now I should have mentioned this in the readme.

Work-in-progress graphics:

I've made these new blocks in Inkscape myself so there should be no copyright problems except maybe for the space invader.
<br/>
<br/>
I can make graphics, but I'm not talented enough to make music and sound effects. I need <span style="font-weight: bold">help</span> with this.

Which brand of copier do you recommend?
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that the hardware interfaces of the popular models of copier are documented, it should be possible for the ripper program to tell the copier to dump only those parts that contain the compressed graphics, decompress them, and convert them to packed pixels. Then any SPC ripper such as SNESSOR could convert the game's SPC samples to PCM, and a specially written tool based on reverse engineering the game's playback engine could translate the music sequences into MIDI or whatever other format your playback engine uses.
<br/>
<br/>
Original sound effects are doable. Which do you need?
<br/>
<br/>
Music, on the other hand, is a minefield. How can I know whether a given melody is <a class="postlink" href="http://slashdot.org/~yerricde/journal/36125" target="_blank">already copyrighted by someone</a>?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

In the game right now we have these sound effects:

chain - when you make a combo or a step in a chain
<br/>
die - when you lose
<br/>
fanfare(1-2) - when you finish a chain of 4 steps, or 5 or more

It's best to assume that any melody you've heard before IS copyrighted. Nowadays music is (technically) automatically copyrighted the moment it is mastered - i.e when the first copy is completed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'd build my own. As long as it can generate a direct copy of the data on the ROM chip then you have what you need to do this.

Does either the official DS port or the unofficial clone use Polarium/Meteos style control or anything?
