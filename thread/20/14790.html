    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i was wondering if it is possible to use my supercard lite micro sd slot 2 card as external ram, if i buy a supercardDS ONE sd?
<br/>
if it is possible, is it as easy as plugging it in or do i have to put special firmware or what?
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: will i have to use my sd card (1mb) as the ram or is it built in?
<br/>
sorry but i have absolutly no idea about how ram works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">um... an SD card is flash memory (ie writable memory like a mini harddrive) RAM is memory that the system uses to run everything, its not writable it is just there to store all information that is being run at any point in time... the supercard RAM is built into the card, as such you dont need to do anything else to use it (besides load the supercard firmware onto your SD card)<br/>_________________<br/>NDSL: M3Real, EZ4 Lite Deluxe, 2x Kingston 1GB Micro SD, 1x Kingston 4GB Micro HCSD 1x Kingston 8GB Micro HCSD</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I seem to remember using an R4 to load memtestARM, and it found a SuperCard SD's RAM. So if R4 + SCSD works, I'd guess that a SCDS + SCLite would be very likely to work.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
