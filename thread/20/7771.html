    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey. I was wondering, if it is possible to play EXE's on the DS.
<br/>
I've used a program called <span style="font-weight: bold">Multimedia Fusion</span> (<a class="postlink" href="http://Clickteam.com" target="_blank">http://Clickteam.com</a>), and I think it's just a clone of C++ or VB.
<br/>
Beside, the EXE's uses a .dll known as CNCS232.dll (<a class="postlink" href="http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?cncs232" target="_blank">http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?cncs232</a>) ... can it still be played on the NDS?
<br/>
<br/>
Please Respond

NDS isn't based on Windows operating system and therefore can't run the .exe applications. A similar project, Game Maker was being ported to NDS, but the project was cancelled.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The only kind of EXE that could be made to work on a DS would probably be an MS-DOS EXE running in a PC emulator.
