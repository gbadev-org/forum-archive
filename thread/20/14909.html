I would like to know when my ds needs charging.

The ds battery icon on the main screen is useless because it's green until the last trickle of power is left.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

As far as I know, it cannot be done in software. <a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#dspowermanagement" target="_blank">GBATEK</a> states that the DS power management chip returns only one bit for battery status, which indicates "poor" or "&gt;= fair". It would be possible in theory to build a third-party battery with an LCD readout of remaining battery charge, so that you can turn over the DS and see how much power is left, but I don't see much of a market for it.

You've been spoiled by the flashing excellent, good, fair, poor lights at the bottom of a Wii Remote, haven't you? :-)<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

No I don't have a wii, my newest system is the ds and before that ps2
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't even know the wii had such a feature. Why didn't nintendo include it with the ds. I doubt it would have been hard or cost extra.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The battery charging system must keep better track of the battery's status (probably just uses voltage) because it seems to know when to stop charging and with most LiIon batteries you need to adjust the charge voltage during charging as the battery reaches different levels.
<br/>
<br/>
But for some reason the main DS hardware doesn't seem to have access to that info, the battery charging system is totally separate.  Personally, I don't feel the need for a more detailed battery status indicator, but it does seem like an odd way to design the system.  It doesn't even seem like it would be saving them any money on a per-system basis.  Maybe some one-time savings when they wrote the initial firmware, but that's about it.
