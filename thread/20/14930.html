example:

<br/>
the url when opening an html file on your hard drive would be 
<br/>
.file:///c:/documents/tutorials/tut1.html

You youngsters and your flashy GUI's, back in my day you had 16K and a rubber keyboard grumble grumble.  ;-) 
<br/>
<br/>
To start links or retawq (the included browsers) type retawq (or links), then enter.  There's more information on the <a class="postlink" href="http://dslinux.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/Retawq" target="_blank">DSLinux wiki</a>.

</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

For retawq, probably not.  Links probably will require some form of RAM expansion
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Of course, all of this is superfluous if the paths are hardcoded as Windows values (ie C:\html\blah)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

hah yea, well its mostly because i was never a linux user...not that i didnt want to, i just didnt have access to a comp w/ it on at all... i had to wait and experiment w/ it on my own, and never really got it..i'm sure its like driving stick..a bit of a learning curve, but after that, you dont want to go back to being able to control everything

thanks for the info though, i'll throw that back on my card and see if that works</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When you used Mac OS X, did you ever run Terminal?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

yea, but not really enough..i know its pretty much Unix, right? i hadn't really ever had much of a need to play with the terminal too much, as all I'm using my mac for is graphic design work and such.  it's something I've wanted to mess with and learn, but somehow i always got distracted.

[edit] when i tried the retawq command, it gives me a screen's worth of stuff, then says "out of memory: killed process 69"..this mean i need the expansion? if so, i dont know if that's happening any time soon</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes it does, unfortunately it seems DSLinux has recently got a little too big to run without a Slot-2 RAM expansion.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

...figures...oh well, looks like i'm gonna have to wait until i get a slot 2 expansion...is the one that comes w/ the official nds browser big enough? or should i get something that's got an sd card slot(if one like that exists)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Personally, I'd get a Supercard SD Slot-2 as I've been quite happy with mine.  I think the M3 Slot-2 is quicker though.  There's a list of supported Slot-2 devices <a class="postlink" href="http://dslinux.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/RunningDSLinux#Notes_on_Extra_RAM" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
The Opera expansion will provide enough for most things and it's probably easier to get hold of, but I think the upcoming Q2 build (if Simon manages to get his code sorted, fingers crossed) will require more than the Opera expansion can provide.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i see...thanks for the info on that..i should have some time tonight to check that stuff out...btw do you have any idea if the either the supercard or m3 slot 2's are compatible w/ the r4? or doesnt it really make a difference..i've heard that the r4 and m3 are pretty much identical anyway, but was just wondering if you knew off hand.
<br/>
<br/>
as of now, i guess there isnt any other option to do what i wanted it to do, or at least none that anyone here knows of...well i'm gonna check out buying a slot 2 expansion, i'll probably need it for a lot more in the future anyway..thanks again</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Bunjalloo worked beautifully...one thing though..is there any way to bookmark/favorite the files so i can just pull them up quick after? if there is, i couldn't figure it out..didnt see anything about it in the readme either.  if not, no big deal, it still at least works with what i need it to
