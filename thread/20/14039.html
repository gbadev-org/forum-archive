Even though chishm doesn't know what exactly it is and I'm not sure why I'll ever need it, I like it. It's going in my R4's Utilities directory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Were you ever successful in that?  I know that there was extensive discussion in the Nitro Hax thread about the possibility of making a code to do this, but as far as I am aware nothing was ever produced.  It would be great if I could keep the slot-1 Opera cartridge in my DS and not have to swap any cartridges to launch it (I have a Supercard miniSD and a flashed DS).  I tried out this DS Launch program, but it appears to do nothing other than launch the game, like the name suggests.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/NDS_Projects/OperaRAM.zip" target="_blank">Opera RAM</a> doesn't patch the game like Nitro Hax. Instead it unlocks the SLOT-2 RAM pak, writes the data expected by Opera DS, then launches Opera from the DS card. Like Nitro Hax and the above posted launcher, it requires you to reinsert the DS card to boot it correctly. Also note that this should only work on the official Opera DS card, not on ROMs.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks chishm, that's exactly what I was looking for.  My Supercard appears to use up a bit more battery than the official RAM pack, but it's still a nice convenience.  Again, thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
