    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently been having a problem with my MMP and GBAMP. I will start up the DS and it will go right into GBA mode with the MMP in NDS slot. I have set the setting for both automatic and manual start up.
<br/>
<br/>
I usually have to remove the MMP and put it back in or just turn the DS on and off a few times. ( occasionally it freezes at the Nintendo health/start up screen, kinda faded not fully loaded.)
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not to sure about this, anyways, if your ds settings matchup to booting automaticly, put it in manual mode since mmp will boot right into gbamp. Also why don't your just flash your ds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
