    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSChess is a *surprise* chess game for the Nintendo DS and my first DS homebrew. It uses a very strong engine called Fruit. You can download a first alpha release on my page:

Beware that this is an alpha version and there could be a bunch of bugs inside.

Maybe I have choosen a bad start configuration (too hard), but you can change the strength of the computer. Enter the main menu with START, then choose "New Game" and there go into the submenu "Time Settings". Here you can choose e.g. "Movetime &lt;5s&gt;", this means the cpu has max. five seconds to plan his next move. Another possibility is to choose a fixed depth to which the cpu calculates (Depth &lt;5&gt; should be quite fast). Leave the sub menu with B. Now you can start a new game with "Start game!".
<br/>
<br/>
The menu is all in all not a perfect solution, but it does not have prime priority. I have written a small general menu class for text menus, if someone is interested to port this (including touchscreen support)...

<br/>
<br/>
When I see "buggy" binaries that don't have any source code along side them, I have reason to not trust them. You can't argue with me or the other people that had a preexisting trust in others but ended up being screwed over because of it. It's a reality.
<br/>
<br/>
I will laugh when your DS gets bricked because I will have had the sense not to fall for the same trap.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the other suggestion directed at me, I hope you weren't serious. Running binaries on WMB produces the exact same results as running them on GBAMP.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Oh, and I don't have a GBA flash cartridge -- just a wireless card. So if my flashed DS firmware gets overwritten, I am out of luck. Better to err on the safe side of things.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Actually, I thought that they concluded this out of a quick, not too informative statement by loopy, in which loopy said that the new flashme (v5) fits entirely in the first part of firmware (or something along those lines).
<br/>
I myself concluded that he ment that this new flashme is only as big as the first found firmwares (which were bigger than just the first 64 KB) and thus will not be overwritten by official games just to store information... not that it fits entirely into the 64 KB.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure about this, since loopy's comment could go either way. But I don't think loopy compressed it all the way to fit in the first 64 KB (which was what? only 4 percent of the entire flashing with the first flashme?).

For one thing, if I recall correctly, firmware is 256 KB (or 512 KB for iQue DS). For another, perhaps the stuff needed for the main menu and DS Download Play is in the first 64 KB and stuff needed for the other parts (Pictochat and options screen) are in the rest; that seems rawther plausible.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I can confirm that. Text does not display on GBAMP.

Nice additions to the chess board, though!

Oh, hooray! All that white helped me find a stuck pixel. Now I can definietly get the screen replaced... the guy at the repair place had better do a good job.

Edit: Actually... this is curious. It appears that there is a black spot at the top right of the screen. A quick check of the startup screen tells me that this only occurs in DSChess. A strange bug, if it is one. Does anybody else get this?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I can confirm that. Text does not display on GBAMP.
<br/>
Nice additions to the chess board, though!
<br/>
I can't wait to see the menu :)

Hmm, strange, I will have a look at it, hope to fix this soon.

<br/>
Very very nice. Thanks :)
<br/>
I like the new menus.
<br/>
<br/>
I still have a black spot though...
<br/>
It's on you're screenshot too, actually, so presumably you know about it. Either that or I'm going completely crazy!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Suggest Move appears to suggest impossible moves when one uses it for the very first turn when playing white...
<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or is the engine running faster?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Yes, I know about it. I think it was some sort of test I have made. In the next version I will remove this "stuck" pixel.

This is a bug which occurs if you start a new game, the suggest routine then suggests you a move from the last game...
<br/>
<br/>
The engine is not running faster, but I changed the starting timesetting, now the computer has max. 10 seconds to make his move.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I corrected the poll, so everybody can finally vote now...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
