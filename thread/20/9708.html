    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello <span style="font-weight: bold">dev</span>ochki (heh Russian joke), I've been having trouble getting homebrew wifi to work. It always hangs at aquiring DHCP. I have 64-bit WEP and even if I turn it off it still doesn't connect.
<br/>
<br/>
My router model is WRT54G v4.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone care to help?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Whenever I am like 20 feet from my AP, it hangs at "ACQUIRING DHCP" for about a minute. But after that it starts working. To fix that, I usually sit near the AP and it doesn't stick at the "ACQUIRING DHCP" for as long. It is usually instant.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if it will work, but try sitting really close to your AP.
<br/>
If that doesn't help, then you don't have the same problem as me.
<br/>
<br/>
And if that is the case, then I don't have the answer :P<br/>_________________<br/>popcorn</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think I'm on WRT54g hardware version 4 as well. (Must. Avoid. Rant.)
<br/>
Is it the one that doesn't work with any of the older WRT54g firmwares? (ARRGH).
<br/>
Firmware version on this one is 1.0.0.9 or something nutty like that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have trouble with it, too...

I think you mean the version 5. The version 4 is the last one that still runs Linux. After that, they moved over to VxWorks, and dropped the specs of the router a good deal.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Version five just forked the WRT54G line into "G" (VxWorks, which can work with less RAM) and "GL" (Linux, slightly more expensive) models.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
