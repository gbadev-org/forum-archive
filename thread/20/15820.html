    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Since you have a router, you should be able to do Wifi on DS fine. The router needs to support 802.11b,(802.11g should work also, since that's backwards compatible with b)
<br/>
and WEP.(WEP isn't really required, but if you want the network to stay secure, it's needed.)
<br/>
If your router doesn't support WEP, and is using some other security, well, you'll need a Wifi dongle. Unless opening up your router with no security is an option, and that's probably not an option.
<br/>
<br/>
If official DS games with Wifi work with your router, it should work fine with homebrew. But if you have a DS Lite, some homebrew may not work unless the router's channel is set to channel 11.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
