    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I sorted it all out yesterday. I've flashed my DS and I put all the software onto my CF card. It was working fine yesterday and earlier today, but now when I try to use Scummvm it only shows the controls in the top screen and the bottom screen is just blank. It's almost as though it hasn't turned on. Has anyone else had this issue, or could someone help me to sort it out? Thanks.[/b]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
