    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering about something. Bluetooth uses 2.4 ghz just like WiFi does right? Could a custom wireless stack be written for the DS that can make it act as a wireless bluetooth device? (would definately save a lot of time file transfering, heh)
<br/>
<br/>
Also, this could be the ultimate achievement but, I was wondering how possible would it be to turn the DS into a cell phone? It's got the headset port, alls it needs is an antenna and software..and software to drive it. It would be the ultimate 3rd party accessory, whether it be fan-made or slightly professionally made. And, of course, it would be GSM based (perhaps with a custom extension using the GBA port, or a little usb device that could attach to say. DSerial or something?
<br/>
<br/>
Ahh the possibilities, people just need to be willing to utilize it.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I wouldn't want my DS to have a motion card; I've already had enough accidents with the near-indestructable WiiMotes. I doubt the DS could stand up to the punishment without taking serious damage.

Lite doesn't.
<br/>
<br/>
If they put a microphone on the wii-mote they could've made a bluetooth phone and they couldve hooked it on to their email thing :( ... of course, they do always have the expansion slot and firmware updates!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
But the idea of a bluetooth adaptor being able to transfer files back and forth between your PC and your DS would be so nice.
<br/>
<br/>
But I really have to push the idea of a cell phone for the DS. I only wish I had the technical know-how to do it myself, because I definately would. The fact that the DS being as popular as it is, it could literally become the most powerful Cell Phone out there..and it would turn <a class="postlink" href="http://kotaku.com/assets/resources/2007/01/dslitephonemitsu.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> into a major immitator.
<br/>
<br/>
I sent off the idea to Datel, the only 3rd party out there with the balls to do something like this, but I have little confidence of their taking my e-mail seriously.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo's probably the only developer out there who would actually do this kind of periphreal justice, but I doubt they'd be interested either. I suppose it's one of those things that would be an awesome idea, but never utilized.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Why would you need bluetooth?
<br/>
<br/>
In theory, its just as much possible to make the DS act like a Windows file share directly and swap at the max wifi speed.
<br/>
<br/>
If the Wifi set up inside the DS could emulate Bluetooth, I dont see why by faster :-/
<br/>
Surely it would be slower?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think it would be feasible for the sole purpose of saying it could be done. That's one of the only reasons anyone can really say anything about anything, right?
<br/>
<br/>
I also think it's very coincidental the RAZR's antenna and bottom half's width is very ..very similar to that of a GBA game's physical size. :) Hmmm. Same voltage as well.
<br/>
<br/>
It'd be cool if someone could adapt a V3 into a GBA cartridge and then feed its information through the DS itself, using the DS's speakers and mic. The RAZR's speaker could obviously be used as the "ringing" speaker. Hmm..
<br/>
<br/>
Ugh maybe I should make a mock-up or something. hehe.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
