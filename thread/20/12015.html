    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That would be nice to play GBA games, and perhaps even better GB/GBC games too (I found the old tetris for GB more challenging than tetris DS, expecially in two players mode when in the GB version both players gets the same tetriminoes)... by emulating a system link cable over the DS wifi connection.
<br/>
I wonder why this is not possible yet.
<br/>
Is that impossible to implement?

Er...
<br/>
<br/>
I thought the idea was to enable a GBA game running on the DS to use GBA link...
<br/>
<br/>
So, why would you be running two GBA virts on one DS?
<br/>
<br/>
In the simplistic view, you'd virtualise your GBA emu but have the back-end of the GBA link code transfer through to some custom Wi-Fi shenanigan...
<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, that's the simplistic view. Is virtualisation appropriate for the running a GBA emu in this way on the DS? Maybe, maybe not.
<br/>
<br/>
VMWare works nicely on my PC, but then and again, that's a PC and the DS is a rather different beast...
<br/>
<br/>
Fun to talk about, though :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Well, I had an idea and i'm halfway in implementing it. 
<br/>
Usingt he MPU to scan read/writes from memory and just re-"compile" the data for GBA. 
<br/>
<br/>
Example: 
<br/>
ARM9 runs ARM7 code (totally possible) and writes to 0x0400000 (DISPLAY_CR/REG_DISPCNT). GBA's DISP_CR is 16bit, but on the DS it's 32bit, so any writes to 0x0400002 would be 'eliminated'.
<br/>
<br/>
As for different graphic modes, MODE3 is 16bit single BG(2). redirecting it to MODE<span style="font-weight: bold">5</span> with BG2 in addition to P affine.
<br/>
<br/>
Problems I encountered and (particialy) solved: 
<br/>
Timing - DS's ARM9 is x4 faster the GBA's ARM7, but code 'scanning' takes more then that. solution: nothing but optimization.
<br/>
<br/>
Sound - Sound is on ARM7 and needs to be redirected to there. (Not yet implemented)
<br/>
<br/>
Memory map - Yes. GBA ROMs are running from 0x0800000 fixed location, DS's binaries are running from RAM (0x02000000).
<br/>
solution: placing the supervisor code in DTCM, and loading 4MB-256k of the ROM into 0x02040000 and adjusting reads to the new location.
<br/>
<br/>
VRAM - Not a problem at all - just use VRAM E (64k) for BG and VRAM G for sprites. framebuffer modes are switching VRAM bank options and copying the data in them (for 'realizm')
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Exlusive stuff:
<br/>
Use of X/Y for turbo A/B keys and touch for other stuff (pre defined)
<br/>
(Not implemented) Use of wifi as serial emulation(?)
<br/>
Using the second screen to show debug info on real HW (BG data, tiles, memory... etc)
<br/>
&lt;insert your idea here&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
This GBA "supervisor" is not fully done yet and supervising some instruction does not work as it should. speed is slow, but way faster then native ARM7 emulation on DS.<br/>_________________<br/>Private property.
