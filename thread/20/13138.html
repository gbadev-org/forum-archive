    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Greetings everyone.  I've been trying to get glkpogo to work on my R4 for several days now but have come up completely empty.
<br/>
<br/>
As for glkpogo, the readme file states...
<br/>
<br/>
When you start an interpreter you are presented with a file requester.
<br/>
Use UP and DOWN and A to select files. You can also edit the filename
<br/>
directly. When the right file is selected, hit START to load that game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Exactly what type of file(s) is it specifically looking for and where should that file(s) be located at within the glkpogo folder?
<br/>
<br/>
When I start the program on my DS, at the top of the screen it shows "game.dat". I can move the cursor left and right and type any text, but pressing up and down does nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
I've typed the name of the .z5 or .dat game I'm hoping to load up within the glkpogo folder but I just get a critical error and the program crashes. I must be missing something really simple but I just can't seem to problem solve my troubles.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone with a huge brain that can help me out on this?
<br/>
Has anyone even been able to get this to work on an R4 using Windows XP?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. :o)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You know, I wouldn't mind putting the DS Linux version of Frotz on my R4 if that's a better application.
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, I don't have a clue on the first step to do that either.
<br/>
<br/>
I really could use some helpful advice if someone's got the free time to help a poor fellow out.  :o)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Okay, that might have been a little too dramatic, but still, is there anyone who knows how to run Glkpogo using an R4 cartridge?
<br/>
<br/>
I would love it if someone could shoot me out a straight answer.
