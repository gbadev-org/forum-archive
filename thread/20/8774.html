Yes. I hate that too.
<br/>
PoffPad v0.1 for example is sh*t! It's using some really old tools. It detects my stylus 10mm from the wrong point. To test the accurancy I followed the corners.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The problem with homebrew and DS is that Nintendo made several 'versions' of the touchscreen, the problem with these several 'versions', is that while programs like DS2Win and DS2Key (used) to have a very... peculiar touchscreen on my DS (on older builds), the new builds fix this for me, but wreck other DSs. 
<br/>
<br/>
Poffpad is nice, I have trouble writing X and Y, but other than that, the stylus works perfectly, at least for my DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Try recalibrating the DS, but get mark the crosses  wrong and test Poffpad, that might help ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.
<br/>
Thank you, everyone, I look forward to taking advantage of your work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm not entirely sure (But I'm sure someone else, like tepples, knows this a lot better than me), however I'll share my thoughts on the topic. 
<br/>
<br/>
When you calibrate the DS, it stores some numbers on some memory. Official games use some sort of math lib to calculate where are you pressing, based on those coordinates. 
<br/>
<br/>
The libnds tries to mimic by calculating as well. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is, as far as I know, I wouldnt hold my word for it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
