<br/>
if your willing to open the DS and cut a trace(which you reform later)
<br/>
<br/>
all you need for it is a printer cable and a computer with 3.3v printer output
<br/>
<br/>
that is once you figure out the rest of it :P
<br/>
it was for fixing a bad flash or from bricking software
<br/>
<br/>
-p.s. if you can figure this out and get it to work
<br/>
PLease tell me :D
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't try ppflash unless you have soldered before because it takes a lot of fine motor skill, and you could brick your DS real bad if you slip. If you know anybody who has soldered a modchip into a PS2 or Xbox, then pay him or her to do ppflash for you.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
<br/>
-- Who?
<br/>
-- You know, the human.

-- I think he moved to Tilwick.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If he has a commercial GBA game with enough SRAM, it should be substitutable for a flash cart. I'm not sure but I would think most cart writers can write their SRAM. If not, Gameshark Advance can (though it won't run on a stock DS) or you could write a GBA app and run it on a GBA via a simple multiboot cable. (Or on the off chance he has the equipment, I think a Gamecube app could do it through the GB Player.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
