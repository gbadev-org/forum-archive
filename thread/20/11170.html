    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So the last time I've even heard of homebrew on the DS was when PassMe was new. What I'm trying to figure out is if I get a DSLite, would I be able to:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Browse the web
<br/>
2. Emulate SNES/SEGA
<br/>
3. Download DS games
<br/>
<br/>
without adding any extra hardware outside. More or less, is there software that allows me to do these things on the DSLite? Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Browse the web - Yes but only in text format with homebrew software else you need to buy the ds browser.
<br/>
<br/>
Emulate SNES - just about there a several emulators in development but nothing awe inspiring yet
<br/>
<br/>
Emulate SEGA (presume megadrive) - yes but not yet with sound and the emulator is still not perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
Download DS Games - You can download the DS Demos here in these forums but downloading games always has and always be be illegal. This forum certainly is not the place to discuss this anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Emulating snes has its peaks, especially now since a new developer has been helping Bubble2k and Gladius
<br/>
<br/>
A 3-man team for emulating Snes? I see a bright future.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just got a black ds lite and I'm wondering if everything that was possible with the ds phat is possible on it too.  What are the chances of bricking it when flashing?  Does somebody have a link to a very good flashing tutorial?  What's the best flash cart for the ds lite?  Can you remove flashme and restore factory settings if you don't like it?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1: For the most part, yes.
<br/>
2: Slim to none. The battery and power cord would have to fall ou, and even then, you could recover.
