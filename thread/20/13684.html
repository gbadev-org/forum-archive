    <h4>#134634 - yellowstar - Sun Jul 15, 2007 1:54 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have some questions about networks.
<br/>
These are questions about getting the hardware
<br/>
needed.
<br/>
I don't have a network.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Wired</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Neither of the computers I have
<br/>
have an Adapter for the wired NIC card
<br/>
inside both of them.
<br/>
<br/>
But both of them have a wired NIC card
<br/>
inside.
<br/>
<br/>
Months ago I got a cheap cable to connect the two,
<br/>
but after it arrived I found out both of my computers
<br/>
didn't have adapters.
<br/>
<br/>
I still have that cable.
<br/>
<br/>
So,
<br/>
the only thing I need for wired networking is
<br/>
adapters for both of my computers.
<br/>
<br/>
On average,
<br/>
how much does it cost to have
<br/>
a computer repair
<br/>
store put in adapters?
<br/>
<br/>
I know I can do it myself,
<br/>
but I don't want to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Wireless</span>
<br/>
<br/>
As I metioned in the above section,
<br/>
both of my computers don't even have
<br/>
adapters for wired networking.
<br/>
<br/>
So,
<br/>
would a wireless NIC card(or a adapter)
<br/>
work on these computers.
<br/>
<br/>
Both of these computers have
<br/>
Windows 98 and XP on them.
<br/>
My XP is an ME upgraded to XP.
<br/>
<br/>
If a wireless NIC card would work on these
<br/>
computers,
<br/>
does anybody know
<br/>
of a cheap wireless NIC card,(or a wireless adapter)
<br/>
and a router?
<br/>
<br/>
I am stuck with Dial-Up were I live.)=
<br/>
<br/>
So,
<br/>
is there any adapters for a phone line(Dial-Up)
<br/>
and a DSL cord?
<br/>
<br/>
All routers I saw on the Internet can use DSL.
<br/>
None of them can use phone lines.(Dial-Up)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes. A wired network is more resistant to common attacks than an open or WEP network, and a WPA-only network will reject a Nintendo DS system. Besides, the 2.45 GHz band is crowded; which channel does a microwave oven run on again?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are also cheap USB 2.0 10/100 ethernet adapters that work quite well. Plug them in, stick the cd in the drive, and let the installer software take care of everything.  You don't want someone from a computer repair shop touching your computer.  They charge you excessive amounts of money to do the simplest of tasks, most do evil things (like making copies of your harddrive to search thru later, for your product keys, any porn you happen to have, and report you if they find anything you shouldn't have)
<br/>
<br/>
As far as networking to your DS, any 802.11b access point with mac filtering will do. Be sure to set the TXRates to 2Mbit, since thats the max the DS can handle. I've got my DS wifi network setup with mac filtering, a captive portal (for anyone who is smart enough to get past the mac filter), and no route to the outside world. The only protocol I actually let thru to my lan is ds midi wifi.

<br/>
There are routers with dialup fallback. I've personally used one.

Also, if you want any kind of speed?  Sure, for the DS it doesn't really matter because of the 2Mb limit, but to copy files.. it does.  There is a huge difference between a 54Mb WiFi and 100Mb wired..  On top of the fact, that the more computers/devices you add, the less WiFi bandwidth you have to share.
<br/>
<br/>
So, although WiFi sounds great, and is usually faster than your internet conneciton anyway, in a real network envirnment, always pick wired over WiFi if you have the option.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
You can connect your second router in two ways.
<br/>
<br/>
1. Ignore the WAN port and connect one of the LAN side ports to one of the LAN side ports on your first router. This will extend your Ethernet network onto the 3 other LAN ports. This will gain you two more ports (you loose one of the 3 to whatever you unplugged from the first router). This is just using the switch/hub part of the second router.
<br/>
2. Connect the WAN port to the LAN side of your first router. If you can bridge the WAN and LAN side Ethernets of the second router (unlikely) then this will extend your Ethernet network onto all 4 LAN ports.
<br/>
Without the bridge you will be setting up a second IP network on the LAN side of the second router. This second IP network cannot overlap that of your first network (if your first IP network is 192.168.7.0/255.255.255.0 then second would have to use, for example, 192.168.12.0/255.255.255.0) and the first router will have to be told how to route IP packets to the second router. This is probably not what you want.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Some network info</span>
<br/>
<br/>
An Ethernet network can logically be separated into two parts.
<br/>
1. The cabling, hubs and switches.
<br/>
2. The devices that communicate with each other over the network (the Ethernet NIC in your PC for example). These devices each have a unique address, known as the MAC address (the 12 hexadecimal digit number often written as 01:23:45:67:89:ab).
<br/>
<br/>
Devices communicate with each other using Ethernet frames. These frames contain the MAC address of the source of the frame and the MAC address of the destination and the payload data. When a device sees a frame with a destination address that is the same as its MAC address then it will take that frame off the network and process it.
<br/>
<br/>
When an Ethernet frame reaches an Ethernet hub then the hub will repeat the frame on all of its ports except the one on which the frame was received.
<br/>
<br/>
An Ethernet switch is similarly to a hub but uses the Ethernet more efficiently. It monitors the source MAC addresses of the Ethernet frames that pass through it, using them to build up a map of which MAC addresses are connected to which of its ports. If the destination MAC address of a frame is found within this map then it is only repeated on the mapped port saving bandwidth on all of its other ports.
<br/>
The mapping of MAC address to port is many to one as there may be more than one device connected to a single port of a switch (a second switch/hub could be connected to the port). This would be the case for OSW above.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> there is no mention of IP in the above. An Ethernet network does not care or know what is in the payload of its frames.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding what an IP router is, quoting RFC1812:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">This memo defines and discusses requirements for devices that perform
<br/>
  the network layer forwarding function of the Internet protocol suite.
<br/>
  The Internet community usually refers to such devices as IP routers or
<br/>
  simply routers; The OSI community refers to such devices as
<br/>
  intermediate systems.  Many older Internet documents refer to these
<br/>
  devices as gateways, a name which more recently has largely passed out
<br/>
  of favor to avoid confusion with application gateways.
<br/>
<br/>
  An IP router can be distinguished from other sorts of packet switching
<br/>
  devices in that a router examines the IP protocol header as part of
<br/>
  the switching process.  It generally removes the Link Layer header a

  message was received with, modifies the IP header, and replaces the

  Link Layer header for retransmission.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A while ago when I needed more ports, I was thinking of getting another router, but then I read about option #2 above, and decided to go with the (cheaper) switch instead.<br/>_________________<br/>DS Firmware 1, Datel Games n' Music card / Chism's FW hacked GBA MP v2 CF

Is it possible to create drivers for WiFi dongles,

Would this work with Windows 98?
<br/>
<br/>
For managment, it says Windows XP,
<br/>
but on compatibility, it says
<br/>
Windows 98SE,(which I have, the second edition)
<br/>
 XP, and some others.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, it says it has a soft-ap mode,
<br/>

both of my computers,(98SE and XP)

Your kidding right?  Good thing you posted references to how you came to this conclusion..  Maybe you should update wikipedia with this ounce of wisdom.
<br/>
<br/>
How hard is it for each person to google these definitions? The automobile/car reference should have explained it pretty well.  How about calling a web server a computer?  It's true, a computer _COULD_ be a web server and a web server _COULD_ be a computer.  But, neither have to be.  A web server doesn't have to be running on a computer, and a computer doesn't have to be a web server.  These are services performed.  Routing is a service performed.
<br/>
<br/>
Tikker,  If I load Freesco on a computer, what do I have?  A router or a computer?

I understand where you're coming from, but if you use the term "gateway" to talk about a router in front of a switch, then consumers below the median tend to think of a Gateway computer acting as the router, possibly running Internet Connection Sharing.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but if you want to define layer 3 switch
<br/>
<br/>
A network device that forwards traffic based on layer 3 information at very high speeds. Traditionally, routers, which inspect layer 3, were considerably slower than layer 2 switches. In order to increase routing speeds, many "cut-through" techniques were used, which perform an "inspect the first packet at layer 3 and send the rest at layer 2" type of processing. 
<br/>
<br/>
As more routing lookup functions were moved from software into the ASIC chips, layer 3 switches could inspect each packet just like a router at high speed without using proprietary cut-through methods. If a layer 3 switch supports packet-by-packet inspection and supports routing protocols, it is called a "routing switch" or "switch router," which simply means "fast router." For example, Cisco calls its high-end routers Gigabit Switch Routers (fwiw I spend a lot of time supporting 650x's and 760x's)
<br/>
<br/>
More Inspection Takes Time
<br/>
The more deeply a packet is examined, the more forwarding decisions can be made based upon type of traffic, quality of service (QoS) and so on. To obtain this information requires digging into the packet's headers to ferret out the data, which takes processing time. To understand how packets are formed, see TCP/IP abc's. The following shows what data is examined at each layer. See layer 3, layer 2 switch, Web switch and virtual LAN.
