<br/>
IS-NITRO-CAPTURE can capture screenshots and videos from DS via USB cable to Computer, as well as output DS screens as TV signal.
<br/>
IS-NITRO-VIDEO is for TV output only.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wouldn't be possible to write a program for DS/PC that would dump all contents of VRAM and WiFi it over to the PC. I know TCP/IP doesn't work, but someone manage to get WiFiMe working so there is line of communication between PC/DS. The DS would act as a server (like it does for multiplayer games) except it would send the screen capture to the PC client. I dont know how hard i would be to program, but it seems entirely possible.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
