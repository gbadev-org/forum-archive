You mention above in an earlier post that the touch screen is on during gba play for you with your M3 and Ds thats flashme'd. Mine is not flashme'd and I have the passkey, when I boot with passme in I get the touchscreen on aswell when I play gba roms but if I remove the passkey and it boots straight to gba mode the touch screen is not on. Nothing ground breaking here but I thought Id share the tiny bit of data.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">Hmmm... I've been thinking about this. The second screen is active when playing GBA. Wouldn't it be sweet if there was a way to run the GBA emulation and a very very slim, text VIEWER (not editor) on the bottom screen while the GBA runs on the top screen so that you could view a text walkthrough while your playing the GBA game? Maybe add in touch support purely for scrolling the file. Any feedback? I don't care if it's do-able or not (although if it IS, let me know) but I'm more interested in if that would be a cool idea.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">I posted this on the M3 Arrival thread at: <a class="postlink" href="http://tinyurl.com/7as9g" target="_blank">NDS The Movie Way</a>. I was hoping to get some feedback, positive, negative, and technical.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wouldn't that just run the battery down quicker using both screens when you only really need one?  Now say you could have a picture of Latecia Costa on one of the screens for when you get stuck in a game, I might go for that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The second screen is not usable in GBA mode. All NDS features are disabled in GBA mode. The reason the screen stayed on is not because it is in use, but because the M3 firmware didn't turn it off. Think of it like a light, once you turn it on, it stays on until you turn it off. Even if you forget how to turn it on or off (going into GBA mode) it will still stay on.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, now that the functionality and practicality has been beaten to death, how about the second reason I posted this, your opinion on the idea. There's been numerous times where I play a game and either have to look back and forth between the computer screen or a printed page, I would find it cool to have the walkthough so close on the bottom screen. But you probably already knew that or I wouldn't have posted about it ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Putting a .txt viewer on the bottom screen might be doable in nesDS, snesDS, or a port of one of the existing GBA based emulators.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
