DSO is a brilliant app in itself, with multiple uses. If i wanted a DSO plugin it'd be a simple application.

These suggestions are also generally great apps. By adding them to DSO you would in my opinion actually decrease efficiency as you must boot DSO first then the plugin, in comparison to just booting them from your carts loader which is what they are intended for.

The advantage is you could exit the prog's without rebooting.
<br/>
As well as using all the existing internet/sound systems the DS provides.
<br/>
<br/>
While loading DSO then the plugin is obviously taking longer, if your doing multiple things on the DS, it will actualy be quicker.
<br/>
You wont have to wait for reboots, or multiple "fat-loading" sequences ect.

<br/>
Also, in some case's, a plugin will be loading a file of a certain extension...making file-selection *far* easier then selecting the prog, then going within the progs own file selection to trigger the file.

So for many things a DSO plugin would be hugely better, imo.

Yes, that should have been my main point.

<br/>
Also it's just personal preference that i'd like to boot pretty much everything from the carts main loader.
<br/>
<br/>
However another problem could be that if a new build of DSO happens to be buggy or break any plugins you lose the functionality of that app and thus either DSO or the plugin must be rebuilt.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was going to post this, but I figured it wouldn't be worth it as noone reads the manual either.  Plugins are for a specific set of files (can handle multiples) and include support for two actions as well as getting the name of the file called.  Executables don't have arguments as they are launched standalone or from shortcuts, but both of the types have full access to the API and slightly over 2MB of ram.  Keep in mind those 2MB doesn't have to include wifi, fat, sound playback or display libraries as thats all exposed in the API.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

This tool is limited to a 1 GB SD card - for a 2 or 4 GB card it will not work.

It's a great pity.

I realised that too, but really, both plugins and exe's are welcome.

I guess its easier for people to see plugins as a generic name for both.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">But as Tepples pointed out on another board, would it be possible to create a standalone GSF player for the GBA using the external RAM of supported slot-2 devices?  CaitSith's open-source "GSFopt" tool can turn a GSF file into a GBA rom the same size as the original rom, which could be loaded into RAM and executed.  Granted, I agree that a DSO plugin would be highly unlikely, but it could be possible to create a standalone player that runs the file in GBA mode.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
