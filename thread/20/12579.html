    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would like to ask what the possibility of porting a flash game to DS.
<br/>
This one <a href="http://www.flashgame-online.com//upimg/Skill/The%20Missile%20Game%203D.swf" target="_blank">http://www.flashgame-online.com//upimg/Skill/The%20Missile%20Game%203D.swf</a>

Is a 3d game in wich you aim a missile just using the mouse cursor, i think it would be perfect for the stylus.
<br/>
I can't tell about legalities, as i don't know how it work for flashes. But i use a program called Sothink SWF Decompiler (http://www.sothink.com/product/flashdecompiler/) to have all the gfx, sounds, ActiveScript source and etc.
<br/>
So, you'd say it's doable?
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a DS interpreter for ActiveScript/flash games?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Pretty fun game, I'd say a DS clone is very doable, and by clone i mean someone coding from scratch, a port is taking the source and modifying it, and decompiled source is usually hard to work with. A flash/actionscript emulator however, I would say would be very difficult if not impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
And no, I dont have very much programming experience at all, but maybe someone else would do it, although most capable people here have a big project they're working on, or they'd rather work on some thing that they hope will gain more notoriety or something of their own creation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That would be fun on the DS too :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI
