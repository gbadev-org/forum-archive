Renamed the sc version to ds.gba, same result.

Ran the .nds version through the EZ Client, white screens.

Just for the fun of it, ran the nds version by itself, freezes immediately.

EDIT: Using EZ4 microSD

<br/>
<br/>
DsOrganize, on the part of downloading homebrew the list should have a item saying when the list was updates, when the next update, when was the latest update etc...
<br/>
<br/>
A better information about the homebrews would be awsome too.
<br/>
<br/>
A better download speed...
<br/>
<br/>
on the browser i would like not only to copy but to cut files...

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What we need is a more centralized source that the database can work through, where people would post all their updates and apps and have them instantly added to the database :)
<br/>
<br/>
Agreed that Cut would be a good thing to have for files.
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
And I think the keyboard lost accuracy again because it is now recieving input when the stylus is pressed instead of when it is released.
<br/>
The last version recieved input when the stylus was released, and, in retrospect, it felt nicer and eliminated those stylus lib problems where the initial stylus position when it is pressed can be incorrect.
<br/>
Besides, by triggering keypresses on release you could at a later date add a little gesture system where moving the stylus upwards over a key makes the letter capitalized.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Yes but that's because your PC IRC client probably sends all unknown commands starting with / as raw commands but this IRC client only sends several common commands and everything else is just sent as a message.

Yeah me too. On GBAMP. It worked fine before, but I think that was when I was running it off the NOR on my EZ4. Something must be different on the GBAMP... maybe something with the Nick? On the EZ4 it was just giving me the name "NickName" but on the GBAMP it looks like it grabs my name from the DS, but perhaps my name is too long.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

No, the original command is actually /msg nickserv
<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the text it says on most IRCD's it says to do just so.  Newer clients also support /nickserv, but it's not needed to get online.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

PS:. I just thought of a excelent ideia....why not create a portal for wii and ds news ? we could see the latest informations on the games, and software for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to make this happen, so what im trying to say, is that i want to be the moderator of this ideia, i would post with some help of course, the news about the two consoles, so people didnt need to go to the computer to see the latest news on those...
<br/>
<br/>
I have a Ign Insider pass for 2 years and i have spend much time on the computer to know the latest news about them on the second they come out...
<br/>
<br/>
Some thing like having little images, with the news would be cool too, like little gifs or jpgs on the corner, like a Wii image so, we could know its a Wii Infomation or a DS image so we could know if its a DS information.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe then we could make reviews, of games, and homebrew...
<br/>
<br/>
Oh my god...this ideia is sooo cool.

<br/>
The fact that we could see the latest news on Nintendo Wii and DS consoles from any place would be such a miracle, its something that many people are wanting since ever.
<br/>
<br/>
Something like the Homebrew Download Center where you could choose to sort the news sorting for consoles or date, we could choose the news on the screen down, and the upper screen we could see the news, but in front of every type of news, we could see an image of a wii or a ds so we could know if its a DS or a Wii news...

I think there's something odd with the wifi library though. <span style="font-style: italic">Every</span> IRC client on the DS - I've tried 3 now - freezes shortly after connecting. Yet other online apps work, and IRC on my PC works fine. The only other app that had this problem was DSOrganize's Homebrew Database, but it seems to work now (except it randomly stops in the middle of a download; I can cancel and try again, but it's a pain). Also, one time I did manage to connect on IRC, it immediately said I was temporarily banned for using a hacked client or spambot or some such. O_o
<br/>
Another minor flaw I found is if you change the channel in config.ini, you have to re-launch DSOrganize for it to take effect.

It should be said, though, that it doesn't mean it'll look bad with those colors. It just ends up looking like regular antialias :)

On many servers (including irc.blitzed.org), NICKSERV is a valid command.  On EFnet it would be an unknown command.

mIRC and some other IRC clients, send all unknown / commands as RAW commands (they strip off the / and add a space + colon).

The below raw commands will get the same reply on many servers but the first one saves a few bytes.

there seems to be a small interoperability problem between DSFTP and DSOrganize regarding the use of the "/data" folder, as documented on the first page of <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10841" target="_blank">http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=10841</a>. doedill says that DSOrganize claims the "/data" folder as its own and behaves strangely if it exists.

As per requst to start creating a unified data directory, dsorganize looks for a /data/ folder when starting up.  If it finds one, it assumes that you want your home to be /data/dsorganize/, if /data/ doesn't exist, it goes back to being just /dsorganize/
<br/>
<br/>
There can't be an option because...well...it needs to get to the data folder before reading options!  So if you have a /data/ folder on your card, just move your dsorganize folder into it and itll continue like no problems.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

As jaja said, most likely ident.  For efnet, try irc.blessed.net, thats the one I use on my DS.  Also, the top adapter says what its currently trying, not what you are running.  This is in case somoene has issues they can say waht adapter code is making it hang!

The new icons are pretty cool. Still trying to figure out the new keypad, but at least the old keyboard is still available.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing that the "Final Version" on the website is the most recent, as opposed to the previously mentioned "test4" version? And because of the FAT driver, I'm guessing we are supposed to use the unpatched (or GBAMP) versions of homebrew apps regardless of what flashcart/adapter we're using? I'll have to play around with that. Although I've noticed that some don't work now that used to work before. Like launching games patched by SnezziDS since it uses the SRAM on the device. In DSOrganize version 2.1, I could launch them from the browser on my Supercard SD and they would play as normal. Guess I'll just have to launch them from the SC menu, then.

I have tested with different recovery softwares like "EasyRecovery Pro" without luck. It didn't find anything wrong with my card. No errors, nothing. I still can format my card with my digital camera to 2GB (FAT16) and use it, but Windoze doesn't like to format the whole space.

DSOrganize don't use the SD cards right.. it must have faulty fat library for SD handling.

DSOrganiser has a problem that caused corruption, but then windows or your card reader has some sort of problem with your card :-/

<br/>
DSOrganiser couldn't have done physical damage to the card, especially not if the camera uses it fine.

DSOrganiser has a problem that caused corruption, but then windows or your card reader has some sort of problem with your card :-/
<br/>
<br/>
DSOrganiser couldn't have done physical damage to the card, especially not if the camera uses it fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Hay, could it be something screwed up with partitions?

I runned the format from there (Disk management). It says that the disc is ok and free space is 49% (and the capacity is 1.88GB). There isn't more you can do for card, only for HDD. :-( How can I remove those bad blocks?
<br/>
<br/>
My memory card reader works fine with other card. Also it worked fine before.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to low level format the card, but it doesn't allow to. 
<br/>
And I really didn't have any problems with this card before I saved in DSOrganize, so it's definitely caused some troubles in the card.
<br/>
I wonder how the 2GB card is builded as some recovery programs only sees it only as 1GB. I think the manufacturer didn't think that this kind of situation would be possible. Firmware version is 1.01. They must have fixed something from 1.00.
<br/>
<br/>
I still can format the card with my camera -&gt; 2GB. And then put it in my PC and use it -&gt; save -&gt; load -&gt; delete -&gt; etc. But When I run chkdsk or format it, it will mark half of the space as bad blocks. This didn't happen before the accident.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital_card" target="_blank">Secure Digital cards</a> have two low-level partitions: an open partition for use by cameras and a consumer <a class="postlink" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/en/about" target="_blank">digital restrictions management</a> partition for use by digital media players (hence the logo that looks like a CD). A faulty SD driver may have knocked some sectors into the DRM partition, and when read fails, Windows may see them as bad sectors.

I tried it and Zeroed the whole card -&gt; saved -&gt; unplugged the usb -&gt; plugged it back and tested that it is still zeroed (yes) -&gt; formatted it to FAT16 -&gt; Result-&gt; Free space: 960MB, Used space 960MB... didn't help
<br/>
Anyway thanks for the tip.
<br/>
I may send it back next week if I'm not able to fix it before.

I don't think so. That card worked fine before DSOrganeliminator destroyed it. The reader/writer is USB 2.0 and supports also bigger cards.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

<br/>
I mailed to the company where I bought it from. I hope it's possible to change that corrupted card to a new one. I will get a reply later today from them. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.linuxbazis.hu/kepek/linux_kampanyok/large-two-thumbs-up.jpg" target="_blank">Thumbs up</a>. :)
<br/>
I didn't tell them what caused the problem. Manufacturer will inpect that card's guts of course, but I'm not sure what they will find from it (there wasn't any personal data, tough). Maybe they will improve the BIOS to prevent such things to happend (on their site there is BIOS updates for CF cards).
<br/>
<br/>
DragonMinded, I hope your failsafe code prevents such things for happening again. :)
