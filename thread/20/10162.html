Yep, Frotz is awesome.
<br/>
I'm playing Zork right now... the GBAMP doesn't seem to have quite enough RAM for Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the real reason why I am excited about Frotz on the DS), so I am hoping that this can be somehow dealt with. (Computers from that time cant have been expected to have <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> much RAM... so it must be the fault of some piece of software that can always be improved -- maybe Frotz can run in some extra-lightweight mode or stream the game from its data file).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Indeed, my post was a little harsher than I intended.
<br/>
Linux uses file attributes to determine lots about files.
<br/>
Whether they're readable, writable, exectuable and by who.
<br/>
You can view the set attributes with the command ls -l
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
<br/>
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel      603488 20 Jun 13:56 bash
<br/>
<br/>
The three fields, -rwxr-xr-x, are the attributes.
<br/>
The first - means it's a regular file.
<br/>
The rwx after that means that the owner (root in this case) can read, write and execute it.
<br/>
The next 3 charachters (r-x) mean that the group (wheel in this case) can read and execute the file.
<br/>
The last 3 charachters of the string (r-x) list the 'other' permissions.
<br/>
<br/>
The executable format of the file (ELF, BFLT) is stored in the header of the file.
<br/>
<br/>
I think that's right anyway...<br/>_________________<br/>LAWL HOOGE

<br/>
But most often on the DS, Linux is used with the FAT16 or FAT32 file system, which doesn't support the readable or executable attributes.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'd be grateful if someone could please explain exactly how to use frotz via dslinux - I'm completely new to dslinux (basically have got as far as logging into it and typing ls) and I'm at a complete loss on how to use it properly.  Any help would be much appreciated!
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit:</span> With a little help from the dslinux.org forums I've figured out how to run it on a supercard SD, which I'll add here just in case anyone else doesn't know how to do it.  
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, make sure you download the dslinux-supercardsd.tgz (for Supercard-SD) build from here: <a href="http://kineox.free.fr/DS/," target="_blank">http://kineox.free.fr/DS/,</a> I initially downloaded the  dslinux.ds.gba (for GBA flash, G6, SuperCard-SD, M3-SD, iDeaS if you rename it with a .pme extension) build, which as yet doesn't appear to include frotz, so make sure you get the former rather than the latter for now, as it doesn't work.  
<br/>
<br/>
Extract the contents of the .tgz to your supercard, renaming dslinux.ds.nds to just dslinux.nds.  Then drop your game folders onto your supercard (I'm not sure but I have a feeling you only need the &lt;gamename&gt;.dat files to run each game) - I placed them in the root directory.  
<br/>
<br/>
Then turn on your ds and load dslinux.  
<br/>
Login: root 
<br/>
Password: uClinux (you won't be able to see the password as you're typing it in and case matters)  Then, use ls command to see a list of directories, and navigate to the directory where you put your infocom games, in my case I had to type cd supercard (to reach the contents of my supercard) then cd lurking, cd data and then I typed frotz lurking.dat to run the game.  Works perfectly, though the text is a little small for my liking.  =)  Brilliant.    
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps anyone who wasn't sure how to run it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
