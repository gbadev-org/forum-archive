You need to put the WiFi card into Infrastructure mode, first of all. The DS is not going to connect with a WiFi device in Ad-Hoc mode. Weather or not your particular card can act as an AP is dependent on the drivers, so you might hit a snag here depending on the capabilities of your drivers. Drivers permitting, give it a SSID, set your WEP key, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
After the card is set to Infrastructure, you need to setup ICS between your Ethernet connection and the WiFi card. This will route traffic between the WiFi card and your primary network connection.
<br/>
<br/>
The next step is to search for the newly created SSID. Once your DS has found that, you are going to need to associate with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Now this is probably the point where most people are going to have the problem. The PC is not running any sort of DHCP server, so for this setup to work, you will need to setup the DS with a static IP and DNS entries.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You can set your card in AP mode ONLY if manufacturer's drivers allow this. It doesn't matter what kind of OS installed in your PC - Win2000 or XP. Check your card's manufacturer web site and search for AP mode drivers.
<br/>
 My Gigabyte GN-WPKG wifi card has AP mode driver, and you can select it during device installation instead of standart one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK.  So here's what I've got setup that's not working...
<br/>
<br/>
1. Installed the driver.
<br/>
2. Went into configure and set SSID to DS and network to Infrastructure.
<br/>
3. Clicked on LAN Connection and enabled Internet Connection Sharing.  This left my LAN settings as:
<br/>
<br/>
IP: 192.168.1.100
<br/>
SUBNET: 255.255.255.0
<br/>
GATEWAY: 192.168.1.10 (The address of my router)
<br/>
<br/>
And set my Wi-Fi settings to:
<br/>
IP: 192.168.0.1
<br/>
SUBNET: 255.255.255.0
<br/>
GATEWAY: [NONE]
<br/>
<br/>
4. Removed firewalls from both connections.
<br/>
5. Enabled UPnP on my wired router.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS now sees the 'DS' SSID, but when it tries to connect cannot obtain an IP automatically.
<br/>
<br/>
6. Set DS WFC settings to:
<br/>
<br/>
SSID: DS
<br/>
IP: 192.168.0.2
<br/>
SUBNET: 255.255.255.0
<br/>
GATEWAY: 192.168.0.1
<br/>
DNS: 192.168.0.1
<br/>
<br/>
And here I am.  The DS can connect to the access point but can't connect to Nintendo's server.  I'm still wondering if I need to port-forward.  Here's some micellanious settings which I have no idea what they do:
<br/>
<br/>
Wi-Fi NIC:
<br/>
<br/>
Auto Reconnect Mode: Enabled
<br/>
CAM When AC Power: Disabled
<br/>
Fragment Threshold: 2346
<br/>
Local Administration MAC Network Address: [NONE]
<br/>
Network Type: Infrastructure
<br/>
Power Saving Mode: CAM
<br/>
Radio On/Off: Enabled
<br/>
RTS Threshold: 2346
<br/>
<br/>
DHCP (68): Enabled to localhost port 68
<br/>
DHCP (67): Enabled to localhost port 67
<br/>
DNS: Enabled to localhost port 53
<br/>
UPNP (TCP): Enabled to localhost port 2869
<br/>
UPNP (UDP): Enabled to localhost port 1900</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

First, right click on the little configuration tool icon on the taskbar, and select "Switch to AP mode" (if you haven't alredy)

Then after you set up all the SSID, Wireless mode, etc, go into network connections and go to properties for your Local Area Connection (it might be different for you, but it's basicly for your modem, or Ethernet card.)

On the advanced tab, check the box that says

"Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection"

my guess is either one of two things.  i'm guessing since you have the connections seperate in your lan and wireless link, nothing is bridging.  WindowsXP has a bridge feature.  Go to Control Panel, click on Network Connections, and from there click both of your network devices and the right click, "network bridge" or something like that.  That will create a connection between the Internet and anything connected to the wireless, such as the DS.  However, if your wireless connection doesn't remain in infrastructure mode, it probably won't work.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.dynamicpictures.net/" target="_blank">Dynamic Pictures.net</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">after trying different settings on the softAP program and on the DS, i realized that all you had to do is:
<br/>
<br/>
1.  deselect "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection" from the local area network connection (only if you had previously enabled it) and
<br/>
<br/>
2.  bridge the local area network connection to the wireless card connection (the ralink card one).  do this by selecting both connections, right-clicking, and selecting "Bridge connections" (or something like that).  once you do that, all you have to do on the DS is put in your WEP key and you're set!  no need to create an IP address or anything.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">mrnull: have you got it working yet? if not, my guess is that your DNS isn't set correctly. instead of setting the DNS the same as the gateway, set it to the DNS address your ISP gives you. i just setup 4 computers at my gf's house to use a wireless router, and none of them could access the internet without DNS addresses, so my guess is that this should fix your problem
<br/>
<br/>
you can find your DNS (without calling your ISP) by going into the properties for your ethernet adapter (the one that connects to your modem/router) go to TCP/IP and go to properties again. at the bottom of that window, you will find the primary and secondary DNS addresses. put both of those addresses into your DS's primary and secondary DNS addresses. you might also want to put it into the same fields for your wireless card as well...since i have access to a router i haven't tried it yet, though i might soon<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

yeah you can't use the wireless card to connect to the net if you're gonna use it as an AP.  you gotta have a seperate connection to the net, either through dial-up, wired LAN, or i guess even a separate wireless card if you have that kind of capability.  with the wireless card as an AP, its just making a seperate existing connection available to other devices wirelessly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
