    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey everyone.  I wanted to share my progress on my homebrew project, HexxagonDS.  It's an adaptation of the classic DOS game <a class="postlink" href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/hexxagon" target="_blank">Hexxagon</a>.  What I'm posting has the basic gameplay mechanics and graphics, but not all the animations yet.  If you have two styli, you can have a pretty exciting fast-paced 2 player game on the same DS.  Though you have to manually count up the pieces at the end :)
<br/>
<br/>
This is just an early, early preview, but I'd like to know what you think (and if it works on your hardware).  I developed it on a DS Lite with a SuperCard CF.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">very neat! works fine on my supercard cf as well. my only suggestions are: 
<br/>
1. some simple sound effects might be nice, which are different for moving, jumping, and capturing
<br/>
2. a way to end the game
<br/>
3. let the player choose from different board layouts
<br/>
4. a computer player (i'm a loser with no friends and want someone to play against :P )
<br/>
<br/>
overall, good job so far. This will be a keeper once it is finished. Perhaps you could also add online play, that would be neat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks!  Internet play makes a lot of sense for this game, and I already have the wi-fi library integrated into the project.  I'm probably going to tackle the AI next, since that should be easier (and strangely enough, I have written an AI for another different game with a hexagonal board)<br/>_________________<br/>Corner Office: <a class="postlink" href="http://lj.kvance.com/tag/corneroffice" target="_blank">dev LJ</a>

I played this game (well, a clone actually) on one of the many flash-games websites I once stumbled with. I fell in love with this game. 
<br/>
<br/>
I once got around 10 people playing against each other (in diff PCs) at a party. Ah, the good times. Now its on the go, though. Sweet!
<br/>
<br/>
Cant wait for online or A.I.
<br/>
<br/>
[Downloading and placing in my flashcart, I'll tell ya how I felt about the game after I try it]
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: After trying it out, and beating myself many to few, here's a few suggestions:
<br/>
1) A counter that can display how many reds, how many whites. 
<br/>
2) Sounds and more boards, as has been suggested. 
<br/>
3) A way to quit/restart
<br/>
4) A.I.
<br/>
5) Online play
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know this was just an early alpha, thats just what I'd expect from a finished game. Thanks for it btw!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Interesting game...  a bunch of routines from HexxagonDS would be useful for this.  I could see it as an alternate game mode.  Squeezing the whole board into 256x192 might not be practical though.  It would probably require a different input method, maybe scrolling around on the main screen with a scaled down board on the sub screen.  Something to think about much, much further down the road :)<br/>_________________<br/>Corner Office: <a class="postlink" href="http://lj.kvance.com/tag/corneroffice" target="_blank">dev LJ</a>
