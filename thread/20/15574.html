    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSOrganize 3.1129 hasn't had nearly as much of a tendency to corrupt the file system of the microSD card in my R4 as some earlier versions did. DragonMinded did a competent job of squashing bugs in the customized gba_nds_fat that DSOrganize uses. As long as you keep about 5 percent of your card free, there shouldn't be much of a problem.
<br/>
<br/>
But I still want to make a text viewer/editor, just for the heck of it, because there are a few features that DSOrganize's editor doesn't have.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah thats happened to me before... I was working with the newest DSO, writing 2 faqs for games and then both got corrupt :( All you need to do, really, is just make two copies of the files... And also, which version of the dldi are you using? I know when I used v2 with the txtwriter, I got the corrupt graphics, but I think if you boot it with DSO and v1 dldi, it should work fine. Alot of apps I've found and used that  I booted from the GnM booter ended up with corrupt graphics, but when I booted with DSO, the graphics, for the most part (every so often there would appear some random colors), worked with no problem.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well since DSO seems to have <span style="font-style: italic">destroyed</span> yet another of my memory cards, I don't think I'll keep using it. And I get the corrupt graphics in TxtWriter no matter which patch I use.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what it's doing to these cards but it's really the only app I use lately that does any writing at all, and the same things have happened to CF cards in a GBAMP as with this MicroSD in a GnM. The filesystem gets corrupt and nothing will mount it anymore. Sometimes a full wipe succeeds, and then it works briefly, but after transferring a few files, it's corrupt again, even if I haven't used DSO after wiping it.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway that's besides the point, DSO and TxtWriter are really the only text editors I know of (excluding DSLinux &lt;_&lt;), so that makes things difficult.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here, use this combination of stuff. Use DSOS, then download BLARGHTextEditor. I know that Blargh works without any graphical corruption on patch version 1, and DSOS has auto patch and is run by iFile and works pretty well (can even launch GBA games straight off the main screen and can be linked to Moonshell, and has a custom skin file.)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

<br/>
(Also, I'm guessing the reason a full wipe of a faulty card still "succeeds" is due to cache... forgot about that when I tested it. V_v)<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

DSOrganize is actually doing permanent damage to your card?  I've never experienced that.  The only thing I ever get is a file system corruption, which can be solved without any problem by running Scandisk on the card.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sure seems to be. I can't see what else could be doing it; DSO is the only program I've been using that long, it's happened with both CF cards on a GBAMP and MicroSD on a GnM, using multiple different readers on the PC. The filesystem gets corrupted and then not even a total wipe fixes it; certain bytes of certain sectors (typically near the beginning) are no longer writeable. These were good cards too (Sandisk, Kodak, Kingston etc).
<br/>
<br/>
I really do have my doubts DSO is doing it (but it <span style="font-style: italic">does</span> corrupt filesystems quite reliably, which is annoying), I just don't see what else it could be, and I had heard reports of other apps using GBA_NDS_FAT doing the same before libFAT came around.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Come to think of it though, I wouldn't be surprised if Windows was doing something stupid to wear them out. &lt;_&lt;<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
