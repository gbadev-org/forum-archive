"an authorized developer must have a stable business organization with secure office facilities, equipment, personnel and financial resources"
<br/>
<br/>
That could be easily met for the most part.  And as long at the homebrewers can be classified as contractors or something simular, and their projects ported, homebrew could still make it in..
<br/>
<br/>
Or, if the dev house provided a service to port homebrew?  Dunno..  but I'm sure something could be done.

Looks like the XBox 360 maybe the cheapest (only?) console for officially supported hobbyist/homebrew. Maybe Nintendo and Sony will follow suit and provide something similar.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you seen the requirements to develop on one of those Qualcomm BREW phones? Every time you link your app, you need to sign it. Signing keys cost money, and they're available only to businesses, not hobbyists. Even Windows Mobile for Smartphones is getting on the forced-signature bandwagon by making it easy for network operators to require the use of Mobile2Market, which is also not available to hobbyists. And which phone has a decent D-pad?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I am signed up for a Wii dev kit.  It isn't for homebrew purposes, so I would rather not go into why I'm getting one.  All I will say is that smaller studios won't get their kits until three months after the Wii has been released.  This isn't because they can't manufacture them quickly enough, it is to give larger studios a 'grace period' in which to release their games before the market is flooded with games from the smaller studios, according to Nintendo.

No, I don't know the release date or price, and if I did, I wouldn't be able to tell you anyway (this should be obvious, but I thought I should 'cover my ass', so to speak).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Dosnt mater.
<br/>
My point was just that published platform can be any one of numberious things, not just "the big 3/4".
<br/>
<br/>
As for less machines, stuff like the Gizmondo, Wonderswan...heck, theres no date requirement is there?
<br/>
Could go back to Jaguaurs, CDi's...why not Spectrums and Commadores while we are at it ? :D
<br/>
I think the point is more that you have expirence getting something published, rather then any specific platform.

<br/>
oh,btw, and I hate mobile phones for games....the design of a good phone and a good console are mutaly exclusive.
<br/>
Its merely that I see absolutely hundreds of shit mobile phone games about...normal ripp-offs of clasic games with the latest film brand stamped on it. I dont think its that hard getting a mobile phone game published.
<br/>
Its like "hay I made this game"
<br/>
Publisher "Ok, its a game, can you re-brand it for this z-clase tv lisence?"
<br/>
"umm...sure".

Publisher "Ok, we are saleing this game for $2 a download, you will get a one off fee of $10..here you go"
