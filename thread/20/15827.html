    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I love the DS (sadly its being sent to nintendo for touch screen repairs), and its pretty much my computer lol. Now, I was wondering, is there any way to torrent on the DS? I know, I know, you're gonna instantly think "pirate" from this, but I was just wondering if there was a program for this out there? or perhaps something like a limewire port to the DS? :p<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Torrenting directly on the DS would be very tough to do.  It would be a whole lot easier to control a remote system, and have that PC do the downloading, and report status to the DS.  I think there are terminal bittorrent programs, so if there's telnet or SSH for the DS, you can do stuff that way.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It theory you might want to torrent animated gifs or something like that.  Perhaps the OP want to be able to distribute some kind of content via torrent?  FWIW, I don't really see the point when you have a computer, but I suppose some people sleep with their DS under their pillow...

Yeah, it does.  I got a bit bored with trying to squeeze everything into 4MB.  You can boot DSLinux without an expansion and perform simple commands like ls and rm, but even bringing up the wireless can cause out of memory errors.
<br/>
<br/>
I've never really tested ctorrent, but if people report it works (over at the DSLinux forums) I'll get it in the official builds.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
