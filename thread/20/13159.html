<br/>
The size is the same. Are the connectors the same?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: That includes both screens including the touch screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
why not? Some newer firmware NDS phats get a 4-level brightness option if they install flashme as they're detected as lites.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't care about the 4 levels. In the worst case it would always be at maximum, and that's ok for me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is what I know:
<br/>
NO
<br/>
1) FlashMe won't detect a phat as a Lite, and it would (likely) crash upon backlight change.
<br/>
2) Due to multiple backlight levels, the connectors are different.
<br/>
3) Due to general hardware differences, the connectors would be in different places.
<br/>
4) The firmware knows what screens are plugged in and will adjust as such.  It might get all wacky if the connected screens are wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But is it correct that only DS Phats that came with firmware 5 and above have the other hardware that is necessary for brightness switching?  I can't simply use NoFlashMe's Select button trick to install v5 on my v4 DS and gain brightness controls, can I?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, it's the Hardware, the firmware v5 thing is just used to tell how recent the DS is. Im currently lookig to trade my v2 DSPh for a v5 DSph, just for that. The lite isn't appealing to me.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
