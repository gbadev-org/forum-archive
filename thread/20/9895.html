Write one that shows two images (one per screen) and say your DS turns on and "hangs" (well, duh, images are static ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Or you can write a fake FW that does that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Its amusing, yes. 
<br/>
<br/>
He could still reflash the DS since flashed DS have 1 bit of info to allow recovery. Taihen and r0mloader dont delete this bit of info allowing you to continue.

M3s and possibly SCs however will get bricked.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What i would do is have it flashed with flashme already, then run the flasher agian but turn it on 50% of the way through, that should destroy the firmware.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so if I purposely brick my DS by turning off my DS in the middle of flashme, then I can turn it in and get a free DS Lite? What store would you recomend doing this? Is it troublesome persuading the people to exchange it? What exactly should I say?
<br/>
<br/>
What if they <span style="font-weight: bold">don't </span>take it back? I'd obviosly try 4 stores (target, walmart, EB, and Gamestop). But if none of em lets me trade for a DS Lite, or a regular DS.... is there a way to <span style="font-style: italic">unbrick</span> it?
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. My ds has a black shell on it (but I use the old back for the serial) Would they still let me? I don't have my silver shell anymore....
