    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">At home I have a modified Nintendo Wifi Dongle and I can use it fine but I went to my parents house and I wanted to show them Win2DS but they have a linksys wireless router and a couple of laptops.
<br/>
<br/>
How can I set it up to connect to one of those laptops?  How would the router know with laptop to connect to?  Which ip info do I use?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Type IPConfig in Command Prompt of one of the laptops.
<br/>
You'll see it's local IP. You can enter that to access DS2Win on that PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
