You've made an incredible modifier list on your site! Would it be possible to add more options (one for each slot in the inventory, for example) with the ability to place one of the values from your list? As in, if I wanted the ranch table in slot 10, I'd select the slot 10 option from the trainer and put in the numbers 1040?

I was thinking about making a PC/Windows version with a full map editor with a drag/drop interface (edit the 64x64 world map, put rocks where you want etc - or edit the contents of your house). Too elaborate to do as an NDS homebrew alone (unless you want to enter in hex codes)

The trainer is a program that edits the save game map. With a little programming it can add or remove any of the terrain features (or any dropped item/feature) you would like.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's more of an issue with games that share the same data between online and single player modes than a "modded console" issue. It was bound to happen eventually.

<br/>
<br/>
True for competitive games, where people use mods/cheats to improve their game play, and beat or otherwise harm other players (who don't have the cheats)
<br/>
<br/>
However Animal Crossing is not a competitive game. It is a sharing and showing-off game.
<br/>
Using the trainer (or the upcoming map editor) doesn't harm other people, but it gives you the ability to customize your world, and fill it with rare items.
<br/>
You can show off your creativity beyond the normal game.
<br/>
The online interaction is up to you, and only positive (ie. you help other players, you can't harm them).
<br/>
For example: by opening your town and giving away rare items or bags of bells

That's an interesting philosophical question. There are various scrupulous and un-scrupulous ways of obtaining items or bells in the game (with no added hardware). If your enjoyment of an item depends on how it was obtained:
<br/>
<br/>
Are you happy with someone who "time travels" to cheat the turnip market prices?

Are you happy with someone who kills hundreds of fishes to make money/bells to buy an item from a crooked store keeper ?

Sorry no - the houses are sometimes plopped down when you start the real AC program. Also other things like shells on the beach and weeds in fields appear when you restart the game.
<br/>
However with the map editor (coming soon) you can easily re-add your orchard in a new location or otherwise destroy or add things to the terrain.

I haven't figured out the format for the river. ocean and mini-lakes (yet?). However you can add rocks almost anywhere (rock walls around houses of villiagers you hate, or in the river), or easily make mazes out of rocks or tall trees.
<br/>
Also you can do some tricky arranging of your house contents (placing things on the stairs, placing objects on top of objects that weren't meant to, or in some cases place objects on the ceiling)

<br/>
There are already ways within the game to do most of these things, and will probably be safer than the program partying on an undocumented gamesave file.
<br/>
<br/>
The editor (and NDS trainer) focuses on things you can't regularly do in the game, or are tedious (like working to make money, or waiting for the right time to buy a rare items)
<br/>
<br/>
Some things, like the town name are in a number of places in the gamesave. Simply changing the string in all those places may work, but may have unknown side effects (since the names are used for WFC). I'd stick with the built-in game ways of doing things.
<br/>
For example: use time travel then go back in the editor for fast weeding; for changing your name, add a new resident. For a new town name/shape you are best off wiping out the old town. After the annoying prologue and nooks lame tasks, it is easy to build it up again with map editing and infinite wealth...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I notice that around some buildings like my own and the town hall, there's cobblestone. Does this fall into the same catagory as rivers and bridges? Because if you eventually find a way to solve that, it would be sweet if you could place cobblestone paths. 
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I have the most common paths I take marked by patterns on the ground (straight lines to buildings that don't bump into trees so I can just run without swerving). It's be cool to have a path from the gates to your house for guests to follow, or even a way of putting words down, although I can do that by using a bunch of patterns.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the background patterns are not that general.
<br/>
There are only 16 tiles (4x4) for the entire world (probably a leftover from the GameCube version - which had a very stark transition when you moved from tile to tile)
<br/>
What you put in each tile is limited. There are about 100 to pick from (rivers in various patterns, some with bridges, green space, green space with cobblestone, ocean front, etc). So you won't be able to lay-down detailed cobblestone paths, but you will be able to do major things.

If you are using the NDS trainer app, it compresses to SRAM. Be sure the game save is 64KB in size.
<br/>
If you are using another game save backup utility, the file should be exactly 256KB in size for the raw game save.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The L trigger on my DS doesn't work...
<br/>
Sorry, I intentionally picked L + R to be hard to hit accidentally - before updating the gamesave on the cartridge.
<br/>
If you have built NDS homebrew apps before, you can tweek the program to use another key (email me for source)
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, use a game save backup utility like "ETool".
<br/>
Then use my PC based Map Editor to manipulate the game save. It has many more features than the NDS version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Pretty good -- within the limits of the game (only gamesave editing, not game code tweeking)
<br/>
For the next release: (new features)
<br/>
+ Add Nook points
<br/>
+ River Edit (tile based terrain editing)
<br/>
+ Advanced World Edit - allowing you to move buildings around, or make copies
<br/>
( see teaser photo: <a href="http://www.aibohack.com/nds" target="_blank">http://www.aibohack.com/nds</a> - two copies of new years sign, 3 sisters store, 3 automobiles)
<br/>
+ Neighbor Edit - change the neighbor catch phrase or room contents.
<br/>
? TBD: change the neighbor species (the names/species/house types are hard coded, about 190 of them)
<br/>
? Change world name ?? still needs more testing
<br/>
<br/>
Still waiting for Action Replay to support the AC:WW game. Once that happens the world of AC:WW will change dramatically.
<br/>
<br/>
----
<br/>
&gt; there's a copy of my .sav file here if you want to take a look... 
<br/>
It is a 32KB file created by another save tool - that's only the first 1/8th of the raw gamesave (256KB)
<br/>
<br/>
If you use my trainer, it will compress the 256KB to something smaller like 32KB or 64KB. The Map Editor will load/save that format directly.
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, if you are using another game save backup utility (like ETool) it must be a raw gamesave that is 256KB in side (or sometimes 500 or 1024 bytes bigger)
<br/>
Backing up gamesaves is very hardware dependent (depending on your homebrew setup), so keep trying until you can get a 256KB raw gamesave on your PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I just tried the windows based editor... wow its amazing.

Actually I found this forum looking for a Method to compare savegames from different

states of play to find the right values to set.
<br/>
How did you actually figure it out? Trial an error Method?
<br/>
Which tools did you use? Please tell me I want to try editing other games ,too.

1. Could You implement a feature to stick custom Patterns to the ground        so that one can not "remove" them ingame (picking them up)?
<br/>
2. Windows based custom Pattern Editor?

3. Small preview pics of features (from Nooks catalogue) etc., actually I could capture those for You...

<br/>
&gt; How did you actually figure it out? Trial an error Method? 
<br/>
Yes - change small things, binary compare the game saves.
<br/>
Some things are relatively obvious (like the 64x64 cells for the world map), and some things are relatively obscure (like the 4x4 cells for the river/terrain tiles)
<br/>
<br/>
re: patterns / patterns placed on the ground
<br/>
As mentioned, Thulinma already has a pattern editor.
<br/>
I can do most things within the limits of the game save (not changing the code). If you want to keep a stranger from screwing up a message written on the grown, surround the pattern objects with rocks (each 1x1 in size)
<br/>
<br/>
That's separate from the background graphics used in the 4x4 grid that makes up the river, ocean, cobblestones, bridges etc (each 16x16 in size)
<br/>
For that there are only 16 bytes to play with - and the interpretation of those bytes is hard coded - not very flexible.
<br/>
<br/>
re: preview pics of items
<br/>
I don't see the need. Only some of the items have valid previews. Including their images gets into copyright issues too. IMHO: the names are more descriptive. If you don't know what they do, throw them on the map, run the game, pick them up and play with them as your ACWW character</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I wouldn't call it realtime town editing or 'hacking'.
<br/>
It is using a quirk in the system to drop items on the world map (or in the case of the tulip, inside your house) - combinations that aren't meant to happen.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is there anything we can do to help the situation? 
<br/>
The map editor can fix things after an attack (but can't be used to create the items for attacking other towns)
<br/>
<br/>
With real game save editing, you can do so much more.

<br/>
&gt;  I absolutely cannot get the save to back up correctly from a Flash Advance 128 Pro ...
<br/>
A lot of people have had problems with SRAM backups.
<br/>
When using my trainer (animala), it compresses the game save and places into SRAM. Look at the upper screen to see how big it is.
<br/>
Often people don't have the window set properly, and only get 32KB of SRAM saved to their PC. Check the instructions for your utilities or try one of the dedicated gamesave backup/restore utilities (ETool or RAIN - if they support your hardware)
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a file you think should work, hex dump it. Be sure it starts with "ANMLSAVE" and is at least 64KB big. The end part of the file should be filled with hex 55 55 (Letter 'U'). If the end is filled with 00 or FF, then likely only a part of the SRAM data is being saved.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It isn't the firmware.

You need a hardware mod (solder two pins)

<br/>
My philosophy:
<br/>
The Editor focuses on things that are tedious, difficult or impossible to do 
<br/>
in the real game.
<br/>
<br/>
Many of the suggestions I've received fall in that category (ie. very obvious and easy to do within the game) or are core part of playing the game (like the fluctuations of the turnip market or the weather)
<br/>
The donation thing is a good example, since money is cheap you over-donate - and the ungrateful Boondoxians forget to send you a feather.
<br/>
But in map editor mode, you are god of your town - make yourself as many feathers as you want ;-&gt;

<br/>
There are two types of fish and bugs, the "Item" type and the feature / "Furnature" type.
<br/>
IIRC the furnature type can be mailed, but can't be donated. The item type can't be mailed but can be donated.
<br/>
Mail the furnature type. Tell your friend to drop the furnature in their house and pick it up again -- it should turn into the item type (so they can donate it)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
It is a terrain type, like when you place trees and rocks on the world map (the terrain red tulip is at the top of the list in the world map editor)
<br/>
It isn't meant to be in your inventory. Nintendo screwed up. They haven't released a fix and I suspect they never will (they say "We're continuing to look into this issue...")
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; does exporting map in a graphical format count as impossible todo within the game? 
<br/>
Not sure what you are asking.
<br/>
If you print-screen the river editor or the world editor - it will give you a block-level schematic version of your town.
<br/>
To see the true game graphics, you must play the game (the map editor does not contain any Nintendo specific/copyrighted graphics)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Only what is built into the game. See the Terrain/Trees list in the map editor. All the regular trees come in 8 different sizes (from sapling, to mature with fruit, to mature without fruit in different seasons)
<br/>
There is also a generic tree, and the palm tree (with optional coconuts) with a few additional stages.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the shirt I delivered appeared in that villager's wallpaper slot! 
<br/>
Also you can mail letters with presents to the villagers. Apparently if the NPC like the item you send (ie. furnature), they will show it off in their homes. The map editor lets you edit the results directly.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I thought about it, but that's one of those "play the game" if you want to use that feature.
<br/>
ie. the reason for placing items in the museum is to show off what you found. Automatically filling out the museum doesn't give you anything does it ?
<br/>
[unlike the catalog - which lets you order items]
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Similar to many other feature requests, if you don't want them, don't add them in the museum (ie. it is technically possible, but the map editor is not a replacement for playing the game)
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Can you use this with a GBAMP? I read something about SRAM, so I'm guessing it doesn't work.
<br/>
My trainer requires SRAM.
<br/>
Try RAIN, I believe it works with the GBAMP

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">&gt; Yes, RAIN does work, so I would have to use the Windows app? 
<br/>
Good. The Windows app is much more functional than the NDS trainer.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is there anyway to eliminate the need for SRAM?
<br/>
The existing game save homebrew alternatives already do that (RAIN and ETool).
<br/>
My trainers rely on SRAM because it is simple and works for almost all "homebrew" setups. The GBAMP is the one major exception.
<br/>
<br/>
Doing full game-save editing on the PC (using the Windows app) is the best solution.
<br/>
The program is point-and-click graphical, large screen and forces people to make backups of their game saves.
<br/>
It also works with the $35 Action Replay, not requiring a full homebrew setup.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
The SuperCard gamesave format should be a raw file save. The editor already supports that file format (the exact file extension doesn't matter). The file should be exactly 256K (262,144 bytes). If not please email me a sample.
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does it work on the european Animal Crossing game??
<br/>
Yes, the gamesave format appears to be the same (ie. use the current AnimalMap editor).
<br/>
Makes sense since you want to be able to WiFi between US and European games (you can't do that between US and Japanese games for a number of reasons)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
