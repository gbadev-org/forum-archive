    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a class="postlink" href="http://ds.spacemonkeymafia.com/txtwriter.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold">TxtWriter</span></a> ... I just finished the 0.1 release of my first fully functioning DS application. It still needs more work, but it <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> working. It's a text writing application, using a virtual keyboard for primary text entry, with the directional and A/B/X/Y buttons for supplementary input (for space, return, shift, and backspace, respectively; paralleled on both sides). You can save the text files to a CF card, and even type in a filename for it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Any input would be appreciated. It's only been tested on a GBAMP, so I'm curious to find out if it works on the SC and M3.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">UPDATE</span> 11/6/05
<br/>
v0.2
<br/>
- file browser to open, edit, and delete previously saved text files in the TXT folder. And alphabetized.
<br/>
- rewritten text engine to support scrolling for long text files, and word wrapping.
<br/>
- file overwrite confirmation. 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">UPDATE</span> 11/6/05
<br/>
v0.2.1
<br/>
- fixed delete menu display bug
<br/>
- should now work with M3
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">UPDATE</span> 11/11/05
<br/>
v0.3
<br/>
- text console background
<br/>
- new font
<br/>
- new extended keyboard
<br/>
- key highlighting
<br/>
- home/end/pgup/pgdn &amp; arrow keys navigate text
<br/>
- cursor
<br/>
- dialog boxes
<br/>
- F-keys for opening &amp; saving files.
<br/>
- Clear button
<br/>
- internal editing
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">UPDATE</span> 3/20/06
<br/>
v0.3.1
<br/>
- Sektor fixed the M3 issue and updated it with the newest FAT library for me since I haven't had the time to do it. Big ups to him.

How would you check that? Do you a code sample? And this program, they're supposed to be switched. Now that I think about it, they don't need to be, so I might be able to change it and take out the lcdswap.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I was thinking about that ... but as it is, this is all new ground for me. :) When I tidy up the code a little bit and make it a little more logical (in a rush to get a working version done last night, my saving routines got kinda sloppy and hacked together), maybe someone else who understands GBA SRAM a little more than I (which would be anyone who knows anything about it) can take a look.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I wonder why it didn't work on the M3. Was it a general problem running or a saving problem?

I'm using Chishm's latest drivers, and I assumed it worked with the GBAMP and M3. :/ Looks like SC support has to be added in, but M3 should work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yeah, would be cool. But after thinking about it - it's not really useful, I think because backing up SRAM and so on - saving it as a TXT file makes more sense.

I have yet to figure out why it's doing this. But, I'm trying something with the 0.2 release, which should hopefully be ready in a day or two. I have a couple more things I wanna get done with it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was basing the initial set-up off of Headspin's keyboard example which did an LCDSWAP, but I realized it wasn't entirely necessary, so I've redone the screen set-ups to do away with that, so the keyboard is set to the sub screen. Hopefully this will take care of the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Swapped the displays to get rid of the lcdswap(), so hopefully anyone having inverted screens won't anymore.

probably the only thing i noticed was that if i deleted the second file in the list (of only two files) the prompt would stay on the screen after the rest of the text was updated. and the asterisk would also disappear until i pressed up
<br/>
i don't know why, but i kept looking down expecting to see a flashing light to indicate the card was being accessed...maybe i too used to seeing the light on the drives of my computer, but it would b kinda cool if you could get the power light to blink as sectors (or maybe a larger block of memory) are written to

oh, and maybe adding directory trees as a next/later step

<br/>
probably the only thing i noticed was that if i deleted the second file in the list (of only two files) the prompt would stay on the screen after the rest of the text was updated. and the asterisk would also disappear until i pressed up
<br/>
i don't know why, but i kept looking down expecting to see a flashing light to indicate the card was being accessed...maybe i too used to seeing the light on the drives of my computer, but it would b kinda cool if you could get the power light to blink as sectors (or maybe a larger block of memory) are written to
<br/>
oh, and maybe adding directory trees as a next/later step
<br/>
keep up the good work</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br/>
No, the screens are right. The title screen is on the top. I threw it together last minute and felt that people wouldn't be too confused for the time being.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm, I  thought I fixed that file issue, but I didn't test it with only two files. I'll check into that. I know why it's doing that, so it should be easy to fix. I hope. 
<br/>
<br/>
I think someone released the code to make the light blink. I'll see if I can find that.
<br/>
<br/>
And a directory tree is part of the plan, but just keeping things simple for now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, I'm focusing on the actual program right now, and hoping someone writes a combined FAT driver for all the various cards. :) I'm still new to C and programming for the DS, so just getting the GBAMP card to work was a bit of a challenge, let alone supporting multiple types.

I'm confused. I don't have that in my code. Instead of doing that, I just made the text the main screen, and the keyboard the sub screen and took out the lcdswap(). So, right now, there is no screen swapping.

Well, there wasn't until I added "powerON(POWER_ALL);".

I'm slightly annoyed that I have to LCD swap the screens. It just feels wrong because it shouldn't be happening that way. :/ Aw well. I guess it's more important for you M3 people to use my program than my code to feel right. :)

Here's the updated program with the screens swapped, and I went ahead and fixed the delete menu display bug that was reported. I was going to throw in the LED blinking when saving and opening, but that would take a little too much effort right now. That project will be saved for 0.3.

For simplicity in writing file names, I made it automatically add the file extension. Now that I understand how C strings work a little better now, I can do some string testing to add .TXT if no file extension is given. So, custom file extensions will definitely be added.

I'm tickled that you made a webpage with my app. :) And in response to what you wrote in the page, I am intending to add the ability to move around and edit within a document, and not just editing the end. I have all the text management done in an array in v0.2, so now I just have to work on the code to move text around in it. That's on the plate for v0.3. I've already upgraded to the keyboard from Headspin's example 4 in my dev code, since that has the home/end/pg up/pg down and 4 arrow buttons. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It also has a much spiffier user interface, and dialog boxes for confirmations and alerts. It has an updated extended keyboard and more use of the keys. The F1 key now saves a file and F2 opens the file menu so that all operations, except for delete, can be done via the touch screen.

Wow. That's ... yeah. I have no idea what's causing that. If anyone wants to dig around my source code and take a look, <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.spacemonkeymafia.com/download.php?file=txtwriter_0.3-source.zip" target="_blank">download v0.3 source</a>. I'm starting a new job tonight, so I'm not sure when I'll be able to really play around with it, and without an M3, I'm not even sure if I would be able to pinpoint the problem. And my code is far from perfect. I have been slowly cleaning it up as I go along, but there are lots of things that can be done better and some stuff was just hacked together to get it working quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears.

Maybe it is something like that...I don't think it's folk's CF cards since I have both an M3 and a GBAMP, it works as you'd expect in the GBAMP but with the M3 I get the same problem described above (this is off of the same compact flash card).<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm running into what I think are memory issues. For text manipulation I have two variables. A multidimensional array to account for such things as text display with word wrapping. Then, there's a Really Long String that acts as the file in and out buffer. If I make these too big, then stuff goes wrong and doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see it fixed, but there's a higher list of priorities, like the To Do list on my site, and getting it to work with the M3 again. And, personally, the way I think about it is that TxtWriter isn't an eBook reader. It's a note writing program. Jot down some ideas, make a shopping list, that kinda thing. If you wanna read a book on your DS, there are other programs out there that are far better suited.

I have flashcart (U-Disk, like M3) and v0.3 is not working properly. It starts directly to the scrambled screen.

I love the idea of a text writer, but I only can look the <a class="postlink" href="http://ds.spacemonkeymafia.com/images/txtwriter/txtwriter_0.3.gif" target="_blank">ss</a> in our homepage and have a dream of it working, ohh well. :(

I have tried run it like a game.. to run it like a rom... with loader... without loader.. nothing seems to work.

Any ideas how could I try to get it working?

Thanks! I'm glad a solution was found. Unfortunately, since my last update of the program, I've been way to busy with other things to do much with this (working a shitty job 40+ hours a week overnight shift really takes the drive to program outta ya). I'll update the stuff on my website at some point today and give you credit for fixing it. :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sad that I wasn't able to get the program where I wanted it, but atleast it's usable to more people now. I've also noticed other people making their own text editing programs, so my little program isn't filling as much of a void anymore. 
<br/>
<br/>
In a couple weeks, I'm leaving the job and moving, so either I'll have more time to get back into DS programming (either with this program, or maybe a game) ... or I'll have even less time. I'm hoping on the former. :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://ds.spacemonkeymafia.com" target="_blank">ds.spacemonkeymafia.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
