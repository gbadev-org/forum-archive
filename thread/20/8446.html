<br/>
The DS is custom-made for a browser, email, PIM &amp; VoIP client. Surely it's a matter of time before they appear (perhaps by Nintendo themselves).
<br/>
<br/>
Opera Mini is a 200Kb download and works on my Sony mobile phone - surely the DS is powerful enough to run this (and, yes, I do realise Opera Mini runs on Java - but still)

He took the "promise" back, saying that his test app was now the library test that he's offering. He also said that when the library was released, some people would probably be able to make a much more full featured client than his test app would provide, so he saw no point.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Another thing I'd like to see is an app that's specifically a Winamp remote, maybe with the ability to display the currently playing song on the DS.

I'm in fact working on a simple IRC client... Basicly just waiting for WiFi lib 0.3 release to get it working. Meanwhile, been thinking if <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8385" target="_blank">Didou's penstroke recognition</a> would be fun to be added - there's enough space for both keyboard and drawing area on the touchscreen when I leave all the text input on top screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as a chat client goes, we really have to get away from just using onscreen keyboards, imo.
<br/>
<br/>
Theres many writeing systems designed for mouse or stylus use that will be much faster.

<br/>
Stuff like dasher:
<br/>
<a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/" target="_blank">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/</a>
<br/>
(and many other systems like it. WinDS already has a version of something called Meds)
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to "keep up" with pc users, porting one of those writeing systems is a way to go,imo.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The dogs learn their names and commands (sit, stay, dance me some disco).  It works moderately well, even if you're not the one who trained it.

VoIP might be a lot of fun, too!

Also, I love Dasher.  That would be pretty awesome on the DS!  I wish I was better at using it.

<br/>
The newest release of <a class="postlink" href="http://www.youngmx.com/?loc=ndsdev/NDSDEV" target="_blank">DSOrganizer</a> also has a glyph system for writing with the stylus, so maybe we're getting pretty close to some kind of character recognition.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The idea was that the size and type of the text reflected the way in which it was said. So the typeface reflected the emotion  (Think of "Golden Sun" if you have played it)

Regarding handwriting recognition, I bet it would work better if you drew bigger letters. Like make them as tall as the screen when you write. It might be easier to distinguish between them that way. (It's certainly easier for a person to read larger print.)
<br/>
<br/>
If it doesn't take up too much resources, a word completion system might be neat too. As you write, it tries to determine which word you're writing, showing it in the corner or something. Double-click it to automatically enter the word.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
There are a multitude of problems with true handwriting recognition.  They are being solved, but the problem is on a level of complexity (and the solution on a level of sophistication) comparable to language translation tools.  But people have different methods for writing the same letters, and even different glyphs ("a" with and without the curve at the top, for instance) and they're all valid and human-legible - but very different.
<br/>
<br/>
Gesture recognition systems (Graffiti, Jot, etc.), on the other hand, work quite well.  The main disadvantage of using them is that the user has to learn the gestures the system recognizes.  The advantages are that since the gestures are simple and standardized, the processor can be small, efficient, and reliable - and the process of writing them is faster, as well.
<br/>
<br/>
It should also be noted that writing on a touchscreen is very different from writing on paper.  The friction is different, and even with "digital ink" the responsiveness is different.<br/>_________________<br/>---GEC

I think that all the work that's been done by the homebrew community so far to support people who want to program for the GBA or DS is amazing.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Idea for web browser interface:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I been thinking, and you know, I dont think the Opera/Nintendo method is best. Having a zoomed screen and an overall screen is the best you can do to replicate the look of a website on a pc.
<br/>
<br/>
But why do you need this?
<br/>
Isnt it better to replicate the functionality in the easiet to use/read fashion?
<br/>
<br/>
My preposal would be to have a full,zoomed out view on the bottom screen.
<br/>
Then, you click on something on the bottom screen (eg, a paragraph of text).
<br/>
<br/>
The text appears on the top screen then..not a zoomed view of the webpage, but just the text resized and wraped to fit the screen.
<br/>
There could be a scroll bar on one side, and you simply use the D-pad to go up and down.
<br/>
Much like moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, if you click on a jpeg, it appears on its own in the top screen where you can zoom in and out.
<br/>
<br/>
The more I think about it, the more I think this would be a superb interface. It gets around the problem of having to scroll the screen, and I think the results would make large blocks of text even easier to read then on the PSP's screen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
