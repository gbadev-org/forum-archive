    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yesterday,i wrote the sound demo(included with devARM)
<br/>
to my flash cart and for some reason anything that has
<br/>
text doesn't work, but the sound worked when i pressed A
<br/>
so i got curious and wrote another few and the only text that
<br/>
worked was the "custom font"!!my ds lite is V5.
<br/>
also most homebrew that i donwload works just not what i compile</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
