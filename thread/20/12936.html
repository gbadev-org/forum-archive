    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello,
<br/>
<br/>
A friend and I are trying to make a doom deathmatch between a Zaurus and a DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Before to play we have tested the connections locally.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">My friend (DS) :</span>
<br/>
<br/>
His computer host a server and he try to connect his DS on it.
<br/>
Some text appear on the screen, nothing connected and the last message is "Connecting via wfc data", when he tried any other ip, same behaviour, same message, nothing detected EXCEPT for the ip 192.168.0.1 (default DS ip) which says this thing :
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">192.168.0.1 doesn't correspond to any of his network hardware.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
The port 5030 is opened.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Me (Zaurus) :</span>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm connecting to my PC server with the local ip -&gt; it works.
<br/>
Same thing with internet_ip:port -&gt; it doesn't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Last line : "D_InitNetGame: Checking for network game"
<br/>
<br/>
Port 5030 opened too
<br/>
<br/>
If someone had any ideas to solve our problem, I'll be happy ^^</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, I have the same problem, getting to run multiplayer Doom DS. Already did a posting at Jefklaks Code site, but this topic probably also is worth a try :)
<br/>
<br/>
I got an M3 DS Simply card, DS Doom is running fine in single player using the shareware wad file.
<br/>
I downloaded and installed PrBoom 2.4.7 on two computers, startet a prboom_server.exe as told in the readme and had no problems starting a network game on those two.
<br/>
Now with the DS, I originally had trouble getting WiFi to work with homebrew software at all, until I realized that broadcast SSID had to be switched on. Connecting to my AP (using 128bit WEP) works fine now with NDSMail, wifi_lib_test etc.
<br/>
I put 192.168.1.7:5030 (local IP of the comp the server is running on) into the prboom.cfg, yet when I select network game, "Connecting via WFC data" is the only thing the DS says. The config file definitely gets read by DS Doom, tested that by setting the map?s background color to be the same as the automap?s walls.
<br/>
Any suggestions would be very welcome, thanks in advance.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Would still be cool if someone could shed light on this wifi issue with DS Doom though. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just to give a quick heads up: I got it to work, it was the Windows Firewall preventing the connection. It seems to forward packets by other Windows computers running Doom, but not those of a DS running Doom by default. Anyways, works like a Charm now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Good news on getting multiplayer working, have fun! :)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/" target="_blank">devkitPro - professional toolchains at amateur prices</a>
