    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">from what nintendo's been saying recently (Reggie in particular) to access the WiFi Connection from home you either need a compatible router (check the list at <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com" target="_blank">www.nintendowifi.com</a> or the USB dongle...actually, the site also suggests you need either of these two and that just a single PCI/PCMIA card won't work
<br/>
<br/>
homebrew wifi apps however should work with any setup<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It isn't confirmed, but seems the USB dongle only works with DS'es (you probably can't use it as a generic wifi card). 
<br/>
<br/>
But it's possible to use any USB/PCI card (not only a router) to setup an ad-hoc connection. It's just that you must manually setup it to share the internet connection and do the DHCP work, using the manufacturer's software. Since the steps to setup such thing varies from card to card, Nintendo decided to keep quiet about it. They aren't saying it's unsupported either.
<br/>
<br/>
The dongle is also needed if your router is using WPA or WPA2, since stupid Nintendo didn't add support to it, and the DS will simply hit a brick wall trying to connect to such networks. You can plug the dongle to a computer connected to the WPA network, and have it create a DS-only access point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I think it does, is the same as what a computer can make with an "ad hoc" network, which is a direct link between two computers, but in the DS's case, The DS and the computer.
<br/>
<br/>
So in theory, could you use a Wireless PCI card and make a ad hoc connection between a PC and the DS?</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

As long as your Wi-Fi adapter is compatible with the 802.11b standard, it should work with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection; however, we have encountered some stability and/or compatibility issues with some routers that are compatible with 802.11b, so we can't know for sure at this point. What I would recommend is visiting your manufacture's web site and check for an online or PDF manual for your adapter. It might not address your specific question, but it may be useful to help you troubleshoot any problems you may encounter once you get your first Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection game and attempt to connect.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Really??

Wow, now I don't feel quite as bad for not being able to get ad-hoc to work with my implementation :)

Of course, I'll still try to get it working... if they haven't done it though, no real guarantees can be made :|

If this is true, wouldn't it make it impossible to play Mario Kart on hundred-plus-mile van trips? Or what battery-powered AP would you suggest?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you can get internet access on 100-mile-plus van trips, more power to you.  However, there are several ralink-based cards (including the nintendo USB stick) that act as soft-APs, and could be used for this purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
(oh, and - ds to ds multiplayer isn't ad-hoc. they're using a custom auth scheme that's a bit more similar to an AP associacion)
