    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It seems that the Big N is setting up demo kiosks in the near future that allows downloadable demos, movies, or game content. Sweetness!

So, does this mean that it will be possible to get a hold of these like the homebrew community was able to get their hands on the E3 Demos? That's be even *more* sweeter.
<br/>
Oh, and anyone know how to go about dumping the wifi-downloadable demos?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by dualscreenman on Fri Feb 10, 2006 10:44 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Yes, I know, which is why I am asking if it is possible to dump these like done with the E3 Demos <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/" target="_blank">http://www.akkit.org/DS/E3/</a>, and how to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hopefully not. At least we have some FatPorts hotspots for WFC. EB Game, Best Buy etc. should at least get them. It's a marketing tool so people can try games before they buy them, I see no reason why Nintendo wouldn't want to increase their sales in Canada.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe a wrapper for the firmware, so you select download play and it write to CF card at the same time as it's downloading.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
