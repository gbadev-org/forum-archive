<br/>
EDIT: Of course, I go and forget that Soldat is closed-source. Bleh. Soldat Clone DS anyone? :-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Wow! From the description it sounds pretty cool! (Inspired by Worms, with elements of Counter-Strike and Quake? Count me in!)
<br/>
<br/>
Too bad about there being no source, A clone it is then!
<br/>
<br/>
I would offer to help, but the only thing I could really do is help with testing, or game advice :-/<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

(I find it funny that they offer a registered version for money, and yet they ripped plenty of sounds from Quake, Counter-Strike, and I'm sure elsewhere...)<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Actually, the <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake" target="_blank">sound effects in Quake are made by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails</a>, they are not just licensed from some stock library.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Reznor has been known to use samples in NIÐ˜ music. For instance, Reznor bought John Lennon's Mellotron analog sampling keyboard. <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_to_God" target="_blank">"Closer" samples an Iggy Pop song</a>, and there are <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Downward_Spiral#Track_information" target="_blank">plenty of other samples on <span style="font-style: italic">The Downward Spiral</span></a>.

Something tells me this is unlikely, because if they belonged to an audio library, it would probably be costly, and probably more popular.
<br/>
<br/>
The game was clearly inspired by both games, they probably originally made it not intending to sell a registered version.
<br/>
<br/>
There are other freeware games that use Counter-Strike sound effects, Counter-Strike 2D for one. Even though its free, I'm guessing using the sounds is still technically illegal?<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.
