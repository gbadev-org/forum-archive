    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Does anyone know of a homebrew program that can restore saves off your computer (from Wi-Fi, apparently. Savsender can send the saves to my computer, but I don't think it can receive them), or from a R4/M3 Simply to a commercial game card (READ: NOT A ROM)?
<br/>
<br/>
If this program has not been created, is this possible:
<br/>
I saw that some save managers used the SRAM to save the game data. Is there enough room in the Slot-1 SRAM to save the save information and a small program that replaces the save data in the cart?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Copying a sav from R4 to DS card should work, as the hardware supports hot-swapping from R4 to DS card even if not the other way. Does this game use a 2 Mbit flash?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
