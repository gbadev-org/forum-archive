your wolf3d port (the preview) is just awesome and it will help other ones porting games, which use the same(or modified) engine(like "Rise of the Triad","Corridor 7","H.U.R.L.","Nightmare 3D" or "Blake Stone"),easier to the DS.
<br/>
thank you
<br/>
<br/>
I guess duke3d uses a completly different engine though.
<br/>
but maybe the already existing "hexen" and "heretic" ports would help...<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I do remember, however, that RotT's engine was quite similar to Wolfenstein's, but RotT had some vertical movement. (Mostly via jump pads and lifts.) By "similar", I mean it used a block-based map system like Wolf3D, rather than a vector-based map system like Doom and later FPS games used.

Wolf3d is around 13 years old and even on fast hardware it doesn't run full speed all the time. Though replacing floating point operations should take care of that.

<br/>
Doom for example...

<br/>
- Replace all calls to alloca() with calls to malloc/free
<br/>
- Add in DS filesystem code
<br/>
- Write the input/sound/video driver

Sort the textures by their use, load as many as you can, and replace the rest with random ones already in memory. Nobody will notice, right?

from what i remember of duke nukem 3D, the characters, enemies and pickups were (are) all 2D in 3D space...in fact, the walls were too, so the only  big limitation is the textures

If anything, you would want to work with Jono on such an undertaking (Who receives help from Ken, thus he is the man to talk too). However, there is no point, as the DS would never be able to run full fledged BUILD games (even if you took out voxel support, which pretty much castrates the engines greatest feature).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Duke3D, despite the name, didn't use polygons for rendering.  It rendered the world in a very specialised way, using horizontal and vertical spans (that's the reason that looking up in the game looked so funny - it was a kludge done via shearing).  So to get it working using the DS 3D hardware would be a major amount of work (you'd probably want to start from an OpenGL port).
<br/>
<br/>
The DS resolution is 256x192.  That's why I'm thinking that a direct port might work (although much of the build engine is in assembly language).  Hmm I wouldn't be surprised if Duke Nukem Advance used the same sort of span renderer that Duke3D used.  Back in the day of pre-hardware acceleration it was a fast (if limiting) technique compared to a fully 3D engine (like Descent).
<br/>
<br/>
Also it looks like people have ported Duke3D to various other handhelds/PDAs.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm who was it that ported Wolf3d?  I was just browsing the sources and  there is mention of "dynamically compiled scaling routines" -- is this referring to some sort of SMC?  Is that possible/just as fast on the DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yes, it referred to just-in-time compilation of a separate scaling routine for each strip height. This worked on 80286 memory hierarchy. But given ARM conditional execution and "slow" memories used in the GBA and Nintendo DS, it might not be significantly faster than a simple column scaling loop.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Now adays, hardware accelerated rendering is the preferred method so a for things like wolf3d, doom, duke nukem 3d maybe it's best to re-write the engine and port the game to the new engine rather than the old engine to a limited platform.
<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about this for my nds wolf3d port, at each map load every room ( seperated by doors ) would be converted from 2d map tiles into 3d quads. I haven't thought about visibility yet, but that should be easy enough. The advantage to rendering the game this way are:
<br/>
- You would never reach the 2048 poly limit ( well, for wolfenstein anyway ).
<br/>
- Less game time spent drawing in software leaves time for other things.
<br/>
- Smooth, 60fps gameplay.
<br/>
<br/>
By writing your own engine, you could even get quake working on the DS.
<br/>
You would need to write your own engine though, but being written from the ground up ensures that the game feels at home on it's new platform rather than a port of the pc version.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

for a start the snes version is nothing like the pc version.  theres no source code to it, it written on a totally different processor and makes uses of the superfx chip also, porting it would be total insanity!

would it be better to port one of the opengl versions of  doom/wolf3d since they already convert them into 3d (also the new node builders remove a lot of the errors in the maps like t-intersections)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Super FX chip is just a 20 MHz 32-bit RISC CPU, right? The ARM9 is a RISC CPU clocked at three times that. I'm not familiar with the Super FX instruction set, but if we can get some sort of static binary translation going...

<br/>
Half the work is already done for you, just grab one of the dozens of doom engine ports and start hacking.
<br/>
Hell, there may not even be memory problems - I may have just had some other code issues at the time I tried to port doom.
<br/>
Though, working with wolf3d has taught me alot about nds hardware.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

speaking of that......how is it going?Any major problems so far?
<br/>
The pre-version you released was already stunning...especialy the framerate.<br/>_________________<br/>Abusing Cube and DS with all sorts of homebrew and hacks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Right now I have to deal with:
<br/>
<br/>
- GBAMP File creation bug
<br/>
- Design and write a compressing filesystem for SRAM
<br/>
- Finding an embedded romdisk in memory ( should be easy though )
<br/>
<br/>
All except the last one are especially preventing a new release since I would like to get saving working. The spear demo I embedded was fine without saving because it only had 2 levels.
<br/>
<br/>
Though my latest flashcart builds have had saving for a long time, it was ripped out at the last second.
<br/>
Instead of only allowing saves at the start of every level, I decided to compress the large ( 35kb ) full wolf3d saves so that flashcart users could save anywhere at anytime.
<br/>
<br/>
Another issue is music, the FM OPL emulator that came with the SDL version and the code that uses it are horribly uncommented.
<br/>
For example:
<br/>
<br/>
- A Function is called "Blah()"
<br/>
- Hex values passed to the OPL emulator without any comments explaining what the values are or what they do
<br/>
<br/>
Either way the emulator doesn't work on the nintendo ds, I tried running it but somewhere a call to malloc() fails so I think it's too memory intensive to use anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
