    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Do we know if those two other metal things in the DS's battery compartment serve any purpose?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">They are exposed, but it is best not to touch these, as they are LCD voltage level adjustment controls.  Essentially, the average voltage on the lcd over time should be around 0.  Adjusting these controls requires training/speciallized equipment.  Leave them alone.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
