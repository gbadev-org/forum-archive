    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been out of town lately so I utilized the browser in DS organize to download additional files to mess around with. Also I moved several episodes of a tv show onto the card before I left. Now that I'm back, the photo printer I normally use to link the card to my computer says "reading card" , but just stays there. I left it for an hour or so and it didnt change, and when I tried to open it as a removable drive the computer didn't detect it. Any suggestions and/or help?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's also possible the card is bad / has gone bad, it happens. Hopefully it's still under warrenty (usually they have a several year one), and you can get it replaced</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
