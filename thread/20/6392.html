    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know that the GBA has severe limitations on it's ability to display colors and the resolution was pretty low, but could the DS be used with CDisplay to show archives of jpegs and pngs? I'm imagining a thumbnail of the image on the bottom screen with a box highlighting a zoomed in part of the image on the top screen. Dragging the stylus on the bottom, scrolls the zoomed area on the top. 
<br/>
<br/>
Keeping in mind that most images are 500-700 KB and somewhere around 900 x 1400 dpi, how much zoom would have to be used to make the images readable and would the DS be able to keep up with the scrolling?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, CDisplay is available at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/davidayton/CDisplay" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/davidayton/CDisplay</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I can't get demo 10 to work on either my Supercard or GBAMP. I do have flashed firmware and have tried using WifiMe. Demo 1 worked without a problem. But when I try booting 10, I get a black top screen and the four values at the bottom stay at zero no matter what buttons I press or where I touch the screen. Would this need to be coded differently for use with the CF loaders I have?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I believe the way doublec uses gbfs will only work if it's booted from a flashcart. Neither CF nor WMB will work with it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If someone is working on this, you should talk to natrium42. He has GPS working for the DS using GIF images from Google Maps. He's using the GBA MP and says the limit for the map images is the capacity of the CF card. It sounds like he's figured out how to bring in images on the fly. And his work supports zoom layers (seperate image sets, though). Seems like a short hop to a cDisplayer.

<br/>
I've been desperately trying to find a comic book reader since I setup my DS for homebrew and found this thread to realise that it hasn't been updated in a year!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm 100% incapable of coding this but would love to contribute via donating or something similar.  1000s of others and myself would love to see something like CDisplay on the DS lite/phat!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The archive decoding won't be such an issue, since the images are usually already stored in a compressed format...

<br/>
Also, the memory limit can be worked around. I think 32mb+4mb would be more than enough to handle generally speedy viewing...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

Well, DSOrganize views images with a thumbnail on the bottom and you drag a viwing square around for the top screen.  The problem is that you can't rotate the image 90 degrees for a more native comic/manga shape, and maybe some good scaling would be nice...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

theres a problem:

<br/>
<br/>
1. Use the magic unlock code.
<br/>
2. Write to 0x8000000 as if it were just regular memory! (only issue is you must write in 16bits or greater, however the same limitiation occurs with VRAM, so it's not too big of a deal.)

Here are the magic unlock codes for M3, and Supercard:

Looks rather beautiful. That may just be the bright and clear screenshots posted on top of nice looking DS-Lite trick, though.

Unfortunately, it doesn't stream from FAT; it just has a PC program which turns a comic book file into an NDS file.

I'm hoping upgrades to that will follow...<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I have yet to encounter any bugs or major problems except I have a few things that could be improved on
<br/>
<br/>
 - Needs an ability to zoom in (even further) because for double page comic scans I am unable to read it due to the low resolution that the PC program converts it to

<br/>
 - When making .nds files, have an option to just choose which format you'd like and not create all of them (.sc.nds, .nds, .nds.gba)
