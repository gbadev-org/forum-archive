    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are some people who've toyed with the idea.. The fact that the Linksys WRT54G router uses a linux-based OS, and is actually very actively edited by some communities, it seems like it's possible.. Though, no one's tried.
<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, it still probably wouldn't work with new Firmware'd DS's..<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

If you just want to download stuff to your DS quickly, use Bafio's WiFi Transfer. Acts pretty much like a WMB application ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And, WiFiMe is actually NiFiMe.  Meaning, it uses NiFi protocol, not WiFi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NiFi, simply put, doesn't exist (the WMB protocol isn't the same as the pictochat protocol or the in-game comms of the pre-WFC games, they're all raw comms on top of wifi).  WMB and pictochat share similarities in their beacon advertisment design, but more because they were written by the same people, rather than because they use the same protocol.
<br/>
<br/>
WifiMe *is* wifi, since WMB (and every other piece of comms out there using the DS wireless) adheres (tenuously) to the 802.11 standard, trademarked Wifi.
<br/>
<br/>
Wifi just means layers 1 and 2, it doesn't say shit about TCP/IP, etc...<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You can't use a router for that, you need a PCI or PCMCIA card with ralink chipset.  The M3 menu doesn't work with WifiMe either.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
