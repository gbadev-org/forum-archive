I wish I could add things to the address book though :(

Also, a little suggestion: We need to be able to clear items from the calendar in the full calendar view. Also, when an item is cleared, its file should be deleted from the directory or the program gets confused.
<br/>
<br/>
The day planner seems to randomly mess up and forget to list items...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very nice app. I can't wait to see what comes of it! (And what those other three sections are... and what I can configure in the configuration section!).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Thanks for adding the Previous/Next function to the day planner ^^.
<br/>
Everything works, including New File, Rename, Delete, Copy&amp;Paste. 
<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions: Bind X and Y to always be Up and Open respectively. Because when copy and pasting a file you need to hit L or R to get back to Open and Up in order to navigate to another directory and then back again to the paste option to paste the file. A minor annoyance I can live with, no biggy.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I notice when the browser classifies somethign as a text file, A goes from N/A to Open. Is this a hint at a possible text reader/editor in the fututre?
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Oh, and I know it only works on GBAMP, but when opening NDS files on Supercard SD it just blinks quickly and returns to DSOrganize Home. Not sure if you knew exactly what happened when we tried anyway.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, but for big files that take up 51% of the CF card, that wouldn't work.

Is this, or something similar on the to-do list? It would be really nice if you implemented something like this later.
<br/>
Also, do you have any intentions of either:
<br/>
<br/>
a. Improving the handwriting recognition
<br/>
<br/>
or
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The HTML help is a nice feature (and I like how it spans both screens... I'll get into that later)... is this an actual full blown HTML parser that intelligently tosses away anything it doesn't know how to do, or is it specifically built around the help content?
<br/>
<br/>
I have just tried out the Gif viewer and it works beautifully (I'm also surprised that Moonshell doesn't do that...), the text editor is very clean and pretty, and the syntax highlighting on ini files seems to work perfectly.
<br/>
And even with all that, it looks like there are still two new features to come!
<br/>
<br/>
First, a bug report :(
<br/>
When in the address viewer, if I have no vcard files, it'll give me an error that there are none present and there are no options displayed on screen. Pressing B, however, will create a new one... which leads me to believe that this is just an old error message which you forgot to remove from before vCard files could be created by DSOrganize.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, my comments on help text spanning both screens... I love this feature and hope to see it used more.
<br/>
The text viewer may very well be my favourite text viewer so far on the DS. Just two things that I think could perhaps be done to make it better:
<br/>
-Perhaps there could be an option to open in read mode (or change to read mode), which removes the onscreen keyboard and instead makes text span both screens like the HTML help. (With X and Y perhaps also then becoming optional buttons to page up and down?)
<br/>
-Could it (or is it) possible to control the text size somehow, to be able to see more information on screen at once?
<br/>
<br/>
Other, more fiddly and perhaps ungrateful sounding requests:
<br/>
-Bookmarks? :P You seem to have one of the best bits of DS software in terms of storing information, so I'm sure it wouldn't be too tricky.
<br/>
-It would be cool if I could tell the file browser to open a file with the text viewer, even if it isn't a txt or ini file. (For example, if I wanted to blindly edit an HTML file).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <h4>#77654 - HyperHacker - Sun Apr 02, 2006 4:50 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Oooh, this is nice! I was starting to worry it was dead. My thoughts/notes as I go through...
<br/>
<br/>
I see the directory structure is changed. Nice, but I still have reminder and day planner files from the old version, what do I do with them?
<br/>
Upon further research, looks like I can just drop them into the DAY and REMINDER directories. And I bet that's documented in some readme I didn't notice and I look like an idiot for asking. &lt;_&lt;
<br/>
<br/>
On bootup, I get two white screens until I tap the touch screen a few times.
<br/>
<br/>
Still doesn't show Japanese names correctly, or names with symbols (such as the A/B/X/Y buttons).
<br/>
<br/>
You can still select "Not Implemented" as the startup screen. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
Being able to create V-Card files is great; now the Address Book actually has some use to me. ;-) The keyboard in this version seems very sensitive, though, and keeps thinking I pressed things far from where I actually did (the previous version worked fine). When in Caps Lock it can be confusing; the Caps Lock key should maybe be highlighted in red. Very nice keyboard though, even though it's the same as all the other versions, just thought I'd mention that. It's easy to use, which is good because I can't seem to get handwriting to work at all (I managed to write a T, then backspace it and write an I when I wanted to write an E and not backspace).
<br/>
Also, I was worried it wouldn't support Canadian postal codes, but it seems to just fine. Yay!
<br/>
<br/>
The file browser is... well, the same as before really. Though it seems to be thinking I pressed L or R when I didn't fairly often. My L button has been a bit unresponsive, so who knows, but it worked perfectly in a Mario Kart session just a few hours ago. It might also be the same problem as the keyboard, thinking I'd hit the L or R icons, but it didn't do other such things (randomly selecting files, closing the browser etc) so probably not.
<br/>
<br/>
Opening .rem files shows the date in the calendar, cool! However it doesn't actually look at the file's content. I opened one for March 31st from the old version which was just kinda in the root directory until I figure out where to put it (well, I <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> delete it &gt;_&gt; but there's others), and it highlighted that date, but didn't display anything. I guess that'd be difficult to implement.
<br/>
Oh, and opening .dpl files shows the date in the day planner. Kinda expected that after noticing the above. :-p
<br/>
<br/>
Looking again at the main menu, it's nice that the icons are big enough to touch with your fingers, but since you need the stylus for most other functions, this isn't terribly useful. (True you can do a few things with the buttons, but then, you can select the options with the buttons too. :-p) Could there be an option to use smaller icons, so they'd all fit on one page?
<br/>
<br/>
Also in the browser, it might be useful to display the memory card's capacity and used/free space on the top screen. (Or does the FAT lib allow you to determine these?) Maybe show things like the dimensions and metadata of an image if one is selected.
<br/>
<br/>
Image viewer, frickin nice. Be even nicer if it supported zoom though. (Sorry if I sound demanding, just listing things I think would be nice to see.) I think it's the first to support animated GIFs on the DS. Doesn't support RLE bitmaps, though. I have code which can load any bitmap except 4-or-less colour, if you want it.
<br/>
<br/>
Text editor, also very nice. It even wraps text, unlike some viewers. :-p I do have some suggestions, though.
<br/>
1) Use it more as a viewer; in place of the keyboard, show more text.
<br/>
2) Ability to turn the text sideways, so you could hold the DS like a book. Would go especially well with the above suggestion.
<br/>
3) Txtwriter-like shortcuts. If you've never used it, here's a brief description: The keyboard has up/down/left/right keys used for navigation, and the buttons are used in editing. Up/X is Shift, Left/Y is Backspace, Right/A is Space, and Down/B is Enter. (Using both buttons means it's good for lefties too.) It's truly an ingenious feature and I'd love to see it done here too. Perhaps L/R could switch between this and the standard A=Save, B=Cancel, Dpad=Navigate layout.
<br/>
4) Option to use a fixed-width font, maybe 6x6 or 8x8. (If you've ever used my GBA Booter, you may have noticed the 6x6 font; feel free to ask for it. I intend to release the source code with the next version anyway. I didn't make the font, though.)
<br/>
<br/>
Syntax highlighting in INI files. Holy shit. Are you planning to put a compiler in here? :-p (Actually a sort of BASIC-like language for coding on the DS would be pretty cool, but I don't expect to see one in this app.)
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, weird things happen if I hold Shift and poke at the Dpad in the text editor. I screwed up the syntax highlighting somehow. (Probably just added a space.)
<br/>
<br/>
The built-in help is very useful. I didn't know about a lot of these features. Cool!
<br/>
<br/>
One small problem I noticed in the browser is it's very difficult to copy a file to the same directory with a different name. You have to copy it to a different directory, rename the copy, copy it back to the original directory, then delete the copy in the other directory. I was hoping that copying, renaming, and then pasting would do the trick, but once I've renamed a file, it forgets that I hit Copy. (It goes back to Copy rather than Paste.)
<br/>
For that matter, a Move option could save some time. If you just did it by changing the file's name and path, rather than copying and deleting, it'd allow you to move files when their size is more than is available on the card.
<br/>
Hm, it also doesn't prompt if you want to overwrite a file when you paste in another directory and one with that name already exists. Just overwrites it.
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, just two white screens if it can't load error.html. Makes sense.
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously this is sweet. All it needs now is an MP3 player. ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Whoops, found a typo in the help file for the day planner. "Use the and [down] buttons or the stylus" - the up image is missing.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I thought of a nice addition to the day planner/calendar the other day. Whenever the program starts up it should store the current time and date in an INI file or similar. Then on the next startup it reads that date and deletes any day planner or reminder files between then and now, and stores the current date. That way you don't have reminders in there for last month or something stupid like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Woah, something weird just happened. When I went to delete a file, it popped up a keyboard. I accidentally closed it right away. I hit Delete again, and it did so, but garbage appeared on the screen for a second; afterward, some random letters were displayed on the top screen. O_o
<br/>
[edit] This happens every time I delete a file, except the keyboard thing (maybe I hit rename or something). The letter H flies across the top screen and stops near the top right corner. Afterward, a nameless directory, not visible on the file list itself, is selected. I can't rename it, but I can open it; this takes me to the root, but I can't select any files; hitting B a few times goes back to the directory I was in, then it works again. (Seems like the '..' directory is selected.) After deleting a few more files, instead of the letter 'H' it's a lot of numbers. This doesn't seem to happen when deleting the last file in the list.
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I see some interesting fields in sample.lng. Memory? Working? Choose Pallate (sic) File? Heh, you can even change the alphabet. O_o The "Brwoser" section is misspelled, though.
<br/>
<br/>
[another edit] Hm, this time when I deleted a file, it selected a zero-byte file with no name, not on the list, and a question mark for an icon. The only text on the top screen is "File Size: 0.0b", but it's repeated. Not gonna try to copy/rename it (can't open it) as I just entered like 20 entries into the address book and I don't want them to get corrupted.
<br/>
Speaking of which, I noticed you can't delete entries from the address book; you have to do it in the browser. Also that keyboard bug gets to be quite a problem. It especially likes to randomly insert the letter i, presumably because it thinks I'm drawing one.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by HyperHacker on Sun Apr 02, 2006 6:53 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

3. Vcards! Works well. Perhaps they should save to the directory, not the route though?
<br/>
<br/>
4. The simple HTML help is nice.   (from what I can see; &lt;p&gt;,  &lt;head&gt;,&lt;title&gt;,&lt;br&gt;,&lt;font color=###&gt;,&lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; tags are supported...as well as custom bits to write button press's! :D)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br/>
I would like... ;</span>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Add HTML reading/writeing to any file. (Dont worry, I dont mean a browser, but any simple html file should be able to be opened as if it was text).  This could help make HTML help become standard for other homebrew apps :)
<br/>
<br/>
2. If you do the above, add a few more basic tags supported. (&lt;center&gt;,&lt;code&gt;,&lt;tt&gt;,&lt;big&gt;,&lt;small&gt; ect)
<br/>
<br/>
3. Fine tuning the text reader for reading books.  This simply means bookmarks really. (and a way to quickly go to a specific "page")
<br/>
<br/>
4. Support for the "Application Loading Path Standard" in this thread;

<br/>
<br/>
Now for my comments on this... Well, first of all, w00t and thanks again.
<br/>
I see you fixed that "random L button press when using touch screen" bug. Good, I thought my DS was messed up! :-p
<br/>
Hm, was that Ins button always on the keyboard? I see there's a Delete button on the address book's keyboard too. Not going to press them, but do they ask for confirmation? It'd suck to accidentally press them, especially since many DS apps have touchscreen accuracy problems on certain DSes.
<br/>
The todo list is cool, but I see no way to set a priority or mark a task as being completed. Also it appears the Delete and Clear buttons don't ask for confirmation. (And although it doesn't hurt anything, it doesn't make sense to have a Delete button when creating a new entry. :-p)
<br/>
A paint app, yay! I've really been wanting one of these, but never got around to making my own. No more crappy ASCII diagrams in the text editor! Nice description in the help file too. Even has a colour picker with custom colours. There are only two minor problems I see here: One, it's difficult to get the slider to the top since it's difficult to actually touch that area with the stylus, and two, no R/G/B display. (No need for an actual numeric input, just showing the numbers would be fine.) I can't believe all these features... line and box drawing, flood fill, eyedropper, multiple line widths, spraycan (though the spray area is HUGE), colour replacement, even a text editor! You should be selling this app to Nintendo or something man!
<br/>
Woah, it's freaking out after I closed the scribble pad. The top screen keeps alternating between what it should be and a rectangle (much like the rectangle drawn around a selected menu item) everywhere I go, and it didn't save the image. (I think I might have forgot to make the directory to save them in. ^_^; ) It stopped doing that after I viewed a JPEG, though. There was also a single character in the top left corner, but it was white so I couldn't make it out. (I was hoping viewing a JPEG with a dark background would help.) Speaking of directories, there's no way to make one.
<br/>
...Yeah, it's working now that I created the directory. Oops! Although it appears the only way to delete the image is from the file browser.
<br/>
Coloured buttons and more functions in the calculator. Oooooooh... If this could convert to hex/octal/binary and maybe gradians, I'd never need another calculator. (Any plans for graphing functions? May as well use that empty top screen space for something. :p)
<br/>
Heh, the buttons all appear white when viewed from a certain angle.
<br/>
Hm, my CF card seems to have got a bit messed somehow. One of my .vcf files is in the root directory and has no extension. Windows also shows it with a ? in front of its name, and it's only 7 bytes, no information in it at all. Yay backups!
<br/>
Hm, actually, I don't have such a file in my backup. I think I deleted or renamed it quite some time ago. O_o *Does a disk check to be safe* Also I notice it shows the "." and ".." directories when hidden files are enabled.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, a small suggestion: The address list should show the nickname, if any, in brackets next to the real name.
<br/>
Also, general suggestion to anyone doing DS dev out there: A program which could record sounds from the mic and save it as MP3 or simple compressed (maybe zipped) WAV would rock. I may do it, but I'm pretty busy.
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, now that there's a scribble pad, can we expect to see it expanded to be able to edit any BMP, PNG and maybe JPEG or GIF file from within the browser? I mean you could already just drop a BMP or PNG into the SCRIBBLE directory and edit it that way, but that's not very convenient. :-p (Hey, and now you can make borders for my GBA Booter right on the DS!)
<br/>
<br/>
Also I realize these are unlikely, but can we expect to see an MP3 player or hex viewer/editor? I mean they're practically the only things left this doesn't do. ;-) (Hex viewing at least is great for seeing what's in that random file you don't recognize, and pretty easy to implement.)
<br/>
<br/>
[edit] Hm, it did indeed corrupt a few things, some files went missing. Probably from trying to save an image when the directory didn't exist. Come to think of it, that rectangle looked quite a bit like the progress bar shown when saving an image.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Unfortunately I've found a few more problems/bugs. I found most with the previous version, but I checked to make sure they're still valid.
<br/>
<br/>
In the scribble pad:
<br/>
-Weird things happen if you save an image while drawing a text box. Not only can you do this by pressing L before you release the stylus, but also by drawing a box too small for any text.
<br/>
<br/>
-Lack of undo and cut/copy/paste make it difficult to recover from mistakes. (It doesn't help that it occasionally reads the touch screen wrong, causing big lines to appear.)
<br/>
<br/>
-Due to the DS's design combined with touchscreen accuracy problems, it's nearly impossible to reach the edges of the screen. This makes it difficult to use the fill tool on areas at the edge, such as when drawing a boat in the water.
<br/>
<br/>
-Small white squares appear in the image randomly. Sometimes they cannot be erased. (Haven't seen this in the latest version.)
<br/>
<br/>
-If a corrupt PNG is present in the SCRIBBLE directory, selecting the scribble pad freezes the program. The corrupt PNG was actually created when the previous version glitched up while saving for no apparent reason. (Over 100MB left on the card.) The progress bar jumped around, it swapped the screens, and it froze.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the image viewer:
<br/>
-8-bit PNG with alpha displays stretched and miscoloured. Interestingly, the image is not skewed.
<br/>
<br/>
-Large images cannot be rendered, however, it does not explain why. Moonshell would freeze when opening them, which suggests that they are too large, but others with larger file size and dimensions work OK. With very large images or animated GIFs (300x300, ~8 frames) it just freezes. (Not tested on current version, but it all acts the same.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the calculator:
<br/>
-acos(0) = 90.0000000003?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In other places:
<br/>
-X and Y don't work when renaming files.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It also doesn't seem to be writing files properly. When I rebooted Windows with the CF card inserted, it removed several nonvalid long folder entries from various directories I'd accessed in DSOrganize, and several files I'd deleted from within the browser returned. I think it was all files I'd deleted (the number of errors in each folder is, IIRC, the number of files I'd deleted from that folder), not all of them were undeleted though.
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, how does it know which images to list in the scribble pad? A PNG that I copied into /SCRIBBLE won't show up. Also, I just noticed this keyboard has no backslash. O_o
<br/>
<br/>
And I still can't figure out how to work that todo list app...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There also seems to be some entry mismatch happening when creating new files.  I am suspecting it also doesn't create a long filename entry when you create a 8.3 file name (in small letters)?  After mismatch happens, the program gets confused when I open a file, sometimes it opens an incorrect file instead...  Maybe it's best to always have 2 entries (long and short) synced up?<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow. I finally got around to trying this out (Beta 1.9 Preview 2). Very cool collection of applications. It seems that when I try to save a Scribble image in PNG format, the DS freezes before it complete. This happens with both my GBAMP and SCSD. It's also frozen a few other times while in the Browser and usually occurs after I've been loading images (although this is pretty random). Also, launching MoonShell from DSOrganize kills the touchscreen (and I can't even get MoonShell to launch DSOrganize on my SCSD at all). Other than that, it's been pretty stable.
<br/>
<br/>
A few suggestions I have:
<br/>
1. On Home screen, allow L and R to work with Next and Previous.
<br/>
2. An "Undo" option for Scribble.
<br/>
3. If possible, support for hexadecimal and binary numbers for the calculator with options for bytes, words, dwords, and qwords and operations for AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and MOD calculations. Hey, it could come in handy.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Go into the DSOrganize folder on your SD/CF card and make a folder called SCRIBBLE. This will solve this problem.<br/>_________________<br/>Don't sign your posts, it's dumb.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

There's a lot of things that could be added: Web browsers, PDF viewers, SPC players, NES emulators, etc. ;-) (How about playing MP3s while viewing text files? AFAIK no DS app can currently do that.)
<br/>
<br/>
This version seems to have completely broken MP3s for me. The progress bar doesn't advance (I can advance it manually but it doesn't do anything) and no sound plays.
<br/>
<br/>
HTML viewing = w00t, though, especially combined with the ability to download files from the Interweb (that Homebrew Database link). BTW, that link won't respond to being touched at all, and you can only move down to it from the Browser icon. It also never connects (it gets to either Getting MOTD or Getting List, then says it can't connect) except the first time I tried it; it listed 2 items but the Download button simply didn't do anything.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hah, not even close!
<br/>
(Just kidding -- it's been perfect for a while now :P)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that the file browser is getting a bit fiddly to use, now that it has all these buttons that I have to toggle through.
<br/>
The thing here that really seems out of place, I guess, is the text editor. Perhaps the text editor could be moved to its own section in the main menu and the eBook reader could become the default action when an understood text file format is opened?
<br/>
Pressing Y to open the eBook reader just seems a bit weird.
<br/>
<br/>
Another more simple thing that you have probably already thought about is that it would be efficient if bookmarks could be opened through the file browser, prompting the associated eBook to be opened at that location automatically.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

The Homebrew Database is also awesome. It has tons of homebrew I've never even heard of and downloads at a steady pace of 6~7 KBps on my DS Lite. And it auto downloads the .sc.nds versions of all the homebrew because it knows I have a Supercard (is excited cause he could never get it working before now).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This feature would be great in Nitrotracker. The server would have various samples for users to download to a specific folder called "samples." Or maybe even users can upload short tracks that they've created. I bet uploading would take too long though.

Indeed.
<br/>
<br/>
DSorganiser is exactly what it says: An Organiser...a kick-arse one at that.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, it has functions that Moonshell is missing really (moveing files about, copying, ect). And some formats it handels better (Gifs).
<br/>
<br/>
In some ways I view moonshell for "play" 
<br/>
And organiser for "work" :p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

a) Advertise this feature! Make that database much bigger!

<br/>
<br/>
You guys have got to stop taunting me with all this.
<br/>
I'm tempted to go buy another router or stand on my roof with a metal wok so I can swipe my neighbour's connection.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... gee, this is amazing.
<br/>
Just curious: How is the homebrew database connect working? Is it just grabbing the first entry in the firmware's list of access points?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with thundrestrike here. A simple file browser that can be used to choose where to save things would work wonders, for both the HB database and the scribble pad.
<br/>
...Although, even more cool there was an app in DSOrganize which lists available nds files in some kind of sorted manner with icons (attached icons are big enough to fit around 2 lines of info... 3 if there's some fancy formatting).
<br/>
Of course, that's not really very important; this is awesome enough already :)
<br/>
<br/>
Why is the Homebrew Database button on the bottom there? Why not put it like the other apps?
<br/>
Little bug with that button, too: If I press anywhere in the empty area above the HB Database button, it will open.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Oh man, I want command lines!
<br/>
Would be amazing if I could select a DPG file and have Moonshell automatically booted and playing it.
<br/>
Ah well.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Yes, use a lower bitrate stream, try 32kbps. It will work but it just fills up the buffer, plays and empties the buffer then stops and refills the buffer again.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well I finally upgraded from 1.9 Preview 2 to 2.0. I haven't yet tested the homebrew database, but everything else seems a bit more stable. I don't seem to have the consistent PNG corruption from Scribble anymore (YAY), but what I do still get is frequent random freezes. This usually involves me trying to open or save image files, NDS files, and music files in general. It's inconsistent and I don't really get it, but it happens quite often. It's especially a problem when saving a Scribble image because it corrupts the file and then it freezes the next time you go to open Scribble when tries to scan all the image files. Thankfully you can delete the corrupted file from the browser, but it's still problematic.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, is there some kind of special requirement for launching NDS files from DSOrganize on a SCSD? I know that you need a loader in the files to launch them from the SC menu itself, but does DSOrganize still need that? I seem to have trouble launching those same files from both DSOrganize and Moonshell. Am I doing something wrong or using the wrong files? Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I still think that it would be a nice feature to be able to use L and R  to function as Previous page and Next page while on the Home page. Just makes things a little faster if not using the stylus. That and possibly hexadecimal and binary options to the calculator. I'm sure some people could use that.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Not bitching really (because I've got backups of most things - except savegames) but just thought I'd mention it just incase its happened to anyone else or is a known bug. Any ideas how I can prevent it from happening again?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had random freezes with v1.9 Preview 2 and v2.0 and my SCSD, but nothing that wiped the SD card (then again, I haven't tried v2.01 beta yet). However, whenever this happened and I was saving an image file in Scribble, it would corrupt the file and I could not access Scribble again (it would hang if I did) until I deleted the corrupted file. Sounds like it blew away the File Allocation Table (FAT) on your SD card (basically the table of contents). The data is still there, but all file names and information about what is what got wiped. You might be able to use file recovery software to get it back, but I don't know of a good one off the top of my head. This is why it's probably a good idea to back up the contents of your SD/CF card regularly (or at least before you play with anything that writes directly to them).<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I do desktop support, and take my DS with me everywhere at work. Awsome for recording faults and jotting down notes. Big fan of the file browser.

I've noticed the following little things with v2.01 on Supercard MiniSD:
<br/>
<br/>
(my battery just went flat, so I'm going on memory here - might not get the exact names for things right :P)
<br/>
<br/>
* Day planner didn't seem to want to save entries. Calendar saved fine, as did the V-card address book.
<br/>
<br/>
* Day Planner - couldn't get 'Next Day' and 'Previous Day' functions working - perhaps user error there :P
<br/>
<br/>
* Played a couple of MP3 files, seems that they get chopped off at the end by a few seconds or so
<br/>
<br/>
* In the V-card address book, the 'state' field allowed a max of 2 characters only.

<br/>
That's all I can think of for now, will test these again when I get home and charge up the DS :P

does anyone else find it odd that the A+B buttons are placed next to each other; A being on the left, B on the right but when changing mode in DSOrganize it's reversed.

Ok, my mistake but my point still stands... If the A button is on the right then surely the DSOrganize modes that button applies to (rename, delete, etc, etc) should be on the right hand side of the screen also? Gah, this is really hard to explain! 
<br/>
<br/>
The B button should be assigned to commands that are on the left hand side of the screen and the A button should be viceversa... it's too easy to press the wrong button imo. A setup option to reverse/invert this would be the simplest solution. Am I the only person who finds this weird?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just had to change my DS to stop using DHCP. I seemed to be having some IP conflicts, anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Miraculous...
<br/>
This database needs mirrors, pronto!
<br/>
I suggest it get a spot at ndshb, since it would be great to have that domain actually turn in to a central location for DS homebrew :D
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding .m3u files:
<br/>
They're really just simplified pls files with less information actually in the file. (Presumably, the name and such is stored on the server so it can be changed dynamically).
<br/>
<br/>
With a quick copy and paste operation, this:</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">http://icecast1.cbcradio3.com:80/r3

<br/>
numberofentries=1
<br/>
File1=http://icecast1.cbcradio3.com:80/r3
<br/>
Title1=CBC Radio 3: 100% Canadian music from new and emerging artists
<br/>
Length1=-1
<br/>
Version=2
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
And, while I've only just taken a peek today, I believe that is the CBC Radio 3 Shoutcast / Icecast / Internet Radio / Thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure why the information isn't being shown (and it seems to get replaced by the information from previously viewed pls files!), but the audio works pretty well :)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Some buffer problems, actually... but I imagine you know all about it :)
<br/>
I'm noticing that sometimes, when the buffer reaches 0, audio stops working after the buffer is refilled or even when playing a different shoutcast. Sometimes it seems to keep losing its connection, reconnecting, then buffering,
<br/>
I have to restart DSOrganize to get it working again.
<br/>
<br/>
And... The best shoutcast stream I have found so far in my region (Western North America) for stability is KPLU.org, which I can listen to outside of my house without ever losing the buffer... and it sounds excellent!
<br/>
It lasted up until a mysterious crash which completely froze DSOrganize. I will see if I can reproduce it, and time it this time.
<br/>
<br/>
CBC Radio 3 nearly succeeds, too, as I can get about a minute without losing the buffer. A better Internet connection / router should be able to stream it pretty well. (My computer streams it fine :().
<br/>
However, I don't think DSOrganize likes their audio codec, as it sounds kind of crinkly.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

One thing I'd like to see is custom file associations. For example I'd like to be able to edit some INI file or similar so that .BAS is treated as a text file.

Also, there's still a few bugs in either this or (most likely) the FAT lib. It froze while saving a text file and trashed the directory structure a while ago.

It wouldn't be useful for the DS Lite because the microphone flips down below the hinge when you shut it, and the DS(Lite)'s microphone isn't that powerful anyways... It still would be useful, though, with an external mic, such as the headset Nintendo is releasing.<br/>_________________<br/>SCSD, 1GB Kingston, Flashme v7 on DS v1, Flashme v7 on DS Lite</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I recently started having this problem with my GBAMP.  Any slight tap/vibration, even closing the lid would cause it to skip for a few seconds before resuming properly.  This is probably due to dirty contacts.  Now, what I did to fix it was clean the contacts on my GBAMP where it plugs into the GBA slot.  Much like a NES/SNES/N64 game or wahtever, I just took a Q-Tip, wet one side, and ran it a couple times back and forth, then dried it with the other end.  After doing so, I tried all sorts of stuff, such as rapping on the card, slamming the lid, shaking the DS, etc, and no skip.  The only way to make it skip was to pull the card halfway out, and then when I put it back in, it resumed fine. ;P
<br/>
<br/>
The moral of the story is: Don't do drugs ki...wait, clean your GBA cartridge!<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.
