    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I remember a few months ago there was some discussion of a Windows-based game creation studio app that didn't require any actual C programming.  It was built on top of PALib as I recall.
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone remember what this app was called?  I've tried searching through the forums and I can't seem to find it.  Maybe the discussion wasn't even here, but if not hopefully someone knows what I'm talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
Along similar lines, have any of you guys seen this thing:

I haven't tried it yet, but I'm curious to see how it works, so I think I'll try making some sort of game with it this weekend.

I don't know why but <a href="http://www.gameweaver.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gameweaver.com/</a> seems kinda suspicious.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried GameWeaver once just for the heck of it.  Couldn't understand how to use it, but it sent me a compiled *.gba file at the end even though it was just a jumble of random sprites.  If you can figure out how it works, you could consider it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yeah, XtenDS, thanks.  Though it looks like it currently doesn't do much besides provide a sort of environment for doing regular C programming in.  With only a few scripts for handling simple things like text.  It's still being developed, though, it seems, which is nice.  I thought it had been abandoned.

Suspicious indeed.  I just tried to register and it turns out there's a $10 registration fee befroe you can actually begin playing around.  I'm not totally opposed to someone charging money for a thing like this, even if you're very limited in what you can actually make with it, just the novelty seems like it would be worth...maybe $5.  Not $10, though, I'm afraid.  A shame since I was sort of looking forward to seeing if I could produce something playable.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">seems free to me...i signed up, and drew a couple images. it looks fairly extensive, but of course limited as these types of applications always are. also it was quite buggy for me. It's an interesting idea though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
