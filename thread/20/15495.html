    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">You'll probably want to get a 1 gig sandisk SD card and use only version 1 patch for the dldi (which is the only one that works with the 1 gig card). I would start with downloading DS Organize. It's a pretty good little app, and good with organizing as you can make items hidden, so you don't have to always see those files for things like DS Doom that get annoying to look at.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, definately download some demo games like the contra 4 demo xD it gives you something to do.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to do web browsing, using bungalloo. Its probably the best out there that works, but doesn't render the sites, only shows the text (sadly) and links. You can click on picture links and bring them up, along with download things with it, making it one of the better (and doesn't crash every 10 minutes like DS Organizes does)
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously put music on there as thats one of the main ressons for the card, along with use Moonshell for the music. It has the best sound (that I know of) of the Mp3 players for the DS.
<br/>
<br/>
I would definately suggest you stay away from the Games N' musics built in video player. It has horrible quality and skips like crazy (on files that are large).
<br/>
<br/>
That's all I know of to use :) if you plan on doing back up for you GBA games, use the good old GBA back up too. :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Be warned, the maximum supported card size is 2GB. Also, I don't know why GBA backups were brought up, as A) this forum doesn't discuss that and B) G&amp;M (like any slot-1 card) can't play them.
<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, LMP v1.02 is the best music player.
<br/>
DSOrganize: Works great for 2-20 minutes at a time, then crashes.
<br/>
Moonshell: Limited features, often crashes between songs.
<br/>
LMP 1: Works well; crashes randomly, but not often (typically only once every few hours).
<br/>
LMP 2: More stable, but sound quality is reduced.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell's crashes seem to be when switching formats, so if you only use one format it probably works just fine. It has no playlist support, but you can copy all your music into one directory and name the files with incrementing numbers at the beginning.
<br/>
<br/>
LMP has a few quirks, but is overall the most stable. I suspect most of them are due to the G&amp;M's slow card access, as they didn't all happen on my GBAMP:
<br/>
-Certain songs, when starting after certain other songs, play at the wrong pitch briefly. Usually this corrects itself after a second or two, but for a few it will do the entire song like that. The workaround is to pause right at the end of the song before, skip ahead twice, play, then skip back once to the song that would have come on. Inserting a short clip of silence between them might also work.
<br/>
-Under heavy load (most noticeable with OGGs), the buttons become unresponsive, as if it's taking so long each frame to decode it doesn't have time to process input. (Poor use of interrupts?) You have to hold the button until it responds. On some songs it just won't respond at all.
<br/>
<br/>
The random crashes don't seem purely random; there are a few songs on my playlist that will crash it nearly every time, but how far it gets through the song or whether it crashes at all is random as best I can tell, and occasionally it happens during other songs that play fine 99% of the time.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall if you want a decent music player, I'd get a decent card :-p but LMP is tolerable on G&amp;M once you get to know which songs you need to skip back and forth at. Someone needs to write a better player, really, but unfortunately the DS sound hardware is a pain in the neck, and it's simply not an easy task to decode audio with such limited CPU power.<br/>_________________<br/>I'm a PSP hacker now, but I still &lt;3 DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Thank you for helping me out i guess it will still not be able to run some homebrew games even when the games get patched? Does anyone know if Pocket Physics work with GNM because that looks such a cool game.
<br/>
I'm so excited i hope it comes soon, I'll download everything you have recommended,
<br/>
<br/>
I really like this forum, very helpful.

Edit: and yes, Pocket Physics works on the GnM. It has some issues with freezing, however, but I'm guessing thats just in the game itself, not because its on a GnM card :p And the only thing the GnM won't run is Commercial roms, which is no reason to get a homebrew card anyway lol<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

Just plug in the GnM with any .nds file on it, have DSorganize named bootme, so it instantly boots to it, then, press a on a homebrew you want to play and bingo, DSO patches and runs the game for you :)<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, the "difficulty" to get them homebrew compatible doesn't help.  It's not like the GnM works out of the box.  You are pretty much required to use another bootloader because the built in one sucks (doesn't setup hardware properly before launching homebrew) and overall it's pretty slow.  Specially if you are loading larger homebrew.  Some people tend to think it's not working when it doesn't load in 2-3 seconds.. when they just need to wait longer.
<br/>
<br/>
But, you have to look at it from a cost point of view.  Is a $20 device that is available world wide in major retail stores worth waiting a few extra seconds to load your homebrew?  I'd say yes, vs spending twice that, still needing a MicroSD card, and having to order it online and wait for it.  In that comparison, I think the GnM is an excellent device.  The fact that it only runs homebrew makes it even better in my eyes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
