    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i dont think loopy has intended for a public release yet, so do it with caution. over at the chinese forums there are some cases that failed to flash ds lite (brickfied it) not due to human errors. so...be careful.
<br/>
<br/>
most of it includes machine shutting itself off for no apparent reason, most common are:
<br/>
<br/>
1. 1% or below, lite turns it self off, bricked. (happened to machines that has not been flashed b4)
<br/>
2. at certain precentage, lite turns itself off, attempts to resume will lead to either a succeful flash, or another auto shutdown, eventually there will be this one time that it shuts itself off and cannot turn on again (happened to a v7 flashme user)
<br/>
<br/>
some things worth looking into is:
<br/>
<br/>
1. can a ds lite that has not been flashed be flashed with flashme-lite beta?
<br/>
2. the 2nd case from above is likely a fuse that burnt out, i have read a case that power light lights on for a split second but the machine would not turn on after having ds lite turn itself off multiple times while flashing.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1.  Well, I'm sure. :)
<br/>
2. A thought...could possibly turning down the DS Lite's brightness level help with this (I mean, it would reduce power consumption and logically might help keep the fuse from getting borked)?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hm, you write to the firmware the same way you control the power management, right? Through the SPI? Could be some hardware problem with the controller, making it write to PM instead of firmware. Or could just be that writing to the firmware takes extra power, which along with super-bright lights and the sound system overwhelm the power circuit.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know about the bricking problems. My guess is the new design is more prone to shorting mistakes...  slip-ups accidentally shorting the wrong thing.  Try to keep a steady hand :)</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Someone else reported that on the new DS Lite, if you leave the DS plugged in, then removing battery does not shut off the DS lite.  Maybe there are other hardware changes in DS Lite.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.DSLua.com" target="_blank">DSLua - a scripting language for your DS!</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I was flashing my DS Lite with 'FlashLite' (:P), and a couple (!) of times I apparently hit the wrong spot and the unit turned off, but I recovered using the fail safe and continued...took me quite awhile to actually get the right spot and hold it long enough for flashing to complete...much longer than with my regular NDS, but I did it.
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I turn on my DS Lite and start swearing as I look at the top screen and it's weird and flickery.  O_O NOOOOO I'm thinking, but it seems the DS has fixed itself and I'm noticing no problems whatsoever now.  It happened when I waited awhile, then tried something else to test the screen...I booted up that 'Touch of War' RTS game and it was completely fine on both screens.  So thank you 'Touch of War' for fixing the screen on my DS Lite. lol
<br/>
<br/>
Good lord that was scary though.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
This is getting weird...it seems that now that it is doing it maybe the first time I boot after waiting awhile, but not after that.  Would anyone who knows the actual hardware part better possibly know what is up with this?  I mean, unless it's doing the flickery on that boot the screen seems perfectly fine.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit2*
<br/>
I think maybe I just saw it do it while I was watching a movie on MoonShell rather than just at boot....but now I'm playing Castlevania and not seeing this at all.  I wish I knew what was going on here. There is definitely something wrong here.  I hope it's something that is fixable.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by The 9th Sage on Tue Apr 11, 2006 9:28 pm; edited 6 times in total</span></div>
