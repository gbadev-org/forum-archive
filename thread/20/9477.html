    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to get ScummVm working on my Flash2Advance Ultra (256Mbit)
<br/>
<br/>
I know it can be done as i've seen some screenshots around the net with it running on a f2aultra cart.. however i'm running into some problems, im guessing due to the compatability, though i may be completly wrong...
<br/>
<br/>
Using 0.5 , CF Reader Not Found , Zip File Found , I click Add Game , but it cannot find any games , whether its in a dir or not.
<br/>
<br/>
Using 0.4 , Zip file found , I click add game , this time out of the 3 folders I had it only detected 1 (monkey2) and when i clicked CHOOSE it froze and did nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
I know its a small cart , but since the games cant go over 30mb its pretty ideal. If anyone has an answer , a possible answer or even an insight or theory pls post..
<br/>
<br/>
edit. Oh just to add im using flash me, just incase u need to know info</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
I followed the problem back to my archiver (powerzip or somthing its called, a compression tool that covers many archive types) Anyway even though i stored them as uncompressed, and even though scummvm finds the zip file, it wasnt adding any games...
<br/>
<br/>
Instead I used Winrar's Zip mode to Store them as uncompressed (store mode) and even though the filesize was the same as how I did it before it seems to of corrected the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
So any of you out there having similar problem try this solution.
<br/>
<br/>
I know have the first 2 Monkey Islands on my lil' flash card (F2A Ultra 256) running Perfectly with full sound, and Wow , ScummVm Ds is awesome, just to hear the old monkey island tunes blaring out of my Ds is stunning. I get to relive the adventure gmae scene all over again, but this time its portable ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
