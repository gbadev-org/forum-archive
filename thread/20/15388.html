    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Eepinator can dump the save files of games that use SRAM to save, though I've heard you have to dump it twice for it to work for some reason.
<br/>
<br/>
There is another program that works with more save files, but as it is (I believe) also capable of dumping commercial GBA cartridges it's probably best not to mention it.
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a DLDI-capable slot-2 device, you can use Chishm's cart_save program.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's perfectly legal to create a backup yourself of an owned GBA game (and keep/use the ROM of it).

...As long as you don't "release" it to the public, which is the only illegal part.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
