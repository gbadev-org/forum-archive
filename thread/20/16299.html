Please come back when you have one of: a demo, screenshots, a compelling design document, a business plan including how you think you will convince Nintendo to license your game, or a previous game you made to show you can finish the project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't want to be meat, but your post says absolutely nothing.
<br/>
It also has a very young and / or inexperienced attitude to it. So, I hope you do not really believe what you wrote. Please read the posts above and hopefully you will understand what we are trying to say here: It is very unlikely anybody at Nintendo will look at your stuff.
