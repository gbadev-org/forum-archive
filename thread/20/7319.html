    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, this is not my first journey into my DS, or Gameboys in general. I have a few questions.
<br/>
<br/>
1.) Without causing major damage to anything would I be able to dust off the screen itself without removing the protective screen cover?
<br/>
<br/>
2.) Is it easy to get past that first board? 
<br/>
<br/>
And that's all.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,
<br/>

This is useful for me, because it shows that the touch screen cover is loosely mounted to the casing, so if I ever felt so inclined to do something stupid, I could "easily" replace the cover with some sort of nice bendy plastic material that I'm sure I can buy. (It has to be somewhere between a plastic bag and plexiglass, though).
<br/>
Of course, this brings up the question: What on earth were they thinking?!!!? It further proves that the cover could have been made easy to replace without voiding the warranty and all that.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have disassembled 2 DS already to make some repairs and I must say that the bottom part is pretty easy to take apart if you have a tri-wing screwdriver.  Top is a little harder because the screws are hidden under the little pads that surround the top screen.  They are not easy to remove without breaking them, and that's what happened when I tried.  I would try heating them a little to loosen the glue first if I had to try again.
<br/>
<br/>
And Mr. Pickesworth, I hate breaking your bubble, but there is no cover on the bottom screen.  You have the LCD display and the touch screen glue on top of it.  There is nothing more, no cover.  You are directly on the touch screen when you play, so don't do something stupid, cause you won't be able to change it that easily :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
