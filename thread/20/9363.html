    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I wouldn't be asking this normally, but I could have sworn I once saw a tutorial on transferring nds files to the DS via Wifi directly through Windows Explorer.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably missing some big catch here, and I may have dreamed the entire thing.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, do you happen to remember such a tutorial, too?
<br/>
Do you remember where it was located and... perhaps have a link to it? (I can't find it with Google).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I use a one-line batch file, something like this:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">c:\ds\tools\wmb\wmb -data %1</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
and drag .nds files onto it to send.
<br/>
<br/>
I think I do remember seeing a tutorial on how to set it up so you can just double click them to send, but I don't remember where it was either...<br/>_________________<br/>___________
<br/>
The best optimization is to do nothing at all.
<br/>
Therefore a fully optimized program doesn't exist.

Edit: there you go, it's near the bottom of the page. Never used it so I don't know how well it works.
