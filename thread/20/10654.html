I'm only looking for a online store with DS spare parts (precisely - the ribbon cable and a new case), that actually has stuff in stock. Plus, a tri-wing screwdriver is also preffered to be on sale. Any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
And anything I should be careful about when I disassemble it?

from the sounds of it, all you need is a top-screen placement (with ribbon)

did the speakers wire break too?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Also which ribbon are you talking about? The LCD ribbon or the ribbon that connects the top boards to the lower boards.<br/>_________________<br/>It's so easy to be wise. Just think of something stupid, then dont do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Even the dog who ate the DS Lite didn't break it. Just did a lot of cosmetic damage.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Something similar happened to mine, where I only see the ribbon ripped. The sound one, if it's the brown cable is still there, intact. It doesn't turn on, but I take it it's normal in that condition.

Images of it: (Though I don't have any close ups.)

Yes, but there's no Walmart in Europe ...
<br/>
Anyways, it looks the same as in the picture Mantine took, but with the exception of both cables being damaged ...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
