    <h4>#60640 - Mr. Picklesworth - Sun Nov 13, 2005 5:05 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just wondering if somebody happens to have built an app that does movie playback for DS which does not have file sizes 3x larger than the original file which was much larger and does not take forever to compress?
<br/>
<br/>
:D
<br/>
<br/>
I kind of expected that people would be clamouring to do a nice movie player for DS in order to silence that stupid PSP vs DS rivalry. (It's really annoying, since I, and many other people, actually *gasp* -"BURN HIM"- like both the DS <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> PSP... I also find end-user rivalries by consumers over consumer products to be really stupid, anyway.).
<br/>
<br/>
Uhm... yah.
<br/>
Movie playback, anyone?<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Not everybody lives where First Hunt bundles are still available new in box. There already are reports of silver DS units coming with new firmware, and by the time the homebrew community gets some sort of decent movie player working, this will become even more common. Worse yet, unlike on the PSP (where revision A was sure to have 1.50 FW), it's impossible to distinguish an old firmware silver or electric blue DS from a new firmware silver or electric blue DS without opening the box and trying PassMe.
<br/>
<br/>
And I didn't say that Memory Stick is cheaper, but that the price gap is closing.
<br/>
<br/>
And what do you gain by switching from Play-Yan to some DS native solution? A measly 16 pixels?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">16 pixals...eh?  slightly more then that me thinks.
<br/>
<br/>
But yes,much more processing power and Ram is the main things. This can (obviously) improve movie abilitys a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
Touchscreen controlls would also be nice, but not essiential.
<br/>
But also to be able to use the DS as an all in one package.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell does an excelent job of MP3's and Jpegs, and theres now a nice text writeing program for the DS. All usefull apps.
<br/>
Id just like a nice quality movie player to go with that. 
<br/>
<br/>
The homebrew is comeing along very nicely imo, emulators are a little lagging. (allthough theres lovely stuff for the GBA...master system/gg, nes, and gameboy colour all have superb GBAMP emus now).
<br/>
But the potential for the future of DS homebrew is very bright.
<br/>
<br/>
Dispite the new firmware in some DS's, its nothing we cant get around. And its also no where near as annoying as "upgradeing/downgradeing" PSP firmware is.
<br/>
First Hunt Bundels? Who needs them. I never got one, and it worked fine for me. The Homebrew community will adapt to new firmware..it wont stand still. 
<br/>
And I am sure that solutions will be made for the GBAMP...or, at least, cheaper solutions then Flashcarts.
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo, for the moment, dont show signs of having auto-firmwhere updates with games. 
<br/>
And untill they do, homebrew on the DS is a win-win situation for users.

Yes, but the PSP isnt a particularly good movie player either.

<span style="font-style: italic">Compared to </span>"proper" portable dvd players, or even HD media players, its lacking.
<br/>
These are games machines,thats what they are primarly good at. 
<br/>
Its just some of us want to use our hardware for more :)
<br/>
<br/>
The resolution limit off memory cards is purely sonys invention, you can hack around it. They just wanted to drive sales of their stupidly overpriced UMDs up.
<br/>
<br/>
Just like PSP homebrewers want to get the most from their system, so DS owners want to get the most from theirs.
<br/>
<br/>
And the DS can do much better then the GBA-format PlayYen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Rather 1-dimensional thinking going on here :p
<br/>
(in more ways then one)
<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be struggling to turn this into a PSP vs DS debate, which this isnt.
<br/>
<br/>
Its simple<span style="font-style: italic"> "Can a better video system be done on the DS", </span>and the answere is yes.
<br/>
<br/>
Your takeing very specific examples to try to make the PSP come out the same cost wise....when that isnt an issue at all.
<br/>
If your buying the DS system TO play movies, then you are stupid indeed. 
<br/>
Wheras, if you have a DS and just want an extra features, I dont see how your argument is at all relivent. 
<br/>
<br/>
And Mpegs arnt the only movie format, you know.
<br/>
I dont know the specifics of the PlayYen chips (how much ram does it have? ect).
<br/>
<br/>
But I do know the DS can do better then gba-resolution,15-20fps movies that the playyen produces.  
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, official developers are casualy produceing<span style="font-weight: bold"> FMV's on both screens at once mearly as intros. </span>
<br/>
Hunters intro didnt look less then 20fps to me.
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously they are short, but thats a space issue, and CF cards are cheap and getting cheaper all the time. 8Gigabytes has already been confirmed to work, so I dont see space being much of an issue.
<br/>
<br/>
So why do you think the DS cant do better then the PlayYen *on a single screen* ? when its already doing better on both screens at once :?
<br/>
<br/>
I dont think official developers have access to a secret "magic chip" :D
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(I appriciate access times from DS games are probably quite quicker then CF, but thats a streaming issue not a processing one like your implying.)

My point was mearly space is fairly cheap, and getting cheaper all the time. We dont need highly compressed stuff that the DS can barely handel, we only need to work to the sort of compression that the DS can handel.
<br/>
Why take it too extreams?
<br/>
Work the argument backwards, if you admit the DS can handel uncompressed bitmaps, then ask yourself what sort of compression could it handel at a decent speed?

You dont surely thing it could handel no compression do you?

Movies have to be re-compressed due to the screen size anyway really, so, like the GBAMP has its *.gbm format, maybe a simerlar type thing could be made for the DS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Didn't intend to. I was just being thorough. Setting a lower and upper bound is important in any discussion. In this case, the upper bound is 8 bits per pixel (uncompressed bitmaps) and the lower bound is 0.14 bits per pixel (estimated data rate of Majesco's GBA Video codec).

Distortion is a function of two variables: data rate (in bits per frame) and decoder complexity (in cycles per pixel). Maximum possible decoder complexity is a function of frame rate and image size. Given an image size of 256x192 pixels, which data rate and frame rate did you have in mind so that we can set lower and upper bounds on what is possible?

It will be provided at no charge in Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS Software Development Kits. The codecs will allow all Nintendo's game developers to implement video content in their games.
<br/>
<br/>
On the Nintendo DS, Actimagine software video codec can achieve full screen 256x192 video up to 30 frames per second from 100kbps to 700kbps, with stereo sound from 8KHz mono to 48KHz stereo. Dual screen can be supported up to 15 frames per second.

This is a purely software-based solution, making the video cartridges compatible with the installed base of Nintendo hand-held consoles.

My post has obviously been misread. If more was read outside of the abbreviation "PSP," that person would have noticed more information to go along with it.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not a DS vs. PSP debate, this is a thread about the possibilities of running MPEG video on a DS in order to view a TV series which I happen to now have converted to rather nicely compressed MPEG files, on a computer which has no sound at the moment and is not connected to the network, and I can't be bothered to connect it to transfer the files to the decent PC. 
<br/>
(I have it on DVD as well, before you ask).
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I will make a quick attempt to rescue this thread.
<br/>
This is my thread by the way, if you don't like what its topic is, please start your own thread, rather than destroying mine.
<br/>
<br/>
First, I will explain why it is not a stupid idea to write an MPEG viewer for NDS:
<br/>
Unlike some people who claim to own every bit of electronic gadgetry ever built, there are people who actually <span style="font-weight: bold">do not own</span> a Play-Yan or a PSP, but do own a DS. If you understand basic logic, you should be able to figure out that the purchase of a Play-Yan or a PSP in order to fix this problem <span style="font-weight: bold">would cost them money on top of the money they spent on their DS.</span>
<br/>
It's pretty darn simple, actually.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now... On with why I returned to this thread which really should have been over a while ago.
<br/>
Mighty Max: I have taken a peek at your code, and I think I may as well play around with it for a while. I just need to know around where it is that you stopped, so I can pick up from there.

If you own a DS, and even if you happen to have bought an exploitable game (for example, not the US version of Meteos) with your DS, and you weren't involved in the GBA homebrew scene, then you still need to buy a PassMe2, a SuperCard (which, unlike the GBAMP, works with the PassMe2), and a CF or SD card in order to run homebrew. How much does that cost compared to the price of a Play-Yan (which also works in a DS) and an SD card?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I think quite a few people...probably the majority...actualy are in the position of haveing to spend ...zero...to get DS a hypothetical DS movie player running. *because they already have everything*
<br/>
<br/>
And if your talking to the future, then maybe their will be other GBAMP like devices that do have the nesscery stuff for PassMe2 to work.
<br/>
Or maybe someone will come up with another PassMe like device.
<br/>
ect.
<br/>
ect.
<br/>
Two completely seperate issues, and its an extream and bizare stretch to say something is pointless because you have weighed up the costs in a very precise way looking at one thing to see what comes out on top.

<br/>
But surely you would have to resize the footage anyway?
<br/>
<br/>
While I firmly believe decent movie playback is possible, general rescaleing while maintaining framerate probably isnt.
<br/>
<br/>
And, if re-sizeing using Vdub or whatever is acceptable, then why not a complete custom format?
<br/>
Something the DS can handel (and people can code for).

I am curious however.

</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">What bitrate and what frame rate? </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
I cant say the bitrate really. Depends on too many things.
<br/>
But framerate Id be looking at whatever that Metroid vid was doing.
<br/>
Looked about 20fps.
<br/>
<br/>
But well, as I keep saying.
<br/>
Give me that video, on one screen, with some sort of compression.
<br/>
Thats not that much to ask, Imo.
<br/>
<br/>
But lets get to maybe the heart of your viewpoint on my viewpoint:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">How cheap? Given the price of a 1 GB card, how many hours of video would you want to put on it? </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Hours?
<br/>
45mins maybe ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Allthough Id like the option to watch a movie at some point, frankly, I dont think I would do that often if at all.
<br/>
Id me just watching stuff when traveling.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be either tv shows, one at a time, or maybe 2/3 if its animated.
<br/>
<br/>
I dont see any point at all in having a "collection" of videos on a portable.
<br/>
I watch stuff once and then I am done with it.
<br/>
I might want to be clips of my 3D work (talking minutes here), but thats about the only thing Id want to do perminately.
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, other people might want to watch LOTR's on the DS, but Id leave it to them to buy huge CF cards. (or more then one and split it...)
<br/>
<br/>
I easily fit a few eppisodes of Futurama, say, on my GBAMP+512MB Compact Flash. I have in the past (when clearing everything else off), managed to fit two whole eppisodes of Farscape on it.
<br/>
<br/>
For the DS, with its better abilitys, I dont see why expecting full screen for a more or less simerlar space taken up is unreasonable at all.
<br/>
<br/>

Codecs that have come into wide use were likely designed by people who know more about video coding than 98 percent of the people who read this board.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Dosnt stop my GBAMP from playing its own movie format though does it?
<br/>
<br/>
You cant have it both ways.
<br/>
Yes, they will be better in terms of compression then people here can invent. Absolutely. That would be first choice.
<br/>
<br/>
However  *IF* you keep saying the DS cant handel them, THEN I wouldnt mind a custom format. Like the GBAMP's one, maybe. 
<br/>
<br/>
You see <span style="font-style: italic">I dont care.</span>
<br/>
I just want the end result, which I know is possible because my GBAMP does it minus a few pixals and a few frames, and thats purely using GBA processing!
<br/>
I know DS developers are using various forms of compression too. And I see the animation on that Metroid demo. (two both screens as well, I just want one)
<br/>
<br/>
So one way or another, its possible.

I mentioned the SuperCard, which is a GBAMP-like device (CF adapter) with the extra RAM that PassMe2 needs. The M3, from the maker of the GBAMP, is similar.

Everything in life, and I mean everything, is a cost-benefit analysis. If and only if the benefit outweighs the cost of programmer time, then somebody is going to port a video decoder to the Nintendo DS.

I seem to remember that the video in <span style="font-style: italic">First Hunt</span> was 30fps, with frames alternating on the top and bottom screens. This correlates with Actimagine's announcement.

Thank you. From this I can compute bitrate. It looks like you're aiming for something in the same range as <a class="postlink" href="http://www.videohelp.com/vcd" target="_blank">VCD</a>, which would put 115 minutes of video on 1 GB. This would be 1200 kbps, with perhaps about 1000 kbps used for video. At 256x192x30, that would end up at 0.65 bit/pixel, which looks like a much easier target than Majesco's data rate.

With LOTR or Titanic or GWTW you'd be able to get away with 256x144 (16:9).
