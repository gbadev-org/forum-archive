Post a comment on the blog if your interested, I know I already asked before but I was not clear on a few things and the project fell behind due to other issues as well.

<br/>
As usual, you need a valid Macintosh Plus ROM image as well as bootable disks for anything to work.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, if someone wants to make a movie of the new version and put it up somewhere I'll send you a copy right away - no docs needed :)
<br/>
<br/>
There are already a few movies on youtube showing the emulator so ideally it would need to show off some of the new features.
<br/>
Example: You can set the color of the on/off pixels, make the screen any color you want. I set mine to green :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
