    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It has been meticulously noted that, for no <span style="font-style: italic">apparent</span> reason, the little intro blinkety-bling sound that compliments the Nintendo DS logo at startup, changes to a chingety-ching noise that sounds somewhat higher pitched.
<br/>
<br/>
In the event that this happens, bear note that it is, in fact, the first sign that your Nintendo DS is going to brick itself, due to corrupt firmware and/or a mishap involving the transfer of virii to your handheld via WiFi without you knowing.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no known remedy for this. After six more start-ups, your top DS screen will flicker abnormally and you'll smell a burning odour coming from the battery compartment of the Nintendo DS. Soon after, your DS will make good use for a paperweight or an oddly-shaped frisbee.
<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you may wish to see if it's your birthday. Not because you'll need someone to get you a DS, since its firmware is corrupt, but rather because you realize that what I said above is a complete and utter lie, and, in reality, this is how your DS says "Happy Birthday" (i.e. chingety-ching).
<br/>
<br/>
In the words of Alan Turing, the great mathematician:
<br/>
<br/>
"A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human."
<br/>
<br/>
Or, in this case, into believing that something is utterly wrong with it, based on the tone of it's blingety-bling.
