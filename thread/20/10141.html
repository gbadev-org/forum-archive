    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm pretty busy with multiple DS projects right now...I guess I have a little developers fever and going crazy on this little machine. So many possibilities. Anyways, i've considered starting a MMORPG for the DS...or atleast attempt a small test. 
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, i've already written a server app that communicates with the DS. Already handles creating an account, logging in, retrieving the player data, updating player data and sending back to the client DS's. I've created a DS protocol for communicating with DS&lt;-to-&gt;server. Its nice so far, but i'm about to start to code on the DS end now.
<br/>
<br/>
Before I do, i'd just like to have some feedback, thoughts, ideas and good lucks.<br/>_________________<br/>Prodigy Games</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, IMO, it doesn't have to be a UO clone directly, but the UO formula works so well, that if you were to have that same basic style, it would probably go over very well. I know some sprite artists that, might be persuaded to help you out, if you're interested. I'm just starting to learn programming (extensive knowledge of scripting, and some C and C++ from several years back, but now I'm about to get pretty heavy into learning languages again), so it would be nice if this were open source (though that decision is entirely up to you). I don't know how much I could honestly contribute, but for me, considering how interested I am in this kind of a project to begin with, it would certainly help me to learn a LOT about programming for the DS - I know, probably the lousiest reason to make this open source.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

But don't knock the UO engine just yet... there's a LOT of open source stuff based on the UO design that you could take advantage of (even if just to get some ideas). Don't forget that a LOT of great games are based off of older great games, like UO and Dune 2 (virtually ALL RTS games have derived some, if not most of their design and elements from Dune 2).
<br/>
<br/>
But I am definitely ALL for the idea of a something original. Adding to previous statements, I'm also a writer, and I've been involved with D&amp;D and Pencil and Paper gaming for many years now, I'd be more than happy to see what I could contribute to this!

That's a great idea - something akin to the Vegastrike engine for PCs (An engine designed around the old Wing Commander games that allows you to create your own games through it - there are NUMEROUS people who've continued the Wing Commander series through that engine as a result, not to mention the numerous other games that have popped up in its wake as well).
<br/>
<br/>
And about the sprite artists, I know one who is VERY well known in the sprite community for his Sonic sprites, and being a sonic fan myself, I'd LOVE to use the engine to make a SERIOUS, heavily mature (NOT PORN, but certainly not for kids) Sonic the Hedgehog RPG - damn plumber gets far more action than the blue hedgehog ever got in that department. But of course, that would be for the future, after a serious engine is in place, and probably after another main game has been made.<br/>_________________<br/>Est Sularis Oth Mithas - My Honor is My Life

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi there,
<br/>
<br/>
i thought about creating a client for UO - DS. I'm the Teamleader of the Iris 3D-Client for Ultima Online Freeshards.
<br/>
<br/>
Screenshots:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://iris.berlios.de/album_cat.php?cat_id=1" target="_blank">http://iris.berlios.de/album_cat.php?cat_id=1</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I think its no problem to code it, but it's a problem to store all datas on DS Flash card.
<br/>
<br/>
I converted all Groundtiles from 64x64 or 128x128 to 16x16 Tiles. So i reduced the size from 21MB to 490kb. If we convert all other gfx (statics, anims) to the same resolution maybe its posssible. The main problem are the big Map0-4.mul Files (~128MB).
<br/>
<br/>
If someone is interested in writing a 2D UO Client for DS contact me. I'm in the UO Dev scene for years and maybe we find others to help us.

Map is not a UO Mul map.

Groundtiles are taken from Texmaps.mul and resized to 16x16 Tiles.

Human Sprite is resized to simply fit 32x32 sprites (just for now).

This UO client mod looks interesting. Depends how many sprites you can fit into the game.. all the tiles/gumps/characters.

Wonder if DS could support MUL-like filesystems - even if you limited the amount of tiles used.

Talking about your ideas, I think that ISO view it's better, in this way it will be possible to use some images from art.mul only reducing them in size, giving to the client the possibility to draw little houses and other buildings.
<br/>
And besides using a top view not only implicates to work more on the graphics for converting them to this view, but also means to loose the well known look of the original 2D UO-client...
<br/>
<br/>
With a limited number of arts and landscape tiles it will be possible to make real mini-shards for the DS! SWEEEET!
<br/>
<br/>
Edit:
<br/>
Here it this is an example of a converted 16x16 art graphic

About the ISO view. I must checkout how complicate it is and how slow to draw the Tilemap. Because the streching of the Texmaps is done 3D like.
<br/>
<br/>
The converted static 16x16 Tiles look ok. At first we have to develop a routine to draw a iso pseudo 3D UO-Map with 16x16 Textures (texmaps.mul). After that we have to develop an algorithm to draw 16x16 static Tiles on the 8x8 NDS raster.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'll help out in any way I can. If you have some tedious tile-converting work or testing, I will help out in ANY way I can.

By the way, we can use most code of the iris client for the small DS Client. Currently i'm a bit busy...but next month i continue working and create a wiki entry here:
