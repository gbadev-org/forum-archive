    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I had an idea some days ago, it would be great to have Civilization on DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
Freeciv is a Civ2 remake, single and online game playing, with free source code and it is a very active project. 
<br/>
I think that a DS port would be totally possible, there are ports for a lot of OSs like Palm, Linux, Win, FreeBSD, Mac OS, Pocket PC, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
DS is a perfect system to play Civ, touch screen, two screens for displaying menus... I have no idea of programing, so i can't help with this quest heh I only give ideas ^^
<br/>
<br/>
I hope anyone can take this project and make a great port of Civilization for all the mankind :D</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would second this.
<br/>
<br/>
Why there isnt an official version being made I dont know. (there is age of empires I read somewhere).
<br/>
<br/>
Still, it sounds like a big project and a lot of work.
<br/>
Id rather the skilled people work on their own things, or "generic" things that help all DS Homebrew usage.
<br/>
<br/>
That said, maybe It could work ver DS Linux someday.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">So rather than posting a (thinly veiled) request for a game, why not download the free civ source yourself and see what needs to be done to port it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the age of empires game is a remake from the ground up, it's turn based for one thing (which can't help but radically change the gameplay), and probably has completly redone art and sound assets.
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I'd love to see an epic game of Civ or Stars! on the DS wifi :)  And also, I could really go for that castle...<br/>_________________<br/>Joat

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">meh, give the guy a break, it is ds misc, and he did at least provide a place to get the source.  It wasn't like he asked someone to port halo 1 and 2 in their entirety.  I think it would be cool, although i never liked civ and I can't even run homebrew...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Except someone has already <a class="postlink" href="http://pinocchio.jk0.org/halo2/" target="_blank">ported Halo 2 to the GBA</a> back in April.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I would have saw the source if I had know how to do it, but I only know how to do this: make &amp; make install with the source in Kubuntu :-p
<br/>
<br/>
I have not idea of programming (like i said in the first post), so posts like Joat's one, are out of place... I only had skills programming Basiq in my old Amstrad CPC :) for example----&gt; print "Hi, my name is Manolo and I'm beautiful" xD
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe porting it to DSLinux would be easier but, the cost of resources (I think) would be to much higher, and the implementation of the wifi libs would be perfect for a game like this one ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Ilomoga said a port of openTTD, a very good option too :D other idea is to support Simcity 2000 (Snes edition), the emulator is a bit paused but I hope to see it running again :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just to make it clear: We don't want someone to port it for us but we said it would be cool if it would be ported ;)<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yep, I'm using Kubuntu 4 months ago :D I said goodbye to win definitely, maybe I will install Suse in other PC hehe</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
