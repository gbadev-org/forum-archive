    <h4>#85677 - walaber - Thu Jun 01, 2006 7:07 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This is my first DS game I'm currently working on, called "Rubber Bands".  it is based on a simple particle physics library that I wrote, that has support for static lines, particles, stiff rods, and "rubber bands", which are the main feature of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
the game itself is a collection of mini-games that are based around the physics.
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have the game done soon for release... it currently works on Dualis, and on the hardware of course.

From the looks of it, you've managed to get a design which rivals lots of pro puzzle games.
<br/>
Sure, it's simple and we've all thought of it, but doing it this smoothly on DS is really nice and the number of modes that you have put into one single concept gives it fantastic potential.
<br/>
I can see all sorts of features like an intuitive level design segment and nicely seemlessly integrated puzzle types.

he posted on the first site, that hell release a testversion for everyone, so there are no betatester requested...

i hope the betaversion works on m3, because there were a lot of problems with the first versions of blubb until qw3rty fixed it(i was betatester), but now i got my gbamp back so, i have 2 chances of working :D

if the app has problems with m3, go to qw3rty, he can tell you what to do:

The following crashes are occuring for me on hardware (Flashme v6) booting through Moonshell with nds build booting on GBAMP:
<br/>
<br/>
The Catch game will crash immeadiately upon lifting the stylus when I draw a rubber band.
<br/>
Same thing happens to Basket game...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm finding the Egg Drop game impossible, as the egg sometimes passes through barriers. I like the idea though, so don't pull it out just because I think it's hard! (And maybe I'm doing it completely wrong).
<br/>
The player could be able to draw a rubber band / stiff rod which connects to the egg?
<br/>
<br/>
If I draw a rubber band that has a length of 0 (occurs in Complete game, when I can not draw any more bands), the game will crash.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I've experienced disappearing rubber bands, (well the ends are still there) as well as the object going through a rubber band, as mentioned by someone else. One thing, I dont know if this is intentional... if you're still dragging when you start test in complete mode, the rubber band end seems to move on its own, and wont stop until you get back into edit. Should be easy for you to fix though.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, impressive game, makes a lot of fun. I also always wanted to write a physics engine sometime...
<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed some small bugs:
<br/>
If I start the game with moonshell, it crashes in the catch game after drawing the first rubber band. If I instead use DSOrganize to start it, it works fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if the particles are too fast, they go right through the rubber band and sometimes the particle changes sides. Seems to be a problem with the collision code.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Collision detection has some bugs, my particles fall through the bands
<br/>
<br/>
To create invisible bands, just use to many of them in complete mode or egg drop, (btw i got 1500 ^^)
<br/>
<br/>
and also i noticed that when i use the game and i draw a band, then let go (on second 2 modes) it crases the game and goes to the menu,
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, i cannot access complete mode, and sometimes some of the other modes , i think its because of a high score bug    -23142354236 is my high score (something like that)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for the info everyone!  I have decided to make some changes to the game:
<br/>
<br/>
1. updated to the latest devkitARM (r19).
<br/>
2. switching to fixed-point math for all calculations (in this process right now).
<br/>
<br/>
I now have the physics converted over to fixed point, and the high-throw game works on the fixed-point build (sort of).  this should make a large improvement on the speed/stability of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
once I have the entire game working in fixed point mode, I will release a new beta, and we'll go from there!<br/>_________________<br/>Go Go Gadget NDS!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Here is an updated version of the game.  The changes are:
<br/>
1. Updated to devkitARM r19
<br/>
2. Moved to fixed-point calculations instead of floating point
<br/>
3. Some general clean-up.
<br/>
<br/>
the major physics issues that were present in the old version are not fixed yet.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would love it if those interested would take some time and let me know a few things:
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Is this version more stable (less crashing) than the previous version?
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Are there any NEW physics-related bugs?

Sad thing you can't save replays

on the other hand.. the new release seems alot faster and stable but the feel is different.. the band seems to responce/move/hit different :)
<br/>
the highthrow hits the sides and the rubberband stretchs longer faster.. might be a bug or not

edit: I threw the high throw and got some graphic corruption... M3 CF (after the corruption the game seemed slower)

i can still get one end of the particle through though :D

If the problems with the particles passing through objects when they're going too fast become a lot of trouble, I'm thinking you could get away with using it as a gameplay element, where having them go too fast breaks an elastic.
<br/>
(Of course, by the point that it can tell when it's passing through an object without hitting it, it's already half way to solving the problem... but still :))<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

That won't help in this case, the movement of particles is treated as a line, so collision is simple line vs. line intersection... so a smaller timestep won't help to prevent "tunneling", because that's not that's happening...

damn, I thought these bugs were squashed... I will look closer into the stylus release code in "catch", and the bug in "complete" is probably related to loading the level file from the filesystem... maybe there's something funny going on there... it works great on my SC (CF 64MB) via SuperPass2.

<br/>
you have to build a strcture out of particles and stiff rods, and then wrap the "egg" (green particle) with rubber bands so it doesn't shoot out and hit the walls.

there are definately some bugs in it still though.

I have fixed several gameplay bugs, and started some general optimizations to the code, which have really sped up the EggDrop game in particular.  I have quite a bit more that I can optimize, and I have found some mysterious slowdown in a few situations as well, so I will continue to work on that.

I trust you realize that my last post was in comparison to my earlier post. With that said, here's how every game works, with my M3 SD slim version and launching it from the firmware browser:
<br/>
<br/>
1. High Throw: Works flawlessly.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Catch: Crashes when I lift the stylus or when I keep it pressed for too long (unless there is some other variable that I'm not considering.) The crash freezes the screen, and no control will respond.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Basket: Works great.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Complete: Will crash when selecting 'start.' Screens fade to black and it stays like that.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Egg Drop: In Particle mode, I can add particles more or less anywhere (they seem to snap to a grid,) but when I press A it starts falling and I have no control over anything. The red particles bounce off the hazards and the green particle keeps a straight line downward until it hits the first hazard. In Rubber Band and Stiff Rod modes, touching the screen does nothing, either before or after pressing A.
<br/>
<br/>
That's it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
for EggDrop, you have to place particles in PARTICLE mode, and then in RUBBER BAND or ROD mode, you drag bands/rods from existing particles to other existing particles.
<br/>
<br/>
I will post a short video showing an example:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">OK, the new build shows some improvements: Complete now works until the particle stops bouncing--then it freezes. I tried Egg Drop following your intructions, but I still don't understand what it's about, I can't really make the egg move at all, maybe this is not how it's supposed to work--oh, and if I created too many rubber bands or stiff rods, it would freeze. The rest of the games work exactly the same as described in my previous post, including the problems with Catch.
<br/>
<br/>
You know, I've been having an awful time trying to remember what game is called what. You should consider giving each game either a much more descriptive and specific name (for instance, Basket could very well apply to Complete, or Egg Drop to Catch,) or perhaps create a theme for every mode and name them after that. High Throw works, in my opinion, but the others could use some work. I might think of some alternatives.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I used the supercard NDS version and my evaluation of bugs...
<br/>
<br/>
None that I can find. It never freezes, I play the games as much as I want. There IS the occasional particle that falls through the band, but it's not enough to render the game unplayable. I thoroughly enjoy the egg drop. It's interesting coming up with designs where the egg won't bounce outside the sides.
<br/>
<br/>
Only once did something odd happen. During the first time I played egg toss, it seemed to get stuck to the side of the tunnel, like gravity was pulling from the left. I was able to go back into edit mode and touch and drag the casing further down. This hasn't happened again.
<br/>
<br/>
And finally, did anyone notice the highscores when you first start, they're either astronomically high, or in the negatives. I always use L+R to clear them before starting a game however.
<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion... AWESOME game. A level editor kind of deal would be awesome (I think I saw it mentioned in this thread somewhere, but I may be confusing it with something else). Only thing I think of is when this gets bigger, instead of little red crosses and such, maybe replace it with some sort of graphic. I'm fine with the way it is now so I don't have any ideas about the graphic. Well, I'm done. -goes back to playing Egg Drop-</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
several fixes in this version... 
<br/>
* I realized I wasn't creating the .sc.nds / .ds.gba properly- there was no loader appended.  hopefully this will help with some compatibility issues.
<br/>
* tweaked the phyics a bit.
<br/>
* improved the High Throw game.
<br/>
* rearranged and added a few new levels to the Complete game.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Supercard SD - used .sc.nds, .ds.gba, .nds

<br/>
All show the same problems.
<br/>
<br/>
In CATCH, it freezes when I let go and freezes when I hold on too long. In COMPLETE it freezes after the first time the particle disappears (whether by lying on the floor or after level complete). If I press A to edit while it's still in the air it works fine till next level.
<br/>

Your previous version, the .sc.nds worked just fine for me, before the physic tweaks and discovery of wrongful creation.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yeah, I think that was what I meant...I misremember the exact total.  Anyway, High Throw is much smoother now as you say, I seem to be still having a problem though.  I got to 33xx (over 3065 at least)...I can't recall the exact number but strangely it looks like the high throw's 'box' runs out if you get it up that high. O_o  Maybe that has something to do with the problem.
<br/>
<br/>
*edit*
<br/>
Actually, I just managed to whip the rubber band OUTSIDE of the box...I got it up high and it happened to be at a slight angle and went outside the box, fell down a bit, then it went to the next throw.  Throw was 3205 on that one, so the size of the box wouldn't be more than that.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you press A and try to build anything it goes all wacky and you need to press B. Both my screens turned yellow if I try to place a rubberband. Anyway, you should put a top on EggToss or at least sides that extend out for it to crash into if you do that.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

just a few fixes in this version... probably nothing that fixes compatibility b/c I simply can't reproduce the bugs here.
<br/>
<br/>
this version adds a few new Complete levels, and also fixes the slowdown that could happen in Complete and EggDrop.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I truly don't understand the crashes... the code at the end of a complete level to either reset or go to the next level just removes the particle from the simulation, which is the same basic code that runs in Basket, Catch, and EggDrop modes...  so I'm a bit stumped.
<br/>
<br/>
I will try to fix the "leaving the world" issues in High Throw, although it's pretty difficult because the particles have no radius...  
<br/>
<br/>
I agree a "sandbox" mode would be pretty cool as well... my next game will probably be more along those lines :)
