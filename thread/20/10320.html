    <h4>#92045 - Sebbo - Tue Jul 11, 2006 9:19 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Decided it was about time something like this was started since some things are said over and over on each page of some threads. I aim to try and keep this up-to-date as problems are fixed or present themselves. 
<br/>
<br/>
This is a list of general problems (and their solutions) that people are having with running WiFi homebrew (mainly on the connecting side of things). For problems specifically relating to the functionality of an application, use the relevant thread for that app.
<br/>
<br/>
If something isn't listed here, take these steps:
<br/>
1. <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/search.php" target="_blank">Use the Search function!</a> its there, so bloody well use it
<br/>
2. After confirming that your problem hasn't been solved in another thread, ask in this thread and someone should (hopefully) answer and the problem and confirmed solution will be added to this list.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of the most frequent for now, will update when i have more time to look back in some of the threads
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Problem: The DS won't connect to my Nintendo WiFi USB Connector even though official games work</span>
<br/>
Follow <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=64212#64212" target="_blank">Waffle's guide</a> to setting up the USB Connector and SoftAP.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, you should have a network that looks like this:
<br/>
Modem &lt;-&gt; Gateway (your network might not have this, but many do) &lt;-&gt; LAN via Router or Switch/Hub &lt;-&gt; Computer with USB Connector &lt;-&gt; Wireless Network
<br/>
Set up the network settings for the computer with the USB connector to something similar to below (Network Connections under Windows XP, go Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections, right click and go to Properties)
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="code">Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection: (this is your already existing LAN, you shouldn't have to change any settings here)
<br/>
IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.120 
<br/>
Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0 
<br/>
Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1 
<br/>
<br/>
Ethernet adapter Wireless Network Connection: (this is the USB Connector)
<br/>
IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.129 
<br/>
Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0 
<br/>
Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 
<br/>
</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Note that your settings do not have to be exactly the same as this, but the same general format.
<br/>
After you have changed these settings, in Network Connections, click on one of the connections, hold down CTRL and click the other so they are both selected, then right-click and select "Bridge Connections" from the menu.
<br/>
Now all that's left is to go into your DSs WiFi settings and make sure the following is set:
<br/>
IP Address: 192.168.0.117 or similar, just make sure the first three groups of numbers are the same as those set on your PC for your LAN
<br/>
Gateway: 192.168.0.1 or whatever you have set for Default Gateway on your PC
<br/>
Primary DNS: same address as Gateway
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Problem: DS won't connect using automatic WFC settings even though Mario Kart etc will (using router or SoftAP+USB stick)</span>
<br/>
my recommendation is to not use DHCP (even though it should work)
<br/>
jump on a computer connected to your wireless network, and assuming your running Windows, go Start -&gt; Run, then type command and press enter. when command prompt loads, type ipconfig and you should get something like this:
<br/>

<br/>
enter that info into your WiFi Connection settings on your DS, but change the last digits (after the last .) in IP Address to something else (i'm using 189) just make sure its less than 255 (inclusive) and that no other computer on the network is using that address<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Sebbo on Thu Jul 20, 2006 2:31 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

If you use the new version (2916) with the official USB stick, you should not use the modified EXE files from nin_wifi.rar. Instead use the ones in this rar:

One thing you should add to your first post, is that when using WEP, official games need Network Authentication to be set to Shared. When using homebrew I believe it needs to be set to Open.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
i think the main conflict in IP addresses will be between the LAN card and SoftAP on the computer that SoftAP is running on (as i doubt you have 255 computers running ;-) ). These will basically act as two seperate networks, just bridged by your computer. 
<br/>
have a look and see if the IP addresses for SoftAP and your LAN card are the same, if they are change your SoftAP address. you can just change the last digit, or i believe you should be able to change the second last digit (if it was 192.168.<span style="text-decoration: underline">0</span>.1 you could change it to 192.168.<span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.1, as they should act as seperate networks). if you take the second option, remember to change your DS's IP (if your not using automatic settings) so that the first three groups of digits are the same, ie. 192.168.1 in this example
<br/>
hope that helps

If you have a good router, you might be able filter the MAC addresses of your WiFi devices and only specify the devices you know you will use on the network (like you DS, laptops, PSPs, etc.). This all assumes that you have control of your network access point (ie: your router). If you're on a public WiFi network (like a school, university, library, etc.), then you're SOL and at the mercy of whatever they have setup.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

Hmmm... Problem is my network is like this.
<br/>
<br/>
Internet (DSL)  -----&gt; Dad's Comp &lt;---&gt; MS HOME (LAN) &lt;----&gt; My Comp &lt;--- Wireless Network Connection (buffalo. etc)
<br/>
<br/>
and there can only be one shared internet connection on one subnet, the dsl. And networks can only interact with other networks on one subnet.
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it is the nintendo wi-fi setup does, it sets the wireless network Connection as a regular home connection and sets my mshome as a second shared connection, i don't know how it does this, but it makes it work. Problem is, when i go to uninstall the nintendo program, it removes the sharing on my mshome.  So I am back to square 1.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if I set the wireless connection to the same subnet as my mshome, and my dsl, my mshome cannot even reach my dad's comp.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Have you tried sharing the LAN connection on your computer after uninstalling the Nintendo program? What happens when you try this?
<br/>
<br/>
An alternative option, which may work, is on your computer, bridge the LAN and Wireless Network Connection. This way, everything will be on the same subnet (that includes your Dad's comp). In this scenario, on the DS you would set the Gateway and DNS servers to be your Dad's Comp. 
<br/>
However, when I tried to bridge my setup, I found that after a few mins of playing, the connection would just die out. This may have been caused by my ADSL router. Using ICS fixed that problem. You may have better luck!
<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you could try bridging first. To bridge, open Network Connections on your computer, select both the LAN connection and the wireless connection (ctrl+click on them both), right-click and select Bridge Connections.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I tried the bridge, and it said unable to connect to server. Access point is okay though. That is with wifi-options on mario kart, using shared wep. I find that when I disable WEP my ds does not connect at all. I have no homebrew that can rach the net on open WEP.
<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I noticed was that when the nintendo installer was finished. The resulting network for the usb connector was a regular lan, not a wireless one.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, when it is in the bridge, my pc can reach the internet thru the lan, no problem, but the wireless network and my ds can't reach the net. With is pretty weird considering a bridge joins the ip's of my lan and my wnc.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the earlier suggestion though, but i had sort of tried it already. It fixes the wireless connection not being able to exist at all with the other connection working thing though.
<br/>
<br/>
I can confirm the access point works all right, as sylphamp works great.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: Do I need it in Ad-hoc mode? B/C that is grayed out. Only infrastructure works. And is there some way to find out exactly what the nintendo setup exe does to share that connection, or a way to change my wireless network into a home network.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing worth mentioning: the home network created by the nintendo setup is viewable on my dad's computer, while my wireless network connection is not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#93417 - Waffle - Wed Jul 19, 2006 12:56 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok. Let's try a different approach.
<br/>
First, disable WEP completely.
<br/>
Disabling WEP requires both these things to be set:
<br/>
Network Authentication: Open
<br/>
Data Encryption: Disabled
<br/>
<br/>
Then remove all bridges and internet connection sharings on your computer.
<br/>
Check if SylphAMP works correctly (to see if the access point is still ok).
<br/>
Now either choose the ICS or bridge method - do it on your computer.
<br/>
Check if your internet from your computer works fine.
<br/>
Now on your computer and your dad's computer, open a command prompt (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; cmd), type:
<br/>
ipconfig /all
<br/>
And post the results here.

Okay. I disabled WEP, seems i had it set on shared when i put it on disable, b/c it works now. I don't really care about security, this is my house, not a workplace, so I'll leave it off.

<br/>
I can't do ICS at all, so I re-bridged it. SylphAMP kept on working after i bridged. My dad is on his comp, so I can't post the results of his ipconfig (he would kill me if he saw me running cprompt on his comp, might be able to post it tommorrow. However here are my results.

Reason they are on diff. subnets on unbridged is b/c my lan won't even connect to the internet when it is on the same subnet as my wnc.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Thanks for all the help!! Now people connecting through a network that is not wireless can get in on the fun.
<br/>
<br/>
To summarize: to connect your wireless network to your home network, first you must bridge your connections. And then you have to assign your ds an ip address in the same subnet, and for gateway and primary dns, put the gateway OF THE NETWORK BRIDGE. In other words, put the shared internet connection ip, (usually 192.168.0.1) as the gateway, and primary dns. You don't have to do this if you connect straight to the internet from your computer.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Phew after picking up a Belkin F5D7000 v3 and running the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/support/download/dld/spt_dld_detail.php?UID=584&amp;kind=8" target="_blank">MSI software</a> on it followed by updating to the latest Ralink driver I'm all set running 802.11 Ad Hoc...
<br/>
<br/>
Just 3 notes for people
<br/>
1) Each time you change to 'Gateway mode' you will need to go into your Network connections-&gt;Internet connection sharing-&gt;Advanced and just tick the DNS on.
<br/>
2) You must ensure the Wireless device has a static IP &amp; Subnet mask setup (Network connections-&gt;Properties of the connection-&gt;Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-&gt;Properties [NOTE this should set itself when switching to Gateway mode]
<br/>
Side note you only need 'Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)' ticked as well thats all your doing using raw TCP/IP communication.
<br/>
3) The WEP works but you cannot use any characters other than alpha numeric ones (so no []/\,;'-= - I think the setup application fails to address those characters correctly changing them into there %value codes - web browsers)
<br/>
<br/>
Well that was a fun waste of a couple of days LOL
<br/>
<br/>
PS If your wondering WTF how did you get the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/support/download/dld/spt_dld_file_record.php?folder=2&amp;kind=8&amp;name=MSI_WLAN_WPA_Software_4.3.1.4.zip" target="_blank">MSI software</a> to work - took me a while but eh my first wireless network (poo security though lol)...
<br/>
<br/>
1) you need to install the specific driver, assuming your using the <a class="postlink" href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=136479" target="_blank">Belkin F5D7000 v3</a> or any other RT2500 based mini PCI card, you need the  <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm" target="_blank">'802.11g MiniPCI Wireless Network Adapter'</a> driver installed (I ripped the driver files from the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm" target="_blank">RT61+RT2500 installer exe</a> to avoid installation of the dead AP Software they provide (Their software AP seems to be written not to work and bridges connections which means that your local PC cannot access the connections in the bridge when it's running - A good/bad thing depending on what you want to do)
<br/>
2) hexedit the file 'C:\Program Files\MicroStar\WLANUtility\APUtility.exe' and change one of the references in it to match your VEN, DEV &amp; SUBSYS (The references start at 0x3E740) - it looks for a specific SUBSYS if you don't change it the program will run so far and die - memory error
<br/>
<br/>
Oh lastly you having trouble extracting that RT61+RT2500 driver??
<br/>
The easiest way is to run the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.ralinktech.com/supp-1.htm" target="_blank">RT61+RT2500 installer exe</a> and then copy the drivers from the 'C:\Program Files\RALINK\RT6x Wireless LAN Card\Installer\WINXP\' folder. Afterwards you can simply uninstall the Ralink drivers, this gets rid of the garbage Rarlink exe's.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and with this no more thrid party aegis protocols! YAY n.n
<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE NOTE All this is XP only (I think all the Ralink related drivers Soft AP/Gateway exe's are)
<br/>
<br/>
PPPPPS Secure your wifi by MAC address - it's not much but every little helps :) - there are manuals on the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/support/download/dld/spt_dld_file_record.php?folder=3&amp;kind=8&amp;name=SoftwareAP-only_forXP.zip" target="_blank">MSI site</a> if you need help doing that
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and EDIT anyone know if/how I can hide my SSID using these drivers??? (yeah I know it's kinda pointless security but still it helps) - Oh well I think it's done by software and this software doesn't seem to have a hide ssid function oh well</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I got DSAIM, Wifichat, and Sylphirc to work because I configured my Nitendo USB dongle to be a softap. Everything was fine and I sat in chat for a while. Then I tried connecting again later and suddenly everything doesn't work anymore and I freeze at launch for each program. Any reason for this?
<br/>
<br/>
-I allready checked and disabled the WEP.
<br/>
-I allready disabled and reenabled the network
<br/>
-I allready reconfigured through metroid hunters
<br/>
-Wifi games work on commercial games
<br/>
-I allready filled my battery
<br/>
-I allready put everything in the root folder
<br/>
<br/>
*NEW*
<br/>
<br/>
-I allready bridged connections between my wireless and LAN.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else I could do? Could a CF card go slower if more stuff is on it? I currently have like 400-500 megs on it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

if that doesn't work, have you changed any part of your network at all? (sounds like a silly question, i know, but sometimes its the silly things that you miss). if not, some details on your network (ie the layout) and the address settings on your computer, router and DS will greatly help us help you
<br/>
<br/>
kienzan: i'm not sure why the programs would freeze...my guess is that it has something to do with how they're being launched...try launching them from Moonshell, DS Organise or Mighty Max's Multibooter and see if that helps...also, if DHCP (ie. auto obtain ip address etc) for you DS is turned on, turn it off and assign the IP address to it yourself. sorry, but i don't trust DHCP in the current wifilib much, seems to be a cause of most  problems at some point or another...that and i like control ;-)<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't know what's wrong. Is the access point speed set to 802.11b Only? Maybe check the settings on the DS? 
<br/>
<br/>
clone dad,
<br/>
Did you enable WEP? If so, homebrew doesn't support Shared network authentication. However, sgstair's newest wifi lib does. So hopefully when more homebrew uses the newer lib, there will be no WEP problems between normal games and homebrew.
<br/>
<br/>
albob,
<br/>
IP address settings need to be set correctly. Otherwise you cause conflicts and routing problems which is why you are unable to access the internet when you do it wrong. The ASUS control centre will show ICS as enabled even if you use Network Connections to set up ICS. That is normal. Post an "ipconfig /all" if you want me to attempt to come up with some IP address settings that may work for you...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Before you continue, make sure you have removed the Nintendo software and drivers as they will no longer be needed. 
<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Drivers folder of my RAR file, you will find modified Buffalo drivers. Install these drivers for the USB Connector

first is to unrar the archive into a folder, then use the Add New Hardware Wizard, when it asks for a location for the drivers, browse to that folder

the second is to go into Device Manager, find the USB stick and go to the properties, click the Driver tab, then Update Driver. then browse to a folder that you've unrar'd the archive into

i don't have the USB stick, so this is just guess work, but the second way is similiar to what you had to do for WiFiMe<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Sebbo's second method is correct.
<br/>
The steps to do this are:
<br/>
<br/>
Extract the <span style="font-style: italic">Drivers</span> folder from the RAR file.
<br/>
Open <span style="font-style: italic">Device Manager</span> (<span style="font-style: italic">Control Panel</span> -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic">System</span> -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic">Hardware</span> -&gt; <span style="font-style: italic">Device Manager</span>).
<br/>
Under <span style="font-style: italic">Network Adapters</span>, right-click on your USB dongle, and select <span style="font-style: italic">Update Driver...</span>.
<br/>
Depending on the way your system is configured, you may get a dialog asking if you want to search Windows Update for a driver, select No.
<br/>
Now select <span style="font-style: italic">Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)</span> and click <span style="font-style: italic">Next</span>.
<br/>
Select <span style="font-style: italic">Don't search. I will choose the driver to install.</span> and click <span style="font-style: italic">Next</span>.
<br/>
Click the <span style="font-style: italic">Have Disk...</span> button. Then click the <span style="font-style: italic">Browse</span> button and go to the folder to where you extracted the drivers from the RAR file before, and select the INF file. Then click Next and rest should be straightfoward.
<br/>
<br/>
If when installing the drivers, you are prompted for "rt25usbap.sys" on the official WiFi USB connector's CD, then something has gone wrong.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hello, Bomber here...
<br/>
<br/>
I am just another person who needs help, after tryin' to get Beup workin' right serveral times. This is all the information I've gathered and I hope someone can help me out. Please help after readin' the followin: 
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">First things first:</span>
<br/>
* Passcard3 and a Supercard (DS Lite)
<br/>
* Mini SD
<br/>
* Wireless internet (Usin' WEP)
<br/>
* IP: 192.168.1.12
<br/>
* Usin' Beup 0.3 chishm (also have Beup 0.3 rein, but usin' this as backup.)
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Problem:</span>
<br/>
* I power up my DS Lite and execute Beup 0.3 . Then, if I do nothin', Beup himself uses 'firmware' and I arrive at the next page. From there, if I fill in my email and password, leave the two boxes for 'auto loggin' and 'fix blur' open, change my start status to everythin' BUT offline and hit the connect button, Beup begins to connect. And that's where it all ends. Last two words:
<br/>
<br/>
"Doing handshake.."
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Things I have already done, but do not understand:</span>
<br/>
* I can interfere from the moment I execute Beup and need to fill in my IP address by pressin' 'stop'. Then I can make Beup find a couple of SSID's, includin' my wireless connection, but even then if I choose my own connection I will get the same outcome. Normally, Beup uses 'firmware' to connect and the SSID stays blank. W...what?
<br/>
<br/>
* I read somewhere that in order to save your settings, you have to copy 'save.sav', rename it to the same Beup you're using and then add it, in my case, in the SD Card. Enter your settings one time when executin' Beup, immediatly disconnect, goto the saver menu of the Supercard and press A two times to save everythin'. I did this, although as discribed earlier, if I connect usin' SSID, disconnect and then save in the saver menu, Beup will not remember the SSID I logged in with. Huh?
<br/>
<br/>
* I've changed my WIFI connections in the DS usin' Metroid Hunters/Lost Magic (Great games =D) I've changed the last digit of my IP address. So to say, .12 became .13 . Question: My normal IP ends with .12 , but I've changed the IP address to .13 in my DS. Which IP must I use to log in at Beup? .12 , .13 or somethin' else?
<br/>
<br/>
* I've taken a good look at my internet connection and I think everythin' is supposed to be as it is. The connection is OPEN, not SHARED. I can't seem to disable my WEP, but from what I have heard Beup can work with or without WEP. The WEP keys are HEX, not ACSII. The only thin' I haven't seen yet is 'DHCP'. I heard that DHCP can be the problem, but then again kevinc himself said that Beup is supposed to work with DHCP.
<br/>
<br/>
That's 'bout it. If I forgot somethin', please let me know. I hope someone took his/her precious time to read all this and help me out. I would appriciate it from the bottom of my heart.
<br/>
<br/>
Bomber out.   ?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">in no particularly order...
<br/>
<br/>
just to clarify, the last group of digits (on the right) need to be different from every other computer connected to your network.
<br/>
<br/>
i think when using your settings saved in the firmware to connect, it doesn't bother to update the screen using that info, so as long as one of the 3 slots in your firmware connection setup is configured to connect with your access point, then it will connect using that (unless of course you press stop)
<br/>
<br/>
don't take my word for it, but i think that the save file only stores your username and password. i could be wrong, but the easiest way to check is to just open it up in notepad (you could then change your settings there too)
<br/>
<br/>
how long has it sat on "doing handshake" for? sometimes if there's too much traffic on your internet line it will take a while
<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps a bit<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I downloaded Beup 0.3 Final and today I've tried it. As you would have guessed, still no luck. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've handshaked my hand off. The time limit of one session handshake is like 7/8 minutes or so and I've been there...   ..trust me.
<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify, I'm usin' 192.168.1.13 as IP address and I'm absolutly sure no other computer has that IP address on this network. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, every bar stays blank when I open/execute Beup. It's connects tho, so I will be thankfull for that.

I find it very odd that homebrew wifi things are not working for you.
<br/>
Can you post the wifi settings that you are using on your DS?
<br/>
Have you tried deleting all wifi connection profiles, and using only the first slot?
<br/>
Could you try and use <a class="postlink" href="http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/wifi_lib_test.nds" target="_blank">sgstair's wifi_lib_test</a> and connect using that?
<br/>
Just run wifi_lib_test.nds on your DS, select "Connect to an AP", then "Use Nintendo WFC Data". It will then try and connect. If it is successful, it should end up at a menu with options like "UDP Test" and "DNS Test". Select "DNS Test" and just hit the "Accept" button. It should come up with a screen of <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">www.google.com</a>'s IP addresses.
<br/>
If there are some errors, or it gets stuck in the connection process, please post what happened.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

here's my experience with ds wifi with last homebrew versions :
<br/>
- wep never works

<br/>
1. "on boot" (i navigate to r4 browser and choose the right nds)
<br/>
- dsorganize 2.7 : works !
<br/>
- all others (dsftp, beup, ndsmail, liveweather, wifichat) : don't work...
<br/>
2. "on soft reset" after intializing wifi in a game (i test the connection in the game then the r4 allow me to press L+R+A+B+X+Y to softly reboot my ds, which seem not ro reinit the wifi)
<br/>
- dsorganize 2.7 : hangs ! (completely, the timer is stopped)
<br/>
- all others (same list) : work !
<br/>
<br/>
so i guess it's a just an initialization problem of wifi in homebrews (or in the lib ?)...well i'd rather all homebrews work like dsorganize for init....</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That is so odd. Cause around the same time that happened to you my homebrew stopped functioning using my SI-624 d-link router.  I have the same mem card and an R4DS. I've never been able to connect to dsaim, beup, but the dsorganize browser and irc client worked perfectly. I think it all stopped working after i added the Bunjalloo Web Browser to my mem card, that didn't connect and after that nothing else connected after. Maybe it was a coincidence, but i've already reformatted the card and nothing has helped. I ran the wifi_lib_test v3a and I can see my SSID at 0% only when I physically hold the ds system near the router.

we seem to have the same problem : activate "soft reset" (by pressing R button before launching the game so the upper-right corner icon is green), then launch a wifi game (like tetris), test your wifi ap within wifi control panel (try not to use wep), go back to the game main menu and "soft reset" (L+R+A+B+X+Y).

I'm using the SoftAP method as well to turn my (Buffalo) Nintendo WiFi USB Connector into an access point. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've got everything set up correctly, and I've tested the ICS with a separate computer to make sure it was working (it was). 
<br/>
<br/>
Using Wifi_lib_test.nds I can see the access point and connect and configure to it just fine. It accepts my settings, sees the network, says "Connected", and lets me perform all of the queries, returning the correct results each time (such as for DNS query, it correctly returns the IP addresses of any website). 
<br/>
<br/>
When I boot up into DSAIM and try to use the same settings every time I try to log in I get "ERROR: Could not resolve host".

<span style="font-weight: bold">TL;DR VERSION:</span>
<br/>
<ul>
<br/>
Nintendo WiFi Buffalo USB Stick

SoftAP hacked drivers and software
<br/>
Computer with wireless card can access and share internet
<br/>
NDS games Wifi manual Setup and Connection Test successful

wifi_lib_test successful, can dns pretty much anything

<br/>
I'm using a manual IP configuration, and since both a separate computer AND wiw_lib_test work, I'm pretty sure those settings are correct.

I've already opened the connection, disabled WEP, broadcast the SSID, tried 802.11b-only mode, made sure there were no limited connection settings, tried both ICS and bridged connections.

I'm pretty close to just going out and buying a wireless router, but I figured since I have this USB connector I'd try everything else first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sites with "heaven", "temp", and "max" in their name provide at least some resources more useful to pirates than to homebrew users. They also promote open discussion of piracy methods, even if they do ban links to the actual sites where infringing copies are available.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I'm using an R4, real games and backups all connect. And I highly doubt this would affect WiFi, but might as well say just in case; none of the three homebrew launchers in DSOrganize are working, even when I replace the default exec_stub.bin with the R4 one. =/

I have a rather new (2 months) NDS Lite, R4 with latest O.S. I do not have any dongle, just a access point and a router-modem.

I tried everything. Let me write the checklist, please tell me if there's anything I can test:
<br/>
<br/>
- WFC config is ok. IP is static, there is no IP conflict. I tried with and winthout WEP. I tried by setting DNS to my provider's and DNS same as gateway, as waffle suggested. Gateway is the same as windows XP ipconfig says. And, of course, commercial games WFC goes very well.
<br/>
<br/>
- I tried connecting with a commercial game then soft-reset and connecting with homebrew. Nothing. Not to mention that after I do this the touch screen doesn't work (?) until I hard-reset so I hat do to it with the buttons.
<br/>
<br/>
- I tested with DS Organize (latest), Okiwi and DS Wifi test program.
<br/>
<br/>
- I tried setting DHCP off, I tried to set it on and everything to automatic on the DS (in this case, neither commercial games work). With wifi test I can see my access point and seemingly load WFC config. too, but even if it wasn't so, I tried to input manually the settings and connect again. Nope.
<br/>
<br/>
The message with the homebrew is always: unable to connect to AP.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Incredible - through reading this forum I managed to obtain all the homebrew I needed to test my connection, configure my wifi (well using Tetris), and connect to my next door unsecured wireless router. Even got ftp server DSFTP running fine.
<br/>
<br/>
Excellent forum...good sticky stuff too.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to connect to my laptop so I can just use it to transfer laptop to NDSL direct. And this is where I run out of info and experience.
<br/>
(I don't want to keep using next door's router either ! - it's not polite)
<br/>
<br/>
If I set my laptop wireless config to "computer to computer - adhoc" instead of "AP - infrastructure" I think I should be able to get the NDSL to go direct to the laptop. But using the wifi test or DSFTP fails to authenticate.
<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing some kind of software connection to link the network layer to the laptop via this ad-hoc connection I create on my laptop ?<br/>_________________<br/>Andy..

Just registered to second McBain6666 on this solution.  I have a brand new 1 month old DS Lite using a CycloDS and a 1gb SD card, connecting through a wireless router (BT VOYAGER2110).
<br/>
<br/>
I tried everything from turning off WEP to turning off DHCP and manually assigning my DS Lite an IP associated with its MAC address and then reconfiguring nintendo WFC through a commercial game.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the solution was changing my wireless channel from channel 2 to 10.  Now everything works great!  Thanks for the solution!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
