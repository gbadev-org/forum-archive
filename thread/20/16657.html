I need a volunteer to capture/dump the <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/wmb-asm/wiki/NintendoSpot" target="_blank">Nintendo Zone</a> client in UK/JP,(Perhaps US, in New York City Nintendo World store) and with my tools, inject a hack into the client and run the hacked client. The purpose of this hack is to dump info about data used for the Nintendo Spot series server authentication system. Once the client connects the server, press L and R. A console will be displayed, displaying the dumps. Note the displayed hex dumps either on paper or other non-ds hb means. Press A, then note the data. Press A, then note each pzA WEP key, IDs 0 - 3, pressing A after noting each. The screen will turn black when all of the dumps have been displayed. Optionally, attempt to connect to the pzA/"Nintendo Zone" AP with homebrew. Note that dumping WEP keys is a bonus feature benefiting only homebrew basically, as all Nintendo Spot series server communications are https/SSL secured.(Dunno if there's anything blocking non-nds mac address Wifi devices connecting though) Contact me via PM, or at yellowstar6 [at] gmail dot com if you're interested in volunteering for this.
<br/>
<br/>
The client can be dumped with FwWMBDumper. FwWMBDumper is a work in progress, and can only dump to raw sectors. FAT support is being worked on. The signature should be dumped correctly, but banner dumping is currently unsupported. For running FwWMBDumper, you wouldn't flash the hack to fw nand, you'd run a .nds. Only use FwWMBDumper for dumping the Nintendo Zone client if you have a spare storage medium/spare TF card. FwWMBDumper uses DLDI, and should be compatible with all DLDI no larger than 10KB. FwWMBDumper should automatically boot the un-patched client binary once dumping finishes. With other WMB bin dumping tests, this can take anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds. You can use some NDS hb tools I wrote for transferring the binary from raw sector dump to a TF card with FAT, and patching the binary.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by yellowstar on Tue Aug 24, 2010 8:59 pm; edited 4 times in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Nintendo Spot series has been <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/wmb-asm/wiki/NintendoSpot" target="_blank">broken</a>, thus a volunteer is no longer needed.(Nintendo Zone info is going to be obtained by someone found by other means.)
<br/>
It is unknown for certain if the URL will be released, as if the wireless "DS Station" WMB host software downloads the client from Internet, Nintendo could easily shutdown the current server and move to a new one. If the URL would ever be released, the user agent needs changed to the one the client uses, to hide non-ds user agents. And to send the same http request headers that the DS sends, ideally a simple text based client could be written.
<br/>
Currently the demos available on the server are exactly the same as the Japanese Nintendo Channel demos. In the past however, there were some demos that were released on this server first, then released on Nintendo Channel.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A volunteer is needed to get the Nintendo World Store Nintendo Zone AP SSID, to use my nzoneurlstacksmash <a class="postlink" href="http://dsibrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_Zone#Exploits" target="_blank">exploit</a> with US region DSi in DSi-mode. Since the Japanese volunteer is taking a long time to get the JP N Zone AP capture, it would be great if the volunteer could capture a N Zone AP beacon, if possible. On Linux this can be done with: iwlist wlan0 scanning &gt; aplist Aplist would be the output of iwlist which you'd send me. The SSID is 32 characters long. A homebrew app might be able to capture the beacon, such as my old DSPacketCapture app based on sgstair's raw pkt capture app. This beacon is needed to obtain the tag that the Nintendo Zone client checks for, the client ignores APs that don't have this tag. Send me a PM if you're interested in volunteering to get the SSID, and the beacon if possible.(It's <a class="postlink" href="http://code.google.com/p/wmb-asm/source/browse/#svn/trunk/nzoneurlstacksmash" target="_blank">available</a> in wmb-asm <a class="postlink" href="http://wmb-asm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nzoneurlstacksmash/" target="_blank">SVN.</a>)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I exploited a SSL bug on the NZone EUR server to crash DSi NZone but Nintendo fixed the bug quickly server-side, see this: <a href="http://dsibrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_Zone" target="_blank">http://dsibrew.org/wiki/Nintendo_Zone</a>

NZone volunteers are no longer needed since USA NZone test services don't exist anymore.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
