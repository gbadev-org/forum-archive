    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Are there any programs that remember your track position as ipods do?  For example if your 30 minutes into a podcast then turn off the ds it will remember this time.  Then when you start the program again it will return to the 30 minute mark.  
<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't exist are there programs that allow you to easily and accurately change track position to skip to the point in the podcast you were previously at.  I searched about the forum but couldn't really find anything directly addressing my question.  Thanks.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Moonshell will, in fact, do this.
<br/>
<br/>
you might have to go to the options and enable it to remember the position. 
<br/>
<br/>
moonshell also has a search function, using the touch screen. it' really fast, and doesn't really have to "think" about it, like it does with the older encoded movie files for example.<br/>_________________<br/>-01011101001010101010 (frank)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the replies.  I'll give moonshell a go and tell you how it goes.  My ipod just broke and I'm trying to find a good temporary replacement for listening to podcasts.  Hopefully moonshell does the job.  Also in response to a128, I don't know how to move this topic to the homebrew thread.  If people explain how to I will happily move it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
