    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Is it possible to access the wifi configuration screen from a stand-alone NDS ROM?  Or even from within a homebrew game or app?
<br/>
<br/>
Aren't the wifi config screens actually located in the BIOS and commercial games are just handing off to them?  Or is that config menu actually in the games themselves and they all look the same because there's just a completely prewritten function as part of the official devkit that developers just call when they need it?
<br/>
<br/>
If the config screens are indeed in the BIOS, it would be great to have a stand-alone ROM for accessing them, especially if it was integrated with rebootlib so that you were returned to your flash card's menu after finishing.  And the source code should be made open so that other developers can use this as a lib in their own wifi enabled games.
<br/>
<br/>
As it is now, you have to own a DS game that has WFC capabilities in order to use any of the wifi enabled homebrew out there.

is the DS firmware NDS file legal to distribute, or is it warez? I don't see a difference to this and the firmware NDS file (or flashme) in terms of legality.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

We're talking about the official Nintendo one here. In libwifi's current state (which is horribly buggy), I can't even use DSOrganise for anything related to wifi.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Both of the above are correct.
<br/>
<br/>
The transfer function uses Download Play.
<br/>
Also, the icon used is the same one that was posted.
<br/>
<br/>
(The file is probably the file sent for Download Play.
<br/>
It might be in the Download Play format.(since the above attempt failed.)
<br/>
That is, the format used for transfering programs over Download Play.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
