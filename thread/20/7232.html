Thanks to Zhevon for contributing the Sam &amp; Max cursor code. 
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Changes in this version:
<br/>
    * Full GBA Movie Player support, including save/load. This means full talkie games are playable!
<br/>
    * Rewritten blit operations in assembler, causing a speed increase.
<br/>
    * Fixed crashes in Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
<br/>
    * Added Indiana Jones fight mode. Use the options menu to enable it.
<br/>
    * Fixes SRAM clear keypress sometimes not being detected
<br/>
    * Prevented temporary saves from being saved to SRAM on flash cart version.
<br/>
    * Added alternative controls for Sam and Max. Cursor is displayed on the top screen, and D-pad right switches modes.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The performance with Day of the Tentacle on a GBAMP is terrible.  Lots of music stuttering before it plays a voice.  The intro with purple tentacle loses its flow from the slow loading.
<br/>
<br/>
The filesystem code should be changed to run in the background somehow.
<br/>
<br/>
I personally think Adlib support should be abandoned, since it's a huge CPU hog.  It needs its own sound engine that uses the DS's built in sound channels.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Yep, talkie games with music  are very slow.  Loading from CF ususally cases the sound to stutter because it's quite a long blocking load.  It couldn't run in the background because ScummVM needs the full sample at once. :-(
<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to write a nice sampled music driver with a GM sample set it would be incredibly handy for use with ScummVM.   Problems is, there's not really the RAM left for the samples.
<br/>
<br/>
I've not done anything for the Supercard, as I still have no info on it.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Full Throttle and The Dig won't work.  They take too much RAM and so I stripped their engines out to save memory for other games.
<br/>
<br/>
And your savegames will be compatible from v0.2 but not from v0.1.  But you probably guessed that!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

This is because the final chapter screen waits for the music (CDDA/mp3) to finish, which never happens due to a bug in the backend.

Nope, Monkey Island 3 will not run for many reasons - it uses too much RAM, would probably be too slow on the 67Mhz CPU, and runs at 640x480, which would look awful scaled down to 256x192, no matter how good the scaling was.
<br/>
<br/>
Although, Sam &amp; Max talkie version does work, and is ~150Mb.  It's quite easy to guess why it can work with only 4Mb of RAM - only the current location's data and the current sentance of speech are ever in RAM at once.  This is easy to do for ScummVM because it's already written to do that.  Heretic would probably need most or all of the data for a level loaded, which could end up being quite a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I remember Doom engine games having some sort of caching that allowed data to be loaded as the player ran around the level.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Don't know if this is useful in any way but I'm using Sam &amp; Max a 190 megabyte talkie version on the GBAMP with Mighty Max's multiboot and it runs really swell, with some slowdowns, but nothing much. But (hoping you know the game:|) when I go to talk to the fishing oldman it goes wild, everything freezes and the upper screen is looping some error message of something not present:\ Can't really read.
<br/>
<br/>
But if I talk to him with another "sentence" it will not crash. 
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing funny is the Menu on that part. If I try to go to the menu and save or load it will freeze.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps:\
<br/>
<br/>
Oh. I'm guessing the targeting of the pen is calculated for the non-resized matrix of the game, because it works fine, with accuracy, when the screen is not resized, and kind of misses when it is resized. I notice this especially on the ScummVM menus. Or maybe its the possibility of moving the screen up and down that is offcentering the pen target.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps in anyway:|
<br/>
<br/>
It created a "samnmax.c26" file. Is it a debug file? If so I'll send it to you. If not, what is it? :)

I know exactly the part you mean.  That bit is the heaviest part of the game I've seen, memory wise, because of the helicopter animation when it swoops down to get the fish. To get past that bit, go to the map screen, save your game, then turn off your DS and load your game.  Now go to the World of Fish and talk to the fishing man and you should be able to get past that section.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to squeeze the code a bit more for the next release but I have a feeling that bit may still be a problem!

This was mostly meant as a joke.  Obviously I'm aware of ScummVM on the DS and I don't intend to PSP-troll a GBA/DS board.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the major difference between the PSP and DS version (that you forgot to mention) is that the former is full-featured, while the latter never will be due to hardware restrictions.
<br/>
Although ofcourse the DS has the stylus/touch-screen advantage.
<br/>
<br/>
agentq is doing amazing work on the DS port, but it's highly unlikely to ever run games like Full Throttle, The Dig, Curse of Monkey Island, Broken Sword 1 &amp; 2, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
And even though games like Simon the Sorcerer, Gobliiins and Beneath a Steel Sky should run on the DS, you'd need a seperate build for that.
<br/>
<br/>
So indeed, if you don't care about the above-mentioned shortcomings and/or prefer stylus/touch-screen, then a DS will do perfectly fine.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

BTW, how does ScummVM on the PSP cope with running 640x480 games on a 480x272 screen?  Does it still look ok?

I would love to run Full Throttle and The Dig, as I loved those games.  Sadly I don't think it will happen though.

<br/>
On the other hand using a multiloader, it shouldn't matter that much that there will need to be separate builds for the other engines.

Personally, I think the touch screen input is vastly preferable to a d-pad and makes up for most of the other issues with the port.   But then I would say that. ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It's using the PSP graphics hardware to downscale+stretch the image to fit the screen (it doesn't look as bad as it sounds :P), although the font (especially in the MI3 demo) becomes a bit harder to read.

Would a vorbis decoder run in real time on the 33 MHz ARM7 CPU used for sound?

if they're packaged together, the menu doesn't even come up to add a game, the top bios screen just flips back and forth from the top to the bottom screen about six times before stopping and freezing (they're packaged in their own dirs with no compression)

if they're by themselves, the menu comes up (and the status messages tell me the zip archive is compress, when it's not), but hitting add game.. switches the top and the bottom screens, and it freezes up.

i've tried packaging them with 0.3, then reverted back to 0.2, and it does the same thing.

Using my NDS + GBAMP with Compact Flash + PassMe, I have the following running (enjoyably if not 100% smoothly):
<br/>
<br/>
Sam &amp; Max (Talkie)
<br/>
Day of the Tentacle (Talkie)
<br/>
Indiana Jones &amp; the Fate of Atlantis (Talkie)
<br/>
Indiana Jones &amp; the Last Crusade (FM-Towns, no music support :( )
<br/>
Maniac Mansion (16-bit (?) version off of DOTT)
<br/>
<br/>
I have the Loom Talkie CD, but audio is not supported. If Loom used monster.sou like the other Talkies then there would be no problem, however the audio is encoded as a digital audio track on the CD. I tried converting it to PCM WAV .wav, PCM WAV .raw, IMA ADPCM WAV .wav,  and MP3 .mp3, but nothing works.
<br/>
<br/>
What is interesting is that when running Loom using SCUMMVM for DOS in Windows on my PC, it automatically recognizes the filename "track1.mp3" for audio and it will only play it properly if it is encoded as a real MP3 file. Renaming track1.mp3 to track1.wav makes screeching sound instead when played (since it does not recognize "track1.wav" etc.).
<br/>
<br/>
So since Loom wants to recognize "track1.mp3" for some odd reason, as a last attempt I converted the audio to IMA ADPCM (replies in this thread suggest NDS should be able to recognize this somehow, later if not now?) and renamed it to track1.mp3, but it's still a no go.
<br/>
<br/>
So... does anyone have any ideas on how I could make the audio work? So close yet so far.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">First of all, thanks for making it possible for me to play scumm games on my DS. I bought a DS hoping I could play scummvm on it one day, I never thought it would be this soon :)
<br/>
<br/>
I do have one suggestion though. In lucasarts games you could always pause the game with the spacebar, even during conversations and cutscenes. It would be nice if this was possible in Scummvm DS too, if you use the start menu to pause the game you can't see what was going on before you unpause. And maybe closing the lid could also use the same pause?
<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea, I'm off to play Monkey Island 2 now :)
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: 
<br/>
And another suggestion: If you scroll  down (L/R + dpad) during a conversation you skip a sentence, is it possible to disable the dpad functions while scrolling?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Lamsh on Mon Sep 12, 2005 6:55 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Great job so far. Features/changes I'd love to see introduced:
<br/>
<br/>
- left handed support: the ability to switch the mousebutton controls to the right side, since us lefties hold the stylus with their left hand. Right now it's pretty hard to control
<br/>
- replace the left-mouseclick with a stylus doubletap (controls like in "another code"). This makes it easier to explore the scenery :)
<br/>
- switch to a more scale-friendly font (don't know if this is possible). Scaling looks pretty nice right now, but in MI2 the dialog choices are very hard to read with scaling enabled.
<br/>
- better sound support :) (even though I'm not worrying about that until the makers of the supercard release their promised &gt;256 mbit support firmware)
<br/>
- pause/sleep mode when you close the lid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Boeboe: 
<br/>
Left handed support is on it's way.  As for the double-tap, it has been suggested to me that dragging on the screen should do a mouse hover, touching once should be a single click, and double tapping should do a right click.  I will be trying this method out to see how it plays.  Sleep mode is also being written as we speak.
<br/>
<br/>
As for the supercard, no firmware patch will let it play more than 256mbit of game.  This is a limitation on the GBA cartridge port.
<br/>
<br/>
Lamsh:
<br/>
At the moment, the menus don't display the game behind them because the DS uses a different video mode for the menus.  I'm not sure whether it can be made to work unfortunately.  This would happen if I used the space bar to pause as well.  I'll fix the bug with d-pad down that you reported!
<br/>
<br/>
XciteMatz:
<br/>
There is no CD audio support, and no way to get it working with the current release.  I may well do some ADPCM decoding for this in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Duodreamer:
<br/>
Yep, those warnings come up in the PC version as well.  I can only assume they're harmless!
<br/>
<br/>
Troublemaker:
<br/>
I haven't tried it with a multiloader, perhaps you could try it and let everyone know whether it works?
<br/>
<br/>
DiscoBoy:
<br/>
I know you've been waiting for this... now you can enjoy it!
<br/>
<br/>
draconic:
<br/>
You probably have been deleting files from your zip.  If you do this, sometimes the ZIP isn't read properly by ScummVM DS.  Delete your ZIP and create a new one with the games you want and it will work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One more thing - I'm going on holiday tomorrow so there won't be any new releases for a week or two.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have an idea for the controls (seems like everyone does).  It's similar to <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?p=50893#50893" target="_blank">Mark_RC's idea</a>.  When in hover mode and if the stylus is on the touch screen, use left and right on the D-Pad as left and right mouse clicks, respectively.  If the stylus is not on the screen, hitting those buttons would work as they do now.
<br/>
<br/>
I was playing through Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (FoA) and there were times when I was in the dark.  I would use hover mode, find some thing to interact with, choose the appropriate action (push, pull, etc.), and then lose the object on the screen or just miss the exact spot to click.  It was still totally playable, just kind of annoying.  Having my suggested controls could have eliminated some of the headache.
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I had an idea that probably occurred to you or others already, but would most likely take some heavy modifications.  You could switch the displays on the two screens and use the touch screen as a touch pad, like a laptop.  This would allow you to use the in-game mouse cursor on the top screen.  From there, you could just use the left/right-D-Pad idea or the single/double-tap idea for mouse clicks.  Plus, I think the top screen just looks better for display in general.
<br/>
<br/>
Just a bug report and I'll stop pestering you.  I completed FoA on the GBAMP and the game attempted to write a lot of "iq-points" files to my card.  They were 0 bytes in size, and when I deleted them, another one popped up.  As a result, my root directory became corrupt.  I'm guessing it may be because the file name has no extension.  If that's so, it could be a problem with Chishm's FAT drivers.  I don't have the technical knowledge to know for sure.  Who knows, it might just be my CF card.  Anyone else have this problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enjoy your vacation and thanks again for all your hard work on this project.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">agentq, I never got around to thanking you for incorporating the down press on the keypad for the '.' (skip text) function that I suggested after the first release.

With the help of that (and ver 0.3) I've just managed to play and complete DOTT, and what an amazing experience it was. Not one crash throughout.
<br/>
<br/>
I gave up playing Monkey Island 2 in verison 0.2 as it crashed all the time. I'll now go back and give it another go with ver 0.3.

Keep up the AWESOME work. You don't know (or maybe you do) just how many ppl have done a complete double-take seeing scumm games playing on a DS and responding with, "I only thought the PSP could run homebrew".

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is no direct support for M3 or Supercard at the moment - I don't think anyone knows how either of them works.  It seems likely that the M3 should only require minimal modifications to the FAT driver to work.

<br/>
Until then, both carts pretend to be a flash cart in order to run the games.  Supercard needs special code to be able to write saves back to the CF, and as far as I know, nobody has reverse engineered that yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I will write to the makers of supercard to see if they will tell me what's involved.

The emulator is a handy tool for testing stuff without having to copy the code onto a flash card.  I don't think anyone would actually use it to play ScummVM!

Although I don't know of an emulator which runns ScummVM properly, so I've been using my GBAMP for development.  It's really a quick turnaround, as I've got quite fast at pulling the card out of my reader, sticking it into the GBAMP and the GBAMP into my DS!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
As agentq pointed out, an emulator would let a developer or a reviewer test compatibility between ScummVM and a particular game without having to round-trip the CF card every time. Mounting and unmounting removable flash media on Windows can be slow, especially with the fact that Windows wants you to notify it before you remove a CF card, and connectors do wear out.
<br/>
<br/>
Another possible reason is emulator features. For example, the NES emulator called Nintendulator can't use the Huffyuv AVI codec for some reason, but VisualBoyAdvance can, so I have used VBA+PocketNES to record NES play.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
