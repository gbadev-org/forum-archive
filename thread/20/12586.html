    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Yes i know, im totally n00b at coding, 
<br/>
I did some visual basic when i was 11, but this is totally different, also i did some Ruby scripts modifying in my RPG Maker XP period, s? i understand code quite well, but i know almost nothing of the "programming logic", like how to make a menu, 
<br/>
<br/>
So to fix this, im taking Programming A as an axtra subject nes semester, which will be first semester of my second year in "gymnasiet" ^^
<br/>
<br/>
Programming B is mostly Perl, you think i should take it?
<br/>
<br/>
Edit: not perl, i menat Delphi, and you can choose advanced c++ also, so ill go with both ^^
<br/>
<br/>
and did i say port? more like a rewrite ^^<br/>_________________<br/>Starter of the project TrueLoveDS :D
