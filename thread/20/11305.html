<div id="posts">
<div class="post">
    <h4>#104443 - onigiri - Fri Sep 29, 2006 6:07 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the process of porting Angband 2.8.3 to the DS. I picked 2.8.3 because it was the version I played the most when I was in school! The port is in a state where I think the game is playable (I've played a few hours and died plenty of times). 
<br/>
<br/>
As such, I'm looking for some play testers before I release it. It is pretty much a straight port and only uses the top screen. I wanted to retain the same tactile feel as the original, so touch screen entry, virtual keyboard on the touch screen are all out. All the commands have been remapped to button presses. Some commands have become multipurpose to accomodate the lower number of buttons. For example the inventory command is used to eat, use an oil flash, wear equipment etc.
<br/>
<br/>
I mostly made this port so that I can play Angband on my DS lite. I have a G6 lite, so Angband plays entirely out of GBFS and SRAM. I didn't want to play angband with something sticking out of the slot. It shouldn't be difficult to add fatlib so that the port supports carts without SRAM (if there is demand). The other good reason I went this direction is that the port generally works in an emulator, which is much easier for me. The port seems to work well in no$gba and dualis. The sram support doesn't work in these emulators, but it's possible to use the snapshot features.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Requirements
<br/>
o A DS capable of playing homebrew.
<br/>
o A flash cart with 64KBs of SRAM. I'm not sure how large the save files get. If they start getting too large, I should be able to zlib compress them to fit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Features
<br/>
o High score list saves to SRAM
<br/>
o Save file saves to SRAM
<br/>
o subpixel rendering font by Sylfurd
<br/>
o All commands remapped to DS button combinations. Buttons generally have similar functions. ie x button for inventory, x+RSH for drop item, x+LSH for take off item, LSH+RSH+x for destroy item.
<br/>
o Implemented console style text and numeric entry.
<br/>
o Implemented console style selection for menus.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Possible Enhancements
<br/>
If I have time, I might add some additional features to the port.
<br/>
<br/>
o I was thinking about using the bottom screen as an informational screen. It can be toggled to show a zoomed map around the player (normal large sized font with colour) and a screen that describes the available key combinations.
<br/>
o Remappable buttons in game.
<br/>
o Port the newest version of Angband.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in play testing, send me a message. Only prior players for now please. I basically need people who have different types of cartridges and who will play different types of characters to test their playstyles. I'll have a build ready in a few days for those interested.

I haven't seen the isometric graphical view before. It does look quite nice. For me though, I'm most comfortable with using text characters. However, since all of the characters are tiles, it is possible to put a graphical tileset together.
<br/>

Perhaps if there is some enthusiastic person out there willing to put together a 3x8 tileset...? ;-)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For those who are wondering what the status is of the port, I'll quickly explain. Angband NDS is currently in the third round of closed play testing. I had intended to have a 4th round of closed testing before a public release.
<br/>
However, I've been increasingly busy so I might do a public release within the next week or two.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the port seems to be very playable with no major gameplay issues (my highest level character was a level 19 human paladin). On a cart with SRAM, saving, loading, high scores all seem to work. The bottom screen will remain unused for the initial public release. I am working on ideas  for uses of the bottom screen for later releases. For now, I am concentrating on completing GBA MP support (only saving and loading currently works) and removing the final few gameplay glitches.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the lack of updates. Unfortunately, the project is on hold a little bit. I'm moving countries and still in the middle of the move. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was going to release a public beta just before Christmas but found some compatibility problems with the Supercard. 
<br/>
<br/>
When I get settled, the first thing I'll work on is getting DLDI support. At the moment, the G6 Lite and GBA MP are supported and working well (Supercard with firmware &lt; 1.70 and QPC is ok too). 
<br/>
<br/>
If you have one of these cards, I'd be happy to send you a test copy.

I guess what I'm trying to say is if there is any chance that someone here could break protocol and release the latest version that they received as beta testers.
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there would be any dishonor in doing so, but I've never been a tester before so I'm not quite sure what the implied rules are about releasing something without permission.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, sorry to bump this topic, but I have not had contact with the original author for over a year (and his website isn't operational anymore either, just a directory view)
<br/>
<br/>
When I started beta testing, I received Pre-Release Version 2.  A Version 3 was released, but it is no longer stored on the server it was located on (tried archive.org, didnt have it, and I had it saved on my currently "dead" computer).  So I only have PR Version 2.
<br/>
<br/>
Onigiri, if you are reading this, I am sorry, but it has been over a year since you have contacted anyone, so I am jut releasing what you gave me.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy (Do not credit me, all I did was test it, credit Onigiri, wherever he/she might be right now)

Thanks for sharing this with others like myself and doing so with honor and respect to the original author, whomever he/she/it may be.  
<br/>
<br/>
But if I were you though, I would personally roll up my sleeves and fix that dead computer and try to revive that third version test release.  :o)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm very grateful to you since nobody else was willing to stick themselves out there like you're doing now.

If you're ever in East Lansing Michigan, stop by and I'll get you drunk.  :o)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi All,
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I'd like to say I'm terribly sorry for those who had been following this port. As you might have realised, I have been in a position where I couldn't continue development of the port.
<br/>
<br/>
As means of consolation and a way of saying sorry, please find a <a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.com/files/104554338/angband-nds-pr4.zip.html" target="_blank">link </a>to the last build of the NS port of Angband (preview release 4). All of the requirements as per the original post are still applicable (old Slot 2 cart with SRAM). Please read the readme on how the keys are assigned. It does play and I was able to get reasonably far with a human paladin.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, here is a <a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.com/files/104553785/angband_workspace.zip.html" target="_blank">link </a>to the Eclipse workspace with all of the code for the DS port of Angband. Must has changed in the landscape of DS development and the code will not compile with the current version of the dev kit. Unfortunately, I do not even remember the version of dev kit pro it compiles against. Perhaps, devkitARM release 19a might be a good start since the newest version available at the time.
<br/>
<br/>
The DS port started life as a hacked together version of the code and it shows. It's likely much of the code may be un-usable for someone intending to make a more 'generic' port. Perhaps the port would need to be re-written from scratch but I hope the code at least serves as some assistance to which direction to go.
<br/>
<br/>
If someone would like to start up the project again, I'd be happy to try and help the person to get up to speed as much as I can.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
