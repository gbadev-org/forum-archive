    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Maybe the problem with DSOrganize is that you're using version 3.2? If that's the case, you should downgrade to 3.1129.  It's much more stable.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You could set non-graphical Links to show [ IMG ] where the image would go on the page, then click on that to download it to your card, then use graphical Links to view it.  At least that's what I do, which is helped immensely by tab-completion.

Without slot-2 RAM, look into Bunjalloo and possibly DSHobro if you're fine with leaving a server running on your computer all the time.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Sometimes when it freezes it does something odd to the wifi hardware that leaves it unable to reconnect for a while.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I like that browser. I had a couple of crashes, but nothing that made it so it wouldn't connect :p Would getting an expansion pak help it with the crashing? But, its pretty good, even when you onlyhave 3 bars (so saysDS organize) of connection. :p<br/>_________________<br/>IRC (please join :D):
