I suppose the average DS gamer can just download a copy of a (high-quality commerical) game for free or they can download a homebrew game for free. As homebrew normally has zero budget it often shows and I suppose people pick up on that...
<br/>
<br/>
Either way it's a free game to them, but often commerical &gt; homebrew and that's why people complain.

I see people in my IRC room daily that pop in through DSO IRC and say things like "this is an awesome app, thanks for making it DM!"  On the other hand, though, I get a TON of angry emails because I changed or haven't put in a feature, or won't take a suggestion.  See a recent locked post on scdev for a classic example of what happens when you don't want to change something.  I also get a lot of anger when I don't "fix" boot issues on cards such as MMD, but have yet to recieve a donated card to work on.

Then again, in another post, upon learning that Chishm was not going to release the rom dumper he created for use in developing Nitro Hax, another user stated "I was about to ask whether it was even possible but I guess it is and some people just prefer keeping secrets to helping others."
<br/>

Granted, that post was quickly shot down by a few other members, but it was still an eye-opener.  I fully support Chishm's decision, but it's a shame others apparently can't.

Like simon said, it's most likely a matter of people comparing commercial to homebrew without appreciating the difficulty in getting foreign code to function at all on the device.  For instance, I played that "futuristic racer" demo that was recently posted here quite extensively.  Was it Mario Kart DS?  Of course not.  But for a homebrew project, a user's first programming experience to boot, it's pretty darn good.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

However when you do get a nice mail (or donation!) it just makes it all the more worthwhile, don't you think? Plus when you factor in the amount of downloads versus the amount of complaints it looks pretty damn cool :-D

<br/>
I guess you've also gotta consider that it's exactly the same for commerical games too - we've all bought a game (or watched a film) and quickly branded it as crap without considering the many people who put all their time into it for months and stayed late to do "just one more thing".

Again, when you do get a thanks it just reminds you that not everyone is an asshole. :-)

Also, when I played it on my friends DS, it worked fine with his R4DS, but I didn't like the buttons.  You should switch them around so they are more like other commercial games that are simular so that we are already used to the button layout.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">If you're not developing for your own enjoyment, homebrewing will definitely never be worth it.
<br/>
<br/>
The viciously negative feedback isn't even all that bad, in my opinion.  You have to able to roll with that stuff.  Usually that sort of stuff is so extreme that I can't even see how anyone could take it seriously.
<br/>
<br/>
A bigger problem, I think, is the total lack of feedback of any kind that most games get.  I say games because this is definitely more common with games than emulators or most apps, which do seem to get a good amount of attention by comparison.  Most homebrew games that are released get virtually no attention of feedback at all.  Almost no way for the developer to even know anyone's playing it.  And that's not only for small one-off type games, but even for most of the larger more in depth projects.
<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, unless you're doing it for your own enjoyment, it's not worth it.  And that's got nothing to do with the DS, specifically, every homebrew scene I've ever followed has been the same in that respect.

I have such a high respect for developers.....I look up to them. I can't code and am amazed at there productions. I do not expect commercial games/apps from homebrew... yes often I have been pleasantly surprised with the games/apps. There are so many good games and app homebrew that I wouldn't even mention them all it would take too long.

There are alot of people who stand in awe at the developers but don't say anything. I am also very impressed at how young some of the developers are, it amazes me.

Without you, a lot of this stuff about the DS wouldn't have been figured out yet, and a lot of the awesome apps and games I play with every day wouldn't have come into being.
<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is that some people refuse to understand the amount of work that goes in to making things like this, as well as the fact that you folks are hobbyists.  You do this for free, you shouldn't be expected to ask 'How High?' when some some random person on some random forum doesn't like some little aspect of your game or app.  It's not like they paid $40 for your creation and should expect 24/7 phone technical support either.  :P

I hope that more people like me who appreciate the homebrew scene speak up and give you guys the credit you deserve, maybe we can turn back the tide of lame angry people.<br/>_________________<br/>----

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here is my 2 cents:
<br/>
<br/>
About a year and a half ago I moved from gba development to painting.
<br/>
<br/>
There were many reasons, some of which were:
<br/>
<br/>
* Lack of feedback about games I released
<br/>
* Difficulty in sharing my work with family and friends
<br/>
* Rude behaviour in forums and irc channels
<br/>
* What I perceived as an imbalance in contests towards emulators and ports vs original games
<br/>
* Turnaround time for paintings is much faster than games
<br/>
* I wanted to do something that didn't involve a computer
<br/>
<br/>
I think Dragonminded is lucky, it seems that his works are things that fill a place in the DS software world that isn't served by commerical software. 
<br/>
<br/>
Going up against commercial DS games, and ports of commercial PC games, or emulators running commercial games from old systems is hard work.
<br/>
<br/>
That said GBA and DS development can still be a challenging and rewarding hobby. You just need to make sure that what you want to get out of it is realistic.

It goes both ways (again).  In one sense, having no official competition is nice because I am the benchmark for a lot of what my program offers.  The other hand is, many people bought a DS with the idea that much of my program should have come standard with a DS.  So what ends up happening is they take what I do for granted.<br/>_________________<br/>Enter the mind of the dragon.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There seem to be a good amount of posts by coders stating that they don't get feedback or that there's a lack of appreciation for the difficulty.  
<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, don't always take the time to thank a developer (but have donated a bit here and there), but I also have assumed that they're all getting flooded with Thank you! and/or Screw you! e-mails.  
<br/>
<br/>
As for appreciation of the difficulty, I think there's little you can do about that.  The majority of people into the homebrew scene want quick &amp; easy solutions, and don't even understand things like hardware limitations (just search for questions related to PSX, DC, and N64 emulation on DS).  I download anything and everything homebrew (including tech demos and alphas) regardless of my initial interest because more often than not, even if I don't like a game or app, it's at least impressive that someone put in the time to code something for a very specific and limited bit of hardware and shared it with the world.  
<br/>
<br/>
So, despite it being meager by comparison, I offer my thanks to all Devs, coders, 1337 DS Haxors or whatever you prefer to go by.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
