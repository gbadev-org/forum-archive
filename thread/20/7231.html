<br/>
<br/>
So, I've put together a preview just for you lot.  The Amiga version of the demo of Monkey Island, fully working.

Please go easy on my web server though, I have very limited bandwidth.  So please, only download the version you need.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone would put the file on a server and post the link here, I'd be very grateful.
<br/>
<br/>
To use:
<br/>
Click 'add game'.
<br/>
Click 'Choose'.
<br/>
Click 'OK'.
<br/>
Click 'Start'.
<br/>
<br/>
'Select' switches between scaled and unscaled.  D-pad to scroll around.  Play the game using the pen.
<br/>
<br/>
I should have a version that can play any game you have the data files for by next week or so.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Blimey - I didn't expect to see a playable version so soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Worked very well - but here are a few things I noticed:
<br/>
<br/>
A button (one of the shoulders, perhaps) that you could hold down so that touching the screen didn't result in a 'click' would be useful.
<br/>
Likewise, it'd be good to have one that you could 'right click' with.
<br/>
<br/>
The 'stealing herring from bird' puzzle seems to be a bit faulty - instead of Guybrush stamping on the loose board once, he does it continuously, until you move him away.
<br/>
<br/>
If you press the 'About' button on the main menu and let the text start to scroll, it goes a bit odd.
<br/>
<br/>
I also (I don't know how - I think I was holding down left shoulder button) managed to swap screens - so the debug text was on the touchscreen, and the main menu was on the top. Had to restart, as I couldn't touch any of the options.
<br/>
<br/>
But it's great to see a version so soon. What are the chances of sound, do you think?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">1.3. Is ScummVM free?</span>
<br/>
<br/>
ScummVM is released under the GPL (General Public License), so it's more than free. ScummVM source code is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it. If you make modifications to it and redistribute your work you MUST make the source available. However, the ScummVM team would be pleased if you choose to send them your modifications, so they can be merged into the main tree.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
As far as the GPL goes, to obide by it, if someone asked agent for his code right now he'd be liable to give it to them or he'd be infringing on the license and be open to a lawsuit. I'm just assuming he wants to give it a little polish before putting it out in the open but I'll probably check it out to see if I can improve it any if it gets integrated into the main ScummVM CVS.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to try and answer all the questions that people have asked about ScummVM DS.  I'll be putting together a website when it's done which will have everything on.
<br/>
<br/>
Veg: Thanks a lot for testing this, I played though the demo a couple of times, and it seems to be completely stable now, which is a relief to me!
<br/>
<br/>
The stealing from the bird thing does seem wrong, but I can't see that I've caused it.  Thankfully it doesn't prevent you from completing the demo.
<br/>
<br/>
Dirge: I'd be glad to join forces when I've got things in a better shape for any improvements you want to make.  There's a ton of stuff still yet to implement.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who has posted compliments - it makes all the time I spent on it seem worth it!
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Extreme Coder, Mithos, and emumaniac for posting copies of the file.
<br/>
<br/>
The next thing I'll be doing is playing with a jitter effect like the one that PocketNES uses that should make the scaling clearer.  Currently I'm just using the hardware extended rotation background.  Then I'll be sorting out saving of settings and savegames.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to have to write a replacement for GBFS too, because it seems that it doesn't support directories.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Will the Gobliiins games work?</span>
<br/>
At the moment, no.  I have only ported the SCUMM portion of ScummVM.  The binary is already 2Mb which is about as large as I'd want it.  Perhaps I will build a different binary version for each of the engines that ScummVM supports, but this isn't really a priority for me, as it's the Lucasarts games that are my favourites.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">How about releasing the source code</span>
<br/>
I love open source projects, and I will of course release the source code.  At the moment it's full of dirty hacks, so I will be tidying it up and commenting it.  I would be embarressed to show anyone at the moment.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What versions of games will work?</span>
<br/>
I've only tried a few so far, but all versions all games which are supported by other builds of ScummVM should work, as long as they use the SCUMM engine.  So the 256 colour VGA ones will be fine.  Just be sure they fit on your flash cart with the 2Mb binary added on.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">What about sound?</span>
<br/>
I'll be looking at that.  There's plenty of CPU time left, so it should be feasable.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps even the talkie versions could be made to work for people with huge flash carts.  Ideally, the speech would be reencoded in ADPCM format which can be decompressed in hardware on the DS (I think).  That's way off though.
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Will Wireless Multiboot work in the full release?</span>
<br/>
Yes, but the amount of RAM on the DS severely limits the games you can play to just a few demos, and maybe Manic Mansion.  The game will have to be less than 800Kb or so.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The Monkey Island 1 demo uses a tiny fraction of the DS' CPU power, so much more should be possible.  I have done no optimisation at all so far.  I can't tell you exactly what will run though.  Also, if they require much more RAM I could be in trouble, although the demo runs with 500Kb free all the time, and that's including storing all the game assets in memory.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
As ScummVM is GPL, *YOU LEGALLY HAVE TO* release the source code. Not releasing it is a violation of GPL. Everybody does dirty hacks, don't be embarassed.
<br/>
<br/>
I had an idea about proper scaling and wanted to expose it here, if someone wish to implement it.
<br/>
<br/>
Using an off-line (PC) tool, you could precompute unrolled ARM9 code to scale from fixed resolution (say 320x200) to DS resolution (256x192) to a 15-bits, linearly interpolated buffer. All factors precomputed in ARM9 opcodes.
<br/>
<br/>
eg:
<br/>
 load src pixel 0
<br/>
 multiply components by 0.8
<br/>
 load src pixel 1
<br/>
 multiply components by 0.2
<br/>
 write dst pixel 0
<br/>
 get back src pixel  1
<br/>
 multiply components by 0.8
<br/>
 etc. (unrolled)
<br/>
<br/>
This kind of stuff in proper unrolled ARM9, as generated by the tool.
<br/>
I'm sure it's possible to trick and do this withing a few hundred kilobytes of code. Trying to do it horizontally first (320-&gt;256), since horizontal resolution is more critical than vertical one for a 320x200 screen.
<br/>
<br/>
In theory (if fast enough) this would gets you a linearly interpoleted scaled buffer looking way better than actual hardware scale.
<br/>
<br/>
A table could be precomputed and stored in internal CPU RAM for multiplying a 5-bits color components by a given factor sampled at some resolution (eg: divide the 0.0-1.0 range into 128 steps, total table would be 128*32=4096 entries of 5-bits). Perhaps the overhead of accessing memory per-byte is not worth doing it directly by the CPU. One must try different things.
<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ask if you have any question. (I'd do this if I could but I'd rather avoid homebrew DS development for legal reasons.)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The point would be respecting GPL and not breaking law. You legally HAVE to. Release the "complete bodge" first - People don't expect to be perfect at first, then improve later. Just don't unnecessary break the law because that puts you in the same basket as pirates, somehow.

The code for a single scanline could be reused for all of them vertically, given blending factors and input lines pointers are provided in CPU registers (with ~13 usage registers you have enough for those stuff). It's better in registers anyway since the Y factors are unchanging and you get away with smaller ARM opcodes.
<br/>
<br/>
So you have two unroll:
<br/>
- One "inside" function performing the horizontal write based on two sources scanlines and Y blending factors (256*2 pixel to read and process, could fit in less than 16 kb).
<br/>
- One "outside" function calling the first one with proper parameters (could fit in less than 8kb, less critical anyway so it's ok in RAM).

I'm quite impressed that you'd consider it worth all the time money and effort to get from me what is only about 5 working days' worth of work.  You could do another port yourself and save yourself the time and effort.  Besides, by the time you'd organised it, I would have released the finished version anyway, and it would be a bit pointless.  
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don't want to argue about this, the code points you make are a much more interesting argument.
<br/>
<br/>
The way I solved my scaling problem is by using an inter-frame jitter like PocketNES.  If you stare at it right, you can see it flicker slightly.  What it does is change the scroll offsets half a pixel back and forth each frame.  The lcd's persistance averages this out and gives what looks like a bilenear scaled image.  It's about 80% as good looking, but it costs nothing in CPU time.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a quick mock up of what you suggest.  I did this in 15 minutes when I'm tired after work, and my ARM is rusty so this code is probably rubbish, but you get the idea.
<br/>
<br/>
This is the code you'd need to do one pixel.

There's stuff missing from this, but I make that 52 operations per pixel, not counting memory accesses and cache misses.  Unrolled 256 times that's 53Kb of code, far bigger than the cache.
<br/>
<br/>
For the whole screen that's 2.5 million operations.  Add 20% for memory accesses and waits, and cache misses on the code (it's probably more than that) makes 3 Million.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's say we're running at 20fps.  At the ARM9 clock speed of 66Mhz that gives us 3.3 Million cycles per frame.
<br/>
<br/>
So this scaler would take roughly 90% of the frame to complete.  Far, far too much.

Alpha lerp itself requires you to use a tiled mode, and have two identical layers.  One layer is 50% transparent on top of the other.  It scrolls each layer up and down per scanline independently.  It needs a reletively large hblank DMA buffer, with lots of dummy data inside.  It does vertical scaling only.

Snesds/snesadvance can't use it, since it needs multiple layers.  So it's limited to scaling up to 2 layers.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

First of all, the 8ad code can be set at compile time to use the IMA table index deltas and correction step sizes or my tweaked versions.

Why is it a long way off?  
<br/>
Unless there are a ton of hacks in the SCUMM engine itself (looking at the features of the port it doesn't look like there are), it should just be a case of re-building with the BASS engine enabled instead of SCUMM and adding/changing the relevant datafiles.
<br/>
<br/>
The BASS engine has about the same memory footprint and backend dependence as MI1 does, so if MI1 runs, so should BASS.
<br/>
As long as the data can be read from ROM, instead of RAM (which is the only issue I can think of with the current port) it shouldn't be a problem at all.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I recomend mode 5.  I use this in my yeti port to double buffer the sprite overlay.  It has two extended rotation backgrounds plus a normal 2D tiled layer and  a 3D layer (on main screen only) which (with some slight effort with textures) magicaly becomes another 2D bitmap layer.

And on a side note, GPL has never been tested in court so I do believe if you want to delay your source release until it is a bit less embarising,  and marginaly usefull, you will not have any police knocking at your door. :) (not that i imply delay should be indefinate or even lengthy)<br/>_________________<br/><a href="http://www.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">www.drunkencoders.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
That phrase is very misleading. The GPL doesn't have to be tested in court because it's a very simple copyright license. Some of the particular details (the meaning of 'linking' for instance) will perhaps have to be pinned down by a judge at some point, but it's quite clear that you have /no/ right to redistribute any GPL'd code without providing the source to that same code on request.
<br/>
<br/>
It is in fact noteworthy that the GPL has continually /not/ been tested in court.. The FSF has repeatedly gone to folks violating the GPL, laid out the facts, and invariably they've decided to comply. That is far more telling, in my eyes.
<br/>
<br/>
While I similarly doubt that there will be 'police knocking at your door', the basic fact is that if you choose not to obey this constraint of the GPL, you are in copyright violation, as the GPL is the only thing that allows you to distribute a derivative work. Perhaps the copyright holders will choose not to come after you, but that is their choice. The violation is still there.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I haven't seen anyone acting in an unjustified manner in regard to this. When you're working with GPL'd code, the right thing to do is simply not release binaries unless you're willing to release code along with them. People are right to point this out.

It's a little glitchy though, as it's not easy to get a looping buffer working well on the DS, as there seems to be no way of telling how far through a sample is.
<br/>
<br/>
It's also a bit slow, as the FM synth seems to use doubles(!) which are a killer on a machine without hardware floating point.  That would be a good focus of optimisation to begin with.

Thanks for that, I should probably reimplement my looping buffer to match yours, as mine is far more horrible.

I noticed that you must have changed ipc.h though, and I was trying not to make any changes to NDSlib.
<br/>

Did you just ignore the ipc.h in the ndslib folder and use your own instead?

Still, I think mine sounds good enough for a first release.  It doesn't click all that much.  Besides, I think the looping buffer is only one part of the problem with it.

As to the sound volume, I think it's an issue with FM synthesis in general.  There has to be enough 'spare' amplitude for the loudest sound it can make, so generally the emulation is a bit quiet.
<br/>
<br/>
ScummVM on the PC has the same problem.  At the default settings, the soud effects are much lounder then the music.
<br/>
<br/>
As to the crackliness, I know it's a problem.  It's not so bad in older games that don't tax the CPU much.  I have a few ideas what could be causing it.
<br/>
<br/>
The quit option is also something I know about.  I think I kow why that crashes, but haven't got to it yet.

Unless you run the whole signal, including all FM channels through a lookup table that implements amplification with soft clipping. I've done this in one version of GSM Player.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I have a suggestion for the controls. Anyone played ScummVM on a GP32? It has better controls (except the touch screen, of course ;)). It has to be always in hover mode. Then, use the shoulders, the buttons or the D-PAD as the mouse buttons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

See tepples' reply for the reason behind the 30mb barrier. Looks like it won't be broken on flashcarts, but will be on one of the card adaptors.
<br/>
<br/>
The controls seem fine to me, Mark - I think you want to confine as many of the 'control' buttons to one side of the DS, as you hold the stylus with the other hand.
<br/>
<br/>
One improvement might be to automatically switch back to left click mode after a right click operation has been performed - it's not often that you need to perform a lot of right clicks.
<br/>
Also, unless D-Down currently does anything (or if you have future plans for it), making it also activate hover mode might be an idea.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

For monkey 1&amp;2 I get a message on the top screen saying that the save file is too big for ram, and of course, it isn't present upon reboot. For maniac mansion saving crashes the game, and with Sam and Max the file saves, but will not restore (no error message given here).

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Saving update:
<br/>
<br/>
I have solved some of the save problems with my xgflash 2005 256m card. Turns out that if there is a save game from a different game being played by scummvm in the SRAM of this brand of cart you can't save again until you clear the SRAM. By cart has battery backup, so when I pull the battery out to wipe the saves, the SRAM is cleared (I assume) and I can then save in the new game. It seems that I can keep saving over the same save as long as I don't change to a new scumm game.
<br/>
<br/>
I have so far tested this with maniac mansion and monkey 1. 
<br/>
<br/>
Feature Requests:
<br/>
<br/>
-Left/Right hand control swap: The ability to map the d-pad to x/y/a/b and vice-versa.
<br/>
<br/>
-The command I have always used most when playing any scumm game is the "." (full stop) on the keyboard in order to skip the current line of text on the screen. I read much more quickly than the text is displayed, and I like to skip as soon as I've read the line of text (particularly when replaying the games, or skipping through long conversations). I'm more interested in this being implemented, rather than the text display speed option, as it means I can take my time to read when I wish (and not have text disappear too quickly).  A good use for d-pad down maybe?

All I have to do is walk forward so the bats fly into the air and it crashes.  Strangely, it's crashing inside the scripting engine, in an infinite loop.  If I hold a shoulder button and use up and down I can still scroll the screen.

<br/>
Can anyone else confirm this?

<br/>
Yes, not being able to delete an old save is something I should have thought of, now you describe what happens it makes perfect sense.  Unless you clear the SRAM the old save will be there and it won't save over it.
<br/>
<br/>
Saves disappearing however is really wierd.  The next time it happens to me I'm going to dump the save RAM onto my PC and see if I can work out why it's not picking it up.

The full stop on d-pad down is a great idea - I'll stick it in.

If you want to boot multiple DS homebrew, and have a flashcart, you can use Darkain's multibooter. It's around here somewhere.

You'll need ScummVM DS in a *.nds form, rather than the *.ds.gba, though. And I don't think such a thing currently exists.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't think that Monkey Island is possible on the DS(perhaps on the PSP) because it needs 90 Mhz and 16 MB RAM</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think you'll get Monkey 3 or later to run.  I bet that game will be absolutely huge, and it runs at 640x480, which would be a bit too rubbish scaled down to 256x192.  The CPU time taken up by that is likely to be pretty hefty too.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell may well decode MP3s, but it will probably be using the ARM9 for this, since it's not doing much else at the time.  In ScummVM DS, the ARM9 is almost totally used to run the game, so decoding MP3s as well would be impossible.  
<br/>
<br/>
The ARM7 processor is unused though, so if that can be made to do the decoding then it wouldn't affect the game speed at all (in fact, it may even be faster, as you wouldn't need to do the FM synthesis on the ARM9) but I have some doubts over whether it's fast enough without some serious optimisation work.
<br/>
<br/>
I may try to get MAD compiling on it at some point, unless other people think another MP3 decoder might be better.

In Indy 4 you can fight with the mouse as well by clicking on the enemy to attack or on yourself to block. But this was not possible in Last Crusade afaik.

1. No, games are to big.

You need some stuff for it though. Passme, WiFiME or FlashME.

This port actually inspired me to go out and find somewhere to buy Day of the Tentacle and Sam + Max.  I always was interested in playing them, and this DS port is perfect because the DS is just great for something like this with the touch screen, not to mention the insane portability of it.

Truely awesome work here so far. I just tried this for the first time with Sam'n'Max and it works amazingly well.

The only problem (which I would imagine is easily solved) is that S&amp;M uses the mouse cursor to display what the current action is. As ScummVMds doesn't display the mouse cursor this makes it rather difficult to operate.

Could you please display (or include an option to display) the mouse cursor?

I've released version 0.2:

<br/>
# Crash bug after playing for a while has been fixed
<br/>
# All games have a performance boost
<br/>
# Saves are compressed in SRAM allowing more than one

# Saves don't get lost at random any more
<br/>
# Engine configuration is saved into SRAM
<br/>
# Added option to clear SRAM (hold L+R on startup)

# The sound glitches are reduced

<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, saves are not compatible with version 0.1, so you won't be able to carry on your game.
<br/>
<br/>
Chava: sorry about your problems, I discovered several horrible flaws in how v0.1 saved it's games which are now fixed.
<br/>
<br/>
audiotheory: Yes, Sam &amp; Max uses a different interface which could do with some special support in ScummVM DS.  I'll get to that in the next version.
<br/>
<br/>
IxthusTiger: Broken Sword and Beneith a Steel Sky don't work yet.  Broken Sword runs at 640x480 so probably will never work.  BASS will work when I get round to making a separate build.
<br/>
<br/>
Youplpaboum: No, it's not all that user friendly, but that functionality is straight from the PC version.  I might have a go at changing it at some point.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
What I did was tap on the cardboard box, then choose which cursor I wanted there. Still kind of a pain, since one is missing, (walk I think), and you have to constantly use this box. Still, using this method one can effectively play the game. One could also learn the order in which the different cursors cycle when using right mouse button mode.
<br/>
<br/>
What would be good if it showed the cursor with each tap on the screen, so when someone was cycling through teh cursors with right click mode, you'd see each icon and know which you were using.[/b]</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Still, you shouldn't  need to use the SRAM clear feature as you can delete saves from within the game now anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
It's only really needed when you reflash a different game onto your cartridge and therefore lose the ability to delete the saves individually.
<br/>
<br/>
And if you can't get this feature to work, you can always use your PC to format the SRAM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have to say, this is pretty cool...I can fit around 4 saves (testing with Day of the Tentacle, don't know if compression would vary from game to game) and the saving of the INI is very nice.  Stuff runs a good spot smoother also, which is always a good thing.  :)<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As to the sound bugs, in Monkey Island 1, the intro tune sounds wrong.  I haven't noticed any problems with the rest of the game though.
<br/>
<br/>
All other games seem to have no problems, apart from the crackling that happens everywhere.  If you get no music, you're probably using non-DOS versions of the game.  Only DOS versions have music.
<br/>
<br/>
The sound volume is low.  You can adjust it using the options menu to be quite a bit louder.  The reason it's so quiet is because of the original ScummVM code.  I might be able to hack it though.
<br/>
<br/>
I know about the key repeat bug.  It's annoying, but it doesn't prevent you from saving or loading.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no vertical scaling because the text quality gets worse when this is enabled, in certain parts of the screen.  This is because the scale is very close to 1.  I could still add it as an option if people want it.
<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a problem with deleting files in ZIPs.  If you want to change your ZIP file, it's probably best to delete it and rezip all the files again until I work out what the problem is.
<br/>
<br/>
I've also found an intermittant bug that makes the holding of L + R on bootup not work.  If you have problems, try saving some more games and then try it as it's more likely to work the more saves are on the card.

<br/>
I also got my GBAMP yesterday!  Now all I have to do is find a CF card which it likes, as it doesn't support 64Mb cards like the one I have. :-(

As to saving on the Supercard, if it doesn't save the same way as standard GBA carts, it's not going to work.  I don't have a supercard, but if there is enough interest, and a library to make it work, I can have a go at it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

1. Seems that way for me too when comparing sound on DS vs PC in ScummVM play.

Scaling at a ratio close to 1 sometimes has more annoying artifacts than scaling at a larger ratio. In addition, PocketNES style flicker scaling really only works in one direction at once (horizontal or vertical).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I don't think anyone said that they WOULD NOT be playable (just try the demos for the talkie games...they work fine), just that the size constraints of the GBA flash cart (and the fact that really most DS homebrew is only limited to 32 megs of that flashcart) would keep you from having the entire sound file and the game data on there at once without problems.  You should have all of the code of the game, but probably only some of the monster sound file, which would indicate to me evetually you're going to run into a stumbling block and ScummVM isn't going to be able to load sound effects or something, and the game will probably still play it'll just be angry at you since it can't find the sound file. :P<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
2. Play the ScummVM game in NDS mode and then save your gamestate when you are ready to quit.
<br/>
3. Do a Quick Power Cycle but boot back into GBA mode. Use the menu to manually save the SC SRAM to the GBA game"s save file (I used Ninja cause its small and loads fast). Now you have acutally captured your SC SRAM with the ScummVM save data to your SC.
<br/>
Now to reload this save game:
<br/>
1. Boot to GBA mode and load the GBA game that you tied your ScummVM save to. Use the manual method and load your Game Save. Immediatley QPC but boot into NDS mode this time (this will be tricky if you aren"t using flahsme because it will be hard to insert your passme and all that in the time alloted for a QPC). Now launch the ScummVM emulator again and bam your Save gamestate is back in the SC Sram and you can resume your Scumm game right were you left off.
<br/>
This is kind of cumbersome but hey it lets you play ScummVM and save and resume so what more could you ask for. Try it it works. SC ROCKS!!!!!! The ScummVM dev is working on getting larger Scumm games to work so before long we will have the talkie games working with speach and all.....woot.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Could this be possible to simulate left &amp; right mouse buttons with B &amp; A buttons? In fact it's rather hard to select answers in games like Monkey 2, or pick up small items.

Duodreamer: The save slot numbering is meant to be like that.  When you're loading, an extra save slot 0 appears, which is the one that ScummVM autosaves to.  My version doesn't autosave yet though.  The number of your save game remains the same.

It's an inherent limitation in the GBA cart bus. There is a 24-bit address bus and a 16-bit data bus; 16 bits &lt;&lt; 24 == 256 Mbits. The GBA flash carts with more than 256 Mbit (32 MiB) have proprietary bankswitch registers that vary from make and model to make and model and even on one make and model aren't always easy to figure out.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have had nothing to do with the ScummVM project before I make the DS version.  The amount of changes I've made to the ScummVM source will make it difficult to merge into the main source tree.  But it still could be done.

As to the 32Mb limit, this wasn't a bad choice on Nintendo's part.  No GBA cart went over that limit over the GBA's lifetime so far.  Even if they did, Nintendo could include mapper chips like the NES and GB had, which could make a potentially limitless amount of ROM available.
<br/>
<br/>
I probably could implement mapping code which would allow people with larger flash cards to use the whole capacity if there were a few makes of card which were popular and could be reverse engineered.
<br/>
<br/>
If not, there's always GBAMP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

You may want to talk to Sasq if you want some information on things like that (although the code would be GBA code).  I seem to remember seeing some WIP code for PogoShell supporting quite a few different flashcarts <a class="postlink" href="http://www.emuboards.com/invision/index.php?showforum=13" target="_blank">here</a> or you could try the main  PogoShell site.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Especially for sd cards because they are gonna be very popular (supercard, m3, mk). I guess they are gonna be different but I think fhe file system would be similar.
