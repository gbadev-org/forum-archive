    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Would it work, streaming Tv for the DS, by Online Streaming, i know lots and lots of websites that have streaming for excelent channels, like American CartoonNetwork (OnePiece,Naruto,BoboBobobo), Espn, TvTokyo, etc...
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe its workable... maybe someone could work around with it, because i dont think its that difficult, if the ds can get to irc, msn, get streming from online radios, play online, etc...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think he is infering, you effectively screen capture it regularly, convert, and send to the Ds on the fly?
<br/>
<br/>
Seems doable...the framerate of the "sending to the DS" bit is likely to be much worse then the "print screen" frame-rate of the pc :p
<br/>
(obviously print screen has to be done without hardware acceleration,but thats not a problem)
<br/>
<br/>
But still, I dont see much point given the low quality.
<br/>
<br/>
Id rather have higher/more flexible/easier normal streaming.
<br/>
Supporting OGG streams, or higher bitrates ect.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A program for streaming videos from the PC to the DS would act as a normal conversion program, except it sends the data over wifi instead of saving it to disk. With the current wifi library, the DS seems to be able to sustain download rates of ~30 kbps over TCP. That leads to possible streaming speeds of at least ~224 kbps (including audio). I belive UDP is faster, however, so bitrates of 384+ aren't necessarily out of the question.
<br/>
<br/>
Conversion speed shouldn't be a problem for the most part, because at 12fps, both dpgenc and BatchDPG generally convert faster than realtime.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how much of the DS's RAM would be free for video/audio buffer, though.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

"well, if you are close enough to a computer to run a program, then why watch the shows on your ds instead of on the computer?"

<br/>
then i would say
<br/>
<br/>
"i could run the program in the background of the pc while a family member is on the computer, and watch them on my DS. OR, after my bedtime I could run the program on my computer and watch television on my DS under the covers (don't make fun of me, im a kid :O)"
