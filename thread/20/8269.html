    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seeing as TCP/IP is still a work in progress, would it be possible to program an IM client on the DS using the PC to do the actual TCP/IP communications in the  same way Win2DS uses the PC server to arrange the data, so all the DS is doing is displaying data that has been collected on the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to have the DS running the non-IM on the bed side table, playing sounds when someone logs on and being able to send messages.
<br/>
<br/>
Could it be easily done?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Waiting for TCP/IP to be supported will be a lot better in that you won't even need a PC.. That'd be the better choice, in my opinion.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

I made a lousy interface for mirc (using 6 lines of code) that accepts messages from the DS (and rebroadcasts them to the channel) and rebroatcasts any channel messages to the DS using nothing but the UDP Experimenter on the wifi lib test by stephen - it's not really useful or good, but does the job...
<br/>
<br/>
Not really worth it if you ask me. Wait for TCP.
<br/>
<br/>
But to answer your question, YES, it's totally doable. All you have to do is code one program on the DS Side to handle whatever UDP Packets your PC Side program (which you also coded yourself) will send to it.
<br/>
<br/>
With TCP, DHCP, DNS and ICMP implementation being so close, it's almost not worth to go through all the trouble of coding all that on two plataforms when you could do it in only one (the ds itself) in a short while.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It'd be nice to have the wifilib finished first, then he works on the dstunnel project. Seeing all these ideas that people are doing with their current wifi projects, I would love to see what will come when tcp/ip is complete :)
<br/>
<br/>
DS Tunneling will be cool, too, though it's an isolated thing.. It won't compete with Nintendo WFC :(<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
