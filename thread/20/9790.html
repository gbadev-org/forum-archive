How did you start in the first place? From a rented DS Game Card?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I started a new game on a gamecard I lent from my friend (3 saveslots :)), but now he wants it back.
<br/>
I wasn't payed at the time but now I got enough money (end of the month) to buy my own card (just ordered a M3). But I don't want to start all over and that's why I want to put the save on it. 
<br/>
(Please don't misunderstand me, I buy my games legal and I'm no pirate yarr)
<br/>
<br/>
But with most translaters btw, I get several errors, maybe because my notepad doesnt recognize Japanase, so I cope the wrong text in the translater.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What I'm saying is that if you want to take a save from an M3 .dat file (which for NDS games is in your NDSSAVE folder on your SD card) and put it onto an actual Nintendo DS gamecard, then start up Rein on the M3 using the 'Start' button.  Next, choose the 'M3 Man' option (highlight it and press the 'A' button).  
<br/>
<br/>
Then, in the next screen, choose 'M3 --&gt; DS'.
<br/>
<br/>
A screen will come up with some general info about the gamecard inserted...just press A to pass it.
<br/>
<br/>
Then a screen will come up, look for the NDSSAVE folder, highlight it and press 'A'.  Then, choose the proper .dat file from the list...more than likely for MPH it'd be called Metroid Prime Hunters.dat or some similar thing.  Highlight it and press 'A'.  Assuming there are no problems, and there shouldn't be usually, Rein should then do it's thing and import the save from the dat, then copy it onto your gamecard.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to go from NDS gamecard to M3, it's basically the same process, just choose 'DS --&gt; M3' instead of 'M3 --&gt; DS' in the 'M3-Save(DAT) Manager' menu.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thank you very much!
<br/>
I think the main problem was that I started the program with 'A' and not with 'start'. Thanks for your support, I works =)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
