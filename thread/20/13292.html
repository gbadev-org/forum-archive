    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Moon Books Project has really taken off. From a small blog with a few books to the massive archive of literature and films it is today.
<br/>
<br/>
I am proud to announce that The Moon Books Project has released over 400 pieces of classical literature, and over 140 films for enjoyment on the Nintendo DS.
<br/>
<br/>
Classic literature such as Shakespeare, H.P. Lovecraft, and H.G. Wells is available alongside such films as Plan 9 From Outer Space, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Night Of The Living Dead and The Jungle Book.
<br/>
<br/>
I must also mention, that everything on The Moon Books Project is in the public domain. That means you can download it, and give out copies to friends, and share your enjoyment with everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
It is my hope that everyone enjoys The Moon Books Project as much as I have, and the website continues to grow both in content, and in popularity.

Not sure theres anything many people will want though. 
<br/>
<br/>

Don't know if you want any of it, but your welcome.
<br/>
stage6 can just be downloaded and transcode from site.
<br/>
Veoh sometimes needs a silly silent to download. (which is free and spyware free, but still annoying)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
