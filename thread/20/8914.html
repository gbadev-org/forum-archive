    <h4>#75607 - Bodom - Tue Mar 14, 2006 4:56 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, I'm a member august and I've only posted 2 times...
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a french member of PlayerAdvance (french community of GBA/DS developpers), and since I've made my first DS game, I think it would be good to share it with you :).
<br/>
<br/>
Now let me describe it :
<br/>
<br/>
First, it's not a port of the Amiga Game Aztec Challenge (I didn't know this one till I released my game...).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a port of a TI-82 game that I loved, Laser Mayhem, by Badja.
<br/>
<br/>
If the original game was a bit futuristic, I've changed it to a more "aztec thing", since I prefer this kind of look. All graphics and sprites are home-made.
<br/>
<br/>
A few screenshots :
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So it's a Puzzle/Reflexion game. For each level you have to shoot the target twice, using "quetzalcoatl idols" to lauch fireballs. These fireballs have to make their way through the level using different objects.
<br/>
<br/>
But you'll see that it's easy to understand, the five first levels are tutorials.
<br/>
<br/>
Just put the cursor on an object to see its purpose on the upper screen (the game supports french and english language).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can play the game using the Pad or the stylus (sometimes very hazardous yet.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you play with the .ds.gba one (on linker), your progress will be saved on sram, and you'll be able to continue your game. You can switch between the levels you've completed using L &amp; R triggers.
<br/>
<br/>
If you play on Supercard (.sc.nds), your progress won't be saved, but you can switch between all levels using L &amp; R triggers.
<br/>
<br/>
The game is also fully playable with Dualis and DSEmuMe (but without sound).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to restart a level, simply press Start to pause the game, and press B.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="font-weight: bold">Level Editor</span> is also included, which allow you to create your own levels and add them directly to a rom, so you can test them directly on your DS :). 
<br/>
<br/>
This editor also allow you to save your own levels on your hard drive (in case you want to edit them later), and to send me the levels by a simple click (it's automatic, just send the generated mail). And if your levels are good, they will be in the next versions of the game :)!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you want some Brain Training, give it a try :)!
<br/>
<br/>

may be you can add a crosshair or let the red square on stilus is touching so we can see where we are pressing.. becouse the touch screens looks messed up<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://flickr.com/photos/stuffbox" target="_blank">http://flickr.com/photos/stuffbox</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I know the touche screen is messed up since I used the new ndslib, even without screen protection.
<br/>
<br/>
The new version (with a better contrast and some new levels) will be released soon (for the Neoflash compo) and I'll compile it with the older version of ndslib (which seemed to work a lot better with stylus).

ps. hoagie - level 7 needs just some pushing around with the triangle blocks.. try moving them so that you can shoot also from the left side. :)
<br/>
<br/>
edit: i like also the level design after the initial easy ones a lot ... played through the first 14 on one stand. how many levels are there in total?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">i have a GBAMP, and it all works fine using the .nds except the level switching with L and R. i can go back levels with L, but using R to go forward doesn't work (or should i use the supercard version, since i get the messages at the start about no save files being found etc)<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A few things;
<br/>
<br/>
1. Save system for GBAMP users please :)
<br/>
(or, at least, level select)
<br/>
<br/>
2. Little clock at the top somewhere, theres plenty of space. (Real Time / Time spent on puzzle)
<br/>
<br/>
3. More levels (of course :) )

still,great little game</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Couple things I see that would be nice..
<br/>
<br/>
1) game instructions/rules on main menu
<br/>
2) ability to go back to main menu when pressing START during a game.
<br/>
3) version numbers to keep track if you have the latest version or not, maybe add it on the credits screen?
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, it looks nice.. I look forward to learning how to play and doing a full review on ndshb.com</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
-&gt; Lynx : your ideas sound very good. I'll add version number and the ability to return to main menu during play. For the tutorial, the five first levels are here to learn how to play. But it's true that I shoul add some advices to make the learning easier ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you considered makeing a sequal?
<br/>
I mean, 90% the same, but with a few new devices?
<br/>
(eg, corner pieces that flip when hit to deflect the other way)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the most well-rounded homebrew games I have seen.
<br/>
I could picture it on sale in shops if the concept was just expanded :p</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
