    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm trying to setup the wireless multiboot application, and I'm having a few problems in the process. Here's what I've done so far:
<br/>
<br/>
-I checked my wireless card for compatibility; its on the list: Belkin F5D7010, v3001.
<br/>
<br/>
-I installed the latest custom driver; Nintendo DS appears in my device manager.
<br/>
<br/>
-I downloaded the Polarium demo from firefly's site and placed it into the data folder.
<br/>
<br/>
-I ran the wmb -data command from the wmb directory. A copy of the screen with the resulting errors follows:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;cd c:\wmb
<br/>
<br/>
C:\wmb&gt;wmb -data polarium_demo_usa
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo DS - Wireless Multiboot Application - Version 1.5

Any ideas what I've done wrong, or what I've misunderstood about how WMB works?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Yooser Naim on Thu Mar 29, 2007 6:57 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Could not load header.bin" means file not found. The fact that it displays "header.bin" instead of the actual filename is a bug in wmb.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, so I've setup everything correctly with the exception of how I load the file, but I have no idea about how to correct this.
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to rename the file to anything specific? Does anything else have to be in the data folder along with the official demo? Am I using the -data parameter correctly?
<br/>
<br/>
Note: My WMB data folder has nothing else in it but the " 'polarium_demo_usa' Nintendo DS - Game Card Image."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, KeithE, I thought I had done that, but I hadn't evidently. Now it works. The reason I had thought I had done it must have been that I believed the extension to be .ds not .nds. You would think that I would've been able to see it right on the file, but the file extension for .nds files doesn't show up on my computer anymore. Instead, the file type field says "Nintendo DS - Game Card Image." The first time I had seen this was when I downloaded the Polarium demo, cause before now .nds files showed up with nothing in the file type field and all the extensions were present. I even believed for a short period that it was a unique, 'official' file type; isn't that funny. Windows must have recognized the file type on the polarium demo and started hiding the extension. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have made the mistake.

Oh well, just another embarassing post.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In Windows Explorer, go to Tools - Folder Options - "View" tab - uncheck the "Hide extensions for known filetypes" checkbox and hit OK.  Then the extensions will always show up regardless of whether Windows can associate it with a program or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
