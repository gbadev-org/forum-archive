I made a movie (way to amateur though), showing an interesting bug in DS' sound hardware. Using it, you can use a line-in cable to output sound on DS' speakers. :)<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wow, great way to break your DS. The reason you're getting sound is because you arn't pushing the plug in far enough to spread the pins away from the pass-thru in the jack.  This is no different from not plugging a pair of headphones into your stereo partway and still getting sound out the speakers, except you're back-feeding the DAC in the second DS which is bad. Especially with the second DS off, since that means the DAC is getting voltage in on a line it never was designed to, and while the rest of the IC is unpowered.
<br/>
<br/>
Don't do this if you value either DS. If both DSes are on then you'll be feeding unexpected power to both of them.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">so is this the same danger as connecting together the two sides of a battery? Can anyone verify that there's a risk? This is pretty cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Isn't the power going to the speakers, so therefore not risking breakage?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
