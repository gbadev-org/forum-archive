    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was thinking about using [url=http://www.andreani.net/ds/amap4ds.htm]Amap4DS to read a pdf of a schematic and I'm just playing around with it now.

Is there any homebrew that might be better suited for this?  I can get the schematics into pretty much any format needed but I need to be able to zoom in to quite a high level to read it.

Any ideas?  Maybe ComicbookDS?
