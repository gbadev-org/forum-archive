Actually you can compress at 15fps.  It's not supported in the mpeg1 spec, but some encoders will allow non strict compliance mode to allow compression at whatever rate you like.
<br/>
<br/>
mencode on linux complains in non strict mode, but only about audio-sync issues, which of course are meaningless since the audio is totally separate in dpg files.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

only Moonshell 0.7p1 for Supercard SD here.. might need to test this when 0.8 comes for it.

<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit 1</span>
<br/>
Yep. as I thought.. placing the dpg in EXFS_files and running it improves it in 0.7p1 not to 100% but not far from.
<br/>
<br/>
Seems reading from CF is faster then SD then.
<br/>

<br/>
Hell YEAH.. placing it in EXFS on 0.8 it plays almost perfectly. (sligthly out of sync)

Hopefully it will play that good from SD when Supercard SD version is out.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Mithos on Sat Jan 07, 2006 1:29 am; edited 3 times in total</span></div>

For anime with subtitles, using dpgenc to encode the video at 256x192, 96kbps works well. There is a little bit of dithering and frameskipping (and 0.8 crashes for me, seemingly because of this,) but it's very watchable and subtitles are readable. It doesn't look too great on live-action, but it's still not horrible.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

for anime, I cut a bit off the top and bottom to get 256*168 or something close to that. Mean you can create an almost full screen video with no scaling and almost perfect framerate.

I don't know what you mean by "VBR Constant Quality 190 - 200" because I only see: Constant birate (CBR), 2-pass VBR, Manual VBR, Automatic VBR (CQ_VBR), and Constant Quality (CQ).

96 is the highest you can get with a decent frame rate at full screen. Test it, it doesn't look that bad encoded with dpgenc. I don't like to cut off the top, because the openings have the lyrics on the top of the screen, and some clarifications during the show (for example, in Naruto, the Ninja techniques are translated on top).

@Moonshell, you do GREAT. Could you also release the version for Supercard SD and M3 SD for every new version of Moonshell. I'm sure it will get more and more popular.

One more thing, can you support so that some small NDS or GBA game load directly in Moonshell.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here, something slightly different to look at:
<br/>
I am encountering strange, seemingly random problems with the next file function. When I press R, instead of choosing the next file on the list of files, Moonshell seems to choose a random file in the list. This is a problem with my recent attempts to use Moonshell to read comic books.
<br/>
<br/>
The really weird part here is that it was working fine for no reason a while ago... only to mess up again another time. (This occured with the same version of Moonshell).
<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if this was fixed, and also it would be kind of nice to have an option in global.ini to make Moonshell choose the next file in alphabetical order as opposed to the order of files in the file system.
<br/>
<br/>
No pressure though!
<br/>
<br/>
This thing is amazing.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

I dissagree. I watch anime on my DS (Naruto, Bleach, Full Metal Alchemist) at 256x192 and 192kb's. I set the framerate in mencoder to 15fps (although it probably plays at 30 with duplicate/longer frames). In Naruto the subs are a bit unreadable but FMA and Bleach are perfect with little dithering and framedropping.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Here's some more clips for you encoding fiends:
<br/>
<br/>
The Austin Powers intro is a nice video torture test.  There is a lot of motion and colors in the foreground and background.  This is the intro using Durandle's Stargate settings:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.de/files/10587775/austin_powers_23_9fps.dpg.html" target="_blank">http://rapidshare.de/files/10587775/austin_powers_23_9fps.dpg.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This the same clip based on monkeying with tmpgenc:
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.de/files/10588156/austin_powers_12fps.dpg.html" target="_blank">http://rapidshare.de/files/10588156/austin_powers_12fps.dpg.html</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Settings are:
<br/>
256x144
<br/>
12fps
<br/>
Automatic VBR: quality=50, max=440, min=190
<br/>
Soften block noise 35/35 under the quantize matrix tab
<br/>
<br/>
Audio for both clips are 128kbs/48000.  This is a tradeoff between sound quality and filesize.  An interesting thing I found was at 256x144@12fps, you can bump up the video kbps to around 500 before dithering shows up.  The higher the kbps, the less blockiness shows up in fast moving scenes.  Of course, the downside to a high kbps is a larger file size.  So you gotta deal with compromises between mpeg1's ineffeciencies, the moonshell mpeg decoder, and your preference of dithering or jerky motion.

i dunno if anyone had reach this conclusion too, but choaking and juddering is mainly effected by the frame rate, and bit rate. just set the frame rate to below 24, or as close to 24 as possible (in the case of TMPGEnc, it was 23.9 something). as for bit rate, keep it around 300 for safe measure, and stay away from CBR.

conclusion:
<br/>
dont even try CBR...it just bloats up file size, and moonshell handles VBR fine, just lower the max rate to what you would normally set in  CBR, which is     around 350-400 (a lil pushing it) and it saves space.

<br/>
The skip frame detection has a hard time. It keeps researching.
<br/>
<br/>
As for high bps video stream, the read buffer becomes insufficient.
<br/>
request MPEG is 8192kbyte.
<br/>
MoonShell buffer size is 32kbyte.
<br/>
I will enlarge buffer a little more.

<br/>
I will not mount skin for the time being.

I think that MoonShell should be made safety and secure more. (It is still imperfect now. )

I do not know many of the encode setting of mpeg.

FAT32 (Especially, in DPG) is disadvantageous. Table cache becomes invalid.

<br/>
I am encountering strange, seemingly random problems with the next file function. When I press R, instead of choosing the next file on the list of files, Moonshell seems to choose a random file in the list. This is a problem with my recent attempts to use Moonshell to read comic books.
<br/>
<br/>
The really weird part here is that it was working fine for no reason a while ago... only to mess up again another time. (This occured with the same version of Moonshell).
<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if this was fixed, and also it would be kind of nice to have an option in global.ini to make Moonshell choose the next file in alphabetical order as opposed to the order of files in the file system.

No pressure though!

I think another request for Moonshell to support comic book reading would be to have a zoom in/zoom out function in the jpeg viewer.  You could use the X/Y keys similar to the volume controls in the mp3 player.  That way you can see the entire panel/page and then zoom in to read the balloons.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

i correct myself, the freezing on CBR is very well caused by my FAT32, as FAT16 seeks frame fine. also, VBR videos crashes more often (in fact, a lot) than CBR...which makes CBR the ideal encoding method.

After some more testing, I have come to some interesting results (which still don't help me).  When opening the MPEG after I encode it with TMPGEnc in Windows Media Player, the length of the video is cut off about 4-5 minutes.  But if I leave it until the end, the video will play until the very end like it should.  However, when opening it in Media Player Classic, the length of the video is how it should be.  Also, the length of the mpeg stated by Windows Media Player (the incorrect length) is the exact same length that DPGencoder encodes to, which is why most of my videos lose a few minutes.  I don't know what the hell I can do now though to fix it...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Edged on Tue Jan 10, 2006 1:36 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Other software (Multiboot) as a zoom function, so it would be nice for moonshell to do the same.

Id also like *basic* multitasking.

I dont think it would take too much to intergrate it into moonshell...after all, the background instruction windows still can be scrolled as a video is playing. (you do get slowdown though)

As to helping Moonshell understand our English. I posted about that a while back. If you want to write in a way that the translator can understand, use short sentances and simple grammer and words. Always make sure spelling is correct. Do not use short hand (this includes don't, isn't, hasn't, etc). Try to avoid using "it" to refer to the subject of a sentance. For example :
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell keeps crashing when playing movies. Moonshell might be crashing because of the new YUV code that is supposed to fix the 'red' squares.
<br/>
<br/>
The translators are not very good. They can not deal with the use of past and future tense well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It would be nice to have some real person provide translation services instead of having some automagick translator chew them up.
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;rant&gt;
<br/>
Translations are bad because English is poor and Japanese is also poor.
<br/>
<br/>
Asian languages have no verb tenses and no gender.  English is a language of exceptions, it's lost much of its structure due to infusion from so many different other languages (both UK and US have a history of immigration and foreign involvement).

I vote we go back to Koine greek as the gold written standard.  ;)

During playback. Desync happens when the audio and video are decoded at different speeds. For example, if the audio plays normally and the video is played too fast, the audio will keep getting farther and farther behind. 
<br/>
<br/>
Pausing or seeking causes them to restart from the same spot, so they get resynced.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The compatibility of AVI has been improved.

An old method can be chosen by the Wave acquisition. (2005/12/31 based.)

When long seeking by full-screen, the progress bar was seen.

The bug that the GIF plug-in doesn't decode was corrected.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey I've been playing with the latest encoder... and its pretty amazing  :)  I encoded some episodes of Bleach with :
<br/>
<br/>
256*192
<br/>
176 bitrate
<br/>
20 fps
<br/>
no blur
<br/>
<br/>
I'm impressed that the video stays smooth, the subs you can read easily and the file size is only  46mb.  Oh and the image quality is damn nice (most of the time).
<br/>
<br/>
Note I'm using an M3 CF - other people may not have such luck with the same settings, other carts have slower access times.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if Moonshell can optimise the decoder for ARM9 some more then it will be smoother... who knows  :)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering actually how hard it would be to adapt the same system of DPG to MPEG4...   :D
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
not quite on topic... but I've been playing with file access for SDL and got it working quite easily after recompiling SDL with the FAT_ libs dealing with f-commands. If we can get threading and sound going then we could port anything to DS without havig to change much code at all.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ah.... I've found (I think) a small bug...
<br/>
<br/>
I think the DPG encoder is forcing 4:3 aspect ration. I encoded a widescreen video and it made a DPG with 256*192. The image was stretched. I'm sure the older versions would output widescreen if the input was wide.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
On further testing... the source was MPEG2, it just didn't seem to pickup what ratio it should be so output at 4:3. I encoded a 16:9 AVI and it created a 256*128 movie... which is also wrong. It should be 256*144.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonshell - can you add a 16:9 (widescreen) checkbox in the encoder? Or an option to set both the width and the height...</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Durandle on Fri Jan 13, 2006 12:53 am; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

Even if the source is included, I am no programmer. I don't know how to do anything like that. I figured it would be relatively simple to include, though, which is why I asked.

In most video codecs, including ones like XVID/DIVX, Red and Blue colour seems to have real problems - I'm not really understanding why, some one told me once... maybe something like it uses more data than other colours and as such suffers in high compression.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Maybe this is the same case as with JPEG files that does not compress red color correctly compared to PNG?

Let's let Moonshell just go at his own pace, with his own ideas (you shouldn't doubt yourself, by the way... with what you've done so far, I'm sure you can achieve some sort of plugin support), and people can add features to it themselves using the source code.
<br/>
<br/>
Save text position would be good, but I don't think such a feature should be added unless the idea of putting Moonshell's global.ini file, etc. on CF happens, in which case there would be a place to comfortably put a file to hold such information.<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

問題なさげ。
<br/>
<br/>
SuperCardとM3で起動できない人がいるみたいなので、ブートローダ（FlashROM-&gt;RAM転送のアレ）を逆アセンブルしてちょっと読んでみた。
<br/>
<br/>
不明なレジスタ040001b0/040001b4/040001b8に0を書き込んでいるけど、それ以外は怪しいところは無し。心配だった WAIT_CRも操作していないみたい（ARM7コードだから当たり前なんだけど）だし、別のCF使えば起動できるみたいなので、もうこれはCFの相性だと思って諦めてください?。正直許してって感じ。(^^;;;
<br/>
<br/>
私はアドムービーしかテストしてないので。金が無いんだよ金が！（マテ(^^;
<br/>
<br/>
新しいFATドライバがM3SD対応したらいいな～～～～と言ってみる。言うだけはタダだもーん。
<br/>
<br/>
追加情報によると、正常起動するCFで起動して、起動できないCFに（dpgとか入れておいて）入れ替えて再生すると正常に読み込めるそうです。
<br/>
だから、ファームのCF-&gt;Flash部分が何か（高速モードを使ってるとかで）問題なのかなーと思います。思うだけ。ファームアップデートで直るといいね。</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

if its not that, then its possible the source is interleaved and MPlayer is not decoding it well. What are the source stats and all the out settings your using?

You can add subtitles using VirtualDub (TextSub,Huffyuv -plugins needed) + AviSynth -&gt; Frameserver file (use it with dpgenc.exe).
<br/>
Using VirtualDub's frameserver directly in other app. usually causes VirtualDub to crash in my PC.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Converted two shows.  The first episode of DiGi Charat (a 5 minute episode) and 1 episode of JunglewaItsumoHalenochiGuu (26 minutes).  I watched all of DiGi charat and it was great..no problems.  As for JunglewaItsumoHalenochiGuu, i used the seeking and watched bits and pices of it...everything was perfect.  Plus, the file size was realy small and i coudl read my sub titles :)  42mb for my 26 minute episode and around 8mb for my 5 minute episode.
<br/>
<br/>
I used the following settigns in dpgenc if anyone is interested:
<br/>
PCM rate: 48000
<br/>
Volume: 150%
<br/>
256 pixils
<br/>
176kbit/sec
<br/>
10 fps (This is perfect for me and my anime. :) don't need any higher :S )
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I juse used the default settigns for everythign else. :)  Using a GBA MP and a 512mb Kingston card formated with Fat16. :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">All this talk about MPEG movies is great and all, but I would certainly like to see new features.
<br/>
<br/>
Namely, MikMod playing back 16-bit samples without "dithering" them (drammatically speeding its loadtime)
<br/>
<br/>
..Perhaps WAV support. If the GBA movie player could support this (in GBA mode), don't see why MoonShell can't.
<br/>
<br/>
Fix SPC playback. Don't know about anyone else but current SPC playback = VERY Slow. too slow for comfort.
<br/>
<br/>
Better Directory support... (When in "Next" mode, it should either play the songs in the subdirectory automatically, or skip the subdirectory all together)
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, perhaps an in-program text editor..or maybe even move the config file outside of IMFS so anyone can change the config with any Complact Flash Text Editor
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.. DMV movie support added back in would be nice, too. ;)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Why do you want back DMV support? for the quality? actually it would be nice if moonshell could support both dmv and dpg, DMV for high quality (though big files), DPG for small files (though not very good quality)

sorry!
<br/>
<br/>
About Alternative method mode.
<br/>
<br/>
The mode to acquire the audio data from the media file is set.
<br/>
<br/>
Each 128kb buffered is acquired usually.
<br/>
The Alternative mode is acquired every four bytes.
<br/>
The same output is sure to result originally.
<br/>
<br/>
However, there seems to be a failing environment in 128kb. (I was not able to confirm it. )
<br/>
Therefore, four byte mode was build-in.
<br/>
Please use usual (no check) if there is no problem.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I think it would be useful.  People use different frame rates depending on the video source.  Lower frame rates should let moonshell handle higer bitrates.

Will there be stereo support for DPG? I've tried setting the .ini setting to 2 channels, but that only makes a dpg file without any sound, and it freezes the DS when I try to play the file. (Edit: Later found out that GSM is a mono-only codec. Bummer.)

Every other sample going to each channel would likely corrupt the psychoacoustic structure of the audio, on which GSM Full Rate relies. It'd be better to use two separate streams even if it does require cutting sample rate in half.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The first thing I would like to say is that Moonshell is a fantastic program. I started using Moonshell only recently with version .6+1 on my GBAMPv2, however it is the program I use the most for the DS. It plays all the music files I have and allows my DS to function as a MP3 player. Thank you, Moonshell.
<br/>
<br/>
I just updated to version .8 today and noticed a remarkable improvement. The ability to use the L and R buttons when the DS is closed is incredibly useful. I had considered requesting such a feature earlier. The audio playback also improved. MP3, IT, XM, MOD, and S3M all sounded great. The slight hiss and crackling was gone. Everything was crystal clear, except SPC. SPC played slow.
<br/>
<br/>
So I installed Moonshell .8 Test 5. Now SPC work perfectly. SPC play even better now than in previous versions. However, my IT, XM, MOD, and S3M files now get pops and crackles. Most of these files use 8-bit samples. Could there be a problem with the 16-bit sample support added to MikMod in Test 5?
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time and excellent work! I look forward to the next version of Moonshell! ^_^<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

A "compilable" version, huh? So I'd have to manually change it back to what it was with version .8? And what would I need to use to compile it? NDStool? My point was that all of my S3M, MOD, XM, and IT files worked great in the initial .8 release. Now they do not with .8 Test 5. Currently, I am running both versions and switching back and forth by loading each within Moonshell depending on what I want to listen to.

And you say 16-channel mods? I thought you meant the samples were 16-bit? I will have to check and see how many channels mine use. I just know that they worked well before this last fix, even if some did take a little while to load.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

<br/>
By "compilable", I mean a version where you compile the IMFS directories into the NDS file.
<br/>
<br/>
I do mean 16-channel mods. They do load faster, though, seeing as they're 16-bit samples..which surprised me. I don't know why they're still being "dithered", DS has the capability of outputting at 16-bit..but, because of the changes in MoonShell, and because MoonLight's version of MikMod uses the ARM9 and not the ARM7 (Ficedula's writing an ARM7 driver to use the 16 channels the DS is capable of) it's sharing a CPU that does a whole bunch of other things at once, probably the reason for the slow down. It's all software-mixed after all.
<br/>
<br/>
IT files use something called New Note Actions, which uses a bunch of virtual channels, so even if say you're only using 8 real channels for your mod, if you've got NNA intensive songs running, and it goes past 16 (24 is MoonLight's current limit in build test5) then it's going to use a lot of CPU. Of course, if the samples are 16-bit, they're going to use more CPU as well, twice the CPU.
<br/>
<br/>
One thing you can do is download a program like Impulse Tracker, Schism Tracker, or the icky Modplug Tracker and convert all your samples to 8-bit..that might improve performance as well.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Tssf, I don't see converting all my music as an option when it was just working great a version or two ago (not even a full version change, either). I'd rather run multiple versions of Moonshell before I go about trying to convert all of my media. That goes double for the SPC files. I'm not about to tackle converting my whole collection. Sheesh. O_o The point is, all of my mods and trackers worked great before whatever change happened. Now they do not, and to me that is broken. Why go through the hassle of converting everything because of a bug?

But I would like to thank Moonshell for taking a look at it. Given time, I am sure he will find the solution. I am happy for now because I can use 2 versions for what I need. Thank you again Moonshell. Good luck.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I'd rather run multiple versions of Moonshell before I go about trying to convert all of my media. That goes double for the SPC files. I'm not about to tackle converting my whole collection. Sheesh. O_o The point is, all of my mods and trackers worked great before whatever change happened. Now they do not, and to me that is broken. Why go through the hassle of converting everything because of a bug?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I would like to thank Moonshell for taking a look at it. Given time, I am sure he will find the solution. I am happy for now because I can use 2 versions for what I need. Thank you again Moonshell. Good luck.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Well, I can confirm that one of my IT's don't play with this moonshell test (it being this one here: <a href="http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/turittl.it" target="_blank">http://tssf.i-web.net/Remakes/turittl.it</a> ) But there are a few other problems with it.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, load up an S3M..any problems with the playback? It seems that 8-bit samples are corrupting some how now..
<br/>
<br/>
There's also been a bug in libmikmod since the beginning of it's MoonShell support. For instance, Xxx panning effects in IT files are not remembered past the note it's first used on, only S8x effects are. It also seems that channels that should be mono are being auto-panned to mid left, and mid right. Odd, to say the least.
<br/>
<br/>
Why MoonLight's using libmikmod 3.2.0 beta 2 when 3.2.2 beta has been out the longest time, I don't know. But ah well. At least he chose to try and support these formats, rather than shooting down the idea of using advanced module formats on the DS, beginning to promote an infeasible  format for cartridges, like GSM.

-Window positions saved to the CF card, so next time you start, they're in the same place.

Definately agree on this. :) Perhaps when .shell is saved to the CF instead of IFMS

I asked for playlist support back in the day, don't think it was seen but ah well. It would be nice but I can always live without it.

<br/>
<br/>
Is this possible? o.o Well, maybe starting a DS game would be, but I doubt the GBA one would be..at least, on the M3 when starting a GBA rom, you have to start it in GBA mode or it will not play.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here's to hoping MoonLight listens to some of these ideas. It's all a lot for him to take in though, since he does not speak english. Perhaps someone can offer help, and maybe even changes to MoonShell itself, giving him the code so he can incorporate it. I'm sure that will help him out big time.. If I could code, I probably would do this myself. :)
