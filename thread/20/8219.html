I have not yet seen a link or discussion here. Seems to control the mouse very well. Left shoulder is left click. Needs a left hander option! (for me).
<br/>
<br/>
Works like a tablet rather than a touchpad. ie, where you touch on the ds screen the mouse jumps to there.

I guess it's because my computer sucks, but I get a ton of lag drawing with it in Flash. The mouse moves fine until I start to draw a line, and then it goes reeeeally slow. Still, I managed to draw some nice sketches that would be a bit hard to do with a mouse.

A mode where it clicks automatically after you touch would be nice, so I wouldn't have to touch, hold L, draw a line, and repeat.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I've noticed lag, although only occasionally.  I made some crappy sketches in PhotoShop with it so far. lol  I'm having a bit of a time getting used to doing it on my DS rather than with a good ol' pencil and paper, but this is very cool nonetheless.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, because the program is alreay open.  It's probably minimized.

Win2DS works fine, except the mouse resets to the center occasionaly.

The Pointer app seems to load fine, and it (glitchly) displays the windows desktop. But the Zoom function only works once, thne it crashs.

is it possible to have the keyboard and a small "trackpad" on the bottom screen and the top screen show the desktop, then you zoom in on the cursor (gradually upto 1:1) and have it just track where the cursor is? kinda seems more natural, and you don't have to be sitting in front of the monitor to see where/what your clicking/typing either. just a suggestion is all<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

thanks for the input but i tried that already

btw i had to patch the win2DS to make it work on my supercard if that makes a difference, cause the original file doesn't work at all (white screen)

the DS IP is the computer's IP right or is it the router IP?

well i tried the computer's IP and the router's IP both fail
