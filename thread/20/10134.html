Agreed. If nothing else at least someone get a SNES emulator capable of running it.

1) Don't think there is any DS Download Stations in sweden (never seen one anyway)
<br/>
<br/>
2) Don't have a wifi card (but this one I'm going to change soon when I finally - hopefully - get some sparetime from work to actually try to do some coding of my own for the ds) for the "mild, admin-sanctioned piracy" ;)<br/>_________________<br/>go back to coding and stop screaming wolf :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Well, if you've got a link cable, you can play multiplayer with a friend.  The problem with that though is that you have to have a system that supports the link cable...and a friend who's willing to play with you... Hm, it just occurred to me that my link cable has only been used about 5 times, 4 of which were with the same person, for the same game.  =/
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, "2 in 1 - Dr. Mario and Puzzle League" is a great game for my Tetris Attack addiction.  The Tetris Attack engine has been ported very accurately, so a lot of the chains you can make with very precise timing in TA can be accomplished on the GBA version.
<br/>
<br/>
Although I do understand the reasons for wanting a DS port, wireless multiplayer being the key benefit, I doubt any fan-made project could completely replicate the game with full accuracy.  Your best option would be to get "Dr. Mario and Puzzle League" for the GBA and hope that Nintendo ports it over to the DS at some point in time.  
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as far as emulating TA goes, keep in mind that it is indeed compatible with both SNES Advance and Snezziboy.  However, there is a major problem that prevents the game from being fully playable:

And two Game Paks from the same region. The single-pak feature only sends the single-player demo version. So you essentially have to buy two GBA SPs, two Game Paks, a link cable, and something to carry them all in.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's assuming that your friend doesn't already have a GBA(SP) and the game to begin with.
<br/>
<br/>
Turning it the other way around, in order to play multiplayer on the DS, you would need 2 DS systems and at least 1 Game Pak (assuming that you only need one for multiplayer, which is entirely possible given the DS's 4 MB of RAM).  In both cases, the game can fit directly into the system itself, so the only real difference in the "stuff to carry around" list is the link cable.  In my eyes, that's not too big of a difference, especially when you factor in the size difference between the DS and the GBA SP
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of pricing, assuming that you buy each part new, we've got:
<br/>
<br/>
2 GBA SP systems - $80 apiece - $160
<br/>
2 Game Paks - $30 apiece - $60
<br/>
1 link cable:  about $8 
<br/>
Total:  $228
<br/>
<br/>
or
<br/>
<br/>
2 DS (or DSL) systems - $130 apiece - $260
<br/>
1 Game Pak - pricing unknown - $30 I'm guessing
<br/>
Total - $290
<br/>
<br/>
Sources were Lik-Sang and the online stores for EBGames, Best Buy, and Circuit City.
<br/>
<br/>
Even if the game cartridge prices vary slightly, going with the GBA is still more affordable than the DS way.  Then again, this is assuming that you buy each system new, by itself, online.  If you get them used or at a store that's having a sale or whatever, then it's anyone's guess what the better deal is.  Personally I think that spending over $200 just to play a single game with someone else is rather ridiculous anyway.  It would be better to get some of the items used or on sale.
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, the game might not ever be ported to the DS anyway, so I'm not even sure why I'm arguing this.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Huh, that's funny. In SNESDS, assuming you get the game to run (it works like one in 50 times; keep loading other games, resetting etc) it does the opposite.

It's the exact same demo as the one from NPC, just translated into English, but like the NPC one, it's single-player only.  So yeah, there's no single-pak multiplayer.

The Gamecube version of Panel de Pon (found in <a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamestats.com/objects/496/496567/" target="_blank">Nintendo Puzzle Collection</a>) has 4-player support and it's very good, though not as good as 2-player.
<br/>
<br/>
The color of the blocks in the last step of a chain determines who gets the garbage. So if the last step consists of hearts, the red player gets the garbage. The problem is that YOU could be the red player and you end up sending garbage to yourself, so you need to watch out.
<br/>
<br/>
In the case of a combo, the garbage is sent to each player with corresponding colors.
<br/>
<br/>
If no player is playing the particular color the garbage is sent to a random player other than you.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
