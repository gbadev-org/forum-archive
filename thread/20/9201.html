I open MoonShell on a SuperCard. I select "Luminesweeper.gba". I expect the file to be copied from the CF card into the SuperCard's RAM and then the system to be restarted in GBA mode.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

tepples,
<br/>
just so you know,
<br/>
.DSQ is roms :P,
<br/>
after you patch the rom with supercard's program it gives you a .DSQ and a .sav lol<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">In order for it to work (on the GBAMP at least), it would need to store the path in an agreed place.

Restart, then the GBAMP's firmware detects a flag somewhere saying "autoload", then it goes to where the path is and auto-loads that Rom just as if it was loading it from its own file menus.
<br/>
<br/>
Should all be possible, but requires the GBAMP firmware to be changed. (as well as a plug-in for moon shell)

For a GBA to truly work in DS mode, I think we effectively need a GBA emulator :-/</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Chishm would just need to add "boot_mp.gba" support back to flashmp in order for something like that to work.
<br/>
Boot_mp.gba could be automatically generated by moonshell as part of the loading process, where it would delete itself, then try to load another program, possibly passing arguments (such as filenames) to programs.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

But if its actualy createing a file on the card, only to delete it...isnt that a bit bad practice for FC programeing?

(seeing as they have limited Read/Writes and all)

Personally, I'd like to know if it's possible to launch into DS mode and Moonshell from GBA mode on a GBAMP or SCSD. Or to be able to "quit" homebrew apps and relaunch Moonshell, although I don't know if that's even possible.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
