For WEP, I assume you mean your router. Consult the manual if so. That's probably what you mean. You shouldn't need the dongle, unless you want better security, or if the router won't work right with DS/Wii. You should always go with a router, unless you can't for some reason.

You need a WEP key to put a new computer on the network anyway. Why would asking for the WEP key for a DS be any weirder than asking for the WEP key for, say, a laptop?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

All routers use a web page for configuring settings.(Like setting/retrieving WEP)
<br/>
The only way to access this, is to know the router ip, and the user name and
<br/>
password.
<br/>
You might be able to find WEP, if you dig around in Network Connections.
<br/>
(I don't know if this will work; The only hands-on experience I had with
<br/>
networking was with these ASUS drivers. That didn't work out and now I'm hunting for a WiFi device for SoftAP)
<br/>
<br/>
You might need to tweak some settings on the router to get DS/Wii to work
<br/>
with it, if those settings aren't set correctly already.(Like transmit rate, and 802.11 b standard)
<br/>
<br/>
You're going to need this connector, or a SoftAP if the router won't work with DS/Wii.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
