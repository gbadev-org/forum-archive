<br/>
I wont to know if this engine really exist or is only a fake; there aren' t any file, but some photos(and it can be faked).
<br/>
sample:

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I don't think it's fake. After reading through his well writen updates and their corresponding images, I was led to believe that this project actually exists and is well on it's way to completion( I hope, oh I so dearly hope)
<br/>
I think that everything shown in those images are things that are actually possible on the ds - even considering the ds's hardware "limits" - I wouldn't think it's fake.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's the old FF7 demo.
<br/>
Someone was converting it to run on DS (providing you owned the game and so could extract the music, FMV's and etc).
<br/>
There was a thread about it somewhere.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its not fake. I haven't seen it in person, but I saw the site a while ago and the progress looks real. Also, the developer has made no attempt to promote the demo the way they do if it was a publicity stunt. Also, if you read the text the dude sounds like he knows what he is talking about. I think if it were fake he probably would have released a "video" of him playing FFVII on the DS rather than the modest progress updates hes got on the site. Although if the project was running that good it would make sense for him to at least release a demo so we could test it out.  I guess we'll just have to wait to find out.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cybereality.com" target="_blank">// cybereality</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">That's no fake, really. He makes no claims of a true game running, just models rotating around, which anyone can do with the currently avaliable homebrew tools. If you follow the links on his site, you'll find countless tools (with source code) and documentations on the FF7 various formats (models, textures, text and etcetera).
<br/>
<br/>
He said himeself he would not release any sort of demo for a while, since that would require him to include the art assets (if you read it all, you'll see it doesn't load the original art assets directly, but custom formats that were converted from the original assets).  That would quickly draw Square-Enix wrath upon him.
<br/>
<br/>
Also the process of getting the models textures and other stuff in there is far from automatic right now, so it's a long way until he can put together some sort of tool that can read the original assets and spit out a .nds file.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Woah... that's amazing.
<br/>
Some of that graphics tech he's pulling off looks better than some full commercial DS games!
<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo should pay him. But only after he releases it to the community :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just remade about 5 or 6 mods for MikMod DS for this project.. he's writing a hardware sound driver to output all 16 channels through the hardware channels..
<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
In general, SylphDS is sort of an 3D RPG engine for the DS that he's creating. The FF7 assets are mearly examples that will be included with his engine. People will be able to make their own 3D, FF-style RPGs with this thing. It's gonna be great.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
