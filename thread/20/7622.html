A 200k binary of which around 200bytes are non zero.

Hardly likely to do much of anything other than send people looking for whatever ezloader cards might be.

It's this file

with 9 bytes removed which means it won't do anything since the offsets in the file have changed, effectively turning it into a bunch of random numbers.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

as far as I understood it was supposed give wpa support to nintendo wifi; I heard about it in this thread:

There's an old proverb about higher powers helping them who help themselves. Since the big N won't help us, we have no choice but to add the necessary security ourselves.
<br/>
<br/>
To that end, the first release of the WPA DS Porject is available for download now. It will only load from an EZ-Loader flash reader (more on this in a second) but support for the M3 and the Supercard is coming. It provides WPA with automatic detection and switching for AES / TKIP. WPA2 is not in the development scope at this time.
<br/>
<br/>
You can download the update here: The WPA DS Project. Apologies for the skeletal nature of the website, but at this juncture I thought that getting the code out was more important than writing the FAQ. I will flesh things out as we go. Also, the development list for future builds is being worked on now, so if you have any ideas make sure you drop me a line at the web site.
<br/>
<br/>
Note about loading: This writes to the non-protected part of the DS memory, and loads in PASS mode, so you dont need to void your warranty by peeling off the sticker covering the SL1 jumper. 
<br/>
<br/>
Note about stability: This is an alpha release and if installing this bricks your DS, it's no my fault. That said, since your SL1 sticker is still in place, you will probably be able to get your DS replaced. But there are no guarantees - I don't know how closely Nintnedo will look at the guts of a "defective" unit.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">From what he's saying, he says that is supposedly writes to the firmware?  That would point it out as a hoax right there since there isn't an IP stack or anything like that stored into the DS's firmware.  I assume this is supposed to be for the "Nintendo WiFi Connection" since local NiFi needs to be concerned only with other DS's?<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
