    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hey Guys
<br/>
<br/>
Im the leader of a Mod Team (Who i will not mention, so this cant be misconstrued for ad-spam)
<br/>
<br/>
One thing ive been pondering doing for a while, is making some DS Games made for download-to-flashcart
<br/>
<br/>
If games were to be made, with support for all the popular flashcarts (Via DLDI and custom patches if needed), Professional quality graphics&amp; Design, game balance love that could only come from somebody obsessed (heh) and Online play built in (We have a dedicated server already)
<br/>
<br/>
All priced at something like ?6($12), bought online and downloaded there and then
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
do you think the community of flashcart owners would actually go for it, or are most owners only interested in Free/homebrew/Open source projects rather than any kind of pay-for project?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(The reason for charging would be to give incentive to put a lot more effort and polish in, we arnt planning to live off of it)- We would donate 10% of the proceeds towards the people who made the tools we use (aka devkit) - we arnt leeches
<br/>
<br/>
And when we finish supporting a game (3 years or so, depending), we'll open up the source
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Feedback is very much appreciated , Cheers
<br/>

I wouldn't mind paying 12$ for a game download, especially if it had nice online play with a dedicated server too. But of course this all depends on the game, I wouldn't buy it for charity, it would have to be a good game ;)
<br/>
<br/>
If a demo was provided it would help a lot too, and I like the idea of donating to the devkit/lib maintainers.
<br/>
<br/>
So overall I think its a great idea, but here's the question, what sort of game are you guys planning on making? I was thinking an FPS would be good, or maybe a fighting game similar to SSB. Maybe you should come up with a list, and make a poll so we can all decide.<br/>_________________<br/>If I use a term wrong or something then feel free to correct, I?m not much of a programmer.

Well at the moment we have a Brawler in development, which borrows a lot of elements from a game called "Psychic Force 2" from the PS1 Era

This is what i do fear
<br/>
<br/>
The main selling point would be the online play, which would use a CD-Key for verification (the CD key would be sent via email, seperate from the ROM)
<br/>
<br/>
i guess it would be foolish to assume that pirates would not pirate a commercial cheap pirate game, even if it costs penuts. even if its stealing from charity!

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I personally would pay ?6 for a game if it was good enough, there have been scene/commercial games released like this for the Dreamcast like Feet of Fury that have been well received. There's certainly a hardcore following that would support the release anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
The problem is the userbase of Flashcards does consist of mainly people who are well versed in the ways of piracy and the file itself will be by nature easy to share. I'm sure you've considered all of this anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the way to guarantee at least covering the costs for artists etc is to do a pre-order when you're close to completion, that way you can at least guarantee a certain amount of income before the warez kiddies get hold of it.

I want to buy everything ver download, basicaly, and I want my money to go to the creators with as little middle men between as possible.

I hold no value for physical mediums whatsoever, when I buy something I buy the <span style="font-style: italic">content</span>...or, more specificaly, the legal and moral right to use it.

I know I am in the minority, but think its the way forward.

Why should we, as a species,waste resources making physical objects to store and transport what is really nothing but data?

<br/>
That said.
<br/>
I think your best option is having a "donate" style button right next to the download. Make it easy for people that enjoy it to give you money.

People will always pirate, so your appealing to those that are moral and value your work, however you distribute it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Because some Internet users are "more equal" than others. Particularly in rural areas, each two-hour session might only allow the transfer of 24 MB of data.

but i agree in principle, content would be better with choice

TBH im suprised somebody else hasnt jumped on it, like you said, almost every NDS dev would jump at it, i'm sure it cant be hard to make.

could make the cart require a custom patch for code, and at least try to make it as unfreindly to backups (to prevent piracy) as possible

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think freely available demos would be a necessity for this idea to get off the ground.  Not only is someone more willing to part with their money if they can play the game first (assuming the game is good, that is), but you also generate more general interest that way, too.
<br/>
<br/>
I think basically, you'd want to follow the same model as the old shareware PC games from Apogee and the like.
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, though, I hope the cheap slot-1 card thing works out eventually.  I don't know how I feel about these ones KeithE has gotten ahold of.  I definitely don't like that they require a NeoFlah NEO2 in order to write them and they sort of sound expensive for the size anyway.  It has to be possible to get even larger capacity cards for cheaper than $15 each the way memory prices are these days.

Well the Game will come with two Roms, a game rom, and a server client
<br/>
<br/>
You and all the other players will be in the various rooms (which will have an IRC type chat client), you can see what games other players have (we wont stop at one after all ;) ) , and can challange players to a 1v1 of your game choice
<br/>
<br/>
there is also a play now option, with tickboxes (allowing you to choose what you want to play) , when you select this, you will be randomly pitted against anouther player with a common play now game
<br/>
<br/>
Upon choosing a game to boot by either method, the Server will save the details to a config file, and boot the game up (which upon seeing the config file, will read it and you know the rest ;) )
<br/>
<br/>
But now i've said too much ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for a Niche in a Niche in a Niche, i'd hardly call handheld gamers a niche (more DS's worldwide than 360's, PS3's and Wii's combines, in fact about twice as many as all combined)
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say its a niche in a niche (Flashcart owners, and ones who arnt dirty pirates :P)

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My suggestion: Make the game freely downloadable and sell a version that ships on a slot-1 card, with professional covers, booklet, perhaps some extras etc. with a price that covers the manufacturing process and shipping fees. As mentioned in this thread lot of times, flash card adapter owners in general are easily pirating games, and an indie game isn't any different to a big / commercial game project when it comes to that. On the other hand, CD keys and any kind of copy protection methods will piss of regular users (like me :).
<br/>
<br/>
Call me old-fashioned, but I still tend to buy CD's/DVD's/LP's if there's quality behind it. And I believe there's other people out there who also want to spend money on something tangible. I have also something like 20 games for DS standing in the bookshelf - wouldn't mind if that collection included some good quality indie games as well. Not to mention that by offering physical copy of a game to purchase, you'd have much more wider target audience. Over 40 million people have DS these days, but only few go for a flash adapter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <h4>#129637 - Lynx - Thu May 24, 2007 2:23 pm</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">And requiring a key or other copy protection just creates a goal for someone to crack.  Lots of software is pirated even with a key/copy protection.  If you did go that route, I'd say use the MAC style just to see how long it takes for somone to bypass it.  
<br/>
<br/>
As for providing media, it would open your market up to everyone with a DS.  I agree, making it available for free to flash cart owners might be enough to keep the servers full so that paying customers aren't pissed because they bought a game with noone to play with.
<br/>
<br/>
So, if you plan on taking it serious, you'll need to make the investment and provide it on media.  But, expect to spend at least $2,500 on the initial cards, programmer, cases, labels, booklet, etc for 100 cards.  Maybe more.  And because it would be a startup, you have to expect to spend more on the initial 100 then what it cost to keep it going.  So, you might only be able to make $5 profit from the first 100, but then more profit for the rest.  Of course, the larger quantities you purchase, the more profit you can make, but the more risk you take.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

4 Swords in terms of play mechcanics is half way between zelda and bomberman, but the landscapes have to be big and designed well enough to work with varying numbers of players.

Zelda has a lot too it, the items effecting both players and landscapes in various ways. Trying to outdo it in depth of play would be quite hard indeed.

Then you could do it now.  Buy the hardware and start burning slot-1 cards now.  With that kind of budget, I'm sure you could get the cards even cheaper than anyone here would be able to, as you could buy 1,000 instead of just 100.</span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

Lets take Amplituds  for example.

The developer could release the source, a few levels, etc no problem.

People who really enjoy the game could "buy" it, for maybe $5 or something, and in turn they get bonus content (more levels and worlds).

Both sides win. The program is still free, still open source, and people who really enjoy it can shell out a few bucks for some more action. People who don't enjoy it didn't loose anything for checking it out.

Will people "pirate" it? Yes. Would people who were going to pirate it have payed for it if they couldn't? Probably not. Does a profit really matter? I don't think so.

Profit isnt the driving factor, if it was i would be chasing publishers, no its more the maintinance of the online servers, and just more incentive to put a lot more polish in, although i may release the online brawler for free period, its a lot less work than we invisioned, and the server Useage is negligable for online play</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I think its a bit like online video.
<br/>
On the surface it seems unlikely that people will pay for video online when they can download it, go on tv-links, or acquirer it in some other illega way.
<br/>
<br/>
However, theres lots of people that ARE saleing videos on line and making a lot of money from it. If the price is right,and its convenient people will pay happily.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently I'm keeping my eye on;
<br/>
<a href="http://sanctuaryforall.com" target="_blank">http://sanctuaryforall.com</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Which is a online sci-fi staring Amada Tapping made by some of the team that did Stargate.
<br/>
<br/>
They offer the first 4 episodes free on sites like Veoh, with the eppisodes being roughly ?1 after that. (downloads in better quality too)
<br/>
<br/>
All there videos are completely DRM free. They have made a specific point about this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, the market for games online is obviously less, let alone homebrew DS games.
<br/>
But I think the same principle applys.
<br/>
<br/>
Give people a sample, let them pay in a convenient fashion for more, and dont bother at all with any DRM or protection.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been toying with the idea of putting Ads into the game
<br/>
<br/>
It would go down like this:
<br/>
You play the game singleplayer, no Ads, nothing.
<br/>
You go to play online- Ads are downloaded from the server, and shown as a loading screen while you connect to the server, prehaps shown for 3 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
You use the multiplayer client, and find a player to play against
<br/>
again, a different Ad is shown for 3 seconds
<br/>
<br/>
and when you finish your match, a Third Ad is shown for 3 seconds as you load the Multiplayer client again
<br/>
<br/>
You'd have loading times anyway, so its not going to interfere
<br/>
<br/>
Been playing with it, and could release the game for free and cover costs, but i wouldnt be prepared to release the source- Some gremlin would remove the Ads to prove a personal point, and ofc, nobody would bother trying to advertise</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Nothing wrong with a MAC-address hash based CD key.  If you want something more elaborate:
<br/>
<br/>
1) Create a database of valid keys
<br/>
2) They can be algorithmic, it doesn't matter if someone hacks up a keygen, because you...
<br/>
3) Only activate a key once you've made a sale.  Don't activate them in order of your generating algorithm though.  Also make it so possible keys from the generating algorithm &gt;&gt;&gt; keys that actually get activated, so a keygenner will never stumble upon an activated key.
<br/>
4) When someone tries to go online, verify that their key is valid and activated.  Also, check if someone else with that key is online.  If so, deny access.

Another example of a game that does allow keygenned keys to work online, is any of the battle.net games by blizzard.  The key generation routine is something more complex that only blizzard has, (and is used as verification on the battle.net servers.)   Now, the key verification that is done client side is far simpler.  This results in a keygen being made, but the keygen will almost NEVER stumble upon a valid online battle.net key by chance.
<br/>
<br/>
Another good example, in fact,  is Microsoft's Windows Genuine Advantage.   For a good while,  at some point after a keygen had been made for XP/2003 VLK keys, about a year later.  (The keygen I am referring to is one that generates one key after another instantly, not the one that takes 10 minutes or more.)   What more or less happens, is that the product key stores the 3-7 product ID,  a 32 bit number, and a signature that validates the key with the product.   Now,  XP/2003/any other microsoft product will take any key in certain product ID ranges, regardless of what that 32 bit number is.  However,  microsoft, and only microsoft, has the algorithm that correctly generates the 32 bit number for the 3-7 product ID,  and without the correct 32bit number, the key does NOT pass genuine advantage,  even though it will allow windows xp to be correctly installed otherwise.
<br/>
<br/>
So,  make 2 algorithms.  The first one just validates the key client side, and is easily reverse engineered client side.   The second algorithm made, is used server side for issuing the keys itself.  That algorithm is much stricter than the client side algorithm.  On the other hand, any key generated as valid for server side algorithm will also pass 100% of the time on the client side algorithm.
<br/>
<br/>
An example would be client side.   Add each odd digit to a total.  Multiply every even digit by 2, and add to total.  Sum of all digits will be divisible by 10.
<br/>
<br/>
Server side could be follow client side, except that the total of everything but the last digit will be evenly divisible by 13.  Since the client side will not validate this,  there is no way to know that the key is not valid till the client tries to connect to the server with it.  (Server side validates the mod 13 without the last digit,  then validates mod 10 including last digit.)
<br/>
<br/>
Example.
<br/>
8904235907796 will pass both client side of mod 10, and server of mod 13.  The next key in sequence, 8904235907895 will not pass server side, but will still pass client side.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
