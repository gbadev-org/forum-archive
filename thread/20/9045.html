I second that. They even cross-ship.

I've found the small flathead screwdriver on some models of Leatherman multitool fit the tri-wing perfectly, and is -just- strong enough that if you torque it right, you can loosen the screws without snapping the tip.
<br/>
<br/>
Not that I recommend this or anything, since if you torque it wrong, it snaps, and then you have a chunk of stainless steel in your screw.
<br/>
<br/>
Whoops.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My warranty expired in December. :-( I guess if I can't fix it, I might just send it to them, but I wouldn't doubt they'd reflash it. If they did, then the cost of the repair, a PassMe2 and a flash cart (I have GBAMP) would probably outweigh the cost of buying an old-firmware DS on eBay.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I'm right there with you, though.  In that case, I can't think of a good reason not to open it up!  I probably would if mine broke.  Besides, even if you did send it in, the non-warranty repair is $75 regardless of what you do to it!  &gt;=D
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would guess that as long as you're pretty careful, and don't have any <a class="postlink" href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=8262&amp;start=0" target="_blank">accidents (I know you've probably already seen tssf's thread, here)</a> you'll be okay?

HEY my DS works and it's got a cool new shell.. ;)

You can't say you haven't thought about ripping your DS apart, especially if you can't get something to work with it. :D<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

You can't buy it in any hardware stores, your best bet is to order it from eBay, and hope someone's got it cheap.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
