not sure if anyone here actually has any interest in attempting a port of this remarkable engine (or for that matter if it is even possible), but I definitely enjoyed playing heretic and hexen for a couple of minutes so I figured "why not, maybe someone in DSdev will be interested in this..."
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am behind the times though too, not sure if they released source before this beta or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Uhm... No. If you want to port this, you will have to leave so many features out, it's easier to start making your own.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Q3 is several magnitudes more complex and feature-rich than Q1, and has somewhere in the area of 500mb in assets. It could be possible if you basically remade Q3 with DS assets in mind, but a direct port isn't going to happen.
<br/>
<br/>
On a fairly unrelated note, I had some fun with Q3 last night myself.

The Q3 renderer is more complex and structured more around the capabilities of Quake 3, in particular the shader system. Moving all of your geometry into a tess buffer and manipulating it further in software before offloading it to hardware is definitely not something you'd want to do in a Quake DS port, to give one of many possible examples.

The PSP has 32 MB's of system ram and it has 4 MB's of embeded dram which is dedicated VRAM.
<br/>

That's according to the little brochures Sony has distributed to stores for advertising the 1st setember australian release.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There is more than one Q3 port to psp happening as we speak.
<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the PSP ram: of the 32 megs total, 8 is reserved by the OS, of which 4 can <span style="font-style: italic">temporarily</span> be reclaimed (So, 28 megs ram free is the best case scenario with the OS)
<br/>

A port comparable to the DC version should be reasonably possible, but it might yet take take quite a bit of work.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Edit:  It looks like these were the original specs, from back when the system was announced.  I must've read them THEN and took them to heart.  Still, no real interest in it.  I'm not saying it's not an impressive piece of hardware, but all of it's attributes seem so superficial.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Its quite amazing that the PSP is pretty much a portable PS2, when its running at full-speed.  I have heard people say its actually MORE powerful at full-speed, though that will remain to be seen.
<br/>
<br/>
However the number of people with cracked screens may mean it never does that well. :-(
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to get nearly 2 weeks out of mine before it stopped turning on.  I sent it back for repair and they refused to repair it claiming the screen was cracked.  Alas it DOES now turn on with a big crack in the screen, but im rather dubious seeing as it wouldnt even turn on when I sent it back.
<br/>
<br/>
If I do not get it replaced then I aint buying another.  I will just have to snuggle up to my DS which I might add has been dropped onto a concrete floor and didnt get a scratch from it.  Now THATS how you build a portable console.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://csdclubs.com/club?cid=15" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://csdprojects.co.uk/banners/linuxusers.png">[Images not permitted - Click here to view it]</a>

Are you unsure if Valve will release the Half-Life engine, or <span style="font-style: italic">have</span> released it?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Definately not.  Even if the HL engine is BASED on the Quake engine, doesn't mean they are all that similar.  All you could make is a HL clone that used HL's resources (textures, models, maps, etc).  However, it is a possible project on an official basis.  Though publishing might be a problem with Valve's current policies, and the more likely platform would be the PSP.  If there is enough vocal demand for a portable HL, there will probably be one.  Otherwise, you'll just jave to get cracking on that HL clone, or settle for Metroid.
<br/>
<br/>
Unless, of course, Valve released the old engine's source, which COULD happen at some point.  I'd say the most likely time for that would be in 2008: the ten year anniversary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
