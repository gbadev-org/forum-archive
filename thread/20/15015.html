    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've got a slot2 M3 lite perfect
<br/>
<br/>
in the Extend app, it will play .dsm movies
<br/>
<br/>
I've been able to download some sample japanese music vids, and they look and sound great.  at least as good as dpg
<br/>
<br/>
I found the M3 GBalpha NDS Converter, and it transcodes very quickly, but I've never actually been able to produce a video that my M3 will play
<br/>
<br/>
dsmenc produces an insanely large file that I couldn't even fit on my 1gb card (the source was 350mb, and it ended up at 1.32 Gb )
<br/>
<br/>
has anyone been able to encode a working .dsm for themselves?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSM files are very large by nature due to its lossless compression, so try it with a source video much smaller.

If you're worried about space, use DPG instead.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the GBalpha converter produces a 110mb file, compared to the 99ish of DPG
<br/>
<br/>
but, I can't play it (despite the m3 extend being branded as dsm certified)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong in the conversion, the player is hooped, or what</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Was that DSM, or DMV?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

-- Who?

-- You know, the human.

DSM files should indeed be very large as dantheman pointed out, so if the GBAlpha converter is producing small files that won't play, my first theory would be that the GBAlpha DSM converter is broken.

<br/>
the file it produced was a very reasonable 110ish MB, compared to the dsmenc by moonlight @ 1.3+GB</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Two different formats called "DSM". The M3 format is rather old and closely related to DPG. The creator of BatchDPG actually looked into it but never produced anything.
<br/>
<br/>
Moonlight's DSM is a lossless format created much later and is completely different than the M3's DSM.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
