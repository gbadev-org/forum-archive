    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">"Lacks an ID3 tag" is just a warning message that should not affect playback. MP3 files can store the title and artist of a recording in a data structure; if that data structure is not present, MoonShell cannot display the title. Try waiting a few seconds, try seeking, try turning up the DS's volume (next to SLOT-2 on the Control Pad side), try turning up MoonShell's volume (press X).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
