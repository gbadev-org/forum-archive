    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have recently gotten a japanese graphite DS. While making sure that it was ok I noticed that when I turn the power off, the touch pad will retain the display and fade out. My american DS does not do this and the screen goes black right away. Another thing is that the graphite one's thouch pad also seems to flicker ever so slightly on the black noticed that pop up in the DS menu.  I am wondering if anyone else has encountered things like this, and/or if it seems like it might be a defect warranting a return or not.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My US NDS does this...I called Nintendo to make sure it was ok and they said that some units just do that and it's no reason to be concerned.  I've not had a problem yet (and I've had my DS for some time now), so I don't think you need to worry.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

My US GBA (non-SP) has always done that. IIRC, I think my original GameBoy, GameGear, and TI-86 do it too. Seems to be common for handheld devices.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://blog.dev-scene.com/abscissa/" target="_blank">Useless Rants</a> a.k.a.
