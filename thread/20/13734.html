    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A while back, there was a request for people who were willing to help out with LiraNuna's latest project: Tales of Dagur 2. Due to staff shortages (not unrelated to it being summer time and vacation), LiraNuna is looking for more people to help out. The team really needs more coders and people who easily understand how to make scripts given an example script. 
<br/>
<br/>
To give you a taste of the upcoming Tales of Dagur 2, which hopefully will get you guys more excited, LiraNuna posted some concept art images on his website and announced the battle engine for the new RPG entering in the upcoming NeoFlash competition. It'll be called Tales of Dagur: Coliseum.
<br/>
Follow the link below for the concept art and the post itself:

<br/>
Now, to close off this topic, let me "quickly" tell you why I posted this here, and why Tales of Dagur 2 is a great project to work on.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been working with LiraNuna with coding the battle engine, which will be an active battle engine like Tales of Eternia and the likes. Meaning the battle engine is more like a fighter game than the Final Fantasy RPGs most of you know. This brings a fast-paced, fun gameplay along with it.
<br/>
The idea for creating such an engine (for homebrew) caught my attention and that's not where the ambition stopped though. The attacks and moves in the battle engine will use scripts. Meaning it will be easy to add attacks for people who can't code, using scripts. Plus, the animations are loaded in with an animated GIF loading system. In short, if you're a serious coder and would like to try your hand at an ambitious, large scale project, contact LiraNuna or reply to this topic and - like myself - you might learn a few tricks and implementation ideas.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><a class="postlink" href="http://amplituds.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">AmplituDS website</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">ToD:C really needs help, especially on the coding department.
<br/>
We got some talented people working on story, music and graphics, and since I am a single coder (DarkEz is away for the next two weeks), and this isn't a simple project to work on, we are mostly interested in programmers.
<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to contribute, please consider contacting me in any way.
<br/>
<br/>
Please note that this is a large scale project, and may intimidate novice programmers. Also remember that the LMBS is just a small part of the main RPG engine.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,
