What homebrew possibilities do you think this will have? 
<br/>
<br/>
Alot of people have been hoping for this for a while. I must say,it looks much more convenient than the PSP one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Id probably have a 8GB SD in my DS by the time this comes to the UK...thats enough for, like, a minute :p
<br/>
(assumeing an 8GB works, 4GB works fine in the gbamp).

More practicaly, however, would just be a generic still cam in as high quality as possible.
<br/>
So we can use it with DS Drawing app's seamlessly.

Frankly, its crazy Nintendo are releaseing this "Face Training" rather then Mario Paint, which would work great with the camera.

(Mario Paint being just as much a "non-game")<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

In Mario Paint, Nintendo would be expected to allow exchanging paint documents with other people over Wi-Fi. But it's also likely that griefers will make AO-rated drawings and send them to E10+-rated kids, or that AO-rated paedos will ask E10+-rated kids for their name, home address, and phone number. The risk is much greater in Mario Paint than, say, Animal Crossing, because you can fit a lot more into a 256x176 pixel texture than into a set of eight 32x32 pixel textures.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Like all other games that allow communication between players via the internet, Nintendo could (would) just disable the communication feature unless you have each other's friend codes.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

That's likely not enough. The friend-code-only game <span style="font-style: italic">Animal Crossing: Wild World</span> censors communication even between friends.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Metroid Prime: Hunters has both voice and text chat between friends. So do Pokemon Diamond and Pearl versions.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

A fairly low res image can probably be processed for basic "twist" rotational info, but you wouldnt have much power left over to actualy DO anything with it :p<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --
