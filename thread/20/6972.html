We're not interoperating. He wants a server. Pictochat is P2P. So the only way to implement this client side is to pull up a hex editor and start hacking a way at the firmware binary.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Picochat seems to use different wifi-channels for the picochat rooms.
<br/>
<br/>
room A is on channel 1
<br/>
room B is on channel 7
<br/>
room C is on channel 13
<br/>
room D seems to be on channel 7 again.
<br/>
<br/>
those numbers might be wrong since here channels 6 and 11 are full of WIFI signals, and i did run a "statistical" check only.
<br/>
<br/>
I have recorded some packet dumps.  It's a "assoiciation request" sent out by the DS when in picochat room A. I can partially figure out what the message means, but not enough to assemble the "assoiciation response".
<br/>
<br/>
The dump:
<br/>
80000000ffffffffffff0009bfb9891c0009bfb9891c1013c6e04f03000000006600210001028284030101 05050102000000dd200009bf000a000000010000000000000012000801c000c00048233d3b000104004dee85fa
<br/>
<br/>
first is framecontrol+duration (80000000), then the broadcast mac (ffffffffffff), then the DS mac (0009bfb9891c) twice, then the sequence (6e04). last bytes (04dee85fa) are the crc32 checksum. Could not figure out things after sequence.
<br/>
<br/>
A dump of 2 DS actually exchanging messages would be great. Soft for dump (PC, linksys card) is available.
<br/>
<br/>
I Think tunnelling picochat would be possible. What i need is a second DS and a second PC with linksys card. I dont have to understand the messages in tunneling !
<br/>
<br/>
Is there someone with the equipment (PC + linksys card + DS + internet)willing to try this out?</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by paco1234 on Tue Nov 22, 2005 4:49 pm; edited 2 times in total</span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
Its not the "real use", it's about finding out how it works. 
<br/>
<br/>
btw: 
<br/>
the assoc messages are understood, since wifi download works well. But i could not find any doc or source for it.
<br/>
<br/>
Since the DS will only send out picochat msg when associated, i will have to buy another DS or understand how to emulate it. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am able to fake the assoc request stuff (change mac and crc), the fake will show in the picochat room selection, but as soon as i enter the room the fake disappears.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
