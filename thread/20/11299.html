    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I started this thread because of the discussion that took over ThaKilla's DS Blue app thread.
<br/>
<br/>
So.. now, being "on topic"..
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter if the programmers are getting paid or not, competition is still a good thing.  It works with pretty much everything.  If people were just making these programs for themselves, why would they release it at all?  Well, because they want to share their hard work.  Well, they also like to get recognition for the hard work they have done.  So, if there are two apps that do the same job.. wouldn't you want your app to be the "better" app?  Wouldn't that push you a little harder?
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm way off base, but I believe that a lot of people release homebrew with recognition in mind.  Look what I can do.. check out how awesome my app/game is..  How many game makers actually spend as much time playing their game as they did creating it?  I'm sure not many.  And they don't just do it to learn, or they wouldn't release the game/app at all, as what does the rest of us care what they have learned?
<br/>
<br/>
Just as I feel good when you google 'ds homebrew' and my site comes up at the top (I don't get paid from it), they feel good about us praising their hard work.
<br/>

If you never release your game, how do you know if it's any good?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's all sorts of competition.
<br/>
Friendly competition is great, and KDE vs. Gnome is fine, since they can learn from each other due to the whole open source thing.
<br/>
<br/>
I felt kind of bad recently because I had started developing something amazing (excuse my complete lack of modesty) to build on the concepts in Toribash, but it eventually shaped up to be its own unique idea with nothing at all in common with Toribash.
<br/>
Without the initial urge to compete, OpenWorlds (the first in a long line of do-it-yourself software) would never have happened in the ideal future :)
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's up to the developers in the end.
<br/>
Competition is both good and bad, and in my opinion it is best if both programs find their own place. It prevents disappointment on both ends and it can spark the imagination.
<br/>
DSBlue vs. DSOrganize... well, we'll just have to wait and see.
<br/>
<br/>
I like them both, so in the ideal world I'd like to see all their strengths combined into one but I realize that can be difficult.
<br/>
Over here, though, it's not really competition as much as it is just two people building neat software and seeing what they can do with it. The only real competition is in my decision for which one I will use for my calendar once DSBlue is cleaned up :P<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Seriously, homebrew development is mostly done by hobbyists that enjoy the freedom they get creating something useful. The word 'freedom' is the key of that sentence. Co-operation takes away the freedom and brings in a lot of obligations and deadlines. It's often much <span style="font-weight: bold">easier</span> to work alone, in the developers point of view.

Something that would allow someone to start a project.. they can activelly work on it while collaborating with anyone else whom is interested.
<br/>
<br/>
Developers sometimes like to work alone but letting people jump in with updates here and there.. continue working on older/dumped projects.

Even the ones that have released source, didn't save the project, or show any continuation.  I wish people would stop saying "releasing the source will allow a project to continue" as it just isn't true.  Sure, if the community is lucky, someone might pick up the project and continue it, but I believe if you research, there is a lot more released source projects that have died then that have stayed alive.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ndshb.com" target="_blank">NDS Homebrew Roms &amp; Reviews</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, open sourcecode isnt the answere, it merely helps a lot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Imo, co-operation is a must now for us too truely start to push the potential applications for the DS hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The first thing we need to do is establish standards. 
<br/>
To help applications to work together and provide a more seamless expirence.
<br/>
<br/>
Random ideas:
<br/>
<br/>
*standard folders? (/data ect)
<br/>
<br/>
*standard Ram usage?
<br/>
<br/>
--for exchanging a file path?  (so a Rom could trigger an emulator to load, then the emulator to automaticaly load the rom)
<br/>
--standard clipboard? 
<br/>
--exchange of playlist/music info.  (ok, crazy idea here, but maybe if your playing music in one app, it could pass the track name and position over too another app you run to give the illusion of multi-tasking)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* Plugins   (allready partly done with moonshell)
<br/>
<br/>
-- Letting apps decode/play music easily.  (so anyone makeing a game could just use an Ogg without worrying too much)
<br/>
-- Decodeing image formats.
<br/>
-- Retrieveing web data.  (ie, something that takes info from a url and dumps it in ram....a generic plugin like this would be usefull to lots of people no? )
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are just random ideas, they could all be worthless, but I still am very strongly for the principle of working together, and reusing as much code and resources as possible.
<br/>
If nothing else, it would give us a bit more space on our flash cards ;)<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I think if someone is interested in restarting a project, they can contact the original author. Open source would make it slightly easier, but I agree for most homebrew stuff, being open source doesn't really make too much of a difference.

Besides co-operation doesn't always have to be working in a team, it can also be sharing of information and codebits with each other. 
<br/>
<br/>
Homebrew devs are not slaves of "Homebrew Lord" or employees of "HomebrewSoft Ltd." You have to understand that sometimes, to you it might seem like we're reinventing the wheel, but actually, we have a lot of personal FUN while we do that. We learn much about the system and how to code the best solution (I belive this is the main point to handheld homebrew). If you tell us to co-operate and leave some interesting stuff to others, then it will take away the fun.

Let us be.

<br/>
They were an example of the sort of things that could be agreed apon, not a dictation of what has to be.
<br/>
I hoped to start a discusion on what would be good ideas as standards to establish.
<br/>
<br/>
Purhapes we could even come up with common code people should put in their apps if they wish.  (Eg, "<span style="font-style: italic">Standard Standby Code</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic">Standard Return to Multiboot</span>" ).   
<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice for the lesser-skilled (like me) to have these sorts of things.
<br/>
I also think, a heck of a low of homebrewers would start to use these things if they are easy and no dissadvantages. 
<br/>
I dont think many developers have intentional thought <span style="font-style: italic">"no a standby would not be a good idea in my app"</span>.
<br/>
Its more a case, imo, of "I dont have time to look up/work out how to get a good standby..its not a fun thing to do".

<br/>
<br/>
Which was my point.
<br/>
I dont expect all projects to be made by a team, but I do expect people to help and share information a lot more then is now.
<br/>
People arnt not shareing stuff because they dont want too, its more because theres no organised, easy, way too do it.
<br/>
<br/>
People dont have the *option* of conforming to standards or to share ideas, or too reuse resources, because no one has sat down and discused it.
<br/>
If some standards are discused and agreed it dosnt mean every one has too 100% conform too it.
<br/>
It merely means its there for those that do wish too participate.
<br/>
<br/>
It also means people that cant donate much time (like me) can still build apon the work of others and contribute something. 
<br/>
<br/>
In many ways having a few standards, and starting to work towards plugins means a lot more can be done by individuals.
<br/>
<br/>
If you dont want co-operation, thats fine, but I dont see any point in argueing against it. If you dont believe you would ever use homebrew standards, then it dosnt make any difference too you anyway.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

I agree with this. This is one of the reasons I'm working on getting a proper thread library ported to the DS. Sure, I plan to use it, but I'm sure other people will too, if it's available. 
<br/>
<br/>
While it can be fun to re-invent the wheel, it's not always a good thing productivity-wise. I'm not saying we should all be busy-bee coders, churning out homebrew app after homebrew app, but it would be nice to see a few more standard libraries for NDS development above and beyond lthe fat lib, wifi lib and basic libnds (Which is really the underlying layer that ensures we don't spend all our time wrangling with ARM assembler code [Which can be fun, but can also delay things a lot])...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

I know both types of people, and neither are "right" or "wrong" just different opinions.  I know there are a lot of PALib bashers out there, but that is only because they are not willing to understand how some people don't want to spend as much time as they do understanding the hardware that they could be using to write the actual game code.

a) Not quite the same thing, theres many helpfull people about,sure.
<br/>
<br/>
But thats quite different from having a little libaury of usefull codes we can all add too and take from.
<br/>
Also, having lots of people asking the same basic questions can get annoying ;)
<br/>
(not to mention standard code can be optimised)
<br/>
<br/>
b) Why not? Works for PC's.
<br/>
<br/>
Dont you think it would be handy to have the equilivent of "dll" files for the ds ?  
<br/>
I think we could get some interesting programs building up if we did that.
<br/>
<br/>
eg.
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Person A</span> makes a wireless download program
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Person B </span>makes a Jpeg reader
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Person C</span> uses A and B's dll's to make a program that retrieves a map of your local area and downloads it (say, using google map).
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">Person D</span> thinks<span style="font-style: italic"> "hay thats cool" </span>and then uses the same map as a texture for a little Glider game, so people can fly over their own area.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You see, none of those people have too even talk of communicate, but they can build off eachothers work.
<br/>
It dosnt stop anyone from doing whatever they want, they can leave the files well alone. But for those that just want too get to an end they can make far more impressive things easier.
<br/>
<br/>
A side effect too, is that some programs will be a bit smaller.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Id love to "give it a try", but I dont have enough knowledge.

You don't need to build an extensive dll-like system, you can already do that with libs. Dlls are only usefull (in a non-multitasking system) if you don't want your code to be open-source.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Yes, moonshell seems to do it well...but for obvious reasons, its not documented so I dont think many people know even where to start if they wanted  to use it for there own apps. 
<br/>
Some might call it "bad hacking", but whatever moonshell is doing seems to work fine, imo :)
<br/>
<br/>
Naturely, I think it is worth the trouble, not only for the point of seamless updateing, but also because it would let a lot more people do a lot more for a lot less effort.
<br/>
It also lets people with less time contribute more. 
<br/>
When I code for the PC, I dont have to worry about getting source code for a "Save As" dialogue box, on simerla lines, I can see it being helpfull is DS coders also didnt have to worry about certain commonly used things  things.
<br/>
<br/>
In short, I think it would kick-start homebrewers a bit more.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But *even if*  <span style="font-style: italic">"shared subroutine" </span>functionality is impractical.
<br/>
At the very least we should be getting a shared code-based.
<br/>
My exact same example of the picture-being retrieved from the internet and used in a flying game, would indeed also work perfectly fine if we had some sort of code resource.
<br/>
<br/>
It would have to be easy access for all, and anyone can contribute.

I have used CLS a bit when I was using GLscene, it works fairly well, but I think a website would be better because more people will use and, and more people will "be aware" of it.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://www.rateoholic.co.uk/RateoholicResults.php#SEARCHFOR=&amp;TYPE=VideoGame%25&amp;BY=darkflame&amp;ORDER=hyb_down&amp;ST=0" target="_blank">Darkflames Reviews</a>    --

Would the developers have to build a plugin-build and a no-plugin-build too? The no-plugin-build would never be built, because the developer relies on the plugin-system so much, he doesn't know how to code without. AND AS A RESULT, many end-users won't be able to run the file. But, if the no-plugin-build -IS- indeed built, then there wouldn't be a need for the plugin-build!

<br/>
The cons simply and clearly outweigh the pros. There's nothing wrong about the current system, that's why you'll find so little support from the devs here, to change to a new system.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://licklick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://licklick.wordpress.com</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Hmz..thats a shame about memory.
<br/>
How does the plugin and the main code exchange data then?
<br/>
<br/>
I was hopeing files could swap data by simply putting things in a few agreed memory locations.
<br/>
(the same way I hoped we could use file-extensions to trigger programs, saving the path to memory, which the prog then reads to load the correct file)

<br/>
Why is it foolish when its used on non-portable platforms so commonly?
<br/>
<br/>
Also, of course cross-platform code can be compiled for the DS.
<br/>
But that ignores DS-specific features and optimisation.
<br/>
<br/>
I am sure if a common code-base for the DS, a lot of it would be just ports or versions of code from other things.  But it would still be a common collection of code tuned and garentied to work on the DS.
<br/>
In short, it would still be very usefull.
<br/>
Its still something that we could all build on and add too, so big-projects become easier.
<br/>
<br/>
One simple example is on almost all homebrew apps we have to restart the system whenever we want to return to our bootloader.
<br/>
If there was a codebase people could use a generic<span style="font-style: italic"> "Run _Boot_.nds"</span> for thier exit button the menu, I am sure we would see a lot more programs using it.

In practice, it appears that most cards that do support DS mode but don't support FAT are new versions of SuperCard or M3, and they have 32 MiB of RAM to hold a ds.gba that has the plug-ins in a GBFS.
<br/>
<br/>
Or you could make the standard library into the main program, and user programs would become plug-ins.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I just don't understand the benefit of having plugins. The only real pro seems to be that it cuts down filesize, but really, no one will care if your program is 400kb smaller. It is useful on PC, mainly because you can upgrade the program without updating the library and vice versa, and you don't have to keep track of which program uses which version and stuff like that. On a portable platform, we don't have a huge multitasking operating system, we don't have to worry.
<br/>
<br/>
And what you're describing, as other people have pointed out, is already possible! It's called libraries! Libnds is a library, libfat is a library, the wifi library, libmad (mp3 decoding), tremor (ogg decoding), libraries for decoding images, PALib for making the coding easier, the list goes on and on. You're always reusing code when you make DS programs.
<br/>
<br/>
I believe you had an example:
<br/>
</span><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr> <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="quote">Person A makes a wireless download program
<br/>
Person B makes a Jpeg reader
<br/>
<br/>
Person C uses A and B's dll's to make a program that retrieves a map of your local area and downloads it (say, using google map).
<br/>
<br/>
Person D thinks "hay thats cool" and then uses the same map as a texture for a little Glider game, so people can fly over their own area. </td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, person A makes a wireless download program (using the wifi library, perhaps?)
<br/>
Person B makes a jpeg decoder (*coughlibjpegcough*)
<br/>
<br/>
Person C uses functions and snippets from the other people's code, and makes a program that retrieves a map of your local area and downloads it. No .dll's or plugins involved. Perhaps person A released his source under the GNU GPL, which would force person C to do so as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Person D looks and person C's source code, which he has of course released, GPL or not, and takes the parts he needs, and makes the glider game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I want you to realize is that everything you describe is already possible, and a system for module loading would mean more work for everyone, probably less effective and stable programs, and a big hassle, to include modules, to code the module system and to turn code into modules.<br/>_________________<br/>"no offense, but this is the gayest game ever"</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Probably not much. In Mac OS 1 through 9, every application was in an archive format called "resource fork", similar to Zip or GBFS. "Resources," or files in the resource fork, might contain a code segment (CODE), an icon (ICON, or ICN# if it had a transparency mask), a cursor shape (CURS), a text translation table (STR#), a dialog layout (DLOG/DITL), a menu layout (MBAR/MENU), or a list of file types that the app can open (BNDL/FREF). All code segments were compiled position independent (and thus were limited to 32 KB) and could be loaded or unloaded as needed. The parts of system software not stored in the firmware were also stored as resources in a file called "System" (fonts, default icons, etc). Plug-ins called "extensions", each with a resource fork containing a code segment (INIT), were executed at startup and could add or patch SWIs (the SWI table was in RAM on the Mac).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Plugings indeed give a big memory advantage ,but also an advantage of not worrying about sourcecode being released, or lisences.
<br/>
A plugin can be used without having the source.
<br/>
(not everyone not releaseing source code does it because they are evil, or want to make money, its often just practicality or an effort issue more)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But regardless of all this, there must be SOME things we can agree and move forward on?
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, can we not agree to set up a common code repository somewhere?
<br/>
Return to multiboot, standby, and other commonly needed things could be put there?
<br/>
(and slowly building a nice archieve of more interesting stuff too)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, How about agreeing on some system of placeing file-paths in a location in ram when one bit of software triggers another?
<br/>
<br/>
For instance,
<br/>
So a Rom file could be run purely by selecting it...the extension tells the multibooter to run the emu, and the emu picks up the path from ram, and then auto-reads the rom.
<br/>
<br/>
On the surface, this dosnt seem that hard to me from a technical standapoint. Am I missing something? 
<br/>
Or is it purely a mater a social/agreement thing.

No one has signed up or agreed because theres nothing to sign up too, we are just discuse ideas. Before anyone writers one line of code we would need to work out exactly what was going on.

Exactly, if its so easy, why do many homebrew progs still not have these basic features?
<br/>
Hardly anything at all has a return-to-multiboot function. 
<br/>
<br/>
If there was a simple site with basic examples, I think you would see these functions become near universaly adopted.
<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea of "if you cant do it, you shouldnt bother" is a horrible one, and really harming the homebrew community, imo.
<br/>
Everyone can do<span style="font-style: italic"> everything</span>, given enough time. But most dont have that time to spend...and if they did, they would rather spend it doing more interesting bits of code.
<br/>
<br/>
Simply having a code-based of stuff means people can spend less time on basic functions, and more time on the "fun stuff".
<br/>
Whether its working it out on your own, or searching though huge bits of open source code to find the relivent bits...its all time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A site with a simple list of common codes would be usefull to start with.
<br/>
Allthough, a site allowing anyone to submit ds relivent code, and to catagorise it would be better no?
<br/>
I think with lots of functions, improvements would be made, untill you have the "best version" of a particular function. (most stable/smallest/fastest).
