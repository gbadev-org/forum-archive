    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I have been using the SCSD alternate version for a few days now and it seems quite stable. The default sound font for the midi plugin doesn't sound very good with Moonlight's sample midis, though. I have not yet tried the new midi plugin yet because I don't have the room for it, so I'll try it soon. Otherwise most other music sounds the same as with version 1.0. I have not noticed any difference so far.
<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity, what exactly is the difference between normal Moonshell and the SCSD alt. version? Does it use the SRAM onboard the SC where the normal version does not? Well whatever the difference is, it seems to be working fine. Thanks for the continued development!<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

I haven't found a single Midi that doesnt work.

Obviously sound quality varies a lot, volumes of instruments seem unbalanced, as well as some sounds clearly not supported (I want my reverse cymbals :p)

This so far has been my biggest complaint about MIDI playback engines and sound banks: they don't seem to run their samples through Replay Gain, so instruments end up emphasized incorrectly on any machine other than your own.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Not coming MoonShell for G6. It's sad. :(
<br/>
<br/>
I e-mailed G6/M3 team asking if they would compile 1.0 or version 1.1 and the reply was:
<br/>
<span style="font-style: italic">"We heard that the MoonShell version 1.0 &amp; 1.1 has some problem in this monent. So we will do that later."</span>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe later means after MoonShell is stable enough. Oh that sadness.
<br/>
<br/>
From past:
<br/>
When I asked for a new MoonShell version when there was only 0.3 (for G6) out they compiled v0.999. It didn't take more than few days when they pull it back and released v0.992. I have no idea why. That v0.999 is downloadable from the first post.
<br/>
<br/>
I have decided that I will buy other cart/adapter for MoonShell and media stuff. Maybe M3 SD Mini (If it's later supported. I assume it acts like M3 SD.). I also have wondered if the EZ SD mini is a good one.<br/>_________________<br/>My <a class="postlink" href="http://www.samipupu.com/upload/Guest/xtreme_theme.mp3" target="_blank">Theme</a><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">

Look in the setup...there's an option specifically for a version working with the M3 MiniSD.  Apparently you can read it exactly the same way as the M3 SD, but it needs it's own version because stock MoonShell detects it as something other than an M3 SD for some reason.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I know I am. i never had to do that for the early MoonShells. It's also weird because the SC versions of MoonShell, if I start that with "A", it loads fine with no problems, and even reads off my CF.. I think I'll use that version from now on. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

Because of the plug-in system, I'd wager. :)  Maybe they're afraid they'd have to release plug-ins for some of their extra features, or maybe their ability to view text and listen to music at the same time is messed up somehow because of it.

When the clock turns from 2 digits on the hours to 1 digit (Eg 12 - 1 or 23 - 0) the last digit will still there. So if you turn the clock in at 11 am and wait till 1-2-3 somthing, then the clock will show 11.00-1200-13.00.

Just delete evey plugin in your shell/plugins folder except for the JPG one.

Although, if you want it soley for viewing jpgs... DSOrganize has a pretty nice jpg viewer that suits your particular wants. (No zoom though).<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

It looks like a Compact Flash Type II card.. Perhaps it's a mini hard drive, but it would probably suck more power out of the DS because of the moving parts in the card.
<br/>
<br/>
The movie player itself is simply modified to accomodate CF type II cards (which is completely compatible with type I cards, but simply having thicker shells)
<br/>
<br/>
The fact that it's playing on a DS Lite is as impressive.. 
<br/>
<br/>

1)a screen saver

- moonlight has made a glib wave demo maybe he should add that to moonshell so when you don't use moonshell for 1minute and 30seconds or something it will go into the wave demo and make random waves :)
<br/>
<br/>
2)a slide show
<br/>
- you should be able to like press both the triggers in a directory and it will start a full dual-screen slide show that pushes images through the bottom to top :D, then you could have so awsome music running too,
<br/>
if you say have songs numbered in that directory too :P
<br/>
<br/>
3)running skin switcher :P
<br/>
- you would be able to test out diffrent skins with out computer interference(like having to go on the computer and move skin folders... blah blah)
<br/>
<br/>
4)voice simulator
<br/>
- you can open a text document and the ds will read it to you 0_o,
<br/>
someone made a voice simulator demo before, and i think moonshell could use it :P
<br/>
<br/>
5)two diffrent moonshells :P

The M3 version has this, but it's a double edged sword.  For example...you can play an MP3 and view a picture, but since MP3 takes up so much CPU power already it slows down the decompression of the JPG, and when it's loading or you are scrolling around, the two kind of fight for CPU time, causing the JPG to be slow like I was saying, and the MP3 to sound crackly.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
