    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I was wondering what the cheapest method of backing up and restoring NDS saves from official carts.
<br/>
<br/>
It must be usable with my 64bit Linux installation as I single boot my system and don't have Windows on any system in my place.
<br/>
I can't lose the ability to go on WFC as my game I plan on backing up is wifi so firmware flashes are out.
<br/>
<br/>
I plan on using this when Pokemon Diamond and Pearl come out to clone event pokemon after borrowing them from people online.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
And cloning counts as cheating.
<br/>
<br/>
Just get GBAMPv2 and a CF card + CF card reader and use it with REIN.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks for the suggestion.
<br/>
As for the cheating I am only doing it because it is the only choice to fill my Pokedex. I am from Canada and they don't do events for us. I refuse to let a AR touch my games, I even refuse to accept hacked pokemon in trades. As you can see clones of just the Event pokemon is the closest I can get to a perfect clean game.
<br/>
<br/>
I am doing good so far, I have a emerald game that has all 386 sorted and unhacked personally caught by me except the event ones which I got from verified as unhacked save games online. then on to my carts via xboo+sendsave.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I second this suggestion.
<br/>
<br/>
You can mount the CF card as a standard block device with a USB reader, and should have no problems. I use a SuperCard CF and ReinMoon myself, but the concept is the same.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I got thinking about it and what device would be best with a SD card because my laptop already has a built-in SD card reader (tested to work in Linux) and I have a SD card already so that would knock a lot of the price off what I have to pay.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

gbamp-cf(cheapest CF device) is $25, and supercard-sd(cheapest SD device) is $45. (rough prices from last i checked). if you can get a small cf card + cf reader for less than $20, it's still cheaper. 
<br/>
<br/>
gbamp-sd is somewhat supported, but doesn't work for writing yet, so it won't do what you want.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
