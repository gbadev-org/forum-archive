Theres one for GP2X. Is it possible to port that?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">NeoGeo does needs good Motorola 6800 and Z80 cores. As genesis, i think.
<br/>
Even Dreamcast with barely 16MB of main RAM has a 100% NeoGeoCD emulator (<a class="postlink" href="http://chui.dcemu.co.uk/neo4all.html" target="_blank">NEO4ALL</a>). And the NeoGeo AES/MVS one (<a class="postlink" href="http://chui.dcemu.co.uk/aes4all.html" target="_blank">AES4ALL</a>) is great speedwise, but lags here and there because the MMU (a +50MB rom in just physical 16MB).
<br/>
I think DS can indeed emulate NeoGeo with SC extra RAM aid. Maybe it would run slow and require massive optimization and speed hacks.
<br/>
But for sure it would require many sleepless nights and dedication from a coder, wich no everyone affords.
<br/>
And if anyone would take the task, please don't publicaly anounce it, give schedule dates or open a blog :P
<br/>

As for NeoGeoPocket Color, shame GPF is a busy man and has many promising unfinished projects. Beats of Rage DS, R.A.C.E DS (the other NGPC emu wich runs very nice on DC) and so on. Don't be surprised if Duke Nuken 3DS get canned :)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The Neo Geo (CD) emulators for the Dreamcast and the GP2X are ports based on the SDL library, which is not very well implemented on the DS I don't think.  If the DS port of SDL was more robust, a Neo CD emulator might be possible.  Though it has a reputation for being more powerful than the Genesis, in some ways emulation of the Neo Geo is easier than Genesis, particularly the sound hardware.
<br/>
<br/>
The Neo Pocket is actually pretty similar to the Neo Geo home/arcade hardware, though the video hardware is obviously totally different.  The Pocket uses a CPU from Toshiba which is supposedly based on the 68K used in the big Neo Geo (and Genesis, Amiga, etc.) and a Z80 for sound.  It seems to me like the requirements for Neo Geo Pocket emulation are actually higher than Neo Geo home/arcade emulation.  Maybe because the Toshiba CPU it uses is not so fully documented.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Wasn't the SDL part on Dreamcast port of Fosters's NeoCD been removed and gave place too FAME, FAZE, CZ80, CM68K and such, writen in C and ASM for speed improvements? There's still any SDL in them?
<br/>
As i said above, it looks possible, but very time consuming to do.
<br/>
And i think DS would need M68K and Z80 native emulator first.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

PicoDriveDS is a start. Any asm optimizations you could make to it would help the effort to emulate Neo-Geo.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
