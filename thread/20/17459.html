However, how do games, such as Prof Layton create dialog, using speech bubbles ?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not looking for a coding solution here (although a demo would be a nice bonus). I would just like someone to explain the concept of how to do it.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's done the same way any other GBA game does variable-width text.
<br/>
You set aside an area of VRAM for a text box, and you draw text characters into the tiles with a sprite routine.
<br/>
<a class="postlink" href="http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/tte.htm" target="_blank">Tonc's Text Engine</a> shows an example.  (long article, intended for the GBA, but a NDS can do everything a GBA does.)
<br/>
<br/>
Then you draw the speech bubble just like any other drawing.  Make the box or circle, maybe give it an outline, maybe shade it.  Some people like to use a simple right triangle along with a rectangle.
<br/>
<br/>
On the DS, you could use a real bitmap mode instead of a tile mode if you prefer the eaiser way of accessing the pixels, but using tiled video modes makes the most efficient use of video ram.<br/>_________________<br/>"We are merely sprites that dance at the beck and call of our button pressing overlord."</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Thanks a lot. I sort of thought that was probably the way to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I was just hoping for a shortcut ?
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now you have confirmed the method, I can get down to the hard work of making it happen.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
