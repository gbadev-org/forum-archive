I wonder what means "the end" since he has said it again in his blog (google translated.. maybe I misunderstood something.. i dunno). I hope Moonlight will continue developing MoonShell to more stable and improve video playback to play smoother. Moonshell is the best media player on Nintendo handheld so far.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">It's unlikely to happen for a while (or ever), since a drawing plugin for Moonshell would require significant additions to Moonshell's plugin system.
<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, it would need to be able to boot plugins at any time just like it boots anything else.
<br/>
I'm also unsure as to what kind of control the plugins have over windows, and how they deal with user input... a good drawing app in Moonshell would probably want to create two seperate windows for itself, and would need some pretty interesting UI stuff which Moonshell currently doesn't do.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm willing to be surprised, though :)<br/>_________________<br/>Thanks!

Clock plugin keeps the backlight on all the time.. should it shade out and in after a while? Like 2 minutes on... 2 minutes off... etc to save the backlight.

What I can say v1.11 played that same video clip without slow downs that had problems with v1.13 (beta 1.2).
<br/>
It seems none of use has the courage to name one release. Also it makes difference what settings you use and what was the source file's fps.
<br/>
I have come to the conclusion that one release works great for one and other complains. So what can I say.
<br/>
<br/>
I will make hard testing with M3 MiniSD 80x (~12MByte/s) when/if I can get one. I also have G6 flash, so I can compare if the playback is different with different medias.

"Media Player" is a generic term. Call it Windows Media Player or WiMP. Compared to other media players, WiMP comes with few codecs, but a lot of codecs (called "DirectShow filters") are available for download at no charge on the Internet.
<br/>
<br/>
VLC media player comes with lots of plug-ins, including one based on ModPlug Player for MOD/S3M/XM/IT, but not one for SPC (Super NES audio rips).<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
NDSLiteDefaultBrightness (4=AutoDetect) item was added to [System] section of global.ini.
<br/>
StartupSound (2=Auto start) item was added to [Boot] section of global.ini.
<br/>
MicroDrive was supported with GBAMP. (There is MicroDrive for which compatibility is not suitable. )
<br/>
The clock plug-in was supported with MSPV30. The clock is displayed without turning off the backlight.
<br/>
MID/RCP plug-in was corrected a little. (There are no changes in the sound font and midrcp.ini.)</span>

I wonder what means "the end" since he has said it again in his blog (google translated.. maybe I misunderstood something.. i dunno). I hope Moonlight will continue developing MoonShell to more stable and improve video playback to play smoother.

So if I run MoonShell.. don't push any buttons and wait for (for example) a clock to appear on the top screen.. then I remove the SD card and put it back immediately, it hangs.. this is normal?

I've just tried this with my gbamp + moonshell.

Loaded up Moonshell, waited for screen to clear, removed card, clock was still running... reinserted card, still running, infact I'm playing a song from it now...

Second ran moonshell, then the submarine tech demo removed card, played the tech demo (and got 100% with the usual 40% damage) then re-inserted the gbamp....

[edit]
<br/>
I managed to find a few bugs in Moonshell:
<br/>
-Large images are not rendered completely, and can freeze the program. It doesn't respond or redraw. Older versions turned the backlight off and didn't show any windows; this one keeps it on with the Decode window shown. It fails with images that worked before.
<br/>
<br/>
-Occasionally it misreads file extensions, saying it doesn't support 'ext.' or 'ext.?', even with supported extensions. This seems to depend on name/path:
<br/>
//MPCF/DSOrganize/SCRIBBLE/jesus.png shows 'ext.?', and
<br/>
//MPCF/DSOrganize/HELP/error.html shows 'ext.'.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I figured out that 'file names garbled at right' bug: it's skipping letters that don't fit. For example, "Remix" might show up as "Reix" because the 'm' won't fit in the remaining space. (It should just stop printing entirely.)
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, when I ran the setup app for this version, it didn't actually copy a lot of the files. Just created the .nds. Or did it ever do that?
<br/>
<br/>
BTW, loving that new small font in the debug output.
<br/>
Also, here's part of a modified skin.ini (the rest isn't modified). I made it right on the DS using DSOrganize, and it's pixel-perfect. It fits all the windows except Help onto the screen at once. Now if you were to put clever background images on each window, it'd look awesome. (Or can you only have one image for all windows?)

It isn't closing the FAT library when you go out of the MPCF (FAT device) file system and reopenning it when you go back in. Simple fix? Don't pull out the card.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

<br/>
Unmounting is only crucial if you wish to remount. When you close a file, it's contents are synced to disc and all buffers are flushed, so there isn't a risk of data loss. However, when you unmount, all files and the hardware interface are closed. If you don't unmount, it can't reopen the hardware interface and you won't be able to remount.
<br/>
<br/>
There is currently no way to be notified of a cartridge removal, asside from using cartridge interrupts. However, once that happens it is too late to unmount.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com" target="_blank">http://chishm.drunkencoders.com</a>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Stupid question, but could there be a command sent via software to unmount the library/file system? Then another command to remount it? Sort of like how Windows has the "Unplug or Eject Hardware" wizard, but mandatory? That way, Moonshell stays in the DS's memory, unmounts the file system via a command from the user. The user then removes card, inserts new one, and gives Moonshell a command to remount the system. Then Moonshell pretty much restarts itself and remounts the file system.
<br/>
<br/>
Although, thinking about that now seems rather pointless as it does the same thing as turning the DS off and then doing all that and turning it back on. I guess it would be more intelligent to ask if unmounting could be performed after the media is removed (that is if Moonshell doesn't lock up in the process of removing the media)?<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL

No it does not lock up it (when I don't have any files open).

After card is inserted it just don't find any files, thats it.

Good idea. Add that and a sync function (which flushes all open files) to the public API, and your library will behave as developers and app users expect.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
