<br/>
A huge number of improvements and features have been added since the last version, making this finally a library you can *do something* with.
<br/>
An abbreviated list of improvements goes like this: WEP, DHCP, TCP, ICMP, DNS, WFC data, but all those are just the major points, there?s a lot of work that?s been done under the surface and the internals will run much more smoothly too.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">[ Crimson and Black Nintendo DS Lite | CycloDS Evolution | EZ-Flash 3-in-1 | 1 GB Transcend microSD ]</span></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Just something that connects to a router, and maybe send's and receives a packet, then stops?

The actual library doesn't look like it would be too difficult to use, but I've got no idea how to properly include it in an ARM9 only app. Will the ARM7 stuff just magically be there if I link with the library?
