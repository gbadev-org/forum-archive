    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Just something I thought of last night. FWNitro can be used as both a replacement firmware and a WMB demo. So perhaps the official firmware can be made into a WMB demo as well? Since it's Nintendo's code, we might be able to turn it into a signed demo. So you make a signed WMB demo out of V1, and send it to your V4+ DS; it loads the V1 firmware into memory like any other demo and runs it. Then you use WifiMe and away you go!

<br/>
Any chance of this, or is it just wishful thinking?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

The firmware is not stored in .nds format. As the firmware was not intended to be WMB'd, there was no real reason for Nintendo to put a signature anywhere in the firmware.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

I could ask my crystal sphere for a better answer, but honestly, how should we know? Someone could fool you with this .nds or it might be a 'good' one. What did you expect us to decide upon? Its name?

You either have the nuts to run it, or just - which is prefereable - throw it away when you don't know what it is/does<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://mightymax.org/gbamp_multiboot.html" target="_blank">GBAMP Multiboot</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Do you mean FWNitro? If yes: No, firmware.nds won't overwrite your firmware. Only installer.nds will do after shorting SL1 and pressing some buttons.<br/>_________________<br/>The future of gaming is mobile Handheld Gaming.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, if someone every ships a NoPass, it could be reversed. Then you could wrap that code around FlashMe and you'd be set.
