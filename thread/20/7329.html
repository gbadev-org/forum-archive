<br/>
Think about that. 
<br/>
What does it tell you?
<br/>
You need an internet connection via a router or wifi card so the DS can play over the internet.
<br/>
Think before you type.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by JaJa on Sat Oct 29, 2005 6:12 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

<br/>
In terms of multiple cartridge multiplayer, Nintendo has gone all out. The mode will not restrict players character selection, all the game's 32 levels will be available, and different engine choices will be available. The game will also track each individual player's win/loss record and allow them to trade "ghost data" so others can race against their best lap times.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

A long time ago, a "month" or longer, it was said NO vs in battle online. Only trackracing.
<br/>
<br/>
Howerer in an recent interview it sounded like battle was going online though.
<br/>
<br/>

So big mystery at the moment, I'd say...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
A wifi router doesn't automagically give you an internet connection.
<br/>
Nintendo's wifi connection uses thier wifi hotspots in mac donalds restaurants across America.
<br/>
So you don't need a connection personally, but you need access to an internet connection.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">the free part relates to subscription fees, as atm you have to pay to access XBox Live and any other networks (on Sony Online Network, each publisher sets the subscription fees, as do publishers for PC MMORPGs)

[quote = tepples]Which leaves one thing: Is there vs. CPU in balloon battle?[/quote]
<br/>
<br/>
has there ever been a vs. CPU in balloon battle in any other mario kart? nup, which leads me to believe that there won't b this time around (there might be something similar as one of the challenges in the single player mode tho)
<br/>
<br/>
i don't see why they couldn't do balloon battle online...tracks only allow up to 4 players online, and balloon battles only allow up to 4 players as well. 2 weeks to go tho, so we'll see then eh?<br/>_________________<br/>Here's some ideas I have for when I know enough to act on them, or for others to have a look at when they're bored: <a class="postlink" href="http://www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm" target="_blank">www.wayne.sebbens.com/ds_ideas.htm</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I seriously hope they do put this online.  I see myself playing this mode more than the standard racing, but I keep getting conflicting info on whether this mode is online or not.  But, as you said, not much longer to wait...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
