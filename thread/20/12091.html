<br/>
<br/>
Here's my second piece of homebrew... A faithful custom emulation of International Karate for the DS, including full SID emulation for music and sound effects.

Do you plan to port other C64 classics such as <a class="postlink" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=NZ77InCoxFo" target="_blank">Fort Apocalypse</a> (hint! hint!) ? ;)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My dad (now in his 50s) and I used to play this two player on the c64 for hours when I was in my teens, in fact we were just talking about it yesterday when he saw me playing my IK+ on the GBA, imagine my surprise to see this!
<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful!
<br/>
<br/>
I've always enjoyed the original over IK+ because the randomness of the third fighter when playing two players used to annoy me so much!
<br/>
<br/>
So is this a similar engine to the Geos port? The SID emulation is top notch.
<br/>
<br/>
Any chances paradroid or Giana Sisters might appear?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, what about <a class="postlink" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=-yUy7OQ0jNY" target="_blank">this one</a> then? just kidding... ;)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit curious, could you give us some info about your engine. Is it some kind of C64 emulator engine or is it done entirely from scratch?
<br/>
<br/>
About International Karate itself, the game is just perfect. I launch the game even if I don't wish to play just to hear the music, which leads me to my second question : any hope for a future SID player on DS?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">No, this is no remake. I didn't rewrite the game from scratch.
<br/>
Obviously, most of the game is directly emulated, to get the exact same behavior.
<br/>
But it's not generic enough to run any game. Generic emulators are much slower. If you specialize them, they can run full-speed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What about FIST II? I'd love to see that on the DS as well. Anyway, this is very cool!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

What about a game like, say, Exile?
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_</a>(arcade_adventure)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure touch screen support for aiming (or other functions) would work wonders for it.
<br/>
<br/>
EDIT:
<br/>
Then again, nevermind. It would seem that the game hasn't been abandoned and one of the original creators is working on a new version for mobile phones and modile hardware:

<br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough, even on the creator's own site, he supports emulation of the old Amiga version and offers links to sites that link to other sites for downloading the game.<br/>_________________<br/>Cobalt/Black NDSL
