<br/>
<br/>
I'm a newbie programmer trying to make a rom manager just to improve my coding skill. I want read NDS Rom banner info, and convert pixel and palette data to any image format like PNG or GIF. I don't have docs about how pixel data are stored, anyone can help me providing tips or documentation?

<br/>
Thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The best answer depends on how much you know already. Do you know how tile graphics work on most 2D game consoles? Or do you know how "text mode", which was common during the MS-DOS era, works on a PC?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Most 2D game consoles and 8-bit home computers have at least one display mode that treats the screen as a grid of cells, large enough to hold one character. This is called <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mode" target="_blank">text mode</a>. (The first popular home computer without a text mode was Macintosh, in 1984.) But despite it being called "text mode", it was still popular to draw simple graphics by cleverly arranging glyphs; these are called <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art" target="_blank">ASCII art</a>. If you replace half the in the computer's font with <a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat" target="_blank">dingbats</a> representing pieces of objects, you can draw more sophisticated graphics.

I just want to export this data [1] (bitmap and palette data) from DS rom file to a PNG image. I'm never worked with images formats before. Maybe anyone on DS scene can give details about format used to store game icon on DS rom and how convert it into something useful.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">What tepples is trying to tell you is how text mode works, which the NDS banner pulls from more or less, though I'd point out that the banner is more like working with just the tile cels used for a text mode than the actual text mode itself.
<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you've got tile cels, which are small unique square pictures of equal width/height (8x8 in this case), aligned in a row from left to right, and top to bottom. Within each "cel" are pixels that are also aligned in a row from left to right, and top to bottom. Depending on the pixel format, it could be direct color values, it could be paletted (which the NDS banner uses), or other formats. For the NDS banner, each byte represents 2 pixels, indexed to the palette (which is why you see 4x8 bytes, even though the tile cel is 8x8 pixels) being only 4-bits each (0-15).<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
