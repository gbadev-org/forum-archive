    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hi all, hope it's the right forum for this.
<br/>
<br/>
I have this Gamecube, and i bought a BBA for it, so i can stream files from PC. Actualy i'm waiting for the package arrive.
<br/>
<br/>
But the GC is far from my bedroom, where my PC is. And to stream files i need to use some command line apps in DOS to send the file, receive it in GC and such.
<br/>
But i have a physical defficience and can't go this way, back and forth from PC to GC to PC...
<br/>
So i thought the DS is the perfect solution for me. A app in wich i can type commands and send via wi-fi to a PC side server that executes it like "cmd &lt;command&gt;".
<br/>
The DS client would need only to have a keyboard in bottom screen and top screen showing what i type, send and outputs from the server.
<br/>
<br/>
As i think i shoudn't bother anyone with my matters, i resolved to learn to code it myself. Gone to PAlib site, installed everything and started to read the wiki there.
<br/>
I never coded anything but "Hello world!", just am familiarized with various sintaxes, JavaScript and PHP are my hobbies.
<br/>
Got to do a simple code. Just a keyboard that output texts im the upper screen.
<br/>
I don't have idea on how to send the strings via wifi, write  simple app in windows to listen in the port and execute it.
<br/>
<br/>
Also i would like to read pre-made BATs or a text file with multiple lines from the card and execute that.
<br/>
<br/>
What i did: <a href="http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/8254/myscreenshot108yj2.jpg" target="_blank">http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/8254/myscreenshot108yj2.jpg</a> (is working in my SCCF)
<br/>
<br/>
Could someone do it for me? I'm realy disapointed with my skills.
<br/>
Or else point me to the right thing to do.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm out of money to donate, but i'm eager to help and be helped. Think it's fairly easy to someone who does better things.
<br/>
<br/>
So, what can i do?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Don't.
<br/>
I use DS2Key everytime to play emulators on PC. It works fine, but doesn't show the PC screen, how would i know what i was doing if i couldn have a visual response?
<br/>
<br/>
Win2DS is to slow to be usable. It would be way faster if it worked only with DOS (cmd.exe).
<br/>
<br/>
And DSVNC would be my best choice, but it's even more slower than Win2DS, and its keyboard is a pain to use.
<br/>
<br/>
Infact, i think it would be easyer and faster to send and receive little and real time text strings than full screenshots from the PC.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

When i boot DSlinux, it connects, but doesn't stay as such. I dont have time for anything.
<br/>
I have  a Datel Wi-Fi MAX USB dongle, phat DS and Supercard CF. My PC has winXP SP2 and a hardware firewall (low).
<br/>
<br/>
Every other software, homebrew or commercial works fine right out of the box, but not DSlinux :(</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">DSLinux has particular trouble determining the channel number to use.  Add that info to the rc.conf file and it should make connecting much easier/faster.  It will still read the info from your WFC config but will use the channel number when connecting as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
Any way to keep it connected while it's running?

Also, can i turn off or change down the keyboard's keyrepeat rate?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I'm not sure why it's disconnecting, as it should wait until you type "/etc/rc.d/network stop" before doing so.  Therefore, the disconnection is probably a bug, and my guess is that it has to do with the use of the Datel Wifi dongle, but I'm not certain.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
