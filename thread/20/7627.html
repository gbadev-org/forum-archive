    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Seeing as though MoonShell, SnesDS, Nintendo Home Brewn WIFI development, etc are all on "hiatus" as their authors explore other projects, I thought it would be time to ask you all what's new and exciting in the land of DS Home Brewn DS development? Are there any new "must-have" demos, programs, tools or games that anyone are making?
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, thought I would ask. :)<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well, ScummVM is VERY addicting and fun, especially, if you haven't played it's games bedore. Sushi The Cat DS is a fun game but VERY short (4 minutes of gameplay). DSLinux is interesting thing to play with, but there's nothing useful in it for now.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Looks promising. I personally can not wait until this project is finished in its development for the sole purpose of chatting on, say, instant messengers through my DS while I am in bed. Much more relaxing than sitting at a computer at night. :)
<br/>
<br/>
But, I don't know about the whole "not being able to put it down" thing. If it's a simple card game or battleship, those would be neat to have go online, but it would probably be better if someone, say, began development on a sprite-based online RPG. That'd probably interest me more.<br/>_________________<br/>Mathew Valente [TSSF]
