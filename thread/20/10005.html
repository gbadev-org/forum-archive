    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There are 2 Linux games I have in mind that I consider ripe for DS porting:
<br/>
<br/>
-Supertux
<br/>
-Chromium B.S.U.
<br/>
<br/>
While Supertux looks simpler, Chromium would be much more interesting of a DS port, as it uses mouse control that could work well with the touch screen.
<br/>
<br/>
When I asked in #dsdev I got the response that Supertux would be easier to port, as it uses SDL, which is now available for DS (<a class="postlink" href="http://gpf.dcemu.co.uk/ndsSDL.shtml" target="_blank">Link</a>).  This got me thinking:  What Linux libraries used in games like these have been ported?  How hard would it be for a newbie programmer like myself to begin working on this?  
<br/>
<br/>
And most importantly, what are the important manuals and documentation I should read to get started?  Any other advice?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Well when I port something, I try to read and understand the whole source code first. Then I try to identify the things I know need to be rewritten or reworked. I then split the project up into manageable pieces and develop some sort of step-by-step plan to follow. Once you make the big task into a bunch of easier, smaller tasks, porting is no problem.

<br/>
It's an art as much as anything and the only way to get better is to keep coding...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody"><a href="http://prboom.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://prboom.sourceforge.net/</a> should be portable or hopefully something from <a href="http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Source_ports" target="_blank">http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Source_ports</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Doom is one of those things that, I'd expect will be ported once a cheap solution to add more ram is avaiable. (opera ram card + DScart flash)
<br/>
<br/>
I've seen doom ported to alot of devices with the same cpu speed but generally ram is alot higher.. eg Ipod/Iriver/mobile phones.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://MrShlee.com/" target="_blank">MrShlee.com</a>

<br/>
Are there any existing DS homebrew games ported from Linux, so I can diff my way through the sources?
<br/>
<br/>
From what I gather, I can't really RTFM if there isn't one (not knocking the brief tutorials I have found, don't get my wrong), so I'll use the sources of the games, and existing DS homebrew as a guide lacking thorough docs to read.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
