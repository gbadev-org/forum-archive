    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Homebrew developers spent a lot of time and effort to write their programs. It is time we show our appreciation for their hard work.
<br/>
<br/>
Please donate to your favorite homebrew developers. The amount doesn't matter, what matters is showing you care.
<br/>
<br/>
Setting a paypal account took me a while, but I did it just for this purpose.
<br/>
<br/>
This Christmas, don't think about what you will get, but what you can give. 
<br/>
<br/>
Please reply when you have donated.
<br/>
<br/>
Please also consider donating to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.devkitpro.org/why-donate.shtml" target="_blank">devkitPro</a> and <a class="postlink" href="http://palib.info/forum/modules/donations/" target="_blank">PAlib</a>. Without these two, there wouldn't be many DS homebrew.<br/>_________________<br/><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDSh" target="_blank">Nintendo DS homebrew on Wikipedia</a></span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ok, I gave a few bucks to some of my favourites homebrew developers :
<br/>
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://www.foxysofts.com/index.php" target="_blank">Foxy</a> who made amazing Atari ST ports on the gba : Another World, Nebulus and Airball. He made some stuff on the DS too. I do hope he will make a Sentinel port someday.
<br/>
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://gpf.dcemu.co.uk/" target="_blank">GPF</a>. His work on FrodoDS, a C64 emulator, is very promising. Hope a new release will come up pretty soon!
<br/>
<br/>
- <a class="postlink" href="http://portabledev.com/" target="_blank">Alek Maul</a>. MarcaDS and ColecoDS, do I need to say more? He's working on an Amstrad CPC emulator too. can't wait to test this!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I think I will give some money to <a class="postlink" href="http://www.workingdesign.de/" target="_blank">Lordus</a>. I wonder if he got a new DS for XMas...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
