    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My question is in regards to the Homebrew application ScummVM for DS.  I've went over the information provided on the homepage for the application and searched on the internet for a while now, but have been unable to find any information regarding this situation.
<br/>
From what I've read, it seems that ScummVM limits you using only a 30MB rom with the games built into it.  Now, that limits pretty much all the games that I would want to play, besides Monkey Island 2 and maybe a Non-Talkie version of 1.  I've also read that you can hack a GBAMP to run the application and then play games from other folders through Compact Flash.  This is a much better way to go.
<br/>
<br/>
Now, my question is: Can a <span style="font-weight: bold">M3</span> GBA Movie Player perform the same task as the normal GBAMP?
<br/>
<br/>
I'm still new to this emulation world and I hope I'm not asking a stupid question.  All I know, is that I have been unable to get it to work on my M3 by performing the GBAMP method, only from a single rom with the games built in.
<br/>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Ouch, I see. Well, I've looked at the source for ScummVM for DS and I think I might be able to edit it using the coding from chishm's driver.  If anyone has already done this or if the developer is in progress of supporting the M3, let me know.

Yea how's that going...?
<br/>
Is the next release going to be 0.8.0 ? is that why we m3 users have to wait?
<br/>
Anyway the emu is great,  to bad though it only supports 32mb limit.(exept for the m2)</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">The next version is going ok, and will have some cool new features.  It won't be 0.8.0 though, that's going to have to wait until the next version becuase I've made quite a large number of changes to ScummVM that will have to be done again on the new version.
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, the main reason this is taking so long is that other things in my life are taking up more time at the moment.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
