<br/>
<br/>
I have a number of japanese cartridges, and used them on my original nintendo DS to practice japanese. However, my old DS died, so I bought a DSi XL.
<br/>
<br/>
When it arrived I realized there was no way to put it in Japanese mode, like I could with the original DS. This is ok for monolanguage cartridges which still show japanese. However, for instance my Chrono Trigger cart is actually dual language, so the DS language setting being set to English forces it to run in English mode every time.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way for me to change the dsi firmware to use the japanese firmware, or in some other way to enable the use of japanese language? I really just need the DS to tell my cart to use japanese, I don't need access to the DSI store or whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
If this is not the best place to ask, let me know where...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">For regular DS (i.e. non "i") games, there's something you could try:
<br/>
<br/>
Get a DSi compatible flashcart
<br/>
Run the original NDS firmware dump thats floating about the internet via the flashcart
<br/>
Change the language in it to Japanese
<br/>
Restart DSi and run DS game
<br/>
<br/>
This works for pictochat and download play which run in DS mode, so it may work for games running in DS mode as well.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
