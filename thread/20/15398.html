    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Alright, I just had another one of my crazy ideas for a ds application so here it goes. My idea is to have a homebrew app that runs off of the ds internal RAM that enables placement of a file on commercial rom cartridges. Now you may be confused. My main focus for this is to be able to convert a store bought cartridge into a homebrew device.  Now here are the bugs that can't be avoided:
<br/>
<br/>
-the app must be able to fit and run on the 4mb, kind of like nitrohax, of ram along with whatever file is being transfered (If the app took up 1mb you would only be able to send up to a 3mb file)
<br/>
-It would destroy/erase the game on the commercial game cartridge
<br/>
-This is probably something that will never work but if it sparks anybodies interest on other homebrew please reply.
<br/>
<br/>
Practical applications:
<br/>
-You would be able to send homebrew to a friend with a ds who doesn't have a homebrew enabled ds.
<br/>
-The file can be kept on the cartridge
<br/>
-disadvantage, You have just lost a $30 game
<br/>
<br/>
I may be going about this concept completely wrong in the sense that the ideal way to do this would be to just send a file from a homebrew enabled ds  to a regular ds through ds download play and the regular ds would just store the file on RAM until powered off. I believe there is a homebrew app that can do this, but it requires flash me. Can somebody list all the programs that can do this so I can test them.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I can tell, the most promising way to do this is to use a <a class="postlink" href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/pass/" target="_blank">SaveMe style exploit</a>, similar to the ones that were used to crack the Xbox (Agent Under Fire and MechAssault), PSP (GTA:LCS and Lumines), and Wii (Twilight Princess). Then you can take a game with a 2 Mbit (256 KiB) save and use most of the data for a homebrew download client.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?
