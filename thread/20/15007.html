    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Lastnight I was playing some DS Doom, took a break for dinner, came back and found that my "R" button was no longer sensitive. I have to press down so firmly now to get it to respond that my finger actually hurts.
<br/>
<br/>
I take good care of my systems, I have never dropped my nds, I carry it in a hardshell metal case, etc. I double checked that this problem existed on other games, as well as retail carts.
<br/>
<br/>
A phone call to Nintendo let me know that I can expect to pay $82.50 for a roundtrip mailing and repair and wait a period of 2-3 weeks to get it back.
<br/>
<br/>
So far all I have tried is blowing some compressed air in and around the R button, with no positive results.
<br/>
<br/>
I do not own the Nintendo specific screw driver, and have tried a 3/64" and a 5/64" screw driver but they were unable to get a grib enough to turn the screw.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can provide me with suggestions on what I could try please post back. I would like to fix this myself, if possible, instead of spending money. I am willing to purchase a Nintendo screwdriver if that will help me to get this repaired. 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know all that much about the hardware, and repair on the nds at all. I don't know if this is as easy as opening up the nds case and moving something around, or if I would actually have to swap something back into the case and solder it in.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.

I know they sell the nintendo tri-wing screwdriver for a couple of dollars, and they have free (if slow) shipping</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">This seems to be pretty common and usually seems to be caused by some lint getting into the microswitch mechanism itself, which is a semi-closed component, so just trying to blow it out with compressed air without taking the system apart isn't usually enough.  If you can open up the system, though, you should be able to get good enough access to it to blow it out without having to actually take the microswitch apart, though.  It's definitely worth the dollar or two you'll have to pay for a tri-wing screwdriver, at least.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">thanks for the info. i have done more research the past few days and it appears that this is a common problem. thankfully my issue is on the "R" button. if you pull it up and back there is a tiny hole behind the green power led. I stuck a can of compressed air right up to the hole and gave it a bunch of long spurts. the button seems to be respond correctly right now. i am going to order a triwing screwdriver for the hell of it. i'm not trying to pay 82.50$ for nintendo to fix my problems. if i can't take it apart and move something around i'll just invest in a new nds for 120$.
