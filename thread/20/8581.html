    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Heh.. what I like even more.. is the fact that "they" just changed the main page.  That's it.  Wow.. you are a l33t h4x0r.. you can read a "How to be a script kiddie and change a website that runs php-nuke version 7.6 for dummies" tutorial.  Impressive I think not..
<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't call it hacked untill you have root.  Anyway, I did a scan on the files, and nothing (besides 2 or so entries in the database) were touched/changed.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Waoh, that is so impressive, be prepared for the allmighty turkish hacker because his next deal will be shutting down the whole internet. I am so scared.
<br/>
<br/>
These idiots are all alike, aren't they. The want to prove something to someone, and they want to laugh at the ones who are hacked.
<br/>
<br/>
I must think back to the guy coding the Sasser worm: simply took an already fixed security issue of Microsofts and wrote a badly coded app which did nothing but to spread and crash computers. That is dumb enough, but even dumber is he told others about his work and showed them the source code.
<br/>
<br/>
But in this case there are way less consequences coming out of this.
<br/>
Nevertheless it has been done.
<br/>
Stupid.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
