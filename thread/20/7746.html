Are you using the 'fast' setting?  It seems like it gives the video more FPS when you do that.<br/>_________________<br/>Now with 20% More Old Man from Zelda 1 than ever before!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Though I have to wonder, since it goes through the GBA slot (and most-likely boots up in GBA mode), how good can the music quality be? Certainly can't be as good as Moonshell running Mp3s, right?<br/>_________________<br/>3 is not an "e",

Since you should be able to run Moonshell on an M3 as well, you'll definately be able to get perfectly good sounding audio. The Play-Yan, from what I've heard, has pretty poor audio quality, though a firmware update may have changed that.
<br/>
<br/>
There is no USB port, you need to get a CF and/or SD card reader to access the cards. No one has mentioned the fact that you need to buy a card in the thread yet, so I'll toss that out too. They range greatly in price depending on capacity, I think I got a 512 megabyte CF card for $40CDN.<br/>_________________<br/>IRC: SdnlyDead</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

That also depends on how fast your computer is.  If you're running a PII-500MHz, it's gonna take a lot longer.  If you have a 4 GHz CPU with 2 GB of dual-channel DDR, then chances are it'll probably take less time.

<br/>
<br/>
-------------
<br/>
<br/>
Hi ,
<br/>
<br/>
Our present frame rate is 10fps, and we could improve it with 24fps.
<br/>
<br/>
But we don?t want to improve it , the reason is that many people can not accept so large capacity possibly and the conversion speed will be slower
<br/>
<br/>
I think the present movie quality is better.
<br/>
<br/>
Mepg codec is hardware code , our codec is software codec .
<br/>
<br/>
The cost of hardware codec is too expensive ,so we can't  adopt in our M3 products .
<br/>
<br/>
We will develop another product &amp; adapt the Mpeg4 hardware codec.
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------
<br/>
<br/>
MPEG is hardware? Dunno what he's on about, seeing as I was refering to the example of a software based MPEG1 decoder I got working on the M3 - <a href="http://www.sentientai.net/files/DS/" target="_blank">http://www.sentientai.net/files/DS/</a>
<br/>
<br/>
GBM movies are pretty horrible, in my opinion. And the audio is worse than anything I've heard. What we need is some one with the skills needed to finish that MPEG1 project  ~_~</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
