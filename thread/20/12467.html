    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmmm, it just struck me...
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone thought of creating a piece of DJ'ing software for the DS?
<br/>
<br/>
Would it even be a viable proposition?
<br/>
<br/>
It would be kind of cool if one could waltz into one's favourite club and hook up ze DS and let it do much of the work...
<br/>
<br/>
A quick look reveals that some OSS DJ'ing software does exist, but it's all for PC platforms...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone think this is a cute idea?

Ouch! Two Vorbis streams!
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, well, one could just use MP3s, that might make it a little easier. If Helix needs roughly 33% of the ARM9 (Figure drawn from simonjhall's Quake DS thread) to decode a single MP3, then it might be do-able to briefly handle the decoding of two at once (Which would be required to do the cross-fading, I'm imagining...)
<br/>
<br/>
The GUI could be minimal...
<br/>
<br/>
The search by BPM could be handled by pre-compiling a DB based on music files...
<br/>
<br/>
Or something...
<br/>
<br/>
I've briefly tested the two DJ mixer apps I've downloaded, Ultramixer and Mixxx (Which is OSS :-), and their essential coor function seems to be the same: Maintain two playlists and play songs from them in an alternating pattern, possibly apply a fade mechanism to segue smoothly between two songs...<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

<br/>
<br/>
* The DS's DAC is so gimped that during a crossfade, you can't really hear the difference between an 8-bit source and a 16-bit source, especially when both sources stay close to full scale as is common in the electronic genres generally used with long crossfades. There are companding methods that squeeze even more out of an 8-bit stereo buffer if you care much about dynamic range.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

<br/>
~25kbps VBR, mono, 11kHz, 2:32 song plays in 39 seconds
<br/>
160kbps CBR, stereo, 48kHz, same song in 4 minutes (2:15 on the ARM9)

64 kbps CBR, mono, 44kHz, 2:26 song plays in 1:45

...with all the file access going through the ARM9's vblank handler.

<br/>
The Helix web site gives rough stats of how how performance scales with bitrate and I don't think it's a linear scale. Also don't forget that there's no cache on the ARM7, and that I'm doing the decompression to/from main memory.

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Instead of doing file access using remote procedure call, where the ARM7 has to request a read and then wait for the ARM9 to perform it, try doing file access through a ring buffer of about 16 KiB. The ARM7 tells the ARM9 how much MP3 data it has consumed, and the ARM9 keeps the buffer full by reading ahead slightly.
<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried splitting the processing between CPUs, where one CPU does the decoding and rescaling and the other does the MDCTs?<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I feel stupid :-)
<br/>
<br/>
After spending about an hour last night in a DJ'ing box I realised the one over-riding flaw with the DJ'ing software idea...
<br/>
<br/>
Namely, the DS doesn't have two stereo outputs. Which would make cue'ing and funky tricks rather difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
In essence, the software would end up being a slightly fiddly media player :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I feel a little dur :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Still, one could build a slot-2 device with additional audio outputs and, maybe, an extra audio chip :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Or just get a real mixer :-)<br/>_________________<br/>"My boot, your face..." - Attributed to OOPMan, Emperor of Eroticon VI

So, yeah, the lack of 2 stereo outs is a bit sucky :-(

As for the auto-DJing vs manual DJing...

<br/>
Having an auto BPM matching thing doesn't make it any less difficult to pick good music :-)

As for DJ-crowd interaction, if that involves the DJ shouting lame crap like "Yeeeehaaaa" and "Everybody enjoying themselves?" then it can be done without ;-)
