I managed to get the drivers installed, after a couple of changes to "rt25usbap.inf", but never did get the install app working properly. I got the correct address from the inf of my actual drivers. The address my adapter uses is "USB\VID_0411&amp;PID_008B"
<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you guys can give it a shot. I was trying this with my USB Belkin F5D7050. I believe it has the same chipset as the official adapter.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ralink, not Ratlink.
<br/>
<br/>
What makes Ralink chipsets so special is that they don't "optimize" (that is, mangle) incoming and outgoing packets nearly as much as other common PC 802.11b chipsets do.<br/>_________________<br/>-- Where is he?

Before installing drivers for your adapter, what did it say the VID (Vendor ID) and PID (Product ID) was (in device manager you can see these details)? This driver should have worked out of the box with the ones you say above, as it matches the ones in the inf for this device - but I know that the RaLink chip is likely not the only one present in your dongle, so its plausible the <span style="font-style: italic">other</span> chip is not identical to the nifi one.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps its a matter of making sure all the sys and inf files from your origional driver arent present on the machine, and are unregistered with windows (regsvr32) before trying to install the NiFi one.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I've been experimenting over the last few days and have come up with a solution. If you have Wireless USB adapter (such as the official Nintendo one, Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-AI - which is exactly the same as the Nintendo one, or any other USB adapter that uses the RT2500 chipset) then you can get it to function as a SoftAP.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the official Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector, with the ASUS WL-167g software (which I modified with a HEX editor to recognise my Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter).
<br/>
<br/>
ASUS software from here:
<br/>
<a href="http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip" target="_blank">http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a complex process because I did many steps to get it setup correctly, but the main things I did are as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Uninstalled the official Nintendo WFC software and drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Installed the Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-AI drivers (modified INF file). I think you should be able to use the drivers of any USB adapter that has the RT2500 chipset.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Installed the ASUS software (not drivers, but the Wireless Control Center thing). I had to use a HEX editor to modify the device IDs in some of the exe files to get it to recognise my USB connector.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Setup ASUS software to become a SoftAP. Received error message saying driver file could not be copied, so I copied it manually. Set it to SoftAP again, then it worked correctly. Secured the access point by hiding SSID, setting up WEP, etc. Put access point to 802.11b mode only.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Bridged the wireless network with my internet. This caused problems (many drop-outs in Mario Kart), so I switched to Internet Connection Sharing. And since, it has been working flawlessly. DHCP doesn't work for me so I just assign IP addresses manually.
<br/>
<br/>
So now my Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector now functions as a SoftAP. I've tested it with having two DSs and two PSPs connected to it simultaneously - worked beautifully, no problems.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, I changed the VIP PID's and Windows recognized the Nintendo USB Wi-Fi. The setup automatically sets all the setting, but then fails.

Then download the ASUS software from here: <a href="http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip" target="_blank">http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip</a> and install that. When it prompts you to restart, select No. I have found that there is no need to.
<br/>
<br/>
Now from the RAR file I made, extract the six EXE files in the into the ASUS folder (default: C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities). Make sure you overwrite the existing files. Then click Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; ASUS Utility -&gt; WLAN Card -&gt; ASUS WLAN Control Center. You will get a dialog asking if you want to use the Windows configuration utility or the ASUS one, select the option that uses ASUS one and disables the Windows one. Then there will be a wizard. Click Cancel to close the wizard.
<br/>
<br/>
Now copy the file "C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities\Driver\WinXP\AP\rt2500usb.sys" to "C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers". Make sure you overwrite the existing file. Right-click on the ASUS software icon in the System Tray (bottom-right corner of screen) and select Wireless Settings. When the settings dialog opens, on the left select Config, then go to the SoftAP tab, and select Soft AP Mode. Then un-tick the Enable ICS checkbox. Then on the left click Apply. You will get a message box asking if you really want to change to SoftAP mode, click Yes. A message will come up saying something like "add the adapter to the network bridge", just ignore it and click OK. If all has gone well, there will be no error messages. Now close the ASUS Wireless Config utility or it will start conflicting when we manually set ICS.
<br/>
<br/>
Now go to Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections (this may have opened automatically opened up when you Applied the SoftAP settings).  Right-click on the Network Adapter you are currently accessing your Internet through and open the properties for that connection. Go to the Advanced tab, and click "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". Then click OK. If you get an error message saying the IP address is already in use, disable the Network adapter you are trying to share then try again - be sure to enable it again afterwards. It can take a long time for ICS to be enabled so wait patiently.
<br/>
<br/>
Now right-click on the Wireless Network Connection and click Properties. In the middle of the dialog there will be some protocols, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and then open the properties for that. Windows would have assigned a static IP address if ICS was successfully enabled, check to make sure this IP address does not conflict with other IP addresses on your network. Also, it should be on a different subnet to the Local Area Connection (for example, my computer's IP address is 192.168.0.2, I assigned the wireless network connection the IP address of 192.168.1.1 - which is on a different subnet). If it is on the same subnet, ICS will not work correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
With that done, open the ASUS Wireless Config utility again. On the left select Config, in the Basic tab set a SSID. In the encryption tab, select Shared for Network Authentication and WEP for Data Encryption - I have found that this works with the DS. Now enter a WEP key. Go back to the Basic tab, and at the bottom click on Advanced, change the 54g Mode setting to 802.11b only. Click Apply on the left to save the settings.
<br/>
<br/>
Now turn on your DS, play a Wi-Fi Connection game, go to the Nintendo WFC Settings, and select Manual Setup. Enter the SSID and WEP Key (both of these are case-sensitive) you entered to the ASUS Config utility before. Select No to Auto-obtain IP Address (you must do this because the Nintendo DS doesn't seem to DHCP correctly with ICS for some reason). Now give your DS an IP Address (this must be on the same subnet as the USB connector, I gave my DS the IP address: 192.168.1.2). For subnet mask enter 255.255.255.0. For gateway and primary DNS, enter the IP address of the USB connector. Now try and test connection, and if all has gone well the connection should be successful!
<br/>
<br/>
Now with the ASUS Wireless Config utility, you may want to hide your SSID, and use MAC Address filtering to improve the security of your wireless access point.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a different USB adapter that uses the RT2500 chipset (there is a list here: <a href="http://ralink.rapla.net/" target="_blank">http://ralink.rapla.net/</a>), install the normal drivers for your USB adapter. Then get the PID and VID numbers from Device Manager - right-click on the device and click properties, then go to the Details tab. The device ID would look something like this: USB\VID_0411&amp;PID_008B. Now follow the steps above until you get to the point after where you have copied my six modified EXE files. Open them in a HEX editor and do a search for "USB\VID_0411&amp;PID_008B" (without quotes) and replace all search occurrences you find with the VID and PID of your own USB adapter.
<br/>

I have solved the problem. The fault was in Nintendo driver v1.01. I downloaded/hacked new driver v1.02 and everything works.

Yeah I've noticed this as well. The wifi library for homebrew programs, currently does not support WEP but should in the future. I tried to connect to the access point using a PSP and realised that it doesn't work with the authentication. Unfortunately, I have not yet found a solution for this. I guess the only thing you can do is run it unencrypted. If you do that, hide the SSID and use MAC Address filtering. Although those things can be easily hacked, atleast it offers some very basic protection.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

great that you were able to find a way to use the Nintendo WiFi Adapter as an Access Point! Unfortunately....it doen't work for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I did everything I was supposed to, and its just not working. The DS can't connect to the USB Adapter.......I only get some error messages, saying that theres no Acess Point around.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried to run the AP unencrypted, that didnt work either. And....I don't know what to say, I have no idea why it isnt working, since I did everything as you did. :(

I just tried looking for the connection with the NDS Wardriving Tool, but...nothing....no wireless connection available :(

Hmmm... No idea why that is happening. If you have another computer or laptop could you try on that? Also check in Device Manager to see if the dongle appears as a Buffalo and not the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connector.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">A couple of things:
<br/>
<br/>
To use dswifi library DS homebrew you cannot hide your ssid (I believe). The SoftAP tick box for this does not seem to pick up the change immediately and, for me, required restarting the PC.
<br/>
<br/>
In my network setup (some PCs on an Ethernet that access the Internet through a firewall, one of these PCs is running SoftAP) I believe the following maybe be a safer setup.
<br/>
<br/>
Follow Waffle's guide but do not enable Internet Connection Sharing.
<br/>
Instead enable IP packet routing in Windows (see <a class="postlink" href="http://www.winguides.com/registry/display.php/1171/" target="_blank">here</a> for how to do this).
<br/>
Enable the windows firewall (or something similar) on the SoftAP wifi interface and disable all accesses on this interface. This should stop any wifi stations doing nasty things to the PC running softAP.
<br/>
You will have to create a route on your firewall telling it how to find the wifi station IP addresses. The PC running SoftAP is the gateway for this route.
<br/>
You will have to configure any wifi stations (DSs or PC) manually as there is no DHCP service on the SoftAP interface without  ICS running.
<br/>
You may have to configure firewalls or services on other PCs on the Ethernet to disallow access from IP addresses from the wifi network.
<br/>
<br/>
Why do this? If you use ICS, when IP packets from wifi stations get onto the Ethernet they look like they are coming from the PC running SoftAP. This could allow a wifi PC to come along and access your windows shares and printers and the like. This is especially true as I am not running any encryption on the wireless side so I can play around with wireless DS homebrew.
<br/>
With IP packet routing, the IP packets from wifi stations will have their original IP addresses when they get onto the Ethernet and therefore you can configure firewalls and services on other PCs on the Ethernet to ignore them, providing protection.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I followed your guide, and it works for me...kind of. The PSP never has a problem connecting(I've never tried a game, but it connects to the browser). However, connection with th DS is very inconsistent. Sometimes it connects and I'm able to get through an actual match of Mario Kart, while other times it connects and I get thrown out halfway through a match, and others where I can't connect at all. 
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the error codes I get that correspond with nintendo.com vary from problems with "the WEP key changing(it hasn't)," to problems with my compute'rs firewall. If you have any suggestions as to what the problem may be, please let me know. I'd really appreciate it.
<br/>
<br/>
I know this is long, but one thing I probably should add is that during initial setup, I too got the 'cannot copy driver to system directory' error, so I just tried copying the rt2500usb.sys file that was in the STA folder into the system32 driver directory instead of the one in the AP folder, and it worked. Could this be a reason for it's varying success?
<br/>
<br/>

It turned out my system paths were messed up when I installed the DirectX SDK a while ago, and some important paths were missing (netsh wouldn't run, as example). Maybe that can help someone? Windows never really warned me about important paths like %SystemRoot%\system32, %SystemRoot% and %SystemRoot%\System32\wbem being missing, so it's wise to check if they're there once in a while.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Now when you get the "Cannot copy driver to the system directory", click OK to the error messages and close the ASUS software down completely. 
<br/>
Now copy the file "C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities\Driver\WinXP\AP\rt2500usb.sys" to "C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers". Make sure you overwrite the existing file. Then try and create the SoftAP again. If it doesn't work, try again but this time, after copying the file manually, restart the computer and then try creating the SoftAP.

For those people wondering if they can use DHCP, I have found that official Nintendo Wifi Games does not work with Windows' Internet Connection Sharing DHCP at all. I just tried using SgStair's wifi_lib_test to see if DHCP worked with that, and it does not. So for the DS, you must use a Static IP.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
For "Wireless Network Connection 2" (which appears to be the connection for the USB dongle): remove the default gateway and the DNS servers. This is done by right-clicking on the connection in Network Connections and selecting properties. In the dialog box that opens, select Internet Protocol from the list, and click the properties button. Then remove the Default Gateway and DNS server entries. By remove I mean delete any IP addresses there and leave it blank. The only fields that should be set are IP address and subnet mask. From what I can see they are already set correctly so just leave them alone.
<br/>
<br/>
Now on the DS, using an official game, set these settings:
<br/>
IP address: 192.168.0.2
<br/>
Gateway: 192.168.0.1
<br/>
DNS: 192.168.0.1

<br/>

I did what you said, and I got through the rest of the installation with no problems. until the connection test. when i try to connect with a commercial game, it says it connected to the AP, but couldn't connect to the server. and when i try to run homebrew that connects to a server on the PC (such as DS2Key), it won't work correctly, even though it connects to the AP.

<br/>
<br/>
Wireless connection 3 is the connection i connect to the internet through. WC 8 is the USB connector. 192.168.2.1 is the address of the router my comp is connected to (which the DS can't reach). i assigned the usb connector to 192.168.3.1, and the DS to 3.2.
<br/>
<br/>
edit: NOW, even though i don't think I changed anything on either the DS or the PC, when I try a connection test, I get "unable to conenct to an access point."
<br/>
<br/>
edit2: i tried going into the TCP/IP properties for the USB connector, and i changed the gateway to 192.168.2.1 (the router my comp connects through). then, my comp was unable to connect to the internet, and the DS gave the "unable to connect to server" one again.<br/>_________________<br/>Hardware: DS Lite &amp; Phat (both FlashMe v7), M3 Perfect SD, PassKey 1, Max Media Launcher, SanDisk 1GB SD card</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
If you get "unable to connect to the server" there must be a problem with IP addresses, gateways or DNS server settings.
<br/>
On the computer, have you set internet connection sharing for Wireless Connection 3? Once this is done, check the IP address of Wireless Connection 8, set it to 192.168.3.1 (sometimes Windows changes it to 192.168.0.1 upon enabling ICS, so change it). Don't set the gateway or DNS servers for Wireless Connection 8.
<br/>
On the DS, use these settings:
<br/>
IP address: 192.168.3.2
<br/>
Gateway: 192.168.3.1

maybe it's the encryption settings. I didn't want to use WEP, so I set it to 'Network Authentication: Open' and 'Data Encryption: Disabled' in the ASUS utility. could that have anything to do with it?

i just tried disabling and then re-enabling ICS, and two more connections popped up in Network Connections: Local Area Connection 14 and Wireless Connection 6 (in addition to Wireless Connection 8).

Yes it does work with the wifi lib. If it works for you with official games and not homebrew try broadcasting the SSID and turning off WEP.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Metalli-cat,
<br/>
Do you have a software firewall on your computer? Many software firewalls require you to enable Gateway mode otherwise they block the ICS traffic. If that does not work, post your "ipconfig /all" here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
"Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection" in one connection, in "local connection" or "wireless connection" ...some guys tell me they can turn it on on both. :|

    <h4>#96426 - Waffle - Thu Aug 03, 2006 9:26 am</h4>
    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Don't worry about DHCP. Just use static IP.
<br/>
<br/>
You only need to tick the "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection" in the connection for your Internet. You should not tick it for the wireless connection. I don't know if it is possible to bridge a USB ADSL connection so I think you will need to use ICS. I recommend you post an ipconfig.
<br/>
To do this, open a command prompt:
<br/>
Find the <span style="font-style: italic">Command Prompt</span> shortcut in <span style="font-style: italic">Start Menu -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Command Prompt</span> OR click <span style="font-style: italic">Start -&gt; Run</span>, type <span style="font-style: italic">cmd</span> and press Enter.
<br/>
Type <span style="font-style: italic">ipconfig /all</span>.
<br/>
Copy the results (right-click in <span style="font-style: italic">Command Prompt</span>, select <span style="font-style: italic">Mark</span>, use the mouse and highlight everything, press Enter key.)

Now paste it here.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

If you have Wireless USB adapter (such as the official Nintendo one, Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-AI - which is exactly the same as the Nintendo one, or any other USB adapter that uses the RT2500 chipset) then you can get it to function as a SoftAP.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm using the official Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector, with the ASUS WL-167g software (which I modified with a HEX editor to recognise my Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter).
<br/>
<br/>
ASUS software from here:
<br/>
<a href="http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip" target="_blank">http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip</a>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a complex process because I did many steps to get it setup correctly, but the main things I did are as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Uninstalled the official Nintendo WFC software and drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
2. Installed the Buffalo WLI-U2-KG54-AI drivers (modified INF file). I think you should be able to use the drivers of any USB adapter that has the RT2500 chipset.
<br/>
<br/>
3. Installed the ASUS software (not drivers, but the Wireless Control Center thing). I had to use a HEX editor to modify the device IDs in some of the exe files to get it to recognise my USB connector.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Setup ASUS software to become a SoftAP. Received error message saying driver file could not be copied, so I copied it manually. Set it to SoftAP again, then it worked correctly. Secured the access point by hiding SSID, setting up WEP, etc. Put access point to 802.11b mode only.
<br/>
<br/>
5. Bridged the wireless network with my internet. This caused problems (many drop-outs in Mario Kart), so I switched to Internet Connection Sharing. And since, it has been working flawlessly. DHCP doesn't work for me so I just assign IP addresses manually.
<br/>
<br/>
So now my Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector now functions as a SoftAP. I've tested it with having two DSs and two PSPs connected to it simultaneously - worked beautifully, no problems.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I followed this guide. The PC's in my network have ip's: 10.0.0.x
<br/>
I gave the wireless connection the ip 10.0.1.1(a different subnet).
<br/>
When I search for wireless connections with my laptop I find a network with the SSID I entered. When I connect it I need to give the WEP key. So far so good. But then it keeps saying waiting for network and it won't connect. I've tried without WEP, 54g, 802.11b etc. 
<br/>
In the ASUS control Centre I go to Config-&gt;SoftAP. Then I can drag my LAN connection around. I have put it in the left box. Is this okay?
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">wadoludo,
<br/>
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with your IP address settings. Are you sharing the "WAN (PPP/SLIP) Interface" connection? If you have a software firewall enabled, is it blocking gateway traffic?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
pikafar,
<br/>
I assume your USB dongle is "Wireless Network Connection 4".
<br/>
Change the IP address settings of it to be: 192.168.1.1
<br/>
Then on the DS use these settings:
<br/>
IP address: 192.168.1.2
<br/>
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
<br/>

<br/>
btw its error code 52100. when i do the connection test on the ds, it shows me connectivity,but shortly after it stops and gives me the error. 
<br/>
<br/>
and in the asus log it says something like this :
<br/>
...14:00:04 STA 00.......-EC associated
<br/>
...14:00:24 STA 00.......-EC has left the BISS 
<br/>
(its alway EXACTLY 20 seconds!?)
<br/>
<br/>
and yeah i have norton internet security.
<br/>
it is a bit strange since norton hasn't asked yet if i want to permit/block the asus software from connecting to the net.but i get the same results with norton turned off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 thx waffle for trying to help me</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Notice the DNS? I set it to the same as my internet connection's (it seems to make the DS find the 'net faster, but it might be just me). Also notice the gateway is plain empty.
<br/>
<br/>
My DS is setup to automatically get an IP and DNS, and it works like a charm. 
<br/>
To make DHCP work, all you need is to click on the "Options" buttom in the ICS settings tab (in the connection properties window), and make sure both DHCP ports are marked.

The firewall won't come up asking if you want the ASUS software to connect. I've never used Norton Internet Security, but in firewalls like ZoneAlarm and Kerio, there's a special option (called Gateway mode or ICS host), that needs to be enabled. But seeing as you turned Norton off, I don't know what could be wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CrimsonReaper,
<br/>
Have you tried commericial games, do they work? The DNS settings on the DS can either be what you normally use for the internet, or the IP address of the ICS host.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I don't know why that's happening. Try changing the font used. Otherwise if you want, PM me with the VID and PID of your adapter, your email address and the version of the ASUS software you are using, and I will modify the EXE files for you.
<br/>
<br/>
gdogg,
<br/>
If you convert it to a SoftAP, then you can use DSLinux with it (to use retawq, the SSH client, etc).
<br/>
If you want to use it for WifiME, it has to be done under the Linux operating system. There is a different topic about that somewhere...</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Ok, I seem to have a problem. I installed the old (Original) Driver for the Wi-Fi USB Connector via CD from Nintendo and for some reason I can't uninstall those anymore. I went to Hardware and uninstalled the driver and the USB Connector but for some Reason he still Recognizes the USB Connector. So my Question is, how do I Completely Uninstall those Driver. Oh, and the Original Driver is called something with 2500 and the Hardware wizzard only looks for those, so I can't install the Updated driver from the Download. And how do I install those new driver then ?

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">There's lots of great help here, guys.  Thanks, thanks.  I've been nothing but successful in getting the DS to pick up on the WiFi, and my issue was sending it on out to the Internet.  It might help to note that I had to allow the IPs (192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.2 in this case) in my firewall's configuraton.  I couldn't find an option to permit ICS junk specifically, so I got a bit more specific...
<br/>
<br/>
That said, I've got some wee issues that keep my connection from being perfect. First off, enabling ICS seems to make my router get all pissed off at me.  There are three computers in the household, and we all connect to a wired router to then get out to the Internet.  If the ICS is on long enough, eventually my computer seems to spaz and no longer pick up on the router and the IP address that it provides me with. So while the WiFi still works fine, there's no Internet for it to go to!  The router exists at 192.168.1.1 and I can't even connect out to that when this problem kicks in.  My main network adapter seems to be assuming some insane random IP, and bam. No Internets.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have some specific advice for router-esque situations like this? Like I said, it's wired. Not wireless. You stick ethernet cords in the back.  Also, I'm using Windows 2000! Yay me for defying system requirements. Like I said, the dongle works just fine.  It's configuring my system to properly manage the traffic that's giving me heart palpitations.

I can't see what's wrong with your settings... Have you enabled ICS options in your firewall?
<br/>
<br/>
DarthSky,
<br/>
Are you using these settings on your DS:
<br/>
IP: 192.168.0.2
<br/>

<br/>
Gateway: 192.168.0.1

<br/>
Have you enabled ICS options in your firewall?

Sounds a lot like some kind of IP address conflict. What you could try doing, because you are behind a router, is bridge the wireless connection with your wired connection. If you decide to bridge it, try and see if DHCP works.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Belatedly reporting in, for the possible education of other folks.  I reconfigured the IPs I was using so they were 192.168.2.** instead of 192.168.1.**.  In addition, I had to adjust my firewall to specifically allow traffic from that particular set of IPs.  Once that was done, my WiFi worked BEAUTIFULLY.

If you get "Unable to connect to an access point" then it is not a problem with your ICS settings, but with the SoftAP settings. Check SSID, WEP, 802.11b mode settings.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Have you tried commericial games, do they work? The DNS settings on the DS can either be what you normally use for the internet, or the IP address of the ICS host.</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">

It worked for my normal official DS games. It doesn't for the homebrews. I was puzzled. Why does it work for official games but not homebrews. Until now, ever since I first asked, I still haven't got my homebrew to connect to it.

I have Microsoft software firewall on my computer, and i diddnt realise it was on(I swore i turned it off) During that time i was playing around with it adjusting IP's and what not then gave up and turned my comp off.
<br/>
<br/>
I have since turned it back on and realised my MS firewall was on, i then turned it off. Since then in the system tray my new BUFFALO WLI-U2-KG54-YB Wireless LAN has a little picture of a computer and 2 lines like its sending a signal, if i hover my mouse over it it has 
<br/>
<br/>
Speed:54Mbps
<br/>
Signal strength:Very Good
<br/>
Status: connected
<br/>
<br/>
it diddnt have this before, but still it does not work. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, downsatairs on my dads computer where the router is pluged into i cant explain(boss computer? lol) it has a firewall and i think this could be stopping it(maybe its a hardware firewall as the computer is off(does that matter?)) It so happens that when i was setting up the Nintendo USB wi-fi connector that when it wasnt working we turned on my dads computer and he was getting firewall turn on options. Im pretty sure this is the problem but i cant check because he is administrato of the computer and i cant check atm. What do you thing the likelyhood is that this is my problem?
<br/>
<br/>
Also when i was talking about the router only allowing specific IP's does this mean that the the BUFFALO WLI-U2-KG54-YB Wireless LAN addapters Ip has to be allowed by my router? and same for the DS (or my Wii for that matter)</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by PH on Wed Jan 03, 2007 12:09 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>

also is the potential of 54Mbps fast enough speed for online gaming eg. for a 360? i have a 256k internet connection say i was to get a 360 and a Wi-fi connector for it would it lag anyless than my computer would playing an online game?

First of all, because we set the Wifi dongle's options to "802.11b Only", it's maximum speed is 11Mbps; Windows likes to lie. If you set it to 802.11g mode, then the maximum speed would be 54Mbps. That being said, you have 256k internet connection, which is equivalent to 0.25Mbps. The wireless network, even at 802.11b speeds, is much faster than your internet. So playing an online game on the computer should be no different than playing it on the 360. Wireless does have a tiny bit of extra latency (between 2-3 ms) but that won't cause any noticable lag.

Yer, my signal did go down to 1 or 2 bars when i moved downstairs and there was no signal at all up the front of my house, today(spftAP) i get full signal everywhere inside the house....wierd?

Also for the Wii i would argue that OPERA runs even faster with the SoftAP as opposed to the Wi-fi dongle.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

Your IP address settings seem completely fine.
<br/>
Are you absolutely sure that your mobile phone is actually connecting through the Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter? It's very odd that nothing other than your mobile works.
<br/>
<br/>
When accessing the internet through your mobile, open Network Connections, right-click the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB dongle, and click Status. Do the packet counters (for both Sent and Received) increase?

<br/>
<br/>
I've been very happy with the asus AP hack, but now I wanted to bring back my old Nintendo USB connector software/drivers. Therefore I uninstalled this asus and the buffalo drivers, then I installed the newest driver from nintendo, but it gave me an error during install... and the AP software that comes with the drivers freezes upon startup, it doesn't even install this softAP, I only try running them from the directory "/SoftAP" inside the nintendo drivers folder... now I've been experimenting alot but without any luck.. :(
<br/>
<br/>
Is there a specific way to do this, and will someone PLEASE try and help me!!!
<br/>
<br/>
I need my Wii and two DS's to go online again! :)

I've gotten two different ones:

and one where it simply wouldn't recognise the dongle, so it stalled on the message telling you to plug it in...
<br/>
<br/>
got any ideas?
<br/>
<br/>
The first type of error occurs everytime i run the install, by the end of it, at thereby it ends the install with an error. I guess this means that the error causes the install to cancel the installation of the SoftAP program. (hope you can understand this, bit hard for me to explain... :D)

Open Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections. Does the dongle appear as Buffalo or Nintendo? Is Internet Connection Sharing already enabled? If so disable it.
<br/>
Now physically unplug the network cable going to your LAN card (assuming you are using a wired network for your internet).
<br/>
And try running the Nintendo install again.

Could be driver issue (as in, the Buffalo drivers load when you plug it in, so the Nintendo software won't detect it).</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

It worked for my normal official DS games. It doesn't for the homebrews. I was puzzled. Why does it work for official games but not homebrews. Until now, ever since I first asked, I still haven't got my homebrew to connect to it.

I've found that to get homebrew to work, switch Network Authentication to Open (This will make it stop working for commercial games until you change it back)

I seem to be having the same problem.  I've had this computer for 3 years and it's never given me the blue screen of death, until I boot up with this the USB connector plugged in.  It usually works after I boot up with it unplugged.
<br/>
<br/>
However, now the connection only lasts about 5 minutes before disappearing.  It's getting so messy, I might just see if I can set up an old-fashioned wireless router on my campus's Resnet.  Luckily, Target accepts refunds up to 90 days.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmm, the ASUS download link on page 2 is broken.
<br/>
<br/>
Question:  Could you share a wireless connection using this?  Now, this may seem counterintuitive, but the wireless connection I use is the university wireless and requires a login; I don't have Opera for DS so there'd be no way for me to log in.  In the past, I've bypassed that via spoofing my DS's MAC address on my laptop, but that locks me into only having internet for one device at a time.
<br/>
<br/>
However, with SoftAP, I could login on my laptop and share it through my Nintendo dongle.  The catch is that I use Windows Wireless Zero Config for my existing wireless connection, and would need to use the ASUS tool for my dongle.  Would this setup work?
<br/>
<br/>
I'd try it myself, but as I mentioned above, the ASUS software link on page 2 is broken.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">--Drack</span>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">hi guys. i wanted to switch the Nwifi's drivers to a real softAP so that my little brother can connect via his laptop, since my wired-only router is in my room. :P   
<br/>
<br/>
unfortunately i have a few problems. everything seems to be going alright in the applications, but the activity light on the Nwifi adapter would usually blink for between 20 seconds and 5 minutes, then turn off and stay off. to get it back on i need to either unplug it, or fiddle with (any) settings in the asus apps. there are no error messages or anything, it just kinda shuts down (and i checked, power management for the adapter is disabled in both the device manager and the asus config). the other thing it, when the adapter's light <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> blinking, the laptop sees the AP no problem. but almost every time when i try to connect to it, windows says the AP cannot be found or is out of range, and it disappears from the available networks list. when it doesn't, it can't connect (says no data received from AP). but  it's not an addressing problem, because it did connect (a whole TWO times!), and the laptop had perfectly functional access to the internet. until the light on the adapter stopped blinking again.
<br/>
<br/>
so far i've:
<br/>
-downloaded the buffalo drivers and inserted the PID/VID into the .inf
<br/>
-downloaded the newest version of the asus software linked in this thread (2.916 or whatever), and overwritten one of the supported devices with the Nwifi's PID/VID in the relevant executables.
<br/>
-installed buffalo drivers, installed asus stuff, overwrote old exe's and rebooted
<br/>
-set up the adapter in softAP mode, broadcasting SSID and no security, wireless b only, etc.
<br/>
-verified the new ip addresses are the same as the old ones (when i was using the nintendo app) and updated my firewall accordingly, turned on ICS
<br/>
-setup laptop's wireless card to use the proper (static) address info.
<br/>
<br/>
i've played with everything that seems relevant, but i can't seem to get the adapter to stay active reliably, and when it does stay "on" for a while, it's very rare that it will connect. i will try the older version of asus' apps and see if that helps anything. but if anyone can offer any tips or has experienced this problem for themselves i'm all ears.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Hmmm, interesting that your problems happened around the same time as mines. Coincidence?
<br/>
<br/>
I have used this method for months now without any problems, but all of a sudden things stopped working. For instance, I had the same problem where the dongle would blink for a few minutes and then stop all of a sudden.
<br/>
<br/>
One other curious problem was that I was able to connect to the nintendo wifi service successfully, but when I tried to find random players (in all my wifi games) to compete, not one person showed up. Even in Mario Kart.
<br/>
<br/>
After being so frustrated, I switched back the real drivers and everything worked again. Hope you have better luck than I do.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

device drivers and software:
<br/>
-----------------------------------<ul><li><a class="postlink" href="http://www.buffalotech.com/support/downloads/wireless-g-keychain-usb-20-adapter-with-auto-installation/" target="_blank">Buffalo Wireless G USB2.0 - v1.01.02.002</a> - same driver everyone else has been using, seems to be the most reliable. Buffalo's setup utility doesn't support SoftAP though.</li><li><a class="postlink" href="http://tw.giga-byte.com/Support/Communication/Driver_Model.aspx?ProductID=955" target="_blank">Gigabyte GN-WPKG (PCI card) v1.4, 1.5</a> - this one uses an updated .INF format with no [Adapters] section, so i pasted the <span style="font-style: italic">%rt2500usb_ai.DeviceDesc%</span> line in [Ralink] below the existing device. seems to install fine. i didn't try the driver with the Asus CC though, just the Gigabyte software. its files (search all of them for "VID" to see which ones need editing, as i didn't write it down) also use a new format for the VID/PID strings. when choosing a device string to overwrite, you need to choose one that is a USB device (as opposed to PCI), <span style="font-weight: bold">and</span> uses a 4 character PID code. some only have three, so you would be changing the file length by inserting the Nwifi's code there, and that will break the application. the software's system tray icon changes, and seems to identify the adapter upon insertion, but after a second it goes back to the regular "adapter unavailable" icon. so maybe there's something that can be done with it with a little more tinkering. there's a v1.51, but i didn't try it as it seems to only add win64 support.</li><li><a class="postlink" href="http://www.marvell.com/drivers/driverDisplay.do?dId=175&amp;pId=3" target="_blank">Marvell Yukon v9.12.3.3</a> - this was suggested in the <a class="postlink" href="http://www.nat32.com/nat32e/htm/asus.htm" target="_blank">tutorial</a> i linked last time, but i think it's only for the older chipset (RT-2400). it uses the same format as gigabyte's software. the driver seems to install ok, no dice on getting the app working at all though.</li><li><a class="postlink" href="http://support.asus.com/download/download_item.aspx?model=WL-107&amp;product=11&amp;type=Utilities&amp;SLanguage=en-us#" target="_blank">Asus WLAN Control Center v1.9.8.1 for WL-107</a> - of the software that works with the adapter, this version is by far the most responsive. downside - no soft-AP support as it's for the RT-2400 chipset.</li><li><a class="postlink" href="http://support.asus.com/download/download_item.aspx?model=WL-107g&amp;product=11&amp;type=Utilities&amp;SLanguage=en-us#" target="_blank">Asus WLAN Control Center v2.2.2.1 for WL-107G</a> - this is the newest version available from the asus support website, which is strange since both versions used successfully in this thread are numbered higher. seemed to work ok, but none of my devices could connect to it (no response from AP).</li><li>Asus WLAN Control Center v2.3.7.1 (link dead) - didn't get to try out this version since i couldn't find the installer, the mirrors listed in this thread only contain the modified executables.</li><li><a class="postlink" href="http://users.on.net/~kabeyas/Utility_2916.zip" target="_blank">Asus WLAN Control Center v2.9.1.6</a> - seems to work for most people, but not for me. when inserted, the adapter would be active for a few minutes, then the activity light turns off. also has the same problem as v2.2.2.1, no data from AP most of the time. it worked properly about 4 times over the course of this project, and i had a DS, two Wii, and a laptop all connected and working fine. the connection always dropped after about 6 minutes, and the adapter's light went off.</li></ul>
<br/>
so... it's a good trick if you can use it, but there's definately something to be said for reliability. i hope everyone else has better luck than i did.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

<br/>
<br/>
I've the WUSB54GPv4 perhaps this little guide can help you a bit:
<br/>
<br/>
1. I've installed the normal drivers for this piece of equipment.
<br/>
2. I've installed the ASUS WLAN package mentioned here.
<br/>
3. I've changed the PID and VID numbers in 6 exe files:
<br/>
Center.exe
<br/>
Mobile.exe
<br/>
StMonitor.exe
<br/>
TShoot.exe
<br/>
Wireless.exe
<br/>
Wizard.exe
<br/>
the changing was done with a HEX editor. The right PID and VID numbers can be found in the inf file from the original driver.
<br/>
4. Use these new exe files with the changed PID and VID numbers.
<br/>
5. Overwrite the normal driver with the one found in the folder: ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities\Driver\WinXP\AP\rt2500usb.sys
<br/>
6. That should be it.
<br/>
<br/>
O and I am not sure, if I was allowed to post this guide here.

<br/>
Before you continue, make sure you have removed the Nintendo software and drivers as they will no longer be needed.
<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Drivers folder of my RAR file, you will find modified Buffalo drivers. Install these drivers for the USB Connector. Then download the ASUS software from here: <a href="http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip" target="_blank">http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/wireless/WL-167g/eng_2371.zip</a> and install that. When it prompts you to restart, select No. I have found that there is no need to.
<br/>
<br/>
Now from the RAR file I made, extract the six EXE files in the into the ASUS folder (default: C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities). Make sure you overwrite the existing files. Then click Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; ASUS Utility -&gt; WLAN Card -&gt; ASUS WLAN Control Center. You will get a dialog asking if you want to use the Windows configuration utility or the ASUS one, select the option that uses ASUS one and disables the Windows one. Then there will be a wizard. Click Cancel to close the wizard.
<br/>
<br/>
Now copy the file "C:\Program Files\ASUS\WLAN Card Utilities\Driver\WinXP\AP\rt2500usb.sys" to "C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers". Make sure you overwrite the existing file. Right-click on the ASUS software icon in the System Tray (bottom-right corner of screen) and select Wireless Settings. When the settings dialog opens, on the left select Config, then go to the SoftAP tab, and select Soft AP Mode. Then un-tick the Enable ICS checkbox. Then on the left click Apply. You will get a message box asking if you really want to change to SoftAP mode, click Yes. A message will come up saying something like "add the adapter to the network bridge", just ignore it and click OK. If all has gone well, there will be no error messages. Now close the ASUS Wireless Config utility or it will start conflicting when we manually set ICS.
<br/>
<br/>
Now go to Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections (this may have opened automatically opened up when you Applied the SoftAP settings).  Right-click on the Network Adapter you are currently accessing your Internet through and open the properties for that connection. Go to the Advanced tab, and click "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". Then click OK. If you get an error message saying the IP address is already in use, disable the Network adapter you are trying to share then try again - be sure to enable it again afterwards. It can take a long time for ICS to be enabled so wait patiently.
<br/>
<br/>
Now right-click on the Wireless Network Connection and click Properties. In the middle of the dialog there will be some protocols, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and then open the properties for that. Windows would have assigned a static IP address if ICS was successfully enabled, check to make sure this IP address does not conflict with other IP addresses on your network. Also, it should be on a different subnet to the Local Area Connection (for example, my computer's IP address is 192.168.0.2, I assigned the wireless network connection the IP address of 192.168.1.1 - which is on a different subnet). If it is on the same subnet, ICS will not work correctly.
<br/>
<br/>
With that done, open the ASUS Wireless Config utility again. On the left select Config, in the Basic tab set a SSID. In the encryption tab, select Shared for Network Authentication and WEP for Data Encryption - I have found that this works with the DS. Now enter a WEP key. Go back to the Basic tab, and at the bottom click on Advanced, change the 54g Mode setting to 802.11b only. Click Apply on the left to save the settings.
<br/>
<br/>
Now turn on your DS, play a Wi-Fi Connection game, go to the Nintendo WFC Settings, and select Manual Setup. Enter the SSID and WEP Key (both of these are case-sensitive) you entered to the ASUS Config utility before. Select No to Auto-obtain IP Address (you must do this because the Nintendo DS doesn't seem to DHCP correctly with ICS for some reason). Now give your DS an IP Address (this must be on the same subnet as the USB connector, I gave my DS the IP address: 192.168.1.2). For subnet mask enter 255.255.255.0. For gateway and primary DNS, enter the IP address of the USB connector. Now try and test connection, and if all has gone well the connection should be successful!
<br/>
<br/>
Now with the ASUS Wireless Config utility, you may want to hide your SSID, and use MAC Address filtering to improve the security of your wireless access point.

Ignore that. Enable ICS, and drag your Inet to the near box. Redo the manual ICS setup. Proceed with the setup. Once you do DS ip, make SURE that the ip is the same as the WiFi dongle, except for the last digits. This caused major problems for me since my ip was otherwise. As said in the first few posts in this topic, with WEP, Network Auth needs to be set to Open, otherwise it won't work.

You can't with that setup. You need to find a card for hb booting. (card means any Slot 1/2 device for booting hb)

Maybe if I do another system restore...(I did this to start over with this earlier today)

I'm trying to install WiFi homebrew drivers again. But, I'm having problems.
<br/>
When I try to install the drivers, Windows REFUSES to install them.
<br/>
It seems it not even detecting those drivers, even though I'm telling it
<br/>
to search in the directory with the drivers inside it.
<br/>
Instead, it only installs the official drivers, which obviously don't work.
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing got killed this time, at least not yet. I set a system restore point,
<br/>
so nothing is toasted if that happens again.

Why aren't Nintendo's drivers signed anyway?(The WinXP compatibility thing)

(My XP is near dead, it needs a redo.)

It was detecting the .inf files for the official drivers in the default path. That shouldn't happen if you don't install the official drivers first. But, that's what I did.
<br/>
<br/>
To fix that, delete rt25usbap.inf in C:/Windows/system32/inf, and delete all similar files. Now it should find the hacked drivers.
<br/>
<br/>
Follow the instructions. Don't install ASUS before the drivers. If you do,

the dongle will quit and stop transmitting. Reinstall ASUS to get it to work.

(And everything else needed to install ASUS)

I assume ftp is the only problematic homebrew. Does other homebrew
<br/>
work? I didn't have much time to try ftp before these big problems. Maybe it's your firewall. Try opening the port for ftp(# 20 &amp; 21)(I probably won't be able to help you much.)

I already have a problem, cause how do you install the drivers? The drivers that are in the folder are .sys files, if you have to install a driver aren't they usually .exe? So I just ignored that part, but if someone could tell me how to fix that anyways, please tell me!

A message will come up saying something like "add the adapter to the network bridge", just ignore it and click OK. If all has gone well, there will be no error messages.

The "Enable ICS" checkbox is greyed out, so I dragged the internet connection I use to the box above the checkbox (I think thats what I'm supposed to do).

I followed these instructions carefully. The only problem area is in bold. The "Disable ICS" box is greyed-out at this point. At the point I have put in italics, the box is no longer greyed. However when I click it it says:

</td> </tr></table><span class="postbody"></span></td> </tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br/>
Ignore that. Enable ICS, and drag your Inet to the near box. Redo the manual ICS setup. Proceed with the setup. Once you do DS ip, make SURE that the ip is the same as the WiFi dongle, except for the last digits. This caused major problems for me since my ip was otherwise. As said in the first few posts in this topic, with WEP, Network Auth needs to be set to Open, otherwise it won't work.

Basicly, you just need to do what you did again, except this time let the "Enable ICS" box ticked. Then quit the Control Center, and continue with the rest of the setup.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

I have the wifi connector too, and I would like to use it for the homebrews.

So I have to make what Waffle wrote?

The problem is that the link for the drivers is dead.

Another question: I always will be able to connect my Wii on it, and play DS/Wii official games with the modified connector?

Yes, you can still use the dongle with official DS/Wii games. You should set the channel to channel 11, since you seem to have a Wii. Wii Wifi has issues when the channel isn't channel 1 or 11, and some DS hb has issues with DS Lites when the channel isn't channel 11. I posted earlier in this topic,(it's not before the post I linked to)
