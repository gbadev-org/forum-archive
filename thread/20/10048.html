    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">My DS Lite all of the sudden is having problems with the right shoulder button. It stops working intermediately. you can still here the button "click" when pressed but nothing..  I have not dropped it or anything of that nature. just happened when I was playing tetris. 
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not asking how to fix this ( cause bringing it back would be my choice.)
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to know if anyone else has had this happen?<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">well, I have like the worst luck ever.. Every DS I have ever purchased, the first 2 have problems and the 3rd is the good one. 
<br/>
<br/>
I started with 2 DS's when they first were released and man did I have dead pixels. I went back to Gamestop and it was replaced. then the 2nd one had more dead pixels than the first. so I sent it back to Nintendo and FINALY I was given a PERFECT DS.( Still own )
<br/>
<br/>
then I bought the BLUE DS and bad shoulder buttons, which gamestop replaced with no issue. But I am known now as the customer with the worst luck. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now here is where I end up getting my wonderful new DS Lite. I play for a week and now BAD SHOULDER BUTTON. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that Gamestop will replace the DSL for me with no issues, cause I am about to get my MML on Monday and I don't want to send it to the Big-N and wait another freekin week.  
<br/>
<br/>
I have no issue opening it up myself, but I hate getting dust under the screen when opening the types of electronics. 
<br/>
<br/>
SORRY FOR THE BLAH BLAH BLAH
<br/>
GAMESTOP RULES  :) well the one near my house at least<br/>_________________<br/>Who, Me?</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>
