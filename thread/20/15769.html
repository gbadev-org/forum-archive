    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">Gonna be going on vacation next week, and I just thought about using my DS for reading one of my favorite mangas that was scanned into jpegs. After looking around for a few programs to allow me to view them, I couldn't find any that really worked for me.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried Moonshell, and while I couldn't get it working with the jpegs as they came, the few that I re-saved (loaded into MS-Paint and saved) seemed to work. Guessing a different kind of encoding, but anyways. While these "resaved" jpegs worked, they'd show in only 100% and 50% viewable dimensions, and the jpegs were big, about 750x1100. Not only that, but that viewer doesn't act like putting both screens together, but adds the space in between to block whatever is there.
<br/>
<br/>
I tried DSOrganized, but no matter what I did, the jpegs would not load.
<br/>
<br/>
Imgview 0.6 doesn't seem to run on my M3 Simply, even with the correct nds file.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All I want to do is have a viewer that allows jpegs, resizing them to match the 2 screens together, and also being able to go through a bunch like a slideshow.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"></span></div>

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">As far as I know, there are a few JPEG standards, like jpg2000 and the predecessor to that. You should check that. (I remember jpg2000 involved some nasty licensing back when it was released, so it wasn't very much accepted back then... thing have obviously changed since then. :^) )
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm sorry that I can't help any more.

Have nice vacations, though!<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span> July 5th 08: "<span style="font-weight: bold">Volumetric Shadow Demo</span>" 1.6.0 (final) source released

    <div class="postbody"><span class="postbody">I finally got Imgview to work, and I'm pretty impressed with what the person has done with it. Although it doesn't have native jpeg support, it's no problem, since the manga is separated into books, so I can just convert the group of images into separate books. Now I just need to resize them all a little so they are still high res, but the program's internal scaling will reduce it to just about the right size to show on both screens. Sounds like a job for Photoshop batching.

EDIT:
<br/>
<br/>
Heh, I wasn't thinking when I made this thread, but Dwedit in his post below knows. It isn't "Coding" at all, and probably should have been placed in something like "Offtopic" or of the like.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">DS</span> - It's all about <span style="font-weight: bold">D</span>isco<span style="font-weight: bold">S</span>tew</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by DiscoStew on Sat Jul 05, 2008 8:44 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></div>
